T1  - Effects of intergroup contact and relative gratification vs. deprivation on prejudice on both sides of the U.S./Mexico status divide
AN  - 2419853656
AB  - A study in the U.S.–Mexican intergroup context examined how collective relative gratification (RG) versus deprivation affects the relationship between intergroup contact and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice towards an out‐group. Participants were Mexican university students in Mexico (N = 239) and non‐Mexican students in California (N = 90). As predicted, Mexicans experienced less gratification/higher relative deprivation (RD), and low quality intergroup contact and expressed lower interpersonal closeness and higher subtle prejudice than U.S. Americans. Differences between countries were larger amongst participants reporting higher RD. Second‐stage moderated mediation analysis showed that the mediating effects of contact between country and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice, respectively, were larger amongst participants who felt relatively gratified than those who felt relatively deprived. These findings underline the importance of recognizing the moderating effect of differences in the RG versus RD levels of minority and majority groups when anticipating the potential benefits of intergroup contact for prejudice reduction.

T1  - Personality traits are directly associated with anti-black prejudice in the United States
AN  - 2419349205
AB  - Modern psychological theories postulate that individual differences in prejudice are determined by social and ideological attitudes instead of personality. For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture the authoritarian-conservatism motivation and the dominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N1 = 3,132; N2 = 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world.

T1  - ‘You sick, twisted messes’: The use of argument and reasoning in Islamophobic and anti-Semitic discussions on Facebook
AN  - 2411479124
AB  - This research used critical discursive psychology to analyse anti-Semitic and Islamophobic discourse on the English Defence League’s (EDL) Facebook page. The discussion by Facebook users began about ‘reopening’ concentration camps, in which to incarcerate Muslims. Facebook users also expressed anti-Semitic discourse such as Holocaust denial, and the idea that Jews ‘could have done more’. The analysis focuses on the reasoning used when expressing this extreme idea, and how this was contested by other Facebook users, through the use of three strategies: (1) the construction of ‘sickness’, (2) Muslims as ‘the new Nazis’, (3) devictimising Jews as victims. This research shows how the EDL used positive aligning with Jews as means to present Muslims as problematic, and how such alignment resulted in the marginalisation of both Jews and Muslims. Findings are considered in terms of how critical discursive psychology can uncover the function of extreme discourse on social media, and the potential implications of hate speech online.

T1  - Prejudice and Protestations: Rereading Yu Xuanji's Poetry
AN  - 2403114133
AB  - Aged only fifteen, Yu Xuanji 魚玄機 (ca. 844–869), a native of Chang'an 長安, began her adult life as a lesser wife of a learned man. After losing her husband's favours, she joined the Daoist priesthood and remained single for the rest of her days. Graced with both uncommon beauty and a flair for composition, Yu lived only for twenty-five years but she managed to leave behind a valuable collection of poems, forty-nine of which are preserved in Quan Tangshi (The Completed Tang Poems).[1] For centuries, many of her poems have been criticised as decadent and depraved by traditional critics such as Huang-fu Mei 皇甫枚 (ca. 880–901), Sun Guangxian 孫光憲 (ca. 900–968) and Hu Zhenheng 胡震亨 (1569–1645), who attacks her fiercely, claiming that 'Yu is the most lascivious; her poetry is decadent too' (魚最淫蕩，詩体亦靡弱).[2] Such criticism has influenced Chinese literati of later periods so profoundly that even today it remains the wont of many to label Yu as a dissolute woman. Recently, however, her reputation has been partially salvaged by some scholars. For example, the two articles written by Suzanne Cahill[3] and a book-length study by the Chinese scholar Li Suping 李素平 have challenged the orthodox view about Yu and offered new perspectives on her work. Though pioneering and inspiring, neither of these authors examines the roots of Yu's notoriety. In one article, focused on the female voices in poetry of the Tang dynasty, Cahill discusses the verses of four female priests together with no touch of literati's commentary of their works; in another, she examines Yu's work from the standpoint of material culture and Daoist religion. Suping's book fleshes out the place of women in Daoism as part of its broader coverage of Daoism as a philosophy and literary phenomenon, but it makes only passing references to the works of female Daoists. Thus, many questions about Yu abound. For example, why did classical critics consider Yu a prostitute? What is Yu's outlook on love? How did Yu define herself? Maureen Robertson argues, 'Curiosity and a desire for insight into women's lives may lead one to read a text as a transparent and unproblematic revelation of a historical woman's thoughts and feelings and to overlook the multiply-mediated nature of feminine voices in literary texts.'[5] Yet, since few pre-modern historians care to write about women, especially women like Yu, in their chronicles, for modern readers, the only access to Yu is through either statements of traditional critics or Yu's own poetry, both literary sources.I agree with Cahill, 'As we have used Tang men's poetry as a historical source, so we should use Tang women's poetry.'[6] This study attempts to re-examine Yu's love poems and the remarks others have made about her work and life. In particular, by studying her most targeted poems, I will not only explore the source of Yu's notorious reputation but also show that, though living in the ninth century, Yu had a surprisingly enlightened view of love and relationship, which illustrates her strong desire for the equality between men and women.

T1  - Religiousness and Rape Myth Acceptance: Risk and Protective Effects
AN  - 2360928109
AB  - This study addressed the lack of research simultaneously examining multiple dimensions of religiousness when predicting rape myth acceptance, and extended prior findings of a mediating role for right-wing authoritarianism (i.e., uncritical submission to authority and aggressive attitude toward those who do not conform to social norms) in the association between religiousness and prejudice. The sample consisted of 99 undergraduate and graduate students (M age = 31.87 years, 66.7% female, 80.82% White, and 93% Christian affiliated) from a religiously affiliated university in the Midwest United States. As hypothesized, dimensions of religiousness exhibited differential associations with rape myth acceptance. Religious motivation characterized by openness and exploration (i.e., quest religiousness) was a significant negative predictor of rape myth acceptance, directly, and indirectly through right-wing authoritarianism. In contrast, rigid adherence to religious beliefs, assumed to be “right” and absolutely true (i.e., religious fundamentalism), and extrinsically motivated religiousness each exhibited a positive association with rape myth acceptance through right-wing authoritarianism. In addition, internally motivated religiousness and religious fundamentalism each moderated the nonlinear effect for quest predicting rape myth acceptance. Findings suggest that uncritical religious and secular submission to external authorities or uncommitted and nonexploring religiousness may have increased the extent to which persons adhered to rape myths, whereas religious exploration was protective. Practical implications center on the need for socioculturally relevant prevention and intervention efforts with religious identifying college students.

T1  - Dehumanization, prejudice, and social policy beliefs concerning people with developmental disabilities: GPIR
AN  - 2343005148
AB  - We investigated the nature of prejudice toward people with developmental disabilities, its potential roots in dehumanization, its implications for social policy beliefs affecting this target group, and strategies for reducing prejudice toward people with developmental disabilities. Studies 1 (N = 196, MTurk) and 2 (N = 296, undergraduates) tested whether prejudice took a hostile or ambivalent (both hostile and benevolent components) form. Consistent support for a hostile prejudice model was found. This model was comprised of beliefs that people with developmental disabilities may harm others, should be kept separate from others, and are dependent on others. Also, greater dehumanization was associated with greater prejudice, and prejudice mediated the effect of dehumanization on participants’ social policy beliefs. Study 3 (N = 151, MTurk) provided construct validity for the newly developed multidimensional measure of prejudice. Study 4 (N = 156, undergraduates) showed that presenting a person with developmental disabilities in either humanizing or individuating ways reduced dehumanization and prejudice and, in turn, increased the favorability of social policy beliefs.

T1  - Chapter 3: Racialized Tensions in the Multimodal Literacies of Black Immigrant Youth
AN  - 2507952098
AB  - Background: The chapter explores the intersection of multimodal and digital literacies and racial identities of Black Caribbean immigrant youth in the United States (U.S.). Drawing on ethnographic research on the ways in which adolescent students embody their identities online, the chapter details some of the tensions that arise when these adolescents attempt to navigate a new home country that racializes their cultural and national identities and literacy practices. Context: The chapter offers a meta-analysis of case studies five Black Caribbean immigrant adolescents' multimodal and digital literacy practices in response to the racialized category "Black." Looking across four ethnographic case studies, and through the thematic meta-analysis of data, the chapter presents data snapshots of pivotal events that reflect issues of race. These events highlight the dialogic ways that these youth make use of literacy practices to understand what it means to be Black and immigrant, and to challenge these dominant, racialized representations that negate their cultural identities. Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to explore the tensions that arise when these adolescents attempt to navigate a new home country that racializes their cultural and national identities and literacy practices. In the case of Black Caribbean immigrant youth, part of this newcomer experience involves negotiating what "race" and "blackness" mean in terms of their academic, social, and personal lives. Thus, the chapter illustrates how young people use their modally and digitally mediated practices to negotiate racialized positionings across physical and virtual spaces, affinity groups, and the school and social contexts of their adopted U.S. homes. Findings: As Black Caribbean immigrants, these young persons engage in emotional identity work in their talk about and/or experiences of race. The adolescents' emotional response to racialized categories was defined by contesting feelings of pride, shame, and resilience. Two salient themes that characterized these tensions are the conflicting sense of 1) national pride versus the racial prejudice, and 2) deficit versus worthy. Their feelings of self-worth were intrinsically connected to racialized identity labels "Black" and "immigrant." However, the modal tools and spaces they used and created serve as sites of resilience and identity (re)framing. Conclusions: Adolescents developed their own personal and/or public voice that allowed them to reevaluate their self-worth, importance of social status, opportunities for advocacy, and their redefinitions of identity labels. Modal spaces and tools offered these adolescents alternative frames of reference within which they could evaluate and reposition Self. The intentional responses of these Black immigrant youth offered positive ways to see and present themselves while challenging deficit narratives of persons of color. Recommendation: Explore immigrant adolescents' use of modal and digital tools and literacies as spaces for socially reconstructing notions of race and identity. Consider modal and virtual digital spaces and tools (e.g., social networks, blogs, photographs/images, talk/stories) as a way to create opportunities for youth to air and share their experiences and ideas, as well as have their stories and positionalities become a part of the broader educational and societal narrative.

T1  - Veiled Muslim women's views on law banning the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public
AN  - 2299736270
AB  - In August 2018, Denmark became the latest European country to ban the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public. Indeed, several European countries such as France, Belgium and Austria have already implemented a ban on the wearing of the niqab in public places in these countries on the basis that the niqab is a symbol of gender oppression, Islamist fundamentalism and lack of integration. This issue has been the subject of heated media, political and public debates; however, the voices of veiled Muslim women remain unheard. Within the framework of Critical Race Feminism, the paper draws on qualitative interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the United Kingdom (UK), in order to explore their views on legislation banning the wearing of the niqab in public.

T1  - Gender stereotypes and contact with gay men and lesbians: The mediational role of sexism and homonegativity
AN  - 2314168954
AB  - This study is grounded in Allport's intergroup contact theory and Herek's sexual prejudice theory. We aimed at (a) investigating the mediational role of sexism and homonegativity on the relation between gender, age, and contact with gay and lesbian people with gender stereotypes about gay men and lesbians; and (b) replicating and corroborating the direct associations found in previous research among these variables. The present research used secondary data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics and comprehending a representative sample of 5,863 Italian adults. The results from path analysis indicated that both homonegativity and sexism partially mediated the effect of gender and age on gender stereotypes, whereas they totally mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons. Findings suggest that reducing sexist and homonegative attitudes and increasing contact with gay and lesbian people may reduce stereotypical beliefs about homosexual people.

T1  - When prejudice against you hurts others and me: The case of ageism at work
AN  - 2312955844
AB  - Ageism in the workplace has documented detrimental consequences for its victims, but its effects on those who hold ageist views are rarely investigated. A cross‐sectional study and a longitudinal study examined ageism toward both younger and older workers and its relation to intergroup contact, work behaviors, organizational identification, and the well‐being of prejudiced individuals. It was hypothesized that ageism would predict prejudiced individuals’ behaviors toward co‐workers, identification with their organization, and vitality at work, indirectly through intergroup anxiety and quality of intergroup contact. Overall, 647 employees aged 24–62 years provided data on the variables of interest. Both studies suggested that ageist views worsened the quality of intergroup contact, which in turn increased counterproductive behaviors toward co‐workers and decreased identification with the organization. Moreover, ageism marginally predicted vitality at work longitudinally through the mediation of quality of intergroup contact. No support emerged for the mediational role of intergroup anxiety. Theoretical explanations for these findings and their practical implications are discussed.

T1  - In search of an imaginary enemy: Catholic collective narcissism and the endorsement of gender conspiracy beliefs
AN  - 2297095353
AB  - Gender studies have often been criticized for undermining family and religious values. In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N= 1019; Study 2 N= 223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one's religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs. We discuss the implications for gender-based prejudice.

T1  - Using the Past to Recuperate the Present: The Authentic Evil of Madame Delphine Lalaurie in <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>
AN  - 2306710703
AB  - The premiere episode of American Horror Story: Coven (2013–14) offers a glimpse into the life of the nineteenth‐century New Orleans socialite Madame Delphine Lalaurie before she is punished for her crimes by the “Voodoo Queen,” Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett), who gifts her with immortality before burying her alive beneath her own home. Lalaurie is then catapulted into the present when she is rescued by Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), the dying leader—called the Supreme—of a witch coven who wants to know how Lalaurie has managed to stay alive. Lalaurie becomes embroiled in the coven's attempts to rejuvenate itself and with its ongoing conflict with Laveau, who is also immortal. Although her presence allows for many of the most horrific scenes in the show's third season, Lalaurie's character does not add much to the major plotline. What, then, is her primary function? In American Horror Story: Coven, the historical figure and the character of Madame Delphine Lalaurie serves a crucial role in deconstructing the nature of “evil” in women characters. While she would be considered evil in just about any sense, the “authentic” evil of Madame Lalaurie, based on the facts and folklore of her life, is compounded by the way she is portrayed as either flouting or failing gender norms, both in her own time and in the present. Although she is but one “evil” character among several, the nature of her evil—stemming as it does from a connection to “real” history, overt racial bigotry, and a failure to conform to gender norms—resonates with audiences living in an ostensible postfeminist, postracial moment. She is certainly not the only character who destabilizes naturalized gender roles. But while viewers may find themselves uneasily speculating on the complex portrayal of evil in a character, such as Fiona Goode, Lalaurie's more straightforward evil provides an easy alternative for passing moral judgment because she embodies both failed feminine socialization as well as a racial prejudice that is perceived by white audiences to have long since passed. The combination of failed motherhood (and thus failed femininity), racial bigotry, and a verifiable history of atrocities makes Lalaurie the clear antagonist in a season filled with so‐called evil women. Madame Lalaurie thus provides an “authentic” means of recuperation for mainstream (white) audiences struggling against accusations of ongoing systemic sexism and racism in contemporary society.

T1  - Worlds at Home: On Cosmopolitan Futures
AN  - 2291294369
AB  - The rise in anti-migrant xenophobia, Islamophobia, and so-called populist nationalism in recent years has demonstrated the consequential effects of colonialism, nationalism, and globalisation in our contemporary world. Through the increasing interdependence and accelerating interconnection afforded by global media – especially social media – daily reports of violent conflicts reveal how entire communities and populations continue to be disenfranchised and excluded from the security and belonging that have conventionally been tied to citizenship and territoriality (Razack 2008 Razack, S., 2008. Casting Out: The Eviction of Muslims from Western Law and Politics. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. [Google Scholar], 2015 Razack, S., 2015. Dying from Improvement: Inquests and Inquiries into Indigenous Deaths in Custody. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. [Google Scholar]; Povinelli 2011 Povinelli, E., 2011. Economies of Abandonment: Social Belonging and Endurance in Late Liberalism. Durham: Duke University Press.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). In particular, non-European migrants, Muslims, Black and Indigenous peoples remain vulnerable to dispossession and death, often at the hands of nation-states that otherwise espouse a commitment to universal values and human rights. Hannah Arendt’s (1951 Arendt, H., 1951. The Origins of Totalitarianism. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Co. [Google Scholar]) prescient claim in The Origins of Totalitarianism that histories of anti-semitism, ‘scientific’ racism, and imperialism contributed to the rise of totalitarianism seems even more relevant today.

T1  - The Mediating Role of Multiple Group Identities in the Relations between Religious Discrimination and Muslim‐American Adolescents’ Adjustment
AN  - 2241815893
AB  - Despite increasing anti‐Muslim sentiments, the implications of religious discrimination for Muslim‐American adolescents’ well‐being remain understudied. Drawing on the rejection identification and disidentification models, we examined the mediating role of multiple group identities (i.e., religious and national) in the cross‐sectional associations between individual‐level religious discrimination and internalizing and externalizing problems among 13‐ to 18‐year‐old (M = 16.7 years, SD = 1.6) Muslim‐American adolescents with immigrant backgrounds. Moreover, building on the attributional ambiguity perspective, we examined the moderating role of group‐level religious discrimination in the form of Islamophobia. Religious identity did not mediate the relations between individual‐level discrimination and internalizing and externalizing problems, and these relations did not depend on youths’ perceptions of Islamophobia. However, individual‐level discrimination was associated with American identity, depending on perceptions of Islamophobia. In turn, adolescents’ Muslim and American identities were linked to less internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications of our findings for the development of programs and policies are discussed.

T1  - The indifference that makes a difference: Why unconcern for minorities disguises prejudicial attitudes
AN  - 2202744383
AB  - Studies on historical episodes of intergroup violence and conflicts have underlined the complicit role of bystanders in extreme intergroup dynamics. In regard to contemporary multicultural societies, the concept of intergroup indifference has recently been introduced, defined as being uncaring vis-à-vis arbitrary policies affecting other social groups. In the present manuscript, the reasons why an indifferent position towards minorities may imply some prejudicial attitudes towards them will be analyzed. In particular, moral disengagement and lack of social responsibility are considered to be variables that could explain why indifference might mask prejudicial attitudes and a lack of altruism for out-groups. The results show that moral disengagement and social responsibility are indeed significant mediators of the prediction of intergroup indifference to racism and altruism. In particular, the mediation model shows that moral disengagement partially mediates the path from indifference to racism, while social responsibility partially mediates that from indifference to altruism.

T1  - Multicultural and colorblind, investigating intergroup ideologies and relevant relations in mainland China
AN  - 2245656166
AB  - During the past decades, studies of acculturation and ideology have received great attention in social psychology, especially among western countries. But few such investigations have been conducted in Asia. In this study, we measured personal and normative support of three intergroup ideologies in the context of mainland China, and explored their mediating roles between social dominance orientation and prejudice. Surveys were conducted among 158 Chinese university students in Hangzhou, China. Results of the present study showed that the dominant societal ideology among Chinese respondents was multiculturalism, rather than assimilation or colorblindness. Moreover, based on the proposition that support for different ideologies was likely to have different effects in different countries, mediation model of personal support for ideologies was examined in the current context. As revealed, when the social norms were salient, personal support for multiculturalism mediated the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudice, while personal support for assimilation or colorblindness did not. The present study provided additional evidence to the previous theory, implications and suggestions were further discussed.

T1  - On naming Arab revolutions and oppositional media narratives
AN  - 2209247779
AB  - The unfinished Arab revolutions produced unsettling conditions, sectarian wars, counter-revolutionary wars, proxy wars and transitional democracies. US and Arab media responses could not find effective words to describe them and their underlying geopolitical implications. Whether to name them ‘protest’ or ‘unrest’, American mainstream media initially welcomed the events with a cautious curiosity while Arab media favoured a romanticized coverage. But as the protests spread fast and continued, a more dominant popular narrative in the US shaped by the ‘exceptionalist’ perspective about the Middle East emerged. This article explains how dominant discursive framings deployed a form of ‘nature talk’, specifically through names, phrases and locutions such as ‘Arab Spring’, ‘Jasmine revolution’, ‘Arab transition’, and horticultural words like ‘flower’, ‘rose’ and ‘blossom’ to describe the Arab uprisings. Because of an intellectually limiting media-produced racial vernacular during the period of mass protest, this dominant mainstream narrative spoke about the events either by using neo-imperial language that characterized the revolutions as an Islamist threat or by employing culturally reductionist vocabulary which infantilized protesters. The goal here is to place specific media frames and images that such linguistic constructions create and disseminate within the context of power relations, the politics of naming and knowledge production.

T1  - Pride and prejudice: opposing constructions of mixed race in Australia
AN  - 2198982822
AB  - In the Australian context, the development of a 'situated politics of mixedness' is complicated by the fact that there are (at least) two main categories of mixed race populations - the Indigenous and the migrant/settler. For those with mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestries, and those with mixed White and other migrant ancestries, life chances and identities differ significantly. This paper outlines some of these differences using the trope of pride and prejudice. For those of mixed migrant/settler heritage, evidence is growing that the mixed experience is predominantly one of pride. For them, misrecognition, or being asked about their racial background, is an opportunity for play, often resulting in 'the big reveal' of a valorised mixed identity associated with something other than a bland 'white bread' Australian-ness. For those of mixed Indigenous heritage however, there remains a significant level of prejudice, not (only) for being Aboriginal, but for not being visibly Aboriginal enough. Using existing studies and a number of media controversies as examples, this paper interrogates the implications of these differences for understandings of the ways in which race is recruited in the construction of legitimate identity claims. It asks particularly how 'mixed race' is helpful analytically to describe the identity constructions within these two very different experiences.

T1  - Ethnic diversity, ethnic threat, and social cohesion: (re)-evaluating the role of perceived out-group threat and prejudice in the relationship between community ethnic diversity and intra-community cohesion
AN  - 2166693532
AB  - Research frequently demonstrates diverse communities exhibit lower intra-community cohesion. Recent studies suggest there is little evidence perceived ethnic threat plays a role in this relationship. This paper re-examines the roles of ethnic threat and prejudice in the diversity/cohesion relationship. First, we test threat/prejudice as conceptualised in the literature: as mediators of diversity's effect. Second, we test a reformulation of the roles of threat/prejudice: as moderators of diversity's effect. Applying multi-level models to cross-sectional and longitudinal data of White British individuals across England and Oldham (a unique English town case-study) we find neighbour-trust lower in diverse communities. However, perceived-threat/prejudice does not mediate this relationship. Instead, we find perceived-threat/prejudice moderate diversity's impact on neighbour-trust. The result is diversity only reduces neighbour-trust among individuals who already viewed out-groups as threatening. Longitudinal analysis confirms the importance of out-group attitudes in the diversity/neighbour-trust relationship. In diverse communities, residents whose out-group attitudes improve, or worsen, become more, or less, trusting of their neighbours. However, in homogeneous communities, changes in out-group attitudes are not linked to changes in neighbour-trust. We therefore argue and demonstrate that perceived-threat emerges from other societal processes (such as socio-economic precariousness) and it is when individuals who already view out-groups as threatening experience diverse neighbourhoods that local cohesion declines.

T1  - Estudos em mídia e etnicidades no Brasil: trajetória pioneira
AN  - 2297091290
AB  - O presente artigo descreve a trajetória do Etnomídia: Grupo de Estudos em Mídia e Etnicidade, instituído em 1997 na Universidade Federal da Bahia. Quando a Internet civil e comercial era uma novidade, imediata e pioneiramente o grupo colocou seu site na rede de alcance mundial: menos de dois anos do início da expansão e popularização comercial da World Wide Web. Trata-se de pioneiro grupo acadêmico sobre a temática. Embora estudos que descrevem a representação de negros nos meios de comunicação remontem ao final do séc. XIX, já em Nina Rodrigues, prosseguindo com Gilberto Freyre, Roger Bastide, João Batista Borges Pereira, Solange Couceiro de Lima, Muniz Sodré Cabral. Pesquisadores esses, entre outros, que se dedicaram ao assunto no decorrer do séc. XX, com iniciativas meritórias, fruto do compromisso do sujeito particular, não de grupo de pesquisa formalizado. Brasil foi colônia portuguesa de 1500 a 1822. Com a Independência viria a se tornar Monarquia nas mãos de D. Pedro I (Pedro IV em Portugal), sucedido por seu filho, Pedro II, deposto por um golpe militar de inspiração positivista em novembro de 1889. Durante todo esse tempo, ao menos de 1532 a 1888, o país teve na escravidão da mão de obra de africanos a base de sua estrutura econômica. Verificar como os descendentes desses africanos escravizados são retratados pela mídia e contribuir para a superação de estereótipos e preconceitos midiáticos da mídia brasileira sobre a imagem do negro foram e são objetivos principais do Etnomídia.Alternate abstract:This article describes the history of Etnomídia Grupo de Estudos em mídia e Etnicidade, a website founded in 1997 at the Federal University of Bahia. This pioneer academic group launched the website when the civil and commercial Internet was a novelty, and 22 years prior to the commercial development and popularization of the world wide web. Studies that describe the representation of blacks in the media go back to the end of the XIX century, starting with Nina Rodrigues, followed by Gilberto Freyre, Roger Bastide, Joao Batista Borges Pereira, Solange Couceiro de Lima, Muniz Sodré Cabral. These researchers, among others, have contributed to meritorious initiatives, and were committed to private projects rather than a formalized type of research. Brazil was a Portuguese colony from 1500 to 1822. With its independence from Portugal, it would become a Monarchy with D. Pedro I (Pedro IV in Portugal), succeeded by his son, Pedro II who was deposed by a military coup of positivist inspiration in November, 1889. During this time, from at least 1532 to 1888, the country's economic structure was based on a slave labor force from Africa. The objective of Etnomídia has been to expose how the descendants of enslaved Africans were portrayed by the media, as well as contribute to overcoming stereotypes and media prejudices by the Brazilian media regarding the image of the Negro.

T1  - Navigating Islam: The Hijab and the American Workplace
AN  - 2318717103
AB  - The United States Constitution allows individuals to practice any religion they choose. However, the austerity of this right is tested when an individual’s belief is publicly displayed. For Muslim women wearing the hijab, or headscarf, the intersection between private religious practice and its social expression is explored on a daily basis. To fully understand the manifestation of public religious expression, this paper examines a series of interviews with 35 hijab-wearing Muslim women living in the United States. By exploring the lived experiences of Muslim-American women, this paper highlights the broader issues of the media’s influence on perceptions of Muslim culture, the complex and often unclear legality of religious symbols in the workplace, and the barriers that exist for hijab-wearing women in the workplace. With the rise of Islamophobia, the participants found a stronger sense to exert their right to express their religious identities. Moreover, the women interviewed demonstrate their agency by continuing to embrace their religious practice despite intersecting forms of discrimination.

T1  - Towards a pragmatics of sexual media/networking devices
AN  - 2133338447
AB  - For a long time, the disciplinary organization of knowledge within the humanities and social sciences relied upon a distinction between representation and practice, generating analytic techniques that hive off textual analysis and literary criticism from the empirical study of sociocultural practices and behaviour. While exceptions to this division of expertise abound, especially in the context of recent work on affect, materiality and objects within interdisciplinary fields such as science and technology studies, media and communications, and cultural studies, the distinction continues to provide a basis for discriminating between different strands of sexuality research. For example, pornography scholarship has largely emanated from departments of film studies, literature and media, at least in the USA, while the empirical analysis of sex 'itself' has conventionally been the province of sociology, anthropology and related social and behavioural disciplines. The permeation of digital media and networking devices into all manner of everyday life pushes at the limits of these analytic silos, revealing their inadequacies, while the immense popularity and sexual social impacts of social media and geo-locative apps creates friction and problems for different analytic commitments - their preferences, prejudices and blind-spots - this, my contribution aims to think through and reformulate.

T1  - Four voices of refugee solidarity along the Balkan Route: An exploratory pilot study on motivations for mobilisation
AN  - 2148529954
AB  - Scathing critiques of the European response to what has been widely called a 'refugee crisis' are not in short supply. However, as many activist mobilisations and solidarities emerged along the Balkan Route, this is only one facet of the European response to forced migration. Having interviewed four migration activists from four countries along this route - Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary - this exploratory pilot study sought to investigate possible motivational factors for mobilisation in light of the fact that the participants had no prior experience in activism nor interest in the politics of migration prior to the European migration crisis. Through content analysis of interview transcripts, two factors emerged as having potential implications for mobilisation: media coverage and visibility of refugees. Hence, theories about the media effect and intergroup contact are used to explicate the findings. Possible future research avenues are proposed.

T1  - The multimodal construction of race: a review of critical race theory research
AN  - 2050474882
AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies - online and offline - serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change.

T1  - Iconizing "Muslim Terrorism" in a British Newspaper and Public Perception
AN  - 2056831550
AB  - By examining a news story and reader responses published in the Daily Mail Online (DMO), our study discursively argues that this daily newspaper promotes an Orientalist perception of Islam and Muslims. The religion and its adherents are both framed and perceived as a threat to British society and its "Western values", thus reinforcing Islamophobia within society. This study also argues that the DMO espouses the perceived Orientalist threat posed by Islam through juxtaposition, exaggeration and manipulation of facts, through lexical choices and visual images that eventually establishes the perception of a cultural clash. In addition, by examining the readers' responses toward the news story, this study demonstrates that the vast majority of respondents perceive Islam and Muslims as a threat to "the West". Their comments, as triggered by the text, also contribute to the discourse of Islamophobia and the perceived Orientalist view of an Islamic threat.

T1  - Measuring the Tangible Fear of Heterosexist Violence
AN  - 2002087257
AB  - Fear of crime (FoC) has dominated the political landscape over the last 20 years, with many crime policy developments during this period linked not to actual experiences of violence but to the fear of victimization. Fear of crime studies, in most cases, are conducted with populations that have only a passing, mediated knowledge of crime victimization. The research discussed in this article, in contrast, considers the impact of FoC with a highly victimized community, and establishes psychometric testing to validate an instrument to measure the impact of that fear (Fear of Heterosexism Scale [FoHS]). If FoC is related to experiences of crime as the existing research suggests, then victims of heterosexist prejudice, discrimination, and/or violence would be more likely to fear such incidents in the future. It was also predicted that participants who concealed their sexual and/or gender identity and had lower levels of social connectedness would experience higher levels of fear. The findings highlight the importance of contextual factors in FoH, and identify the critical roles that disclosure and social connectedness play in ameliorating the damaging effects of heterosexist victimization.

T1  - Neighborhood stigma and the sporting lives of young people in public housing
AN  - 2000683466
AB  - This paper spotlights the sporting lives of young people who live in ‘Redcrest’, a public housing community in the Niagara region of Canada. We report on data culled from neighborhood-centric documents (municipal data, planning council reports, media coverage) and ethnographic fieldwork (interviews, community mapping, go-alongs) collected over eight months with 14 young people. This paper also offers a critique of Robert Sampson’s work on neighborhood effects and draws on the theoretical insights and urban scholarship of Henri Lefebvre, Loic Wacquant, and the work of postcolonial scholar Frantz Fanon, who further understandings of racism as a spatial relation. At the center of this research are narratives that highlight that public housing projects, negative stigma notwithstanding, can be good places to live. The results highlight the various contradictions and tensions experienced by young people living in Redcrest, specifically their experiences with neighborhood stigma, racism and Islamophobia, and how this impacts their sporting lives.

T1  - Globalization, Ageing Process and Attitudes of Younger Generations to Ageing
TT  - GLOBALIZACIJA, PROCES STARENJA I STAVOVI MLAĐIH GENERACIJA PREMA STARENJU
AN  - 2187918351
AB  - Due to the increase of aging population in all societies, it seems important to explore this issue from different aspects in order to improve the position of the elderly and recognise their contribution to the society. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and views of the Generation Z on the discrimination and prejudices against the elderly. There were 6 participants in the focus group, 4 girls and 2 boys, all of whom belong to the Generation Z. The data was collected in the focus group who answered open-ended questions. Results of the qualitative research indicate: 1) that there is an unfavourable attitude towards the elderly in the investigated group of children; 2) causes of discrimination against the elderly; 3) prejudice against the elderly. Encouraging the society to provide better education (especially for children and young people), direct contact with the elderly (organising exchange of experience and transfer of traditional and cultural values), as well as better presentation of ageing and old age in the media would contribute to the decrease of global ageing and improve attitude of the younger generation towards ageing animosity. Family has the main influence on young people’s views and it is necessary to motivate parents to present ageing and old age in a favourable light. Furthermore, it is important to work with the elderly in terms of empowerment and developing a more positive self-image.Alternate abstract:S obzirom na porast udjela starije populacije u većini društava, čini se važnim istražiti ovu problematiku s različitih aspekata u cilju poboljšanja položaja starijih i prepoznavanja njihovog doprinosa u društvu. Cilj istraživanja bio je ispitati iskustva i mišljenja generacije Z, o predrasudama i diskriminaciji prema starijim osobama. Ispitanici su bili mlađe životne dobi, prema starosti pripadaju generaciji Z. Podaci su prikupljeni putem fokus grupe, a koristila su se pitanja otvorenog tipa. Rezultati kvalitativnog istraživanja ukazuju na: 1) nepovoljan odnos društva prema starijim osobama, 2) uzroke diskriminacije starijih osoba, 3) predrasude prema starijim osobama. Bolja edukacija (posebno djece i mladih), neposredni kontakt sa starijim osobama (omogućavanje susreta za razmjenu iskustava te prenošenja tradicijskih i kulturnih vrijednosti), te bolja medijska prezentacija starenja i starosti doprinijela bi smanjenju globalizacije starenja i boljem odnosu mlađih generacija prema starenju. Važan utjecaj na poglede mladih ima obitelj i potrebno je motivirati roditelje da pozitivno prezentiraju starenje i starost. Također, važno je raditi i sa starijim osobama u smislu njihovog osnaživanja i razvijanja pozitivnije slike o sebi.

T1  - Ecological Factors that Impact Adjustment Processes and Development of Ugandan Adolescent Immigrant Females
AN  - 1984680859
AB  - Existing literature suggests that acculturation and integration processes for immigrant youth from East Africa are complicated by family values, interaction styles, and social roles that are in conflict with those of the US host culture. The purpose of this study was to explore first-generation female Ugandan immigrant youth perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward self-development and identify factors among their social contexts that impact their development and adjustment. This study utilized dimensional analysis, an approach to the generation of grounded theory. Data collection included over 100 h of community participatory observation and 28 interviews in total. Participants included 20 English speaking Ugandan females aged 16–25 years who immigrated to the US after age of eight. Participants’ adaptations and adjustments led to an altered developmental path, including their beliefs about gender, ethnic and racial identities, and how they balanced and integrated US culture into their existing understandings and cultural awareness. Conditions that impacted the identity development process include timing of their immigration, the contexts of reception, media, the Ugandan Community, the school social setting, the perceived value of Ugandan cultural maintenance vs. the value of adopting certain American traits, and experiences of prejudice and discrimination vs. new future opportunities. The findings represent an in-depth consideration of the cultural, linguistic, religious, racial, and social attributes of the female Ugandan immigrant youth population and can therefore be seen as an important step in the direction of developing an understanding of the developmental assets and risk/protective factors that characterize this young immigrant population.

T1  - Moving images of exclusion: Persisting tropes in the filmic representation of European Roma
AN  - 1969943030
AB  - This paper analyses the most prominent tropes in the earliest and most recent filmic representations of Roma. Stereotypical images of Roma abound in many fictional features as well as documentaries, from the representation of Roma as eternal nomads to racially prejudiced depictions of Roma women and the alleged innateness of music to Roma. Because images and modes of representation change over time, the paper juxtaposes the earliest portrayals of Roma with those produced in the last 15 years. The analysis particularly centres on two dominant reoccurring tropes: types of spaces typically occupied by Roma in film, that is the lack of a place or so-called placeless-ness of Roma; the gendered other, or the Roma woman and the culturally and ethnically othered Roma musician. Ultimately, by analysing how these tropes have persisted in varying forms over 100 years, this work points to the filmic imagery that perpetuates antiziganism, but also how the same has changed over the years to offer possible counter-narratives.

AB  - Interactive narratives allow audience members control over characters and unfolding plots. The present study tested exposure effects of an interactive narrative in which audience members adopt the perspective of an immigrant illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico. Results suggested that exposure to the interactive narrative engendered positive affect toward Mexicans in the U.S., which predicted support for social services that would benefit Mexican immigrants. Participants' enjoyment also positively predicted affect and support for social services benefiting Mexican immigrants. Results suggest interactive narratives may be effective tools in helping reduce prejudice toward marginalized social groups.

T1  - Does Terror Defeat Contact? Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Toward Muslims Before and After the London Bombings
AN  - 1961000088
AB  - Allport (1954) proposed a series of preconditions that have subsequently been shown to facilitate effects of intergroup contact on attitudes toward outgroups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). The present study examines whether objective threat, in the form of the 2005 London 7/7 terror attack, can inhibit the positive effects of contact. We tested hypotheses that contact would affect prejudice toward Muslims regardless of the bombings (contact prevails) or that the bombings would inhibit the effects of contact on prejudice (threat inhibits). Data were collected through representative national surveys 1 month before and again 1 month after the attacks in London on July 7, 2005 (pre-7/7 N = 931; post-7/7 N = 1,100), which represent relatively low and relatively high salience of "objective threat." Prejudice against Muslims significantly increased following the bombings. Psychological threats to safety (safety threat) and to customs (symbolic threat) mediated the impact of the bombings on prejudice, whereas perceived economic threat did not. All 3 types of psychological threat mediated between contact and prejudice. Multigroup structural equation modeling showed that, even though the objective threat did raise levels of psychological threats, the positive effects of contact on prejudice through perceived psychological threats persisted. Results therefore support a contact prevails hypothesis. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07257-001]

T1  - Modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error
AN  - 1938113464
AB  - PurposeModern prejudice was examined as a potential predictor of overestimating proportions of minority employees in gender-typed occupations. Strength of conjunction error was considered as an indicator of distorted perceptions of these proportions. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the association between modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error was weaker for gender-untypical than for gender-typical targets.Design/methodology/approachModern prejudice was considered as a predictor of overestimations of black female employees in Study 1 (n=183) and black female older employees in Study 2 (n=409). Data were collected using internet-mediated questionnaires.FindingsIn Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error when respondents were presented with gender-typical targets. In Study 2, using a sample scoring higher on modern prejudice than in Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism and modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error, irrespective of target occupation. Furthermore, there was an unexpected association between lower sexism and greater strength of conjunction error for gender-typical targets, but not for gender-untypical targets.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings lend support to the ethnic-prominence hypothesis in that modern racism, but not modern sexism or modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that target non-prototypicality can dilute the effect of modern prejudice on strength of conjunction error.Originality/valueThis is one of the rare studies examining attitudes and conjunction error in a work-relevant context, thereby bridging the gap between social cognition and applied psychology.

T1  - The just world hypothesis as an argumentative resource in debates about unemployment benefits
AN  - 1929732644
AB  - The concept of the "just world" is established as a key explanation for how people make sense of inequality so that those deemed to score high in belief in a just world are more likely to hold prejudicial beliefs and to blame people in poverty for their situations. However, this is an inadequate explanation for such complicated and controversial issues. To better understand talk about the just world and the controversial issue of the distribution of unemployment benefits (an issue of inequality), a discursive psychological approach to the just world is used. Therefore, a discourse analysis focusses on 2 feature length British televised discussions about benefit claimants called "The Big Benefit Row: Live" (Channel 5 3/2/2014) and "Benefits Britain: the Debate" (Channel 4 17/2/2014). The analysis demonstrates that people draw on both just and unjust world arguments simultaneously and also topicalise what counts as just so as to support their positions on unemployment benefits, rather than in the consistent way that just world theory would predict. It is therefore argued that the just world should be recast as a cultural value that facilitates arguments about benefits, rather than an internally held belief.

T1  - Encountering Misrecognition: Being Mistaken for Being Muslim
AN  - 1904811374
AB  - Exploring both debates about misrecognition and explorations of encounters, this article focuses on the experiences of ethnic and religious minority young people who are mistaken for being Muslim in Scotland. We explore experiences of encountering misrecognition, including young people's understandings of, and responses to, such encounters. Recognizing how racism and religious discrimination operate to marginalize people-and how people manage and respond to this-is crucial in the struggle for social justice. Our focus is on young people from a diversity of ethnic and religious minority groups who are growing up in urban, suburban, and rural Scotland, 382 of whom participated in forty-five focus groups and 224 interviews. We found that young Sikhs, Hindus, and other south Asian young people as well as black and Caribbean young people were regularly mistaken for being Muslim. These encounters tended to take place at school, in taxis, at the airport, and in public spaces. Our analysis points to a dynamic set of interconnected issues shaping young people's experiences of misrecognition across a range of mediatized, geopoliticized, and educational spaces. Geopolitical events and their representation in the media, the homogenization of the south "Asian" community, and the lack of visibility offered to non-Muslim ethnic and religious minority groups all worked to construct our participants as "Muslims." Young people demonstrated agency and creativity in handling and responding to these encounters, including using humor, clarifying their religious affiliation, social withdrawal, and ignoring the situation. Redressing misrecognition requires institutional change to ensure parity of participation in society.

T1  - Are the ethnically tolerant free of discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance?
AN  - 1929389479
AB  - We hypothesized that the ethnically tolerant (i.e., people who are anti-ethnocentric and score very low on a measure of ethnocentrism) would perceive people with extremely incompatible values and beliefs as out-groups and would engage in discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Experiments among Australian citizens in Studies 1 (N = 224) and 2 (N = 283) showed that the ethnically tolerant perceived supporters of a message in favour of mandatory detention of asylum seekers as out-groups and consequently exhibited discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Study 3 with 265 U.S. citizens showed that, controlling for liberalism, ethnic tolerance led to prejudice against out-groups. This was replicated with 522 UK citizens in Study 4, which also showed that social identity, and not moral conviction, mediated the link between ethnic tolerance and prejudice. The findings suggest that the ethnically tolerant can be discriminatory, prejudiced and politically intolerant against fellow humans.

T1  - Making the "Other" from "Us": The Representation of British Converts to Islam in Mainstream British Newspapers
AN  - 1923037009
AB  - There is now a great deal of literature that shows how Islam and Muslims are routinely represented in negative ways in the mainstream newspapers. With overt or covert reliance on Orientalist discourse, discourses of cultural clash and extremism, including terror, are prevalent. Not only are Muslims less likely to feature in "normal" stories, abuse and prejudice against them is also more unlikely to constitute "news". British converts to Islam have only recently begun to receive more focused attention, both in academia and in the mainstream press. Occupying a unique position in respect to the idea of the "other" and of integration in a multicultural society, converts offer a powerful point of critique of these concepts. The aim of this study is to understand how and in what discourses British converts to Islam are represented, and thereby contribute empirical knowledge to these theoretical concerns.

T1  - Linguistic Anthropology in 2016: Now What?
AN  - 1902296385
AB  - In this review, I extend the ideological and discursive insights on prejudice and racism offered by Jane Hill in her work The Everyday Language of White Racism to consider the potential of linguistic anthropology to address social injustice. In a year marked by the global rise of right-wing politics, 2016 cannot simply be viewed as business as usual, but rather calls for a reevaluation of the potential of linguistic anthropology in light of what it can do now. The essay is thematically organized to focus on the production of value and the reproduction of inequality over a wide range of modalities and research contexts. I begin with the "Metrics of Analysis" to review conceptual frameworks through which ethnographic analysis has been undertaken, such as temporality, scale, multimodality, technology, discourse studies, and others. The sections that follow expand upon these themes across three broad headings. The first, "Participation and Social (In)Justice," addresses the complex agendas and institutional processes that mediate linguistic struggles for equality in settler colonial and indigenous contexts, political language, racism and social justice, and the affordances and limitations of language for young people. The second, "Global Ethnonationalism," builds on a language ideology framework to examine the study of minority languages, the language of right-wing religiosity, and the contradictions of national branding. The third explores "Epistemologies of Value" via performativity, embodiment, sound, materiality, ontology, and media. The essay concludes with potential directions for linguistic anthropologists to address the worldwide "alt-" realities that have come into clearer view. [ethnonationalism, language ideology, race, semiotics, social justice]Alternate abstract:En esta revisión extiendo el conocimiento ideológico y discursivo sobre prejuicio y racismo ofrecido por Jane Hill en su trabajo El lenguaje diario del racismo blanco para considerar el potencial de la antropología linguística en el abordaje de la injusticia social. En un año marcado por el crecimiento global de las políticas de derecha, 2016 no puede simplemente ser visto de manera habitual, sino en cambio requiere una revaluación del potencial de la antropología linguística a la luz de lo que puede hacer ahora. El ensayo está temáticamente organizado, concentrándose en la producción de valor y la reproducción de desigualdad sobre un amplio rango de modalidades y contextos de investigación. Empiezo con "Métricas de Análisis" para revisar marcos conceptuales a través de los cuales el análisis etnográfico ha sido emprendido, tales como temporalidad, escala, multimodalidad, tecnología, estudios discursivos, y otros. Las tres secciones siguientes expanden estos temas a través de tres líneas generales. La primera, "Participación e (In)Justicia Social", aborda las agendas complejas y los procesos institucionales que median las luchas linguísticas por la igualdad en contextos de pobladores coloniales e indígenas, lenguaje político, racismo y justicia social, y la asequibilidad y limitaciones del lenguaje para gente joven. La segunda, "Etnonacionalismo Global", se basa en un marco lenguaje-ideología para estudiar los lenguajes minoritarios, el lenguaje de la religiosidad de la derecha, y las contradicciones del etiquetamiento nacional. La tercera explora las "Epistemologías de Valor", vía performatividad, corporeización, sonido, materialidad, ontología, y medios de comunicación. El ensayo concluye con direcciones potenciales para los antropólogos linguísticos para abordar las realidades "alt-" a nivel mundial que han llegado a ser más claras.

T1  - From Lew Alcindor to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Race, Religion, and Representation in Basketball, 1968-1975
AN  - 1898587043
AB  - From 1968 to 1975, Lew Alcindor/Kareem Abdul-Jabbar traveled a turbulent personal path toward self-discovery. His journey had profound implications for the larger cultural landscape of race, sport, politics, and religion. As he became professional basketball's chief superstar, he was framed by the press as sullen and solitary, and he served as the villain in a media-driven storyline informed by popular prejudices. Yet for many African Americans and other progressive fans, he exemplified the ideals that made black power uplifting and affirmative, rather than threatening. His conversion to Islam and his name change further shaped new cultural and political territory for the black athlete. It highlighted a personal struggle within Abdul-Jabbar - he sought a kind of personal freedom, even as he revealed a tendency to subsume himself before strong authority figures. He nevertheless stood, in this period, as the nation's most prominent face of classical Islam. His religious conversion further distanced him from much of the American public, but over time he presented an effective, progressive narrative about the place of Islam in American life.

T1  - A critical discourse analytic approach to discursive construction of Islam in Western talk shows: The case of CNN talk shows: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1857961330
AB  - The present research aimed at examining the discourse of CNN as a mainstream media, through the application of critical discourse analysis. The goal of this research was to uncover CNN's orientation in covering Muslim-related issues and to uncover how the elements described by van Dijk (2001) play their role in constructing the discourses of Islamophobic ideologies in CNN's talk shows. To this end, an analysis was conducted at two textual and contextual levels, including 34 programs, out of 50 GPS talk shows aired in 2013. The textual analysis was done regarding the three levels of meaning, argumentation, and style and the contextual analysis with regards to levels of access and participants. The findings revealed that CNN's representation of Muslim-related issues was biased and stereotypical at all levels; textual and contextual and the scope of the talk show was in line with the Islamophobic ideologies which prevail the Western media today.

T1  - Living together in multi-ethnic cities: People of migrant background, their interethnic friendships and the neighbourhood
AN  - 1854783733
AB  - This paper explores the extent to which people of different origins, natives and migrants, come together in everyday life in Europe. Instead of looking at overall 'perceptions' and 'stances', which are context-dependent and mediated through political-ideological currents and discourses as well as broader patterns of prejudice, we focus on sustained close contacts that suggest meaningful and organic relationships. Since it is most often people of migrant background who are blamed for leading 'parallel lives' and 'not integrating', we chose to focus on them and their interethnic friendships. Moreover, we seek to understand the relevance and role of the neighbourhood context in the development of those relationships. Despite the expressive fears in public discourses about the supposed negative impact of the presence of immigrants and ethnic minorities on social cohesion, our findings indicate that close interethnic relationships are not uncommon in diverse European cities. They further highlight that the neighbourhood context plays an important role in the first years of migrants' settlement. Relationships in the neighbourhood develop in less formal social settings and are also less demanding in terms of host-country cultural skills on the part of the migrants, thus giving the opportunity to newcomers to develop close interethnic relationships with natives. Finally, the analysis supports the positive role of diversity at the neighbourhood level in the development of interethnic friendships and stresses the importance of the neighbourhood's socio-spatial characteristics and its location in the wider urban net.

T1  - Global identification predicts gay–male identity integration and well‐being among Turkish gay men
AN  - 2067639513
AB  - In most parts of the world, hegemonic masculinity requires men to endorse traditional masculine ideals, one of which is rejection of homosexuality. Wherever hegemonic masculinity favours heterosexuality over homosexuality, gay males may feel under pressure to negotiate their conflicting male gender and gay sexual identities to maintain positive self‐perceptions. However, globalization, as a source of intercultural interaction, might provide a beneficial context for people wishing to create alternative masculinities in the face of hegemonic masculinity. Hence, we tested if global identification would predict higher levels of gay–male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well‐being, via alternative masculinity representations for gay and male identities. A community sample of 219 gay and bisexual men from Turkey completed the study. Structural equation modelling revealed that global identification positively predicted gay–male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well‐being; however, alternative masculinity representations did not mediate this relationship. Our findings illustrate how identity categories in different domains can intersect and affect each other in complex ways. Moreover, we discuss mental health and well‐being implications for gay men living in cultures where they experience high levels of prejudice and stigma.

T1  - Impeaching Rape Victims in Criminal Court
AN  - 1826845620
AB  - The present study investigated the impact of impeaching a rape victim with evidence of a simultaneous civil suit during a criminal trial. In three experiments, male and female undergraduates (Experiment 1) and community members (Experiments 2 and 3) read a rape trial summary in which the victim accused the defendant of raping her in a hotel. In the impeachment condition, the Defense mentioned that the victim simultaneously sued either the hotel (Experiments 1, 2, 3) or the alleged perpetrator (Experiment 3) for US$1 million. In the control condition, the Defense did not mention a civil suit. In all experiments, mock jurors were more likely to render not guilty verdicts and had higher pro-defendant ratings (e.g., defendant credibility) when the Defense impeached the victim than when the Defense did not impeach her. In addition, victim credibility (Experiments 1, 2, 3) and victim greed (Experiment 3) mediated the impact of impeachment on verdict. Results are discussed in terms of the prejudice rape victims may face in criminal court when they also seek justice in civil court.

T1  - Homophobic Prejudice in Czech Youth: a Sociodemographic Analysis of Young People's Opinions on Homosexuality
AN  - 1802421355
AB  - The aims of this study are to provide momentum to research on homophobic prejudice in Czechia and to identify the significant factors influencing or mediating homophobic attitudes in Czech youth. The paper first contextualizes homophobia within the context of the Central and Eastern European countries and then refers to the role of schools and education tools in the prevention of homophobia. Results of a quantitative analysis based on original data collected during a research survey from 9th graders (N=1082) in 35 selected Czech elementary schools are presented in the empirical part of the paper. We identify demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and environmental factors that are significantly linked with homophobic attitudes in youth. Gender differences as well as relationship satisfaction with parents or peers, psychological status, and perception of quality of the environment one lives in were found to be among the most significant factors influencing prejudicial opinions in youth. Metropolitan youth were found to be significantly less prejudiced against nonheterosexuals. By taking lessons from abroad, we propose a number of possible policy interventions mainly in the realm of curricular documents and teacher training.

T1  - Prejudice Masquerading as Praise: The Negative Echo of Positive Stereotypes
AN  - 1797547560
AB  - Five studies demonstrate the powerful connection between being the target of a positive stereotype and expecting that one is also being ascribed negative stereotypes. In Study 1, women who heard a man state a positive stereotype were more likely to believe that he held negative stereotypes of them than women who heard no stereotype. Beliefs about being negatively stereotyped mediated the relationship between hearing a positive stereotype and believing that the stereotyper was prejudiced. Studies 2 to 4 extended these results to Asian Americans and accounted for alternative explanations (e.g., categorization threat). In Study 5, the same positive stereotype (e.g., good at math) was directed to Asian American men's racial or gender identity. Their perceptions about whether negative racial or gender stereotypes were being applied to them depended on the identity referenced by the positive stereotype. Positive stereotypes signal a latent negativity about one's group, thereby explaining why they can feel like prejudice.

T1  - The Enterprising Self and Prejudices toward Unemployed Persons: Analyses of Intergroup-mechanisms that Substantiate Neoliberal Inequalities
AN  - 2167841583
AB  - This research tries to build bridges between sociological and social psychological theoretical ideas for the study of social inequality in neoliberal societies. It adds to research on social inequality by examining amplifiers of prejudices toward unemployed persons. A conceptual model has been developed which draws upon social dominance theory and governmentality studies. The empirical analyses guided by this model assess the mediating effects of the enterprising self - a newly developed attitude measure based on sociological analyses of contemporary self-help literature - and the Protestant Work Ethic in the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudices toward unemployed persons, both depending on social status. Conditional process models reveal the phenomenon of ideological asymmetry relevant for the enterprising self, indicating that this neoliberal guiding principle serves as a dominant driving force in reproducing social inequality through mechanisms at the intergroup-level.Alternate abstract:Dieser Artikel baut für die Untersuchung neoliberaler sozialer Ungleichheiten über die Soziale Dominanztheorie und eine Analyse von Verstärkern von Vorurteilen gegenüber arbeitslosen Personen Brücken zwischen soziologischen und sozialpsychologischen Theorietraditionen. Ein konzeptionelles Modell wurde entwickelt, worin mediierende Effekte von Einstellungen entlang des Leitbildes des unternehmerischen Selbst – eine neu entwickelte quantitative Einstellungsmessung die auf gouvernementalitätstheoretisch soziologischen Analysen gegenwärtiger Selbsthilfeliteratur basiert – unter Kontrolle der Protestantischen Arbeitsethik und des subjektiven Statusempfindens empirisch getestet wurden. Die Methode des Conditional Process Modeling ergab eine moderierte Wirkung des unternehmerischen Selbst auf die Abwertung von arbeitslosen Personen, die mit zunehmenden Status stark zunimmt, leicht in der Mittelschicht auftritt und in der (subjektiven) Underclass nicht vorliegt. Dieses Resultat wird in Anknüpfung an die gouvernementalitätstheoretische Literatur diskutiert.

T1  - THE "SICK" RACIST
AN  - 1801833381
AB  - Since the early 1960s, there has been a movement among activists, scholars, and policymakers to redefine racism as a psychopathological condition, identifiable and treatable through psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions. This development reflects, and is reflected by, the popular framing among mass media and ordinary social actors of racism and racist events as individual pathology rather than as a social problem. This shifting perspective on racism, from a social problem and a system to an individual pathology, has increasingly become a part of academic and psychiatric discourse since Jim Crow. In this article, we have two aims: first, to trace the emergence of "psychopathological racism"; second, to illustrate the relationship between "psychopathological racism" and "colorblind racism" in the post-Civil Rights era. We argue that the psychopathological view of racism compliments colorblindness in that larger structural issues are dismissed in favor of individual pathos. Furthermore, psychopathological explanations for racism dismiss socio-political contexts, eschewing the contributions of well over fifty years of social scientific research in the process.

T1  - The 2012 killing of Chinese citizens in Rome and the ambivalence of Italian journalism
AN  - 1784145627
AB  - Sredanovic discusses the killing of a father and daughter of Chinese origin in Rome in January 2012, and the portrayal of the case in Italian print journalism. He uses a qualitative analysis of a corpus of 193 articles from seven Italian newspapers with different political, market and geographic profiles. The frequency of generally negative and stereotypical portraits of migrants in crime news is well known; however, this specific case offers a number of less familiar insights. Sredanovic shows the multiple and changing frames and themes, both positive and negative, deployed to portray the event across the two-week period in which it was featured on the front pages of newspapers. He demonstrates in particular the ways in which stereotypes that are often used against migrants in crime news find place even in a case in which the migrants were the victims of the crime. He further illustrate how the representation of the perpetrators shifted from describing them as an exception (when it was thought they were autochthonous) to generalizing about their deviance when it was discovered that they were of Moroccan origin. Sredanovic locates this discussion in an anti-groupist theoretical frame, arguing that the stereotypes used cannot be adequately explained by majority-minority group interactions, and that the delimitation and definition of groups should be understood as ideological from the start. He also argues that aspects of the production routines of crime journalism can be added to the factors that explain the portrayal of the event. He concludes by arguing that Sinophobia is a form of prejudice that varies geographically and in time, and calling for non-reifying, practice-informed analyses that mix discriminating and non-discriminating discourses.

T1  - Muslim 'hate preachers' in British tabloids: Constructing the British self and the Muslim other
AN  - 1811948619
AB  - In the aftermath of 9/11, the academia witnessed a surge in the number of studies dealing with Islamophobia, the representations of Muslims in Western media and complex realities created by such (mis)representations. This article hopes to contribute to such scholarly efforts by examining the demonisation of Islam through the fashioning of celebrity Muslim 'hate preachers' (i.e. Abu-Hamza, Abu-Qatada and Omar Bakri) in British tabloids (i.e. The Sun and the Daily Mail ). Drawing upon insights from Serge Moscovici's theory of social representations, the article aims to diverge from the traditional approaches of content and discourse analysis to shed light on the nexus between forms of social thinking and the unique portrayal of these preachers in tabloids.

T1  - Transgender stigma and health: A critical review of stigma determinants, mechanisms, and interventions
AN  - 1751218162
AB  - Transgender people in the United States experience widespread prejudice, discrimination, violence, and other forms of stigma. This critical review aims to integrate the literature on stigma towards transgender people in the US. This review demonstrates that transgender stigma limits opportunities and access to resources in a number of critical domains (e.g., employment, healthcare), persistently affecting the physical and mental health of transgender people. The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations. Additional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in US transgender populations. Multi-level interventions to prevent stigma towards transgender people are warranted. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615302185]

T1  - Trusting Communities and Bigger In-Groups: Social Capital, Interracial Contact Climate, and Common In-Group Categorization
AN  - 1750356044
AB  - Contact with members of different groups can reduce prejudice and encourage people to recategorize members of other social categories. This research examines individual-level social capital--one's experience with trust, reciprocity norms, and engagement within a given community--as a construct that predicts contact climate and recategorization. People who have high levels of social capital within a community are more likely to perceive a positive interracial contact climate. High social capital and a favorable contact climate can encourage people to focus on their shared identity as members of that community. Two studies support the claim that social capital predicts intergroup processes. Study 1 tests a cross-sectional mediation model linking individual-level social capital to perceptions of the contact climate, common in-group categorization, and racial out-group attitudes. Study 2 presents longitudinal data demonstrating that social capital's cross-lagged effects on contact climate, categorization, and racial out-group attitudes are stronger than their reverse effects. Implications for diversity research and community applications are discussed.

T1  - Cutting Gordian Knots: Reducing Prejudice Through Attachment Security
AN  - 1725035918
AB  - The positive role of secure attachment in reducing intergroup biases has been suggested in prior studies. We extend this work by testing the effects of secure attachment primes on negative emotions and aggressive behaviors toward outgroup members across four experiments. Results from Studies 1A and 1B reveal that secure attachment prime, relative to neutral, can reduce negative outgroup emotions. In addition, Studies 1B and 3 results rule out positive mood increase as an alternative explanation for the observed effects. Results from Studies 2 and 3 reveal that secure attachment primes can reduce aggressive behavior toward an outgroup member. The effect of secure attachment primes on outgroup harm was found to be fully mediated by negative emotions in Studies 2 and 3. An interaction between secure attachment primes and ingroup identification in Study 2 indicated that the positive effects of secure attachment in reducing outgroup harm may be especially beneficial for highly identified ingroup members.

T1  - The Effects of Civil Hate Speech Laws: Lessons from Australia
AN  - 1735658655; 201537807
AB  - This article examines the effects of hate speech laws in Australia. Triangulating data from primary and secondary sources, we examine five hypothesized effects: whether the laws provide a remedy to targets of hate speech, encourage more respectful speech, have an educative or symbolic effect, have a chilling effect, or create 'martyrs.' We find the laws provide a limited remedy in the complaints mechanisms, provide a framework for direct community advocacy, and that knowledge of the laws exists in public discourse. However, the complaints mechanism imposes a significant enforcement burden on targeted communities, who still regularly experience hate speech. We find a reduction in the expression of prejudice in mediated outlets, but not on the street. We find no evidence of a chilling effect and we find the risk of free speech martyrs to be marginal. We draw out the implications of these findings for other countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends
AN  - 1767328597; 201605714
AB  - Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceptions of and Objections to Christianity Among Unchurched and Dechurched Adults
AN  - 1768532498
AB  - Mars Hill Church—a large multisite church centered in Seattle—commissioned research examining the perceptions of and objections to Christianity among unchurched and dechurched adults in the United States. ‘‘Unchurched’’ persons were defined as those who attend worship services every few months or less and who did not regularly attend worship services growing up. The ‘‘dechurched’’ were defined as persons who attend worship services every few months or less but who regularly attended services as a child. Data were gathered using both a quantitative and a qualitative component. For the quantitative portion, GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications conducted a nationwide telephone survey using random digit dialing (RDD). To qualify for the study, respondents had to be between 18 and 44 years of age and be either unchurched (n = 259) or dechurched (n = 741) as defined above. The surveys were conducted on landlines and cell phones between late April and early June 2013 and took roughly 12 min each. Saurage Marketing Research conducted the qualitative portion of the research, which consisted of eight focus groups with unchurched and dechurched U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 44 years. The groups were held in Austin, Boston, Phoenix, and San Francisco. In each city, two focus groups were conducted: one with women and another with men. The groups involved 68 respondents in total, who were selected to maintain diversity in terms of educational level and church experience for each group.The findings reveal that a majority of survey respondents describe themselves as spiritual, whether ‘‘very’’ (21 %) or ‘‘somewhat’’ (35 %). Being at least somewhat spiritual is much more common among the dechurched (61 %) than among the unchurched (42 %). The respondents tended to understand Christianity as mostly about acceptance, tolerance, and the Golden Rule, and they criticized Christians for not living in accordance with those values. While some tried to avoid over-generalizing, most respondents viewed Christians as off-putting. Many think that Christianity and Christian leaders play on fear of death and the unknown, and that Christianity is primarily an existential ‘‘crutch’’ that they do not need. For most respondents, their perceptions of church are derived from their exposure to the Catholic Church, Evangelical mega-churches, and television preachers.The primary objection to Christianity across all focus groups and demographics was that some Christians are too intolerant (55 % of survey respondents indicated this as an objection). Beliefs about sexuality and reproduction—especially gay marriage and abortion—were the second leading objection (50 %), followed in third place by the role of Christianity in U.S. politics (49 %).

AN  - 1708527329; 201528954
AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

T1  - Can (elaborated) imagined contact interventions reduce prejudice among those higher in intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS)?
AN  - 1660887487
AB  - Intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS) reflects an affect-laden revulsion toward out-groups. Previous attempts to weaken its prediction of prejudice have failed. Given that clinical approaches to disgust sensitivity successfully utilize mental imagery, we consider contact simulation interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to control, standard imagined contact, or an elaborated contact condition (elaborated imagined contact [EIC]; detailed imagination involving physical contact with a homeless person, with relaxation instructions). Both contact conditions (vs. control) significantly weakened the link between ITG-DS and prejudice, yet only EIC weakened the relation between ITG-DS and out-group trust. Mediated moderation analysis confirmed that EIC significantly attenuated the link between ITG-DS and prejudice through increasing trust. Clinically relevant treatments are thus valuable in severing the association between (a) ITG-DS and (b) lower out-group trust and greater out-group prejudice.

T1  - Preference for consistency and value dissimilarities in dehumanization and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia
AN  - 1700676275; 201524984
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the importance of differential attribution of uniquely human characteristics in dehumanization and prejudice. Relatively little is known, however, about the importance of perceiving dissimilarities between the ingroup and outgroup in different types of values (beyond prosocial values), or the role of preference for consistency (PFC). This study investigated values, perceived dissimilarities in values, and PFC, in dehumanization of and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia. Results from a survey of 140 Australians revealed a strong relationship between dehumanization and prejudice. Individuals with stronger conservation and self-enhancement values, and greater perceived dissimilarity to asylum seekers on self-transcendence and self-enhancement values, dehumanized asylum seekers more and were more prejudiced toward them. The relationships between perceived self-transcendence and self-enhancement dissimilarities and prejudice were mediated by dehumanization, whereas PFC moderated the relationship between conservation value differences and dehumanization. These findings offer important insight into the conditions that promote dehumanization and prejudice, which may in turn help explain the negative perceptions of asylum seekers in Australia.

T1  - Assemblies in Art and Politics: An interview with Jacques Ranciere
AN  - 1692290873; 201521746
AB  - This interview was conducted on 8 October 2011 at the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. It was held during a symposium that reflected on the work of Ranciere and was a part of a broader engagement with the concept of autonomy and its relation to art organized by an umbrella group of universities and arts organizations under the name of 'The Autonomy Project'. A number of the symposium's participants - Peter Osborne, Gerald Raunig, Isabell Lorey, Ruth Sondregger, Kim Mereiene and Adrian Martin - contributed questions that formed the basis of this interview. The interview took place at a time when the longer-term possibilities of the Arab Spring and Occupy/Indignados movements were under general scrutiny. It was also a moment when the Van Abbemuseum itself was compelled to reflect on its own position of political autonomy in relation to neoliberal state directives, political populism at the local level and its own critique of aesthetic autonomy. Ranciere's work on aesthetics and politics has been as much appreciated as a clearance strategy against prevailing visual prejudices as it has served as a platform for rethinking the emancipatory potential of creative practice.

T1  - Do You Say Something When It's Your Boss? The Role of Perpetrator Power in Prejudice Confrontation
AN  - 1634404957
AB  - Two experiments examined the role of perpetrator power in witnesses' decision to confront a prejudicial remark. In Experiment 1, participants who witnessed a sexist remark by a higher-power (vs. an equal-power) perpetrator were significantly less likely to express confrontation intentions, despite finding the remark highly biased and inappropriate. In Experiment 2, participants read scenarios involving a sexist versus racist remark perpetrated by someone higher vs. lower vs. equal in power, and they reported their confrontation intentions. Perpetrator power again inhibited direct confrontation intentions, and this effect was mediated by perceptions of responsibility for intervening, perceived ability to decide how to respond, and perceived costs versus benefits of confronting. Findings were not qualified by discrimination type (racism vs. sexism) or by individual differences in participant prejudice. Consistent with power-as-approach theory, feeling powerless increased sensitivity to confrontation obstacles and thereby inhibited confrontation intentions.

T1  - East Asian Religious Tolerance-A Myth or a Reality? Empirical Investigations of Religious Prejudice in East Asian Societies
AN  - 1718065865; 201532228
AB  - Is East Asian religious tolerance, as opposed to Western monotheistic prejudice, a stereotype or a reality? Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, we hypothesized low prejudice as a function of East Asian religiosity. We examined whether this holds true for interreligious, anti-atheist, ethnic, and anti-gay prejudice. In Study 1, analysis of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2008 data from Eastern religious and Christian samples in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (total N = 3,555) showed, contrarily to Christians, high interreligious tolerance and weaker if no anti-gay prejudice as a function of Eastern religiosity. In Study 2, Eastern religiosity among Taiwanese (n = 222) was negatively related to prejudice against various religious outgroups (except atheists), especially among those low in authoritarianism. In Study 3, Eastern religiosity among Taiwanese (n = 102) was negatively related to implicit interreligious (Muslims) and ethnic (Africans) prejudice; prosociality partially mediated the former association. Eastern religious tolerance seems to be true, but not unlimited. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Challenging Social Attitudes and Making a Change: The Struggle of Feminist Organisations in Turkey and India against Incest
AN  - 1700674157; 201528259
AB  - While it has become easier to find statistics of incest and child sexual abuse and other such 'data' from countries of the Global South such as Turkey and India, academic analyses of the issue from the perspective of organisations fighting against it and supporting survivors remain scarce. The purpose of this article is to lay out the existing discourses on gender, family, childhood, innocence and virtue alongside the social and media explosion on the issue, in order to locate the contradictions in social commentary within and against which three feminist organisations function: Mor Cati Kadin Siginagi Vakfi [Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation] (Mor Cati) and KA-MER (Kadin Merkezi) Vakfi [Women's Center Foundation] (KAMER) in Turkey and Recovering And Healing from Incest (RAHI) in India. Based on interviews with psychologists, lawyers and activists, this article looks at how these organisations challenge the prejudices that allow such abuses to thrive, creating new methods of resistance against incest in the process. In spite of Mor Cat and KAMER being more involved in developing a feminist critique of the public discourse on incest and challenging existing laws on the issue and RAHI focusing more on mental healing of survivors, all three organisations provide support for survivors and criticise patriarchal structures in similar ways in their attempts to break the silence surrounding incest.

T1  - To Love or Hate Thy Neighbor: The Role of Authoritarianism and Traditionalism in Explaining the Link Between Fundamentalism and Racial Prejudice
AN  - 1551002205; 201431181
AB  - Fundamentalism is consistently related to racial prejudice (Hall, Matz, & Wood, 2010), yet the mechanisms for this relationship are unclear. We identify two core values of fundamentalism, authoritarianism and traditionalism, that independently contribute to the fundamentalism-racial prejudice relationship. We also contextualize the fundamentalism-racial prejudice relationship by suggesting that fundamentalists may show prejudice based on conceptions of African Americans as violating values but show tolerance when prejudice is less justifiable. These ideas are tested and confirmed using three data sets from the American National Election Studies. Across all three samples, fundamentalism is related to increases in symbolic racism but decreases in negative affect towards African Americans, and these relationships are mediated by both authoritarianism and traditionalism.

T1  - DISTINCT EFFECTS OF IMAGINE-OTHER VERSUS IMAGINE-SELF PERSPECTIVE-TAKING ON PREJUDICE REDUCTION
AN  - 1551000269; 201429140
AB  - Two experiments tested the hypothesis that imagine-other and imagine-self perspective-taking have different implications for prejudice reduction when instantiated in intergroup exchanges characterized by the potential for evaluation. We reasoned that because imagine-other perspective-taking is more likely than imagine-self perspective-taking to lead individuals to an unproductive focus on how they themselves are evaluated, imagine-other perspective-taking would hinder prejudice reduction whereas imagine-self perspective-taking would not. Results across two different intergroup relationships were consistent with these predictions and further suggested that the negative implications of imagine-other perspective-taking were mediated by relative meta-stereotype activation, an index of the extent to which individuals focused more on how their own group was viewed than on their view of the outgroup. These findings highlight that considering how individuals' concerns with evaluation guide their thoughts and experiences during intergroup exchanges can help identify the likely effects of different intervention strategies in such contexts.

T1  - Fighting Words: What's Wrong with Freedom of Expression?
AN  - 2076973876
AB  - In recent years, Norway has regularly been criticised by international anti-discrimination and anti-racism monitoring bodies for failing to curtail hate speech of a racist and/or discriminatory nature. The so-called 'racism paragraph' of the Norwegian General Penal Code, introduced in 1970, made such speech liable to criminal prosecution. Furthermore, the formal legal penalties for such speech, as well as the range of application of the legislation had if anything been increased and extended since 2005. Nonetheless, few prosecutions under the paragraph have been brought in recent years. Racist and/or discriminatory speech on the Internet has hardly been prosecuted, even if it is in these largely unregulated media that the problem is most visible. This article traces the shifting patterns of application of the Norwegian 'racism paragraph', and argues that as a result of extra-legal developments, Norway has moved in a more liberal and absolutist direction in relation to freedom of expression and its limits. This article advocates a modest defence of existing hate speech legislation in Norway and in western Europe, along the lines suggested by Jeremy Waldron.

T1  - The Role of Ingroup and Outgroup Metaprejudice in Predicting Prejudice and Identity Undermining
AN  - 1718069871; 201530759
AB  - The present study aims to understand the role of ingroup and outgroup metaprejudice in predicting prejudice and identity undermining. I predicted that ingroup metaprejudice would mediate the effect of outgroup metaprejudice on prejudice and identity undermining either on minority subgroup or minority outgroup. The results from the majority of Sunni Muslim participants (N = 214) targeting Ahmadiyya (i.e., minority subgroup of Islam) and Christians (i.e., minority outgroup) showed that the effect of outgroup metaprejudice on prejudice, and identity undermining through ingroup metaprejudice, was significant. In general, the findings indicate that what group members think of what others are thinking may play a key role in influencing intergroup relations and perceptions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Preventing Discrimination of Nonstandard Speakers
AN  - 1504424509; 201406703
AB  - Prejudice against a social group may lead to discrimination of members of this group. One very strong cue of group membership is a (non)standard accent in speech. Surprisingly, hardly any interventions against accent-based discrimination have been tested. In the current article, we introduce an intervention in which what participants experience themselves unobtrusively changes their evaluations of others. In the present experiment, participants in the experimental condition talked to a confederate in a foreign language before the experiment, whereas those in the control condition received no treatment. Replicating previous research, participants in the control condition discriminated against Turkish-accented job candidates. In contrast, those in the experimental condition evaluated Turkish- and standard-accented candidates as similarly competent. We discuss potential mediating and moderating factors of this effect.

T1  - 'We were here first, so we determine the rules of the game': Autochthony and prejudice towards out-groups
AN  - 1512218298; 201408682
AB  - This paper identifies autochthony -- the belief that a place belongs to its original inhabitants and that they are therefore more entitled -- as a relevant new determinant of out-group prejudice. We hypothesized that autochthony uniquely predicts prejudice towards migrant groups and that it mediates the relationship between national identification and prejudice. The mediation process was anticipated to be especially strong for people who perceive out-group encroachment, that is, those who feel that immigrants are 'getting out of place'. These hypotheses were tested in two studies using nationally representative samples of native Dutch participants. In Study 1 (N = 793), we showed that autochthony is an empirically distinct construct and that it is a unique predictor of prejudice. Furthermore, higher national identifiers expressed stronger claims of autochthony, and these claims were in turn associated with more negative feelings towards migrant groups. Study 2 (N = 466) showed support for a moderated mediation model: Beliefs in autochthony were only related to prejudice for participants who perceived out-group encroachment.

T1  - 'If you feel that nobody wants you you'll withdraw into your own': Gypsies/Travellers, networks and healthcare utilisation
AN  - 1767327985; 201609890
AB  - Gypsies and Travellers are the unhealthiest group in British society, suffering from higher levels of physical and mental illness, lower life expectancy and with low levels of healthcare utilisation. They also continue to experience the highest level of prejudice and discrimination in society. While studies indicate that social networks play an important role in shaping health beliefs and the response to symptoms, evidence on the influence of networks on health is unclear and contradictory. This article draws on social network theory and research into the relation between discrimination and health to critically examine how networks mediate between collective experiences of racism and health-related behavior. Qualitative interviews with 39 adult Gypsies and Travellers were conducted in the South-East of England to explore the wider structural and institutional context and the influence those contexts play in shaping health beliefs and decisions whether to access formal health services. The findings indicate that the influence networks play in shaping health behaviour is dependent on the particular social context of the group and its status in relation to wider social structures, making generalization problematic.

T1  - Favorable Contact During Volunteer Service: Reducing Prejudice Toward Mexicans in the American Southwest
AN  - 1494748628; 201401925
AB  - We assessed religious volunteers' intergroup contact, realistic threat perceptions, symbolic threat perceptions, intergroup anxiety, negative stereotypes and prejudice toward Mexicans before and approximately 4-6 months into their volunteer service. Whether assigned to serve Mexicans or European-Americans, all volunteers experienced reduced prejudice toward Mexicans. A multiple mediator model suggests that changes in prejudice resulted from a mediated relationship between quality contact and prejudice. Specifically, intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes mediated the relationship. The benefits of volunteerism as a means of fostering favorable intergroup contact and reducing threat perceptions and prejudice are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Enacting Cultural Interests: How Intergroup Contact Reduces Prejudice by Sparking Interest in an Out-Group's Culture
AN  - 1933733885
AB  - In the present research, we examined the hypothesis that cues of social connectedness to a member of another social group can spark interest in the group's culture, and that such interest, when freely enacted, contributes to reductions in intergroup prejudice. In two pilot studies and Experiment 1, we found that extant and desired cross-group friendships and cues of social connectedness to an out-group member predicted increased interest in the target group's culture. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated cues of social connectedness between non-Latino American participants and a Latino American (i.e., Mexican American) peer and whether participants freely worked with this peer on a Mexican cultural task. This experience reduced the participants' implicit bias against Latinos, an effect that was mediated by increased cultural engagement, and, 6 months later in an unrelated context, improved intergroup outcomes (e.g., interest in interacting with Mexican Americans; Experiment 4). The Discussion section addresses the inter- and intragroup benefits of policies that encourage people to express and share diverse cultural interests in mainstream settings.

T1  - Feeling in with the outgroup: Outgroup acceptance and the internalization of the motivation to respond without prejudice
AN  - 1494749616; 201401901
AB  - Over 10 years of research has illustrated the benefits of internal motivation to respond without prejudice (IMS) for prejudice regulation and high-quality intergroup contact (see Plant & Devine, 1998). Yet, it is unclear how this motivation develops. The current work tested one route through which feelings of acceptance from outgroup members facilitate the development of IMS. Longitudinally, feeling accepted by outgroup members predicted increases in IMS across a 15-week period (Study 1). Experimental manipulations of outgroup acceptance also increased IMS toward racial outgroups (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, IMS mediated the relationship between outgroup acceptance and participants' increased willingness to pay money to increase opportunities for interracial contact (Study 2). Tests of mediation also demonstrated that feelings of acceptance mediated the effect of outgroup acceptance on internal motivation (Study 3). In addition, this pattern of responses held for members of both high- and low-status racial groups. This research demonstrates one pathway through which the fulfillment of fundamental needs influences motivated intergroup processes. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Cooperation makes it happen: Imagined intergroup cooperation enhances the positive effects of imagined contact
AN  - 1463011620; 201345660
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact represents a new indirect contact strategy to reduce intergroup bias. Extending the literature on imagined contact, we tested whether the inclusion of cooperation into the imagination task would outperform the standard imagined contact scenarios used in previous research. 87 participants were instructed to imagine a neutral versus a positive versus a cooperative interaction with an out-group member. As predicted, after imagining a cooperative intergroup interaction, participants showed more empathy and trust toward the out-group than participants in the remaining experimental conditions. Furthermore, they also reported reduced prejudice and intergroup anxiety. Taken together, implementing cooperation in the imagined contact paradigm reduced intergroup bias, above and beyond basic imagined contact effects. Finally, the perceived quality of the imagined interaction with an out-group member mediated the experimental effects. Theoretical and practical implications of these novel findings will be discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Religiosity and Prejudice: Different Patterns for Two Types of Religious Internalization
AN  - 1559005075; 201431767
AB  - The literature on the relationship between religiosity and prejudice has shown inconsistent findings. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between different types of religiosity and that its relationship with prejudice is mediated by different values. Results of two studies conducted in Italy show that identified religiosity and introjected religiosity predict different levels of prejudice toward Muslim immigrants. Moreover, the negative relationship between identified religiosity and prejudice was mediated by prosocial values, whereas valuing conformity mediated the positive relationship between introjected religiosity and prejudice. The results show that it is possible to better understand the relationship between religiosity and prejudice by disentangling the different ways of being religious. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Natural law and critical theory: Bringing rights back in
AN  - 1429629007; 201335391
AB  - This paper re-assesses the significance of the idea of 'right' in the tradition of critical theory. Focusing on the work of Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno, especially their confrontation with totalitarianism, it addresses their conceptualization of rights, their engagement with the philosophies of right created by Kant and Hegel, and the ambivalent place of Marx in their thinking about rights. My argument is that critical theory turned to natural rights in response to the perceived difficulties positive sociology had in confronting the barbarities of fascism and Stalinism. Critical theory steered a path between philosophies of right that acknowledged the idea of right within an unacceptably naturalistic frame of reference, and a sociological consciousness that de-natured the idea of right at the cost of its devaluation. Arendt and Adorno both confronted the contradictions of an age in which the rights of the individual were elevated as a supreme value while individuality was subjected to the forces of technological and economic determination. Both understood the barbarism of their times in terms of the disintegration of mediations between freedom and determination. Both recognized the gulf that separates the concept of rights from the material interests, inequalities and prejudices concealed behind them. And both drew on the critical substance of natural right theory to distinguish between the critique of rights, which has as its end their revaluation, and the trashing of rights, which serves to reinforce their devaluation. I argue that there is much to be gained, in terms of our understanding both of rights and of critique, from critical theory's engagement with the natural law tradition.

T1  - Why does ingroup essentialism increase prejudice against minority members?
AN  - 1364702309; 201323253
AB  - A study with British participants (N = 90) tested a potential mediator of the effect of essentialist beliefs about the national ingroup on prejudice against immigrants. Essentialist beliefs were defined as beliefs in genetic determinism, a basic assumption that group membership is "written in the blood" and that the groups' boundaries and characteristics are determined by genetic and/or biological factors. Essentialist beliefs were expected to play an important role in the formation of prejudice. They were predicted to be associated with a reduction in the perceived possibility of immigrants' adopting the mainstream culture. Further, it was expected that essentialist beliefs would be positively associated with perceptions of intergroup threat, which in turn would be associated with a stronger demand for immigrants adopting the mainstream culture. Taken together, essentialist beliefs were predicted to be associated with a greater discrepancy between the demand for and perceived feasibility of culture adoption. This discrepancy was hypothesized to mediate the effect of essentialist beliefs on prejudice against immigrants. Structural equation modeling analysis and mediation analysis supported the hypotheses, showing that essentialism attributed to the national ingroup results in people demanding something seemingly impossible from immigrants, and that this situation in which immigrants have little chance of fulfilling majority members' expectations results in prejudice against them. Thus, results show that perceptions of the ingroup are associated with attitudes to the outgroup, and they outline an explanatory mechanism for the positive correlation between essentialism and prejudice which has been found in previous research. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Linguistic Description Moderates the Evaluations of Counterstereotypical People
AN  - 1494749235; 201401928
AB  - The present research investigated linguistic description as a moderator of biased evaluations of counterstereotypical individuals. Members of an online participant pool (N = 237) indicated their liking for stereotypical and counterstereotypical individuals who were described using adjectives or behaviors. There was a significant interaction between target typicality and linguistic description: People liked counterstereotypical individuals more than stereotypical individuals when target individuals were described using adjectives. In contrast, they showed no bias or a negative bias against counterstereotypical individuals who were described using behaviors. This interaction effect generalized across gender targets (men/women) and sexuality targets (gay/straight), and it was partially mediated by subjective processing fluency. Implications for the backlash effect and prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Completing the Implicit Association Test Reduces Positive Intergroup Interaction Behavior
AN  - 1364701252; 201323151
AB  - It is frequently suggested that increasing awareness of intergroup bias and limited control over biased responses can improve intergroup interaction behavior. Some uses of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) epitomize this approach to improving intergroup relations. However, if completing the IAT enhances caution and inhibition, reduces self-efficacy, or primes categorical thinking, the test may instead have negative effects. Two experiments demonstrated that when White individuals completed a race-relevant IAT prior to an intergroup interaction (as compared with when they did not), their interaction partner left the exchange feeling less positively regarded. No such effect was evident when White individuals completed a race-irrelevant IAT (Study 1) or an explicit prejudice measure (Study 2) before the exchange, or when their interaction partner was White (Study 1). Mediation analyses (Study 2) suggested that White participants who completed the IAT communicated less positive regard because they adopted a cautious approach to the interaction, limiting their self-disclosure.

T1  - Bright Minds and Dark Attitudes: Lower Cognitive Ability Predicts Greater Prejudice Through Right-Wing Ideology and Low Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1322721284; 201310693
AB  - Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations of prejudice. We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Collective narcissism and anti-Semitism in Poland
AN  - 1023028885; 201223683
AB  - Two studies examined the relationship between collective narcissism-an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the greatness of an in-group (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009) -- and anti-Semitism in Poland. The results indicate that this relationship is simultaneously mediated by (a) a belief that the in-group is constantly threatened by hostile intentions of other groups (Polish siege beliefs; Bar-Tal & Antebi, 1992a, 1992b) and (b) a belief that the Jews are a particularly threatening out-group because they secretly aim to dominate the world (the conspiracy stereotype of Jews; Bergmann, 2008; Kofta & Sdek, 2005). These results confirm that collective narcissism predicts prejudice against social groups perceived as threatening. Collective narcissists' sensitivity to intergroup threat is composed of beliefs about vulnerability of the in-group and hostility of the out-group.

T1  - Do you believe in atheists? Distrust is central to anti-atheist prejudice
AN  - 964187083; 201208910
AB  - Recent polls indicate that atheists are among the least liked people in areas with religious majorities (i.e., in most of the world). The sociofunctional approach to prejudice, combined with a cultural evolutionary theory of religion's effects on cooperation, suggest that anti-atheist prejudice is particularly motivated by distrust. Consistent with this theoretical framework, a broad sample of American adults revealed that distrust characterized anti-atheist prejudice but not anti-gay prejudice (Study 1). In subsequent studies, distrust of atheists generalized even to participants from more liberal, secular populations. A description of a criminally untrustworthy individual was seen as comparably representative of atheists and rapists but not representative of Christians, Muslims, Jewish people, feminists, or homosexuals (Studies 2-4). In addition, results were consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between belief in God and atheist distrust was fully mediated by the belief that people behave better if they feel that God is watching them (Study 4). In implicit measures, participants strongly associated atheists with distrust, and belief in God was more strongly associated with implicit distrust of atheists than with implicit dislike of atheists (Study 5). Finally, atheists were systematically socially excluded only in high-trust domains; belief in God, but not authoritarianism, predicted this discriminatory decision-making against atheists in high trust domains (Study 6). These 6 studies are the first to systematically explore the social psychological underpinnings of anti-atheist prejudice, and converge to indicate the centrality of distrust in this phenomenon.

T1  - Racial Group Membership Is Associated to Gaze-Mediated Orienting in Italy
AN  - 1309096430
AB  - Viewing a face with averted gaze results in a spatial shift of attention in the corresponding direction, a phenomenon defined as gaze-mediated orienting. In the present paper, we investigated whether this effect is influenced by social factors. Across three experiments, White and Black participants were presented with faces of White and Black individuals. A modified spatial cueing paradigm was used in which a peripheral target stimulus requiring a discrimination response was preceded by a noninformative gaze cue. Results showed that Black participants shifted attention to the averted gaze of both ingroup and outgroup faces, whereas White participants selectively shifted attention only in response to individuals of their same group. Interestingly, the modulatory effect of social factors was context-dependent and emerged only when group membership was situationally salient to participants. It was hypothesized that differences in the relative social status of the two groups might account for the observed asymmetry between White and Black participants. A final experiment ruled out an alternative explanation based on differences in perceptual familiarity with the face stimuli. Overall, these findings strengthen the idea that gaze-mediated orienting is a socially-connoted phenomenon.

T1  - Individuals' Beliefs about the Etiology of Same-Sex Sexual Orientation
AN  - 1023025411; 201223971
AB  - We examined the relationships between beliefs about the etiology of having a same-sex sexual orientation, sexual prejudice, and support for gay-relevant legislation using the justification-suppression model of prejudice as our theoretical foundation. Results indicated that more belief that a same-sex sexual orientation was due to nurture factors predicted less support for gay-relevant legislation, and that this relationship was mediated by levels of sexual prejudice. The opposite pattern was found for belief that a same-sex sexual orientation was due to nature factors. This suggests that beliefs about the etiology of sexual orientation may serve as justification (or suppression) factors in the expression of prejudice toward gay men and lesbians.

T1  - Categorization and Communication in the Face of Prejudice: When Describing Perceptions Changes What Is Perceived
AN  - 925714254; 201204087
AB  - In the face of prejudice against an ingroup, common ground for communication exists when people use similar social categories to understand the situation. Three studies tested the hypothesis that describing perceptions of prejudice can fundamentally change those perceptions because communicators account for the common ground in line with conversational norms. When women (Study 1), African Americans (Study 2), and Americans (Study 3) simply thought about suspected prejudice against their ingroup, categorization guided their perceptions: Participants assimilated their views of the prejudiced event toward the perceptions of ingroup members but contrasted away from the perceptions of outgroup members. Conversely, when participants described their perceptions, they contrasted away from the given category information and actually arrived at the opposite perceptions as those who merely thought about the prejudiced event. Study 3 identified an important qualification of these effects by showing that they were obtained only when participants could assume their audience was familiar with the common ground. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of communication in facilitating and inhibiting collective action about prejudice. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - ISLAMOPHOBIA: A PROJECTION OF THE WEST'S 'DARK SIDE'
AN  - 1448995280; 201344130
AB  - Humankind is more interconnected now than ever before. Some celebrate this shared humanity while too many others appear fixated more on their own ethnic group, nationality, or religion. In the personal view of the author, 'islamophobia' is an ungrounded fear of something/someone that does not exist in reality and which involves a psychological projection to create 'the other' as enemy. The focus of this spirited article is on the development of 'islamophobia' out of an earlier 'syndrome' of religio-political antagonism. It is seen by the author as spreading via the mass media 'like a virus'. He argues that this phenomenon is a psychological defence mechanism involving the projection of what he refers to as 'the West's dark side' onto Islam and its followers.

T1  - The power of talk: Developing discriminatory group norms through discussion
AN  - 896180241; 201120083
AB  - Research has shown that group discussion can increase intergroup prejudice and discrimination. However, we know little about the process by which discussion has this effect. Therefore, four studies were conducted in a real-world context to investigate this process. Results suggest that discussing a negative societal stereotype (relative to individual rumination in Studies 1 and 3 and alternative discussions in Studies 2 and 3) increases intentions to engage in discrimination against the out-group target of the stereotype. This is mediated by the formation of an in-group norm which supports discrimination (Study 1) and the extent to which the discussion validates the stereotype (Study 2). A fourth study manipulated the extent to which consensus on the negative stereotype was reached through discussion. When the discussion ended in consensus, participants have greater intention to undertake collective action against the stereotyped out-group, mediated by a congruent in-group norm. These results provide evidence that the process by which discussion increases intergroup discrimination is via the formation of discriminatory local group norms. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Enduring Pictures in Our Heads: The Continuance of Authoritarianism and Racial Stereotyping
AN  - 964198493; 201207413
AB  - This study highlights the importance of examining the influence of personality measures, specifically authoritarianism, on negative racial stereotyping, even in an era of alleged color blindness. The authors examine the relationship of various demographic variables and authoritarianism with negative racial stereotyping in a sample of White urban respondents. Current literature suggests that age, sex, marital status, religious identification, religious service attendance, education level, income, political affiliation, level of authoritarianism, and the demographic composition in an individual's local population all affect racial stereotyping. The evidence presented, using path analysis, suggests that some demographic characteristics influence the level of negative racial stereotyping. While the effects of most included demographic characteristics were statistically significant, others, which continually resurface in the literature, remained insignificant (such as the demographic composition of the respondent's area). The results of this study challenge the loss of traditional prejudice with color blindness and point to the importance of authoritarianism as a mediating factor in negative racial stereotyping. The authors conclude the greatest indicators of negative racial stereotyping included in this study are authoritarianism, education, and income, while many other demographics-such as marital status, religious identification and attendance, and political affiliation-have indirect influences through authoritarianism.

T1  - Opening Closed Minds: The Combined Effects of Intergroup Contact and Need for Closure on Prejudice
AN  - 1928275908
AB  - Five studies tested whether need for closure (NFC) moderates the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice toward immigrants. The results consistently showed that intergroup contact was more strongly associated with reduced levels of prejudice among people high in NFC compared to people low in NFC. Studies 1 (N = 138 students) and 2 (N = 294 adults) demonstrated this moderator effect on subtle, modern, and blatant racism. Study 2 also replicated the moderator effect for extended contact. An experimental field study (Study 3; N = 60 students) provided evidence of the causal direction of the moderator effect. Finally, Studies 4 (N = 125 students) and 5 (N = 135 adults) identified intergroup anxiety as the mediator through which the moderator effect influences modern and blatant racism as well as hostile tendencies toward immigrants. The role of motivated cognition in the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice is discussed.

T1  - Two degrees of separation: A longitudinal study of actual and perceived extended international contact
AN  - 902083838; 201122122
AB  - Extended contact theory proposes that knowledge of ingroup-outgroup friendships leads to reductions of intergroup bias by reducing ignorance about the outgroup and intergroup anxiety, and by increasing awareness of positive outgroup exemplars (e.g., observation of friendly behavior towards an ingroup member), and inclusion of other in the self. Over a one-year period we examined extended contact among home country friends of international students who had direct contact with British people through their study period in Britain. This provides a stringent test of extended contact theory, both due to the longitudinal design, and the inclusion of both actual and perceived naturally arising extended contact. As predicted by extended contact theory, increases in extended contact over time predicted all variables but intergroup anxiety. There was also some evidence for (weaker) reversed causal influence between prejudice and other variables. Importantly, the quality of contact experienced by the direct contact sample (international students) predicted all dependent measures in the matched extended contact sample in their home countries. Results are discussed in terms of the promise of extended contact theory for intergroup relations. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Social dominance-based threat reactions to immigrants in need of assistance
AN  - 881468842; 201116313
AB  - The present investigation examined how individuals higher in social dominance orientation (SDO) react to experimentally induced intergroup threat in terms of support for helping immigrants. Participants read editorials describing an incoming immigrant outgroup posing realistic threats (to tangible resources and well-being), symbolic threats (to values and traditions) or no threats. Participants higher in SDO exhibited greater resistance to helping immigrants upon exposure to realistic, symbolic, (Experiments 1 and 2), or combined realistic-symbolic (Experiment 2) intergroup threats, but not when the same immigrants posed no threats. In Experiment 2, SDO exerted indirect effects on modern prejudice through both heightened infra-humanization and intergroup anxiety, with modern prejudice itself predicting greater resistance and indifference to helping immigrants. Moderated mediation analyses revealed strongest SDO-infra-humanization relations under conditions of symbolic threat. Implications for prejudice-reduction interventions are considered.

T1  - From Prejudice to Discrimination: The Legitimizing Role of Perceived Threat in Discrimination against Immigrants
AN  - 856403328; 201106809
AB  - This research analyses the mediational role of threat perception in the relationship between prejudice and discrimination (opposition to immigration and opposition to naturalization of immigrants). In the first study, using representative samples in 21 European countries (N=36566) from European Social Survey (2002), we showed that the relationship between prejudice and opposition to immigration was more strongly mediated by realistic than by symbolic threat perceptions. In Study 2, using representative samples in two countries with different traditions of immigration (Switzerland, N=940; Portugal, N=1514), we showed that realistic threat more strongly mediated the relationship between prejudice and opposition to immigration, while only symbolic threat perception mediated the link between prejudice and opposition to naturalization. The theoretical implications of considering threat perceptions as factors that legitimize discrimination are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The Role of Social Cognition in the Religious Fundamentalism-Prejudice Relationship
AN  - 835113666; 201101399
AB  - The study examines the indirect effects of religious fundamentalism on prejudice through cognitive style and fear of invalidity. Undergraduates (n= 199) completed measures of religious fundamentalism, homophobia, modern racism, hostile and benevolent sexism, need for cognition, need for structure, preference for consistency, and fear of invalidity. Need for cognition partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and benevolent sexism. Preference for consistency partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and hostile sexism. The indirect effect of religious fundamentalism on modern racism through preference for consistency approached statistical significance. The interaction between need for structure and fear of invalidity partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and hostile sexism, with individuals high in need for structure and low in fear of invalidity having higher religious fundamentalism and prejudice.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 1883033939
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis.

T1  - Intergroup contact and the projection of positivity
AN  - 822522022; 201072903
AB  - Three studies investigated whether intergroup contact reduces prejudice, in part, via the extension of positive attributes that define the self to the outgroup. Study 1 found that positive intergroup contact predicted self-outgroup overlap, and this overlap mediated the contact-attitude relationship. This mediational path was specific to outgroup, but not ingroup, attitudes. In Study 2 we found that it was the attribution of specifically positive, as opposed to negative, traits that mediated the contact-attitude relationship in a model that also included intergroup anxiety. In Study 3 an elaborated model was supported, in which perceived self-other similarity mediated the effects of positive contact on the attribution of positive self-traits. We discuss the findings in the context of recent advances in Intergroup Contact Theory. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The Role of National Identity Representation in the Relation between In-Group Identification and Out-Group Derogation: Ethnic versus Civic Representation
AN  - 754040739; 201049632
AB  - Two studies investigated whether the content of in-group identity affects the relation between in-group identification and ethnic prejudice. The first study among university students, tested whether national identity representations (i.e., ethnic vs. civic) moderate or mediate the relation between Flemish in-group identification and ethnic prejudice. A moderation hypothesis is supported when those higher in identification who subscribe to a more ethnic representation display higher ethnic prejudice levels than those higher in identification who subscribe to a more civic representation. A mediation hypothesis is supported when those higher in identification tend towards one specific representation, which in turn, should predict ethnic prejudice. Results supported a mediation hypothesis and showed that the more respondents identified with the Flemish in-group, the more ethnic their identity representation, and the more they were inclined to display ethnic prejudice. The second study tested this mediation from a longitudinal perspective in a two-wave study among high school students. In-group identification at Time 1 predicted over-time changes in identity representation, which in turn, predicted changes in ethnic prejudice. In addition to this, changes in identity representation were predicted by initial ethnic prejudice levels. The implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - But I'm No Bigot: How Prejudiced White Americans Maintain Unprejudiced Self-Images
AN  - 1866473421
AB  - Four experiments investigate a modern paradox: White Americans harbor racial prejudice, but view themselves as unprejudiced. We hypothesized that social representations of prejudice available in American culture lead many Whites to conclude that they are relatively unprejudiced. In Experiment 1, participants primed with the bigot stereotype viewed themselves as less prejudiced. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants exposed to media representations of racists viewed themselves as less prejudiced. In Experiment 4, participants sought exposure to media representations of prejudice after a threat to their unprejudiced self-image. These experiments suggest that representations of prejudice in American culture lead prejudiced individuals to view themselves as unprejudiced, and the effect of these representations on people's unprejudiced self-images can be passive or intentional.

T1  - The Changing Face of Racial Discrimination: Hispanics as the Dominant Minority in the USA - a New Application of Power-Threat Theory
AN  - 1928744558
AB  - According to Hubert Blalock's 1967 power-threat theory, the larger the minority group's size the greater the threat to the majority group. Most of Blalock's examples, and much of the subsequent empirical investigation into the power-threat thesis, focus on Anglo and African American relations. Changing demographics will likely alter existing majority-minority relations as Hispanics displace African Americans as the largest minority. This will change the face of racial discrimination in the country. Indeed, this paper suggests that the animosity toward Latinos by both the majority white and minority black populations may be more intense than those shaping contemporary white-black relations. Two key lifestyle features that have not contaminated black-white relations may exacerbate hostility toward Hispanics: their perceived illegal status in the country, and the perception that Hispanics resist learning English. The role of the media in perpetuating these stereotypes and inflaming hostility toward Latinos is also discussed.

T1  - Do the "Savage Origins" of Tattoos Cast a Prejudicial Shadow on Contemporary Tattooed Individuals?
AN  - 1866473490
AB  - We investigated whether increases in tattooing rates and designs have eradicated or altered traditional delinquent tattooing stereotypes. We tested the perceived suitability of tattooed and non-tattooed individuals for 2 different jobs. Affective evaluations mediated judgments of job suitability, with those displaying traditional tattoos being rated as less suitable for employment than those who were not tattooed and those displaying contemporary tattoos. Those with a contemporary tattoo were judged in the same manner as those who were not tattooed (even by observers who neither had a tattoo nor were considering getting one). These results suggest that the savage associations of tattooing continue for some, but suggest that for other tattoo enthusiasts, a new stereotype has emerged reflecting a shift toward respectability.
