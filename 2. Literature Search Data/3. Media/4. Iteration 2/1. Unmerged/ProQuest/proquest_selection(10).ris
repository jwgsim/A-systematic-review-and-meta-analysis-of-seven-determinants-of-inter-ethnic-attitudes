T1  - An Implausible Virtual Interview: Conversations with a Professional Research Subject
AN  - 2696577375
AB  - The author explores interactions with one research subject who feigns credentials and invents stories in order to participate in social science research interviews online. The possibility of intentional deception among interviewees in virtually mediated fieldwork is a critical consideration in the context of the recent extensive pivot to online-based fieldwork during the need for social distancing associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Following this rapid shift in what is generally accepted as the “gold standard” for social science research interviews, widespread use of online-based interviewing methods will likely endure as equivalent to in-person methods. A methodological case study with implications for virtually mediated fieldwork, this article highlights some of the advantages and disadvantages of virtually mediated interviews and provides practical suggestions.

T1  - Two-Sided Messages Promote Openness for Morally Based Attitudes
AN  - 2682182219
AB  - This research demonstrates that two- versus one-sided counterattitudinal messages can encourage people with a strong moral basis for their attitudes to be more open to contrary positions. Studies 1A/B demonstrated that the interaction between moral basis and message sidedness was present not just for a controversial issue with balanced views in society but also for a topic with a majority opinion. In Study 2, the relative effectiveness of two- over one-sided messages for people with a moral attitude basis was shown to occur only when the two-sided message respectfully acknowledged the recipient’s side. In Study 3, the effect was replicated in a preregistered experiment. Furthermore, moral bases provided unique predictive power beyond alternative attitude strength indicators. Across all studies, perceived appreciation of the speaker acknowledging the recipient’s view mediated the impact of the independent variables on openness.

T1  - The Enigma of an Emerging Pink Economy in China: Pain Points, Entrepreneurial Opportunities, and Organizational Legitimacy
AN  - 2671974543
AB  - This article examines why an aboveground pink economy has emerged in mainland China, where equal rights for gay people are repressed and public attitudes toward homosexuality are overwhelmingly negative. Drawing on interviews, supplemented with a minimal amount of media data, this article demonstrates that in China there was a group of gay people wishing to fulfill needs mainstream businesses disregard and that such consumer needs necessitate China’s pink sector. More importantly, the state set the stage for the nascent sector to emerge: Government policies triggered a surge in funding resources and technology infrastructure upgrades that laid the material foundations for pink entrepreneurship. Despite being born in an institutional void, pink ventures employed legitimizing strategies to hedge against risk and uncertainty, thereby consolidating this new market. China’s pink economy developed independently of the influence of the gay movement and even expanded, as never before, at the low ebb of the movement. This research gives credence to the notion that an aboveground pink economy could precede political rights but, unlike American scholarship, questions a similar causal relationship between the two in the Chinese context.

T1  - Sociocultural Determinants of Attitudes Toward Domestic Violence Among Women and Men in Afghanistan: Evidence from Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015
AN  - 2670002104
AB  - Domestic violence (DV), also commonly referred to as intimate partner violence or spousal abuse, is a global public health issue that affects the physical, psychological, sexual, and reproductive health of women. We examined the sociocultural factors associated with the attitude toward DV perpetrated against women in Afghanistan. We used data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey, consisting of an ever-married sample of 29,461 women and 10,760 men aged 15 to 49 years. Our dependent variable, attitude toward DV, was determined from responses on acceptance of wife-beating in five scenarios, and the group of socio cultural factors was selected based on evidence from previous studies. Our main analytical method was logistic regression, using the survey design. Our findings indicated that factors such as an increase in years of education and living in a wealthier household reduce the likelihood of acceptance of DV among men and women. Ethnicity was also associated with the attitude toward DV, but the magnitude varied across ethnic groups and gender. Furthermore, an increase in age and living in the urban area were associated with nonjustification of DV among women, but not among men. On the other hand, frequent exposure to the media increases the likelihood of acceptance of DV among men, but not for women. The result of the present study suggests that there are economic, social, and cultural aspects to the attitude toward DV among men and women in Afghanistan. Therefore, policies designed at changing the socio cultural perception of the people are of importance in other to bring about a change in attitude, and even combat the prevalence of DV.

T1  - Adoption of AI-driven personalization in digital news platforms: An integrative model of technology acceptance and perceived contingency
AN  - 2692277006
AB  - This research demonstrates the usefulness of the integrative model of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the perceived contingency model in predicting the users' adoption of AI-driven personalization in digital news platforms. We conducted an online survey with 1369 US adults randomly drawn from the national panel of Qualtrics. The results show that perceived contingency plays a crucial role in predicting the adoption of AI-powered news platforms, showing a significant direct effect and an indirect effect mediated by enhanced user engagement experience and positive attitude. Furthermore, the TAM variables are still important in predicting adoption behavior.

T1  - Does Religiosity Influence Retention Strategies in Nonprofit Organizations?
AN  - 2663833236
AB  - Despite the rise of interest in nonprofit organizations’ (NPOs) retention strategies and organizational behaviour micro-mechanisms, little research has specifically addressed volunteers’ religiosity and attitude towards the organization, and their links to motivation and intention to stay with NPOs. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of religiosity as an antecedent of volunteers’ intention to stay with the organization, and the mediating role of both volunteers’ motivation and attitude towards the organization in such a relationship. Building on motivational functions theory and the theory of planned behaviour, a conceptual model is proposed and empirically tested using bootstrapped multiple mediation analysis on a sample of 379 volunteers of NPOs located in Italy. The results support the role of religiosity as a significant predictor of volunteer intentions, and the mediating role of motivation and attitude on this relationship. Volunteers who are driven by their religious values are likely to develop a stronger motivation to volunteering and a positive attitude towards NPOs’ activities, and consequently a stronger willingness to stay with the organization. The study contributes to the literature on NPOs by stressing the role of antecedents and underlying mechanisms affecting volunteers’ motivation and, in turn, their intention to stay with the organization.

T1  - Who respects the will of the people? Support for democracy is linked to high secure national identity but low national narcissism
AN  - 2646666131
AB  - Support for democracy is based on warmth, inclusiveness, and a general belief that others are well‐intentioned. It is also related to a willingness to respect the rights of outgroups which do not necessarily share the views of one’s ingroup. In this research, we analysed the relationships between different types of national identity and support for democracy. In two surveys (Study 1; American participants, n = 407 and Study 2; Polish participants; n = 570), we found that support for democracy was negatively linked to collective narcissism, measured in relation to the national group, previously associated with negative intra‐ and inter‐group outcomes. The effect of national narcissism on democracy support was present even when accounting for national identification. In Study 2, we also found that this effect was mediated by social cynicism – a negative view of human nature. In both studies, support for democracy was positively linked to a secure national identity, that is national identification without the narcissistic component, which tends to be associated with positive attitudes towards others. We discuss implications for understanding the role of national identity in support for (il)liberal politics.

T1  - Religion, Punitive Sentiment, and the Mediating Effect of Racial Resentment
AN  - 2637648709
AB  - A “tough on crime” attitude has dominated criminal justice policy and practice in the United States since the 1970s. In an effort to understand this rise in punitiveness, scholars have identified racial attitudes and religion as significant predictors of punitive sentiment. However, little or no extant research has examined the potential mediating effect of racial resentment on the relationship between religion and punitive attitudes. Using data from the 2017 Kids’ Wellbeing Survey, ordinal and logistic regressions are employed to measure the relationships between religion, racial resentment, and punitive attitudes toward youth criminals. Findings indicate that the effects of religion, particularly Mainline Protestant, Evangelical, and Catholic affiliation, on punitive attitudes toward criminally involved youth is mediated by racial resentment. This suggests that racial resentment plays a significant role in understanding the relationship between religion and punitive sentiments.

T1  - Verification of ingroup morality promotes willingness to participate in collective action for immigrants’ rights: GPIR
AN  - 2621963699
AB  - Three experiments tested whether verification of ingroup morality increases engagement in collective action in favor of immigrants’ rights. To that end, participants were exposed to (a) verifying, (b) negatively discrepant, (c) enhancing, or (d) no feedback about the morality of their group in general (Studies 1–2) or specifically in matters of corruption (Study 3). Results show that those who received verifying feedback of their group’s morality were more willing to engage in collective action than those who received negative or no feedback. These effects seemed to be mediated by increased anger over immigrants’ disadvantage and positive attitudes towards them. Critically, enhancing feedback exerted similar effects as verifying feedback, although the latter yielded more stable and consistent results across the studies. These results suggest that appeals to collective ingroup morality can be effective to promote immigrants’ rights, especially when members of the host society feel that others consider them as moral as they perceive themselves.

T1  - Understanding the appeal of libertarianism: Gender and race differences in the endorsement of libertarian principles
AN  - 2614034732
AB  - There is a stereotype of libertarians being young, college educated, white men and that the Libertarian Party lacks appeal among women and individuals of color. There is a great deal of research investigating gender differences in public opinion on a number of issues including the provision of government resources and government spending (Barnes and Cassese; Howell and Day). Nevertheless, there is no work specifically investigating why women and nonwhites do not find libertarianism appealing. We test several hypotheses using 2016 American National Election Study data and 2013 PRRI data. We find a sizeable and significant gender gap and race gap in support for libertarian principles. We investigate several explanations for these gaps finding moderate support for self‐interest, racial attitudes, and egalitarianism as reasons for women and African Americans being less supportive of Libertarian Principles. We believe that the modest success of and media attention garnered by Ron Paul and Rand Paul in recent years along with the success of the Libertarian Party presidential ticket in 2016 highlights the need to understand who is drawn to libertarianism and why.1

T1  - Does classroom diversity improve intergroup relations? Short- and long-term effects of classroom diversity for cross-ethnic friendships and anti-immigrant attitudes in adolescence: GPIR
AN  - 2609041784
AB  - This study examined short- and long-term effects of ethnic classroom diversity for intergroup relations in adolescence. Using a five-year panel of Swedish majority youth (MageT1 = 13.40, MageT5 = 17.30), we found only limited direct effects of classroom diversity on anti-immigrant attitudes. However, classroom diversity increased the likelihood of cross-ethnic friendships, which in turn was associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes. Moreover, we found that the effect of classroom diversity on friendships remained also after adolescents transitioned to new schools. The findings highlight the importance of longitudinal analyses and contribute to a deeper understanding of how intergroup relations develop during adolescence. It brings new insights related to the longevity of classroom effects and to cross-ethnic friendships’ ability to mediate the diversity–attitudes relationship.

T1  - Adolescent outgroup helping, collective action, and political activism in a setting of protracted conflict
AN  - 2621585202
AB  - This article examines the role of empathy for outgroup helping, collective action and political activism among youth in Northern Ireland, a setting of protracted conflict. Integrating the Empathy-Attitudes-Action model with the Developmental Peacebuilding Model, a two-wave study was conducted to assess youth's behavioural intentions and actual behaviours toward refugees. Across two waves (N = 383, 52 % male, 48 % female; 14−16 years old), empathy at Time 1 predicted more positive attitudes toward ethnic minorities at Time 2, which in turn was positively related to four outcomes aiming to foster prosocial change for refugees: helping behaviour and realistic helping at the interpersonal level, collective action intentions at the structural level, and signing a petition aiming for cultural change. That is, outgroup attitudes mediated the link from empathy to three types of prosocial action toward refugees. The findings suggest that youth not only volunteer to help an individual outgroup member, but also support broader structural and cultural change that will benefit those they may never meet. Implications for recognising and supporting the constructive agency of youth toward disadvantaged groups in conflict settings are discussed.

T1  - Mind The Gap! The Role of Political Identity and Attitudes in the Emergence of Belief Gaps
AN  - 2631532080
AB  - To more fully understand the belief gap hypothesis, this study examines the effect of political identity, education, and partisan media consumption on the formation of attitudes and false beliefs. Using a two-wave, nationally representative online survey of the U.S., we assess people’s attitudes and beliefs toward climate change, on the one hand, and Syrian refugees, on the other. Building on previous studies, we demonstrate that the effect of one’s political identity on attitudes and false beliefs is contingent upon education, which appears to widen the belief gap in consort with political identity.

T1  - Hiding in plain sight: Dehumanization as a foundation of white racial prejudice
AN  - 2568873131
AB  - In the media, during sporting events, in online forums, and in interpersonal interactions, whites often portray Black people as animals, especially as apes or monkeys. In this essay we consider what contemporary research on prejudice in American politics has to say about these dehumanizing portrayals of Black people. We argue that contemporary political science work has not done enough to understand both the historical roots and the continuing practices of whites' dehumanization of Black people, to the detriment of an accurate understanding of racial attitudes in the United States. To rectify this omission, we draw on the work of historians to map out a brief overview of race‐making and the dehumanizing attitudes that shaped this process. Then, we review political science literature on contemporary white attitudes toward Black people, emphasizing connections between prevailing conceptions of these attitudes and long‐standing processes of dehumanization. We conclude by charting directions for future scholarship; we seek to unsettle the mainstream of a subfield dominated by mild conceptions of racial attitudes.

T1  - Representation of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Swedish News Media: A Discourse Analysis
AN  - 2545944965
AB  - Despite being rated as some of the world’s most gender equal countries, Sweden and neighboring Nordic nations show high rates of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). As the news media contribute to the shaping of public attitudes, this article pursues a two-step discourse analysis of how IPVAW was represented in seven Swedish newspapers during 2018. Although an individualistic discourse on IPVAW was found to be most prevalent, articles where perpetrators were presented as non-Swedish more frequently contained a structural framing of IPVAW. This confirms previously noted tendencies toward individualization and othering of IPVAW in Sweden.

AN  - 2540700074
AB  - In this article we explore preliminary findings from the study COVIDSafe and Beyond: Perceptions and Practices conducted in Australia in 2020. The study involved a survey followed by interviews, and aimed to capture the dynamic ways in which members of the Australian public perceive the impact of Covid practices – especially public health measures like the introduction of physical and social distancing, compulsory mask wearing, and contact tracing. In the rescripting of public space, different notions of formal and informal surveillance, along with different textures of mediated and social care, appeared. In this article, we explore perceptions around divergent forms of surveillance across social, technological, governmental modes, and the relationship of surveillance to care in our media and cultural practices. What does it mean to care for self and others during a pandemic? How does care get enacted in, and through, media interfaces and public interaction?

T1  - Attitude and fear regarding death in older adult people
TT  - Actitud y miedo con respecto a la muerte en adultos mayores
AN  - 2532208702
AB  - Death has often been considered a taboo subject in many societies over time. Over the years, our Western culture in Spain has set aside the issue of death through its avoidance or even denial, removing it little by little from our environment, avoiding it as an evil that threatens us. In the same way, we currently see how the quality of life increases along with a higher life expectancy at around 80. Through this article we intend to reflect about attitudes towards death in older adult people, both at group and individual level. To a qualitative methodological design was selected using an information collecting technique, and a semi-structured and in-depth interview to look into the life story of the older adult. The survey consisted of interviews with 30 individuals from the city of Granada (Spain) aged 65 to 85. The results indicated a positive attitude to death of oneself but not so much to the death of others, expressing the fear or the anxiety towards the finiteness of a loved one. The main conclusion is the need for creating educational spaces aimed at adults, to be able to treat these negative attitudes and reinforce the positive ones through the development of pedagogy and education regarding death.Alternate abstract:La muerte ha solido ser considerada a lo largo del tiempo como un tema tabú en múltiples sociedades. A lo largo de los años, nuestra cultura occidental en España ha apartado el tema de la muerte a través de su evitación o incluso negación, retirándola poco a poco de nuestro entorno, evitándola como un mal que nos amenaza. Del mismo modo, actualmente vemos cómo la calidad de vida aumenta junto con una mayor esperanza de vida situándose en torno a los 80. A través de este artículo, nos proponemos reflexionar sobre las actitudes hacia la muerte en las personas mayores, tanto a nivel grupal como individual. En este artículo se desarrolló un diseño metodológico cualitativo mediante la utilización de la entrevista semiestructurada y en profundidad como medio de recogida de información. La muestra está formada por 30 personas de la ciudad de Granada (España) de 65 a 85 años. Los resultados indicaron una actitud positiva hacia la muerte de uno mismo, pero no tanto hasta la muerte de otros, expresando el miedo o la ansiedad hacia la finitud de un ser querido. La principal conclusión muestra la necesidad de crear espacios educativos dirigidos a mayores, para poder tratar estas actitudes negativas y reforzar las positivas a través del desarrollo de la pedagogía y la educación con respecto a la muerte.

T1  - Supporting the Message, Not the Messenger: The Correlates of Attitudes towards Black Lives Matter
AN  - 2503359053
AB  - Since the Black Lives Matter movement’s rise to prominence, there has been significant opposition from both media and political figures who believe that the movement is promoting a “war on cops.” Because there is no evidence to support this claim, the current study examines the basis for negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter using a sample of over 500 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university. The findings indicate that the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter are being white and holding symbolically racist attitudes. Perceiving the police to be equivalent to soldiers in a war on crime, perceiving police misconduct to be less common, and holding a conservative crime ideology are also significant in the model.

T1  - Gratitude as a Mediator of the Effects of Savoring on Positive Adjustment to Aging
AN  - 2491858838
AB  - We extended the previous experimental work with older adults by testing mediating variables through which savoring valuable “life lessons” improves attitudes toward aging and boosts well-being. A sample of 202 adults aged 65 or older were randomly assigned to either an experimental condition (in which they reflected on important lessons life had taught them) or a control condition (in which they reflected on their typical morning routine). Contemplating life lessons increased feelings of gratitude, which in turn boosted positive attitudes toward aging, life satisfaction, state hope, and state self-esteem. Additional analyses supported a three-path mediational model, in which reflecting on life lessons increased levels of savoring, which led to greater gratitude, which in turn predicted stronger positive attitudes toward aging, life satisfaction, and hope. We discuss implications of these findings for future research on savoring interventions for older adults and suggest future directions designed to advance understanding of these experimental effects.

T1  - Media portrayals of Muslims: a comparative sentiment analysis of American newspapers, 1996–2015
AN  - 2571102579
AB  - Are Muslims portrayed more negatively than other religious groups? If so, what factors are associated with this negativity? We apply computer-assisted, lexicon-based coding to over 850,000 articles that mention Muslims, Hindus, Jews, or Catholics in 17 national and regional US newspapers over the 20-year period of 1996–2015 and compare them to a representative baseline of articles. We show that the average tone of articles about Muslims is considerably more negative than both this baseline and compared to articles about the other groups. The negative tone is most strongly associated with stories about extremism and events in foreign settings. However, even controlling for a wide range of factors does not eliminate the negativity in stories mentioning Muslims. We discuss the implications of these findings for media objectivity and for public attitudes and policy preferences with respect to Muslims and other social groups.

T1  - Education in the Context of Digitalization and Culture: Evolution of the Teacher's Role, Pre-pandemic Overview
AN  - 2537718510
AB  - This study was conducted before the outbreak of the pandemic and now the results seem clear. The intensive forced use of distance technologies in the educational process has changed the approach to education forever. What exactly has changed? this is already a topic for new research. We suggest going back a little and see how the role of the teacher changed as the use of digital technologies intensified before the pandemic. This article analyzes the studies devoted to teachers' experiences in interacting with digital environments, and reviews digital learning systems, environments, and tools. The study found that there are many opportunities, applications, and automated digital environments in the world, but none of them can, to a greater or lesser extent, do without a supervisor, or a teacher. In addition, the paper found that, despite the diversity of digital learning tools, that issues existed related to using such tools by teachers due to the lack of adequate digital competence or even because some teachers tend to have a negative attitude towards this new concept of education. Therefore, sufficient conditions and opportunities should be created for teachers to obtain the required digital competence and to explore the culture of digital technology in education and learning environments to succeed in the subsequent integration of digital technology into the field of education.

TT  - Ciberostracismo: Consecuencias emocionales y conductuales en las interacciones en redes sociales
AN  - 2508650007
AB  - This study focuses on the effect of cyberostracism on social networking sites. Based on the temporal need-threat model of ostracism, we examined a) reflexive reactions, specifically worsened mood and threats to the four fundamental needs (i.e., belongingness, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control), and b) reflective reactions, in the form of prosocial, antisocial, and avoidance behavior. We also focused on the role of social anxiety. Using the experimental tool Ostracism Online, we conducted an online experiment to manipulate ostracism, measure self-reported reflexive reactions, and measure reflective reactions in a newly developed cooperative financial game. The participants were 196 young Czech adults (age 18-30; 62% women). Ttests showed worsened mood and higher threat connected to all four of the fundamental needs in the reflexive stage in ostracized participants. Regression models showed that social anxiety had a small effect on reflexive reactions, but it did not moderate the effect of ostracism. The type of threatened need and social anxiety did not predict a reflective reaction. The only significant predictor of antisocial response was experienced ostracism. Even a mild form of ostracism such as the lack of reactions by strangers to a shared post can lead to negative emotional and behavioral consequences.Alternate abstract:Este estudio se centra en el efecto del ostracismo cibernético en los sitios de redes sociales. Sobre la base de un modelo de necesidad temporal-amenaza del ostracismo, analizamos el efecto en reacciones reflexivas, específicamente el empeoramiento del ánimo y amenaza a cuatro necesidades fundamentales (sentido de pertenencia, autoestima, existencia con sentido y control), y la reacción reflexiva en forma de comportamiento prosocial, antisocial o evasivo. También nos concentramos en el papel que desempeña la ansiedad social. Mediante el uso de la herramienta experimental Ostracism Online (Ostracismo en línea), realizamos un experimento en línea en el que se manipuló el ostracismo, se midieron las reacciones reflexivas autoinformadas en un juego financiero cooperativo recientemente desarrollado. Los participantes fueron 196 adultos jóvenes checos (de 18 a 30 años; 62% mujeres). Ttests demostraron empeoramiento del ánimo y amenaza más alta en las cuatro necesidades fundamentales en la etapa reflexiva de los participantes ostracidos. Los modelos de regresión mostraron que la ansiedad social tenía poco efecto en las reacciones reflexivas, pero no moderaba el efecto del ostracismo. El tipo de necesidad amenazada y ansiedad social no predijo la reacción reflexiva; el único indicador significativo de la respuesta antisocial fue el ostracismo experimentado. Incluso una forma leve de ostracismo en forma de falta de reacciones por parte de extraños a la publicación compartida puede dar lugar a consecuencias emocionales y conductuales negativas.

T1  - Belonging, believing, behaving, and Brexit: Channels of religiosity and religious identity in support for leaving the European Union
AN  - 2469561167
AB  - Having an Anglican affiliation is known to be associated with support for leaving the European Union (EU) in Britain. Religiosity, conceived as strength of religious attachment, has received comparatively little treatment. We investigate religiosity via electoral, household, and attitudinal surveys, distinguishing the effects of “behaving” and “believing.” The association between religiosity and EU Referendum vote choice and position is identified before and after inclusion of values, attitudinal, and civic engagement measures. Consistent with established findings, in socio‐structural models Anglicans are more likely to support Brexit than religious Nones. More frequent church attendance is associated with being more pro‐Remain. The Anglican effect is primarily mediated by anti‐immigrant attitudes, authoritarianism, and salience of ethnic identity, suggesting a Christian nationalist aspect to Leave support. The attendance effect is mediated by warmer attitudes toward immigrants, and social capital. Notably, those exhibiting stronger orthodox belief tend to feature a stronger attachment to “Leave,” with this partly mediated by authoritarianism. To evaluate the net effect of religion on civic life, we should pay more attention to the cultural content of religious beliefs, and how they structure other values and attitudes.

T1  - Social media and moral panics: Assessing the effects of technological change on societal reaction
AN  - 2457917598
AB  - Answering calls for deeper consideration of the relationship between moral panics and emergent media systems, this exploratory article assesses the effects of social media – web-based venues that enable and encourage the production and exchange of user-generated content. Contra claims of their empowering and deflationary consequences, it finds that, on balance, recent technological transformations unleash and intensify collective alarm. Whether generating fear about social change, sharpening social distance, or offering new opportunities for vilifying outsiders, distorting communications, manipulating public opinion, and mobilizing embittered individuals, digital platforms and communications constitute significant targets, facilitators, and instruments of panic production. The conceptual implications of these findings are considered.

T1  - Two Hate Notes: Deportations, COVID-19, and Xenophobia against Hmong Americans in the Midwest
AN  - 2465813491
AB  - In the following days, I discussed the deportation negotiations with Laos at length in my course, "Hmong American Experiences in the U.S." My students were furious about the larger American public's ahistorical, inaccurate, and misguided readings regarding the Hmong presence in the United States as forcibly displaced political refugees who fought as proxy soldiers for the Central Intelligence Agency's secret war in Laos in the 1960s and 1970s.

In these times, we are creating family and community models of care and security for our complex family structure that reject the impulses of individualism and neoliberal self-care management.2 In another instance of community care, the Hmong Medical Association created videos in the Hmong language to educate elders about the COVID pandemic and the social distancing mandates of the state while collaborating with a Hmong American tailor shop, City Tailor, to hand-sew and distribute over eight hundred protective masks to elder care centers and community clinics across the Twin Cities metropolitan area.

In a world where hegemonic structures of knowledge around health and disease prevention preclude refugee and immigrant communities of color from accessing life-saving medical knowledge and social care, Hmong Americans are enacting forms of radical care that uplifts and ensures the collective survival.3 Second, there needs to be conjoined intellectual and activist efforts to situate racism both within the physical violence of everyday culture and within public policies in order to facilitate comparative and intersectional organizing.

In the weeks in which the media comprehensively covered the deportation negotiations against Hmong in the United States, activists from Freedom Inc. organized to set up legal clinics for those affected by unjust deportations, just as they have for issues such as domestic violence.

[...]the inhumanity of family separation within deportations is directly relational to the strict social distancing mandates that were implemented in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in that both scenarios work, explicitly or implicitly, to alienate marginalized communities.

T1  - MIGRANT YOUTH PUSH BACK. VIRTUAL FRIENDSHIPS AND EVERYDAY RESISTANCE IN THE DIGITAL SPHERE
TT  - JOVENS MIGRANTES EMPURRAM PARA TRÁS. AMIZADES VIRTUAIS E RESISTÊNCIA COTIDIANA NA ESFERA DIGITAL
AN  - 2497046951
AB  - Resistance has proven to be a hard concept to define. Debates about resistance in the sociological and sociolinguistic literature cover many aspects: from the degree to which resistance can be seen as related to established social groups (see Rampton 1996), to the level of agentivity and intention that is required for an action to be regarded as resistant, to the type of social behavior that qualifies. Thus, while some see resistance as based on actions, others see it as based on cultural appropriation (Hall & Jefferson 1976). In their comprehensive review of literature on the topic, Hollander & Einwohner (2004) conclude that resistance can be seen as consisting of action and opposition. In this paper, I analyze resistance from the point of view of opposition to ideas, social situations, institutional actions and processes that result or may result in discrimination or stereotyping of specific social groups, as negotiated in the digital sphere by migrant and non-migrant youth belonging to a school-based community. Indeed, it has been argued (Chiluwa 2012, Chibuwe & Ureke 2016) that digital environments constitute ideal arenas for the development of resistance thanks to their wide reach and their ability to mobilize people around common themes. However, much of the research in this area has targeted organized resistance fueled by political or ethnic groups. In this paper I argue that resistance is an emerging process that does not necessarily stem within political contexts or from open choice, but can develop within interactional exchanges focused on everyday life events. Thus, what I am interested in here is in how spontaneous acts and discourses of resistance emerge in the everyday exchanges of a diverse community that was not born around a particular social or political agenda. For this paper, I will examine exchanges that happen on the Facebook page of one of the members of the community. I will show how resistance takes many forms: from irony and jokes to the raising of serious topics, to the dissemination of information and through different discourse genres: from storytelling to the posting of pictures.Alternate abstract:A resistência provou ser um conceito difícil de definir. Debates sobre resistência na literatura sociológica e sociolinguística abrangem muitos aspectos: desde o grau em que a resistência possa ser vista como relacionada a grupos sociais estabelecidos (ver Rampton 1996), até o nível de agentatividade e intenção que é necessário para que uma ação seja considerada resistente, ao tipo de comportamento social que se qualifica. Assim, enquanto alguns veem a resistência como baseada em ações, outros a veem como baseada na apropriação cultural (Hall & Jefferson 1976). Em sua revisão abrangente da literatura sobre o tema, Hollander & Einwohner (2004) concluem que a resistência pode ser vista como constituída por ação e oposição. Neste artigo, analiso a resistência do ponto de vista da oposição a ideias, situações sociais, ações institucionais e processos que resultem ou possam resultar em discriminação ou estereótipo de grupos sociais específicos, conforme negociado na esfera digital por jovens migrantes e não migrantes pertencentes a uma comunidade escolar. De fato, tem sido argumentado (Chiluwa 2012, Chibuwe & Ureke 2016) que os ambientes digitais constituem arenas ideais para o desenvolvimento da resistência graças ao seu amplo alcance e sua capacidade de mobilizar pessoas em torno de temas comuns. No entanto, grande parte das pesquisas nessa área tem como alvo a resistência organizada alimentada por grupos políticos ou étnicos. Neste artigo defendo que a resistência é um processo emergente que não necessariamente se baseia em contextos políticos ou de escolha aberta, mas pode se desenvolver dentro de trocas interacionais focadas em eventos cotidianos. Assim, o que me interessa aqui é como surgem atos espontâneos e discursos de resistência nas trocas cotidianas de uma comunidade diversificada que não nasceu em torno de uma determinada agenda social ou política. Para este artigo, examinarei as trocas que acontecem na página do Facebook de um dos membros da comunidade. Vou mostrar como a resistência toma muitas formas: da ironia e das piadas à criação de temas sérios, à disseminação de informações e através de diferentes gêneros de discurso: da narrativa à postagem de fotos.

T1  - Beliefs in Conspiracy Theories Following Ostracism
AN  - 2429413879
AB  - Four studies (total valid N = 643) examined whether ostracism increases people’s political conspiracy beliefs through heightened vulnerability and whether self-affirmation intervention counteracts the effect of ostracism on conspiracy beliefs. Compared with their nonostracized counterparts, ostracized participants were more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs related to different political issues (Studies 1–3). Moreover, heightened vulnerability mediated the link between ostracism and conspiracy beliefs (Studies 1–3). Offering ostracized participants an opportunity to reaffirm values important to them could reduce their political conspiracy beliefs (Study 4). Taken together, our findings highlight the crucial role of vulnerability in understanding when and why ostracism increases conspiracy beliefs and how to ameliorate this relationship. Our findings also provide novel insights into how daily interpersonal interactions influence people’s political beliefs and involvement.

T1  - Less human, more to blame: Animalizing poor people increases blame and decreases support for wealth redistribution: GPIR
AN  - 2407985159
AB  - Increasing economic inequality adversely affects groups with low socioeconomic status (low-SES). However, many people are opposed to wealth redistribution policies. In this context, we examined whether dehumanization of low-SES groups has a role in this opposition. In the first study (N = 303), opposition to wealth redistribution was related to denying human uniqueness (e.g., intelligence and rationality) and having negative attitudes toward low-SES groups, more than denying human nature (e.g., emotionality and capacity to suffer) to low-SES groups. Mediation analyses indicated that this effect occurred via blaming low-SES groups for their plight, after controlling for participants’ SES and negative attitudes towards low-SES groups. In the second study (N = 220), manipulating the human uniqueness of a fictitious low-SES group affected support for wealth redistribution measures through blame. These results indicate that animalizing low-SES groups reduces support for wealth redistribution via blaming low-SES groups for their situation.

T1  - ‘Who will clean up the mess?’: reflections on media coverage of a human–guide dog pair in Southeast Asia
AN  - 2545008729
AB  - This article analyses media representations of Lashawn Chan (dog) and Stevens Chan Kum Fai (human), who are considered the first recorded service animal–human team in Malaysia. The article reflects on the pair’s public relationship as an intersectional, multi-framework that is relevant to both disability and animal justice. Following both critical animal and disability studies literature, we read media reports of Lashawn and Stevens’ public encounters. These stories frame the pair as spectacle, threat, and resource. They reveal the influences of cultural and social conventions that utilise guide dogs as advocacy tools, as well as public attitudes towards guide dogs and their users in Malaysian and western contexts. The authors advocate for alternative representations based on interspecies interdependence.

T1  - Business as Usual? A Social Capital Approach to Understanding Interactions with Journalists on Twitter
AN  - 2353928257
AB  - On the surface, it seems that journalists are more publicly accessible than ever before, largely thanks to the popular microblogging website/ app, Twitter. But determining who is interacting with journalists on Twitter is important in order to understand who benefits from these interactions. We argue that social capital provides a useful framework for understanding this phenomenon because it sheds light on the ways in which journalists are embedded in structures of formal and informal social connection, and it highlights social inclusion and exclusion in these processes. Relying on a two-wave, online survey collected before and after the 2018 Midterm Elections, we examine the relationship between social capital and interactions with journalists on Twitter. Results show that people with higher levels of social capital are more likely to interact with journalists, which can be interpreted as a form of social exclusion. Results are discussed in light of the role of journalism in fostering social connectivity and civic engagement.

Quant a Google Image Search, le terme "professor style" représentait quasi totalement des images d'hommes blancs en costume.

A titre d'exemple, aux Etats-Unis, oú les protections se font toujours attendre, on trouve de « greater encroachments on personal information privacy [...] vulnerable communities and individuals are less likely to find recourse » (12018, 22).

For example, in the United States, where protections are still long overdue, we find "greater encroachments on personal information privacy [...] vulnerable communities and individuals are less likely to find recourse" (12018, 22) . It is by taking the opposite view of the Net neutrality thesis that Noble chapter three exposes how this false neutrality and objectivity can lead to tragic consequences such as the racist massacre (2015) of nine African Americans. es during a prayer at the church where the assailant, Dylann Rooff, “allegedly used Google Search in the development of his racial attitudes” (Noble 2018, p. 11 and p. 133).

T1  - “Improving Our Way of Life Is Largely in Our Own Hands”: Inclusion according to the Romani Newspaper of Interwar Yugoslavia
AN  - 2511165741
AB  - The only Romani newspaper of interwar Yugoslavia, Romano lil/Ciganske novine (the latter meaning ‘Gypsy newspaper’ in Serbian), was published in Belgrade in 1935 comprising only three monthly issues. The most prominent Yugoslav Romani activist of the time, Svetozar Simić, was the editor of the newspaper, giving tribute to his visions of what Roma should do for the prosperity of their own community. In terms of content, the newspaper articles seem to be strategically thought-out with the aim of creating a narrative about the Roma, as people united by common culture and historical memory, equal to the other people of the Yugoslav Kingdom, who needed to be included in all processes of the social and public sphere. This article looks into the essence of some messages that the newspaper conveys regarding Roma’s social inclusion, such as (1) education and professional training as a key for a better future, (2) the need for Roma to be more engaged and to self-organise as a community and (3) the fight against majority misconceptions about the Gypsies. The article presents and analyses these three elements of Svetozar Simić’s visions for Romani social inclusion as presented in his editorial pieces. The analysis also pays attention to the resemblances between some of the main messages of the Romani activism in the interwar period and the activism for Roma inclusion in later periods, including parallels during the time of Yugoslav Socialism and the period of democratic transition up until today.

T1  - “Did you read about Berlin?” Terrorist attacks, online media reporting and support for refugees in Germany
AN  - 2467807799
AB  - Wir untersuchen den Einfluss des islamistischen Terroranschlags auf den Berliner Weihnachtsmarkt in 2016 auf die öffentliche Meinung zu Migration im Allgemeinen und, da der Angreifer in Deutschland Asyl beantragt hatte, zu Flüchtlingen im Besonderen. Die Analyse dieses natürlichen Experiments zeigt, dass letztere negativer wurde, wohingegen allgemeine Einstellungen stabil geblieben sind. Um den Mechanismus hinter den Einstellungsänderungen näher zu beleuchten, kombinieren wir diese Ergebnisse mit einer quantitativen Inhaltsanalyse der medialen Berichterstattung über Flüchtlinge vor und nach dem Anschlag. Ein Einfluss medialer Berichterstattung auf negative Einstellungen gegenüber ethnischen Minderheiten wird häufig postuliert, bisher aber kaum empirisch getestet. Wir nutzen maschinelles Lernen, um die Berichterstattung in drei populären deutschen Onlinenachrichtenseiten über den Anschlag zu quantifizieren. Die Auswertung zeigt, dass der Anschlag einen signifikanten Effekt auf die Berichterstattung der drei Webseiten hatte, die mediale Aufmerksamkeit aber nur recht kurzlebig war und bereits in der zweiten Woche nach dem Anschlag deutlich abebbte. In den Daten zeigt sich daher kein direkter Zusammenhang zwischen medialer Berichterstattung und öffentlicher Meinung. Im Gegensatz zu den theoretischen Erwartungen suggerieren deskriptive Ergebnisse, dass die Entwicklung der öffentlichen Meinung sogar entgegengesetzt zur Berichterstattung zu laufen schien, da sich die Einstellungen erst Wochen nach dem eigentlichen Anschlag veränderten. Wir diskutieren mögliche Erklärungen dieser auf den ersten Blick kontraintuitiven Befunde.Alternate abstract: We analyze whether the Islamist terror attack on the Christmas market in Berlin in 2016 had an impact on public opinion toward immigration in general and, since the attacker has entered Germany to apply for asylum, toward refugees in particular. An analysis of this natural experiment reveals a negative shift regarding the latter, while no differences are observed for the former. To shed more light on the driver of attitude change, we combine these findings with a quantitative content analysis of online media reporting about refugees before and after the attack. Mass media have long been considered to have an impact on exclusionary attitudes toward ethnic minorities. However, empirical evidence on this relationship remains largely anecdotal. We draw upon unsupervised machine learning to quantify the developments in reporting in three popular German online news websites. Results reveal that the attack had significant impact on media reporting on these websites. However, the strong focus on the attack was only short lived, quickly decreasing already in the second week after the attack. Linking media data to the public opinion data reveals no clear connection between reporting and attitudes. In contrast to theoretical expectations, descriptive evidence even shows that both follow almost opposite trends, since people changed their attitudes only weeks after the attack. We discuss potential explanations of these, at first sight, counterintuitive findings.

T1  - Direct and indirect predictors of opposition to immigration in Europe: individual values, cultural values, and symbolic threat
AN  - 2376777391
AB  - The current study examines the following questions: (1) the extent to which individual basic human values are linked with attitudes towards immigration; (2) whether symbolic threat by immigration mediates this relation; and (3) whether cultural values moderate the relations between individual values, threat, and attitudes towards immigration. The empirical analysis relies on the 2014/2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.

T1  - Older Adults’ Internet Use for Health Information: Digital Divide by Race/Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 2322429951
AB  - Building upon literature suggesting low Internet use among racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, this study examined how race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) influence the Internet use for health information, addressing both independent and interactive effects. Using data from 17,704 older adults in the California Health Interview Survey, logistic regression models were estimated with race/ethnicity (Whites, African Americans, Latinos, and Asians), SES index, and the interaction between race/ethnicity and SES index. Overall, approximately 40% of participants were Internet-users for health information. Direct effects of race/ethnicity and SES—and their interactions—were all found to be significant. Minority status combined with the lowest levels of SES substantially reduced the odds of using Internet for health information. Findings suggest the combination of racial/ethnic minority status and low SES as a source of digital divide, and provide implications for Internet technology training for the target population.

T1  - A View on the History of Media Theory from the Global South
AN  - 2564512655
AB  - The generalisation of “media” as a term for all forms of communication technologies occurred in part as a result of Cold War history. The implication was that every medium was in some abstract sense equivalent, whether it was print, radio or television for example. Media acquired emancipatory connotations, as if their growth would bring progress in its wake. Alongside, however, paradigms for research on media proliferated, and became increasingly hard to bridge; one outcome was the increasing marginalisation of media and communication studies from the social sciences and humanities in general, even as media scholars grew in number. This marginalization reflected a historical problem, but, interestingly, the remedies sought for it are often theoretical, drawing for example on science studies or on critical race theory. It is as if the Global South and North that have been set adrift from each other, with scholarly sanction from the academy. But for understanding the forms of contemporary globalisation, an account of Cold War media theory’s historical formation is indispensable.

T1  - Changing patterns of conspicuous consumption: Media representations of luxury in second homes
AN  - 2267660632
AB  - This article examines the potential of utilising representations of luxury in second homes to chart the changing patterns of conspicuous consumption. It is situated within a New Zealand context and based on the analysis of representations of luxury in second homes in an architecture/lifestyle magazine from 1936 to 2015. A qualitative thematic analysis was carried out on the written and visual text of 305 second home articles. The findings are divided into time periods which relate to distinct socio-cultural, political and economic events and ideologies that have influenced New Zealand society. The analysis reveals a change from ‘quiet luxury’ during the war years to the luxury of imported products, reflecting a fascination with first American and then European style in the mid-century. It also shows a change from a reputed cultural reticence to display one’s wealth to the flagrant conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services in the 1980s which aligns with the rise of new wealth after the introduction of neoliberalism in the country. Finally, the variance between representations of luxury during recessionary times in the 1970s and 2000s demonstrates a change in attitude towards conspicuous consumption.

T1  - Who's in conflict? Racialization of Puerto Ricans in relation to other Latinxs in the New York Times, 2010-2015
AN  - 2232409462
AB  - Puerto Rican migration to the United States has skyrocketed as a result of various political and economic factors faced in Puerto Rico. I focus my attention on how Puerto Ricans are represented in newspapers through narratives of belonging, exclusion and/or perceived threat. I seek to answer is: how are Puerto Ricans and other Latinx groups framed in relation to each other in the New York Times? To answer this query, I perform a content analysis of the paper of record, the New York Times. I argue that Puerto Ricans are not only framed as in conflict in relation to other Latinos, while also being framed as possessing some sort of colour capital that can be transferred over to particular spaces. The NYT constructs boundaries that reinforce while also transform what groups are perceived as threats.

T1  - Pornographic intersections: race and genitalia in South African political art in the age of digital media
TT  - Intersections pornographiques : race et organes génitaux dans l’art politique d’Afrique du Sud à l’âge des media numériques
AN  - 2571619620
AB  - Post-Apartheid South Africa has been characterized by fractious relationships between the races that compose this society and also between the rulers and the ruled. Society has devised many strategies to cope with, understand, resist, and oppose this, but also to bring about change. One of these strategies is the expression of personal viewpoints through elections, social media, protests and humour. This paper is concerned with the deployment of near-pornographic satirical humour in South African politics, satire created to challenge the powerful. Using critical discourse analysis of paintings, citizens’ comments and news media reports, this paper questions the use of ‘genital art’ and offers different readings of these images in the broader context of South African identity politics. Race seems to be the most dominant lens through which the paintings that are the foci of this paper are read. In a racially charged South Africa race is not a funny subject. The paper concludes that the refusal to see humour in South African race relations might be due to the shocking manner of aesthetic representations in these paintings. That the artworks capture the grave levels of the socio-political and economic situation is indisputable but what remains contested could be the modes of representing these situations. All this seems to interplay with race politics and South Africa’s problematic Apartheid past.Alternate abstract:L’Afrique du Sud post-Apartheid s’est caractérisée par des relations acrimonieuses entre les races composant cette société et aussi entre les personnes au pouvoir et les personnes gouvernées. La société a conçu de nombreuses stratégies pour gérer, comprendre, résister, et s’opposer à cela, mais aussi pour apporter du changement. L’une de ces stratégies est l’expression de points de vue personnels à travers des élections, les réseaux sociaux, des manifestations et l’humour. Cet article se concentre sur le déploiement de l’humour satyrique presque pornographique dans la politique Sud-Africaine, satyre créée pour défier les puissants. En utilisant une analyse critique du discours des peintures, des commentaires de citoyens et des couvertures médiatiques de l’actualité, cet article s’interroge sur l’utilisation de l’ ‘art génital’ et propose différentes lectures de ces images dans le contexte plus large de la politique identitaire de l’Afrique du Sud. Le caractère racial semble être la lentille dominante à travers laquelle les peintures au cœur de cet article sont interprétées. Dans une Afrique du Sud racialement chargée le sujet de la race n’est pas amusant. L’article conclut que le refus de voir l’humour peut être informé par la manière choquante de représentations esthétiques dans ces peintures. Que les travaux d’art saisissent les niveaux sérieux de la situation socio-politique et économique est indéniable mais les modes de représentation de ces situations restent contestés. Ils semblent tous interagir avec les politiques raciales et la problématique du passé d’Apartheid de l’Afrique du Sud.

T1  - Facebook versus Instagram: How perceived gratifications and technological attributes are related to the change in social media usage
AN  - 2258134227
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to explore which factors of users' perceived gratifications and technology attributes are associated with changes in the usage level of Facebook and Instagram during the past three months. We identified common gratifications (social interaction, entertainment, passing time, browsing, need for recognition) as well as technology attributes (visual element, recommendation algorithm, privacy setting, openness, simultaneousness) of Facebook and Instagram and surveyed respondents who have both Facebook and Instagram accounts (n = 613). Respondents who were more gratified with entertainment and need for recognition aspects and those who have positive attitudes toward Facebook's recommendation algorithm features were more likely to report that they have increased use of the platform during the past three months. Meanwhile, respondents who were gratified with the browsing aspect of gratifications and those who have positive attitudes toward levels of openness on Instagram tended to report that they have increasingly used the platform during the past three months.

T1  - Citizen surveil-labour: Analysing Crime Stoppers and its alliance of police, media, and publics
AN  - 2219537796
AB  - An examination of a Crime Stoppers initiative – a weekly page published in a major city-based tabloid newspaper – afforded a rare glimpse into this understudied global entity. It also offered a means of reflecting on the co-option of CCTV images; partnerships between police, media organisations, and diverse publics; and the harnessing of citizen labour in a culture of surveillance. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the images, accompanying texts, and rhetoric of this feature page for a two-year period. From a media criminology perspective, the portrayals underscore the abrogation of the presumption of innocence, a focus on mundane property offences, with the potential to exacerbate fear of crime and to engender more punitive public attitudes. From a conceptual frame, this article proffers the notion of surveil-labour where the repurposing of CCTV data in the context of a Crime Stoppers scheme reinforces an alliance of police, media, and the public to enhance an infrastructure of informing.

T1  - Re-presenting the Paralympics: (contested) philosophies, production practices and the hypervisibility of disability
AN  - 2229921702
AB  - Studies that have engaged parasport broadcasting, particularly through a narrative lens, have almost exclusively relied on textual and/or content analysis of the Paralympic Games as the source of cultural critique. We know far less about the decisions taken inside Paralympic broadcasters that have led to such representations. In this study – based on interviews with senior production and promotion staff at the United Kingdom’s Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4 – we provide the first detailed examination of mediated parasport from this vantage point. We explore the use of promotional devices such as athletes’ backstories – the ‘Hollywood treatment’ – to both hook audiences and serve as a vehicle for achieving its social enterprise mandate to change public attitudes towards disability. In so doing, we reveal myriad tensions that coalesce around representing the Paralympics, with respect to the efforts made to balance the competing goals of key stakeholders and a stated desire to make the Paralympics both a commercial and socially progressive success.

T1  - Comedy as a Route to Social Change: The Effects of Satire and News on Persuasion about Syrian Refugees
AN  - 2210015400
AB  - Using a pretest-posttest and delayed recontact experimental design with a national sample, this study examines shifts in U.S. public attitudes about Syrian refugees after watching a topical satirical news segment on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, compared with a CNN news segment. To investigate synergistic effects between satire and news, the design varied whether the news and comedy segments were viewed alone or in sequence (news before comedy or comedy before news). The results show that all four treatments (news only, comedy only, news-comedy, comedy-news) significantly increased support for refugees from pretest to posttest, and these effects were maintained after a 2-week delay. However, the effects were significantly greater in the three comedy conditions relative to news only. Finally, a serial mediation analysis demonstrated that perceived entertainment value is a positive mediator of comedy's persuasive effects and serves as a buffer against negative indirect effects through message discounting and argument quality.

T1  - Homo Post-Sovieticus: Reconstructing Citizenship in Russia
AN  - 2249729941
AB  - It seems odd to speak of transition in Russia. The problem is not just with the term itself, loaded as it is with normative expectations that Russia and its neighbors, having thrown off a seemingly unnatural system of governance, would inevitably converge to the politically and economically liberal mean. And yet it is not entirely a fool's errand. While Russia is neither a liberal market economy nor a functioning democracy, Russian citizens today are not living in the same circumstances that obtained in 1985 or 1991, or even 1999 when Vladimir Putin first came to power. The state's monopoly of the means of production is a thing of the past, as is its insistence on a single ideology that transformed and constricted the lives of its citizens. Though myriad caveats are due, Russians are broadly freer and more prosperous than they have ever been before, and the state plays less of a role in their lives, having largely ceased curating not only their bookshelves and travel plans but also their educational and career trajectories, their health care, and so on. Moreover, this new state of affairs appears to be reasonably well consolidated and capable of sustaining and entrenching itself for the foreseeable future (see, among others, Hale 2014). And so it does not seem unreasonable to argue that there has been a transition from one state of affairs to another. More broadly, the study of durable authoritarianism—the ostensibly surprising perseverance of a regime type thought to be on the way out only two decades ago—owes much to the failure of both democratic transformation and the transition paradigm in the post-Soviet space. From an academic standpoint, at least, this has been a good thing, calling established categories into question and forcing a reconsideration of significant segments of democratic theory (see, among many others, Carothers 2002; Levitsky and Way 2010; Diamond et al. 2014). But the integration of the study of "post-transition" into mainstream comparative politics, while fruitful, has imposed certain limitations. For the most part, following trends in political science writ large, the resulting research has focused on institutions—both formal and informal, and the ways in which they are both captured and subverted—and on the behavior of elites. A second important strand of this research has focused on microstructures, with particular (though not exclusive) reference to China (see, for example, Tsai 2007; Repnikova 2017). Increasingly, however, research on Russia has begun to elucidate a range of pro-autocratic phenomena that lie deeper in the social equation—factors including personality, emotion, and the evidently careful and contingent calculations that inform the expression and/or falsification of preferences (see Treisman 2011; Frye, Reuter, and Szakonyi 2014; Frye et al. 2017; Greene and Robertson 2017 and 2018). This essay argues that scholars should push even further in that direction. While not negating the importance of institutions and elites, the suggestion here is that research should move beyond received assumptions about the ways in which autocratic "distortions" originating at the top of the political hierarchy might cascade downwards. Rather, a cross-disciplinary approach to the study of Russia can help in understanding the ways in which autocratic governance produces not just political behaviors but also more deeply engrained social incentives and preferences, which in turn lend internal coherence—and thus durability—to authoritarian systems. This essay takes inspiration and guidance from Aronoff and Kubik's (2013) use of the anthropological concept of "vernacular knowledge"—the intuitive, common-sense guideposts that communities use to interpret complex challenges—in their critique of Homo sovieticus, the idea that Russian (and other postcommunist) peoples are culturally incompatible with liberalized social, economic, and political systems. Without the benefit of ethnography, of course, studying the political vernacular knowledge of ordinary Russian citizens is impossible. Instead, I will try to tease out some hypotheses, informed by key strands of contemporary research focusing on three central questions: (a) how Russians have assimilated the legacies of the rise and fall of state socialism; (b) how Russians instrumentalize media and mediated communication, with particular reference to politics; and (c) the value Russians place (or do not place) on political participation. From each of these three strands emerges a central thread: that of locality. The idea of the local—not a naively geographical space but rather one bounded by the furthest social distance a citizen might expect her or his power to extend—appears central to understanding the boundaries of Russian citizenship itself. That is the transition with which this essay is concerned.

T1  - Impersonal subjectivation from platforms to infrastructures
AN  - 2170231986
AB  - The rapid expansion of social media has led to the concentration of digitized, networked, and mediated processes into the hands of a few giant corporations (e.g. Google, Facebook, and Amazon), their partners and affiliates. From smart watches to targeted advertising and reputation scores, this new political economy of subjectivation – or subject making – sees an intensification of datafication to sell commodities, manipulate moods, inject ideologies, and influence behaviors. This article argues that in order to understand this new political economy of subjectivation, we need to complicate and build upon framework that focus on the collection of personal data and its risks on individual users. We argue that as social media and digital media giant corporations move away from an enclosed platform model toward a distributed, impersonal infrastructure, the mining of individual data and the shaping of individual attitudes is increasingly geared toward establishing relationships between user data and a plethora of non-human, environmental data. Such an infrastructure invokes impersonal subjects, and thus requires a new politics of relationality.

T1  - Migration Regimes and the Production of (Labor) Unfreedom
AN  - 2199270492
AB  - The concept of unfree labor operates as a useful analytical tool that highlights a continuum of exploitation along which certain groups and individuals have particular vulnerabilities.2 Through specifying the nature of unfreedom in the Canadian context and the role of immigration policies in inciting these conditions, I show how unfreedom refers to both the employment relationship and exclusions from citizenship, the latter mediated by dimensions of migrant social location.

[...]while literature on unfreedom may generally focus on the employment contract, it is not only a question of labor rights and vulnerabilities, but also centrally about (racialized) social exclusion and belonging from the nation.

Under the LSP, employers can recruit workers for any occupation that the federal government defines as "low-skilled."

Since the inception of this program, the most striking growth in TMWs has been in accommodation and food service positions, from 4,360 to 44,740 between 2002 and 2013.20 As I have shown elsewhere, the Tim Hortons corporation recruits most of its temporary labor to western Canada from the Philippines.21 As a labor-sending state, the Philippines has a long history of systematically managing its nationals for overseas work, in its most current form dating back to 1974.

Specifically, Filipino nationals are racially imagined and assembled as "ideal" migrants through a migration apparatus that socializes them to be "exceptional" workers: culturally knowledgeable of the etiquette in host destinations, educated, and yet "cheap."

[...]the Philippines is in the business of devaluing its nationals on an international scale by offering up an essentialist and racially "superior product" at bargain-level prices.

[...]the literature on unfreedom tends to privilege questions of economic structures, employment relations, and the changing dynamics of capitalism to make sense of the plight of vulnerable workers.

T1  - Gender Bias Produces Gender Gaps in STEM Engagement
AN  - 2001505285
AB  - We explored whether the existence of gender bias causes gender gaps in STEM engagement. In Experiment 1 (n = 322), U.S. women projected less sense of belonging, positivity toward, and aspirations to participate in STEM than did men when exposed to the reality of STEM gender bias. These gender differences disappeared when participants were told that STEM exhibits gender equality, suggesting that gender bias produces STEM gender gaps. Experiment 2 (n = 429) explored whether results generalized to a specific STEM department, and whether organizational efforts to mitigate gender bias might shrink gender gaps. U.S. women exposed to a biased chemistry department anticipated more discrimination and projected less sense of belonging, positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men. These gender differences vanished when participants read about an unbiased department, again suggesting that gender bias promotes STEM gender gaps. Further, moderated mediation analyses suggested that in the presence of gender bias (but not gender equality), women projected less positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men because they experienced less sense of belonging and anticipated more discrimination. Results were largely unaffected by whether departments completed a diversity training, suggesting that knowledge of diversity initiatives alone cannot close STEM gender gaps.

T1  - Consequences of the American States’ Legislative Action on Immigration
AN  - 2058283080
AB  - Over the past decade, US states have responded to federal inaction on comprehensive immigration reform by increasing their output of immigrant policies, both beneficial and restrictive. Although there is a growing empirical literature focused on predicting such activity by states, less is known, especially on a broad scale, about the state-level consequences associated with the policy tone states adopt toward immigrants. To better understand the consequences of restrictive immigrant policies, we created a restrictive score for each state year between 2005 and 2014 and employed linear regression with panel-corrected standard errors to investigate effects on immigrant-related demographics, economic factors, and political participation. We found that states with higher restrictive policy tones do experience reductions in the number of foreign-born residents, including Hispanics and those with limited English proficiency, a goal of many state legislators who favor restrictive policies. States with restrictive policy tones showed reductions in unemployment and poverty rates as well, which are also professed goals for restrictive policy activity. Mediation analyses suggested that the effects of restrictive policy scores on economic conditions are indirect, being exerted through the percentage of a state’s population that is foreign born. Finally, though much attention is focused on the expected increase in Latino political clout, restrictive policy tone was not predictive of increased voter registration or voting in states that pass these types of policies. If anti-immigrant policies are inducing those who oppose these policies to mobilize politically, it must be in an arena outside of voting.

T1  - Sexuality, masculinity and homophobia in association football: An empirical overview of a changing cultural context
AN  - 2042960024
AB  - Influenced by the industrial working classes in the nineteenth century, the emergence of regulated and professional association football became a symbol of masculinity for millions of boys and men that subsequently became engrained in future generations of male fans. One particular element of this was heightened sexism and homophobia and was illustrated by the dreadful reaction by fans, the media, team mates and opposition players to the decision by Justin Fashanu to come out in 1990 during a period of high cultural homophobia. Since 1990, however, there has been a cultural shift occurring in professional football. This article focuses on reviewing the empirical research that has illustrated a more inclusive change in attitude amongst some players and fans (both those attending games in person and those who actively engage in football-related discussions via the internet) as well as within the print and online media.

T1  - Linguistic Discrimination Toward Roma: Can Intergroup Threat Enhance Bias?
AN  - 2036682293
AB  - This study tested whether intergroup threat enhances prejudice and discrimination toward the highly discriminated out-group of Roma. An implicit measure of linguistic discrimination, namely language abstraction of terms used in Roma descriptions, and an explicit measure of affective prejudice, that is, feelings thermometer, were employed. The relation between implicit and explicit discrimination was also analyzed. Threat enhanced linguistic derogation and affective prejudice toward Roma. Linguistic abstraction mediated threat’s effect on affective prejudice. The implications of the findings were discussed with reference to the role of language in shaping intergroup relations and social exclusion.

T1  - From “Ridiculous” to “Glad to Have Helped”: Debriefing News Delivery and Improved Reactions to Science in Milgram’s “Obedience” Experiments
AN  - 2017556586
AB  - Commentators on Milgram’s classic and controversial experiments agree that better integration of theories of “obedience to authority” with current archival research on participants’ viewpoints is essential in explaining compliance. Using conversation analysis, we examine an archived data source that is largely overlooked by the Milgram literature, yet crucial for understanding the interactional organization of participants’ displayed perspectives. In hundreds of interviews conducted immediately after each experiment, participants received one of two types of debriefing: deceptive or full. Analyzing 56 full debriefings from three experimental conditions, we find they featured interactional structuring as news delivery sequences and that debriefing news could transform initially ambivalent or negative assessments of the experiment into positive ones. Such findings reveal limitations of engaged followership, the currently dominant theory of “obedience.” Following discussion of improved assessments’ relevance to public attitudes toward science, we conclude that multiple social psychological processes were at work in producing Milgram’s results.

T1  - The use of pseudoscience and experimentation as a persuasive resource in new advertising communication trends
AN  - 2154029696
AB  - Over the years, advertising communication has sought to use creativity to differentiate products and brands; using all possible resources available and with no hesitation in absorbing techniques and methods from different disciplines for the symbolic creation of values and perceptions. With the technological changes and developments in the last 15 years, advertising communication has evolved substantially to adapt to the new media arising in the digital environment. Thus not only the media have transformed but, consubstantially, the means of communicating, objectives and ways have evolved. This scenario has led to the emergence of various, apparently antagonistic, advertising trends. We can see the rise in new vintage trends that recover what is artisan and handmade, while campaigns are developed with increasingly technological applications (bots and new artificial intelligence, for example). These include a great tendency towards scientific and pseudoscientific justification. This not only involves applying neuromarketing to sales environments, but rather recovering old product demonstrations with brand values or understanding the insights applied to a creative concept. Advertising creativity recovered old psychological experiments used in the '60s and '70s, such as the marshmallow experiment, applying them to new creative proposals in special actions. In this way, psychological and sociological advertising experiments find a new way of using the product "demonstration", or a "scientific" argument for the purchase, creating a brand image or promoting a change in attitude. This text analyses the most representative examples of this recently extended practice in order to analyze their characteristics, conceptualization and audiovisual production, so as to better understand the mechanisms used by the advertising sector to persuade and convince about certain changes in attitude.

T1  - Race, Gender, and the Technological Turn: A Roundtable on Digitizing Revolution
AN  - 2025302886
AB  - We are an intergenerational, multiracial roundtable of senior faculty, doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and lecturers who all write about race, gender, and digital culture. We were asked to meet online and in person over the course of a year to discuss at length variations on the theme of digitizing revolution. While our conversations began in the spring of 2016, we presented together on a panel in November 2016 at the National Women's Studies Association's Annual Conference--just days after the conclusion of the US presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In February 2016 Twitter announced a change in its platform structure that would move away from a chronological timeline of tweets to an algorithmic timeline. The Twitter users and public reacted with #RIPTwitter. Suffice it to say, Twitter users were not pleased. However, this is not the first time that this change in the social media platform's framework has been brought up.

T1  - Elite Military Cues and Public Opinion About the Use of Military Force
AN  - 1980028638
AB  - Do military endorsements influence Americans' political and foreign policy views? We find that senior military officers have the ability to nudge public attitudes under certain conditions. Through a series of large, survey-based experiments, with nearly 12,000 completed interviews from national samples, we find that participants respond to survey questions in predictable ways depending on whether they have been prompted with information about the views of senior military leaders on the very same questions. When told that senior military leaders oppose particular interventions abroad, public opposition to that intervention increases; endorsements of support boost public support but by a smaller magnitude. Subsequent causal mediation analysis suggests that military opinion influences public opinion primarily through its impact on a mission's perceived legitimacy and, to a lesser degree, it's perceived likelihood of success.

T1  - U.S. Children's Stereotypes and Prejudicial Attitudes toward Arab Muslims
AN  - 1980069351
AB  - The current study examined whether children in elementary school in the United States held stereotypes and prejudicial attitudes about Arab Muslims relative to other groups. Children (n = 136), ages 6-11 (55 boys, 81 girls), were read three counterbalanced vignettes about different immigrant families who moved to the United States: one family from the Middle East with clothing markers indicating they are Muslim (e.g., hijab), one family from the Middle East without clothing markers indicating religion, and one White family from Ireland. Children's responses indicated stereotypes associating the Arab Muslim male target as more anti-American and hostile and the Arab Muslim female target as more oppressed than others, both consistent with prevalent media stereotypes. Children's positive and negative affective intergroup attitudes were also measured, along with their attitudes about who can be an "American," with children showing both a positivity and negativity bias against Arab Muslims. Children who had some contact with Muslims or were familiar with Islam felt more positively toward Arab Muslims than less informed children. In addition, if children perceived Arab Muslims to be prototypical "Americans," and identified as very American themselves, they also held positive attitudes toward Arab Muslims. Implications for prejudice reduction interventions are discussed.

T1  - Psychosocial Links Between Internet Use and Mental Health in Later Life: A Systematic Review of Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence
AN  - 1965266708
AB  - Research on the role of information and communication technology (ICT) use for active aging is limited. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the link between Internet use and mental health among older adults. The review was conducted based on searches in 9 electronic databases (2002-2014). A meta-synthesis approach was applied, examining quantitative (18) and qualitative (14) studies. The findings from the synthesis of quantitative statistical data indicate an overall positive association between Internet use and mental health and its psychosocial covariates in later life. The psychosocial links between Internet use and mental health identified from the qualitative data were (a) enhanced interpersonal interaction at individual level, (b) increased access to resources within the community, and (c) empowered social inclusion at society level.
The results highlight the multi-level psychosocial links between Internet use and mental health, which may be applied in initiatives targeting healthy aging in various settings.

T1  - Legitimate, expert and referent power in physical education
AN  - 2015501039
AB  - Physical Education (PE) in school aims to help pupils experience the joy of movement through various forms of physical activity and to acquire a positive attitude to physical activity and exercise. The teacher's task is to mediate the joy of movement and instil a positive attitude to exercise in the pupils. Drawing on the methodology of van Manen [(2002). Writing in the dark: Phenomenological studies in interpretic inquiry. London: The Althouse Press], this article takes a closer look at mediating the joy of movement and conveying attitudes through legitimate, expert and referent power [French, J. R. P., & Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167). Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan] as narrated by an experienced Norwegian PE teacher. The teacher's narrative is interpreted within a framework where these typologies of power refer to the teacher's formal position in PE classes and the teacher's athletic skills and teaching qualities. The teacher's narrative indicates that legitimate, expert and referent power influence pupils' views on PE, attitudes and effort in class. Referent power provides the potential to instil attitudes in the pupils, even to the point of getting them to enjoy taking exercise to the limit. It even embraces teachers' potential to influence pupils by displaying their own active lifestyle, which goes beyond teaching itself. However, some problematic and unresolved issues are pointed out within this approach. A didactic approach, where the teachers use their own lifestyle as a pedagogical tool, may prompt a negative rather than a positive reaction from pupils, because they may be (mis)construed as being too eager and physically active to the extreme. Referent power depends on establishing credibility with the pupils, and conveying attitudes through referent power implies a didactic instability. On the other hand, the approach may be a good strategy for achieving what teachers should be trying to achieve, which is to convey and instil the joy of movement and a positive attitude to physical exercise in the pupils.

T1  - Immigration Attitudes Before and After Tragedy in Copenhagen: The Importance of Political Affiliation and Safety Concerns
AN  - 1920539303
AB  - This research analyzes attitudes on immigration before and after the February 14-15, 2015 Copenhagen shootings. Little research has been conducted on changes in immigration beliefs pre- and postcrisis events, and, further, this research has not closely considered how political views and safety concerns may operate within immigration beliefs in an additive, interactive, or mediating fashion. Using the 2014 and 2015 Copenhagen Area Surveys, the latter conducted shortly after the February shootings, our findings show that taking the survey either before or after the shootings did not shape immigration policy preferences. Instead, the findings reveal that right-leaning political affiliation and a greater fear of crime are the strongest predictors of anti-immigration attitudes. Implications center on new approaches to understanding societal responses to crisis events.

T1  - Social trust and radical right-wing populist party preferences
AN  - 1907123544
AB  - In this study, we examine the role of social trust as an individual and a neighborhood-level determinant for radical right-wing populist party preferences. We argue that high social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences and that this relationship is essentially mediated by negative attitudes toward immigrants. Using data from the Netherlands’ Life Course Study, we employ multilevel structural equation modeling to test our argument on support for the Party for Freedom (PVV). The results reveal that individual social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. Beyond the micro-level relationship, we find that neighborhood social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. In either case, the effects are mediated by anti-immigrant sentiments. Our findings provide evidence for the importance of social trust as a multilevel construct in explanations for radical right-wing populist party preferences.

T1  - Competition over collective victimhood recognition: When perceived lack of recognition for past victimization is associated with negative attitudes towards another victimized group
AN  - 1906667164
AB  - Groups that perceive themselves as victims can engage in "competitive victimhood." We propose that, in some societal circumstances, this competition bears on the recognition of past sufferings--rather than on their relative severity--fostering negative intergroup attitudes. Three studies are presented. Study 1, a survey among Sub-Saharan African immigrants in Belgium (N=127), showed that a sense of collective victimhood was associated with more secondary anti-Semitism. This effect was mediated by a sense of lack of victimhood recognition, then by the belief that this lack of recognition was due to that of Jews' victimhood, but not by competition over the severity of the sufferings. Study 2 replicated this mediation model among Muslim immigrants (N=125). Study 3 experimentally demonstrated the negative effect of the unequal recognition of groups' victimhood on intergroup attitudes in a fictional situation involving psychology students (N=183). Overall, these studies provide evidence that struggle for victimhood recognition can foster intergroup conflict.

T1  - Early intervention for stigma towards mental illness? Promoting positive attitudes towards severe mental illness in primary school children
AN  - 1844554303
AB  - PurposeStigma towards severe mental illness (SMI) is widespread, exacerbating mental health problems, and impacting on help-seeking and social inclusion. Anti-stigma campaigns are meeting with success, but results are mixed. Earlier intervention to promote positive mental health literacy rather than challenge stigma, may show promise, but little is known about stigma development or interventions in younger children. The purpose of this paper is to investigate children’s knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards SMI and whether we can positively influence children’s attitudes before stigma develops.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study investigated mental health schema in 7-11 year olds. An experimental intervention investigated whether an indirect contact story-based intervention in 7-8 year olds led to more positive mental health schema.FindingsYoung children’s schema were initially positive, and influenced by knowledge and contact with mental illness and intergroup anxiety, but were more stigmatising in older girls as intergroup anxiety increased. The indirect contact intervention was effective in promoting positive mental health schema, partially mediated by knowledge.Social implicationsIntervening early to shape concepts of mental illness more positively, as they develop in young children, may represent a more effective strategy than attempting to challenge and change mental health stigma once it has formed in adolescents and adults.Originality/valueThis study is the first to investigate an intervention targeted at the prevention of stigma towards SMI, in young children, at the point that stigma is emerging.

T1  - "BUT AREN'T WE ALL POOR?" HOW WHITES' PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC GROUP THREAT INFLUENCE RACIAL ATTITUDES IN MICHIGAN
AN  - 1836863641
AB  - This paper presents a test of the power threat hypothesis (Blalock 1967) through an investigation of the role that whites ' perceptions of economic conditions have on their racial attitudes. This relationship is analyzed using data from Michigan 's State of the State Survey in 2009 when economic conditions were fairly had. Findings support the power threat hypothesis and demonstrate that whites who had more negative perceptions of their own or community financial status were more likely to have negative racial attitudes. Additionally, education and political affiliation were found to he important factors in mediating the relationship between whites ' perceptions of economic conditions and racial attitudes, with conservative, less educated whites exhibiting more negative racial attitudes than liberal more educated whites. These findings suggest a need for future research examining if and why marginalized whites invest in symbolic racial privilege at the expense of their own economic realities.

T1  - The crisis as an opportunity for change? High-skilled immigration policies across Europe
AN  - 2076976273
AB  - The recent economic crisis provided a shock to the system, and led governments to scramble for solutions to problems of falling economic growth, high unemployment and weak job creation. Many European governments responded to protectionist calls by restricting immigration policies, even towards the highly skilled. Yet countries have faced different challenges and thus the cross-national variation in the demand for policy closure or openness is remarkable. Some seized the opportunity to restrict their high-skilled immigration policies, while others took advantage of the crisis for further liberalisation. The article explores different reasons for this variation, ranging from socio-economic conditions, the inflow of labour migrants to the role of labour market institutions and political actors. Countries badly affected by the crisis and with a recent influx of labour migrants were more likely to respond to mobilised groups lobbying for restrictive policies than those countries weathering the crisis relatively better but suffering from continuing labour shortages. The article examines the changing conditions and the role of mobilised stakeholders to explain policy change in selected European countries. It also presents an updated index on states' openness to high-skilled immigrants to measure change over time. The findings are based on position statements of stakeholders, official documents and media coverage.

T1  - Direct and extended intergenerational contact and young people's attitudes towards older adults
AN  - 1816560100
AB  - Research suggests that positive intergenerational contact can improve young people's attitudes towards older adults. However, today's age-segregated society may not provide ample opportunities for positive contact between younger and older adults to occur on a regular basis. In three studies, we investigated whether the positive attitudinal outcomes associated with direct contact might also stem from a more indirect form of intergenerational relationship: extended contact. In Study 1 (N = 70), extended contact was associated with more positive attitudes towards older adults even when controlling for direct intergenerational contact (contact frequency and contact quality). In Study 2 (N = 110), the positive effects of direct and extended contact on young people's age-related attitudes were mediated by reductions in intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety. The mediational effects of intergroup anxiety were replicated in Study 3 (N = 95) and ingroup norms additionally emerged as a mediator of the positive effects of extended contact on young people's attitudes towards older adults. Discussion focuses on the implications for strategies aimed at tackling ageism.

Countries badly affected by the crisis and with a recent influx of labour migrants were more likely to respond to mobilised groups lobbying for restrictive policies than those countries weathering the crisis relatively better but suffering from continuing labour shortages. The article examines the changing conditions and the role of mobilised stakeholders to explain policy change in selected European countries. It also presents an updated index on states' openness to high-skilled immigrants to measure change over time. The findings are based on position statements of stakeholders, official documents and media coverage.

T1  - A Reinforcement Sensitivity Perspective on Adolescents' Susceptibility to the Influence of Soap Opera Viewing on Alcohol Attitudes
AN  - 1806575543
AB  - Previous research found support for an association between exposure to alcohol-related media content and alcohol attitudes, intentions and behavior. Nevertheless, research on what makes young people susceptible to the occurrence of this relationship is scarce. The current study examined the behavioral activation (BAS) and inhibition system (BIS) as moderators of the relationship between soap opera viewing and alcohol attitudes. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a sample of 922 adolescents (Mage = 14.96 years, SD = .85, 56% girls). Regression analyses showed no association between total television viewing and alcohol attitudes, but did confirm that soap opera viewing is associated with positive attitudes towards alcohol use. Moderation analyses indicated that BAS did not moderate this relationship, while BIS did; the relationship between soap opera viewing and positive attitudes toward alcohol was only significant for adolescents with a low BIS-profile. These results provide support for the premise that an elevated BIS protects adolescents from the effect of soap opera viewing frequency on their alcohol attitudes.

T1  - Elite athletes or superstars? Media representation of para-athletes at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games
AN  - 2059568501
AB  - This article offers a discourse analysis of media representations of para-athletes before, during and post the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in print and online sources, drawing on the lens of critical disability theory. We consider the importance of the media-sport cultural complex in influencing public attitudes towards disability. We conclude that whilst the importance of discursive change cannot be underestimated at the level of the media agenda, change at the level of lived experience will only flow from carefully designed and executed political and policy initiatives rather than directly from changes in the media presentation or visibility of individual athletes.

AN  - 2539304212
AB  - Auswertungen in Forschungsteams werden innerhalb der qualitativen Sozialforschung zunehmend als nützlich erachtet: Dies soll zum Ausbau forscherischer Fertigkeiten, zu einer Sichtbarmachung analytischer Prozesse, zur Reduktion von Ungleichheit und sozialer Distanz insbesondere zwischen Forschenden und Beforschten und zu einer intensiveren Befassung mit dem Datenmaterial verhelfen. Mit diesem Artikel wollen wir zu diesem Themenbereich unter Nutzung eines kurzen Interviewausschnitts zur Migration aus der Karibik nach Großbritannien beitragen. Wir veranschaulichen die Arbeitsprozesse im Forschungsteam und die verschiedenen analytischen Ressourcen, auf die wir im Rahmen einer narrativen Analyse zurückgegriffen haben. Und wir beschreiben, in welcher Weise eine initiale Zeile-für-Zeile-Analyse, gefolgt von der Auswertung größerer Textpassagen, zu einem Verständnis beigetragen haben, das im Falle von Einzelforscher/innen schwerlich möglich gewesen wäre. Zusätzlich diskutieren wir die Positionierungen der einzelnen Teammitglieder zu den Daten und die poröse Grenze zwischen der Primär- und Sekundärauswertung qualitativer Daten.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs160294Alternate abstract:Working in groups is increasingly regarded as fruitful for the process of analyzing qualitative data. It has been reported to build research skills, make the analytic process visible, reduce inequalities and social distance particularly between researchers and participants, and broaden and intensify engagement with the material. This article contributes to the burgeoning literature on group qualitative data analysis by presenting a worked example of a group data analysis of a short extract from an interview on serial migration from the Caribbean to the UK. It describes the group's working practices and the different analytic resources drawn upon to conduct a narrative analysis. We demonstrate the ways in which an initial line-by-line analysis followed by analysis of larger extracts generated insights that would have been less available to individual researchers. Additionally, we discuss the positioning of group members in relation to the data and reflect on the porous boundary between primary and secondary analysis of qualitative data.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs160294Alternate abstract:El trabajo en grupos es considerado cada vez más fructífero para el proceso de análisis de datos cualitativos.

Este artículo contribuye a la creciente literatura sobre análisis grupal de datos cualitativos mediante la presentación de un ejemplo práctico de análisis de datos de un grupo, a partir del breve extracto de una entrevista sobre la migración en serie desde el Caribe al Reino Unido. En él se describen las prácticas de trabajo del grupo y los diferentes recursos analíticos utilizados para realizar un análisis narrativo. Se demuestran las formas en que un primer análisis línea por línea, seguido por el análisis de extractos más grandes, generaron percepciones que habrían sido menos accesibles para los investigadores individuales. Además, se discute la posición de los miembros del grupo en relación con los datos y se reflexiona sobre la frontera porosa entre el análisis primario y secundario de los datos cualitativos.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs160294

T1  - Testing a New Theoretical Model for Attitudes Toward Immigrants: The Case of Social Workers' Attitudes Toward Asylum Seekers in Israel
AN  - 1752001706
AB  - The present study proposes a new threat-benefit theoretical model explaining attitudes of local people toward immigrants. Based on the theory of human values and extending Integrative Threat Theory, the threat-benefit model suggests that the local population perceives immigrants as both threatening and beneficial for the receiving society. The model assumes that appraisal of an immigrant group as threatening or beneficial for the receiving society influences opinions regarding immigration policy related to the immigrant group. The study assessed the new model investigating attitudes toward asylum seekers in a representative sample of 283 social workers in Israel. Results of the study support a conceptualization of immigrant appraisal involving four types of threats (economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity) and four types of benefits (economic, physical, cultural diversity, and humanitarian), which represent different types of realistic and symbolic threats and benefits. Findings showed that appraisal of asylum seekers as beneficial or threatening to the receiving society mediated the connections between personal preferences for values of universalism, power, social security, and tradition and support for immigration policy directed either at defending immigrants' rights or defending the receiving society. Application of the model for understanding attitudes toward different minorities as well as for creation of value-based interventions and programs aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward various stigmatized groups in society are discussed.

T1  - The Gap between Public Preferences and Policies on Immigration: A Comparative Examination of the Effect of Politicisation on Policy Congruence
AN  - 2076972757
AB  - The existence of a gap between public preferences for more restrictive immigration policies and relatively expansive immigration policy in Western democracies has received considerable attention. Sometimes, this gap has been explained by the nature of immigration policies: dominated by elites while the public remained uninterested. In many countries, however, immigration has gained considerable salience among the public. There are competing expectations and accounts relating to whether policy-makers ignore or follow public demands on immigration. In this article we examine the potential drivers of variations in the opinion-policy gap on immigration in seven countries (1995-2010). We analyse the effect of the politicisation of immigration on this opinion-policy gap. The strength of anti-immigrant parties is unrelated to the opinion-policy gap on immigration. The salience of the issue and the intensity of the public debate are associated with the opinion-policy gap, and the combination of negative attitudes with extensive media coverage seems particularly conducive to policy congruence.

T1  - BEYOND SYMPTOMS? INVESTIGATING PREDICTORS OF SENSE OF CAMPUS BELONGING AMONG POSTSECONDARY STUDENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES
AN  - 1690677336
AB  - This study investigated predictors of sense of campus belonging among postsecondary students with psychiatric disabilities. Participants were 566 current or past students with self-reported diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression, and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data. Regression results showed that campus engagement and psychosocial inclusion variables accounted for substantially more of the variance in sense of campus belonging than available symptomatological variables. Follow-up path modeling demonstrated the strong mediating role of sense of social exclusion, sense of opportunity, student relationships, and participation in clubs and organizations in the relationship of symptoms factors with sense of belonging. Implications for future research and program development are discussed, with an emphasis on moving beyond symptom-centered interventions to those that stress robust campus integration and engagement.

T1  - Interreligious Contact, Perceived Group Threat, and Perceived Discrimination: Predicting Negative Attitudes among Religious Minorities and Majorities in Indonesia
AN  - 1767327838; 201605551
AB  - This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes toward the religious outgroup among minority Christians and majority Muslims in Indonesia. It answers two research questions: Does interreligious contact reduce negative outgroup attitudes equally for minority Christians and majority Muslims? Are mediation by perceived group threat and moderation by perceived discrimination equally important for religious minorities and majorities? The analysis is based on unique survey data collected from among Christian and Muslim students in Ambon (the Moluccas) and Yogyakarta (central Java). Results show that a higher quantity of interreligious contact reduces negative outgroup attitudes among majority Muslims but not among minority Christians. However, the quality of contact reduces negative attitudes regardless of relative group size. Perceived group threat is an important mediator of the contact-attitude relationship and is equally so for Christians and Muslims. Findings suggest that perceived discrimination does not affect the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - MATERIALISTIC VALUES, SHOPPING, AND LIFE SATISFACTION IN ROMANIA
AN  - 1717443208
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that generally materialists are less happy than those lower in materialism. Several studies confirm that people who experience a lower level of life satisfaction are more interested in shopping; therefore materialism determines directly and indirectly (mediated by life satisfaction) the desire of going shopping. There are only few studies that deal with this topic within Romanian consumers. The conceptual model proposed here was tested on a convenience sample of 390 Romanians. Using structural equation modelling, our findings confirm the hypothetical model only partially. Materialism leads to life dissatisfaction and shopping, but life dissatisfaction does not increase shopping. To the contrary, there is a positive relationship between life satisfaction and the desire for shopping. One possible explanation is that Romanians perceive materialism as a positive attitude. Anyway, nuances should be considered regarding the role of money and possession in bringing life satisfaction.

T1  - POLICE RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: SITUATIONS INVOLVING VETERANS EXHIBITING SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS
AN  - 1700676429; 201527750
AB  - Drawing on attribution theory, research on police discretion, and public attitudes toward mental illness, we examine attributional processes in police decision making in response to domestic violence situations involving veterans and nonveterans with signs of mental illness. Using data from experimental vignettes varying veteran status, victim injury, and suspect compliance administered to a sample of 309 police officers, the results indicate that 1) veterans are perceived as less responsible for troublesome behavior but more dangerous than nonveterans, 2) suspects' veteran status has a significant effect on officers' preference for mental health treatment versus arrest, and 3) part of the effect of veteran status on officer response is mediated by internal and external attributions for problematic behavior and by perceptions of dangerousness. The study empirically demonstrates countervailing processes in police decision making -- recognition of the causes for troublesome behavior and the need for mental health treatment on the one hand and concern for community safety and enforcing the law on the other.

T1  - How contact shapes implicit and explicit preferences: attitudes toward Roma children in inclusive and non-inclusive environment
AN  - 1674422111
AB  - In two studies, the authors examined the effects of intergroup contact in inclusive and non-inclusive environments on children's explicit and implicit prejudices. In both studies, supervised contact with Roma peers, instructed by inclusive program, led to a more positive explicit evaluation of Roma and less social distance, while it had no significant impact on implicit attitudes. In contrast, implicit attitudes were related to mere exposure to Roma (Study 2). Intergroup anxiety and self-disclosure mediated the effect of inclusiveness level on explicit, but not on implicit attitudes. The results indicate that two types of attitudes might be formed via different routes, and that mere exposure and supervised contact influence them differently. This information could help tailor future prejudice reduction programs.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1708525340; 201528947
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Developing public support for human rights in the United Kingdom: reasserting the importance of socio-economic rights
AN  - 1667948511; 201510371
AB  - Public support for human rights in the UK remains limited, partly as a result of misleading media coverage, as well as political hostility. The UK Human Rights Act, in particular, has been under sustained attack and is now threatened by the Conservative Party's drive to repeal it. We analyse recent quantitative and qualitative data on public attitudes in order to learn how to increase public support for human rights practice and principles. The conclusion we reach is that, in order to increase support for human rights in the UK, a central objective should be to shift the focus of human rights discourse so that it better reflects the every-day concerns of the UK public. We consider that this would best be achieved through emphasising socio-economic rights. This could be an especially relevant strategy in the current austerity context which presents both opportunities and threats with regard to mobilising support for human rights. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How initial cross-group friendships prepare for intercultural communication: The importance of anxiety reduction and self-confidence in communication
AN  - 1767330146; 201606290
AB  - We hypothesized that initial cross-group friendships lead to a reduction of intergroup anxiety and increase self-confidence in communication which in turn increases positive attitudes towards contact and facilitates further contact. Our hypotheses were derived from the Anxiety and Uncertainty Management theory of communication (AUM; Gudykunst, 2005a). This theory postulates that individuals are more likely to approach interpersonal communication with strangers when they are able to manage anxiety and uncertainty. In the present research, we considered intergroup anxiety and self-confidence in communication as mediators in this process. We tested the predicted model in a study with Spanish-speaking immigrants in Germany (N = 216). Initial cross-group friendships were measured retrospectively. Furthermore, we assessed current intergroup anxiety, current self-confidence in communication, current attitudes toward cross-group contact, as well as current contact and current time spent with friends from the receiving society. The predicted model showed a good fit. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - More Diverse Yet Less Tolerant? How the Increasingly Diverse Racial Landscape Affects White Americans' Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1708525734; 201528613
AB  - Recent Census Bureau projections indicate that racial/ethnic minorities will comprise over 50% of the U.S. population by 2042, effectively creating a so-called 'majority-minority' nation. Across four experiments, we explore how presenting information about these changing racial demographics influences White Americans' racial attitudes. Results reveal that exposure to the changing demographics evokes the expression of greater explicit and implicit racial bias. Specifically, Whites exposed to the racial demographic shift information preferred interactions/settings with their own ethnic group over minority ethnic groups; expressed more negative attitudes toward Latinos, Blacks, and Asian Americans; and expressed more automatic pro-White/anti-minority bias. Perceived threat to Whites' societal status mediated the effects of the racial shift information on explicit racial attitudes. These results suggest that rather than ushering in a more tolerant future, the increasing diversity of the nation may instead yield intergroup hostility. Implications for intergroup relations and media framing of the racial shift are discussed.

T1  - Gender Violence as a Social Problem in Spain: Attitudes and Acceptability
AN  - 1680151898; 201517786
AB  - Although violence against women (VAW) is not strictly a new phenomenon, its visibilization and the social rejection it produces are recent and, in this sense, it would be appropriate to consider it as an emerging social problem. This paper analyses how a particular form of this violence, intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW), is currently considered as a social problem in Spain. We present some data from different surveys carried out previously in Spain. Specifically, this review provides an overview of acceptability and public attitudes that support the use of this violence and focuses on the effect of gender and gender role attitudes. The data review shows that Spanish society as a whole, considers IPVAW as a social problem and rejects it, but there are still some violence-supportive attitudes, such as victim blaming, and also a gender gap in the consideration of this violence. We discuss the implications of these data on the management and prevention of IPVAW. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Why There?" Islamophobia, Environmental Conflict, and Justice at Ground Zero
AN  - 1460413797
AB  - Conflicts over environmental spaces that are sites of trauma or have been designated as sacred involve questions about who has a legitimate stake in determining the use of the site, and where the hallowedness attached to that space ends. We examine these questions in a study of the 2009-2010 controversy about the Park51 [sic] Islamic Community Center, sometimes called the "Ground Zero Mosque," to examine how issues of distributive, procedural, and inclusionary justice play out in a conflict over valuable land close to Ground Zero. This conflict, though in a specifically fraught locale, speaks to resistance to mosque construction in the USA and Europe. Using newspaper articles on the public debate as data (N = 65), and performing a thematic analysis, we identified four key themes: 1. views of Islam, 2. conflict, 3. American identity and ideals, and 4. proximity and place. Utilizing Chi square analyses to examine the effect of propinquity on support for Park51, we found that people living within New York City were more likely to support Park51 than those outside of the city. Our conclusion discusses constructs that link values, space, and social relations--hallowed ground, place attachment, social distance--and discuss their relationship to justice. We argue that while several kinds of justice are relevant, at its heart, this conflict concerns inclusionary questions about who can speak, who belongs, and who should be excluded.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The association between media exposure of interracial relationships and attitudes toward interracial relationships
AN  - 1433108267
AB  - From an extended contact hypothesis (ECH) framework, mass-media portrayals of interracial relationships may encourage positive attitudes toward such relationships. Caucasian participants (N=218) indicated examples of media portrayals of Black-White interracial relationships, attitudes toward Blacks, attitudes toward interracial relationships, degree of identification with Whites, and the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. Supporting our hypotheses, extended contact with Black-White relationships via media portrayals was associated with more positive attitudes toward Blacks and interracial relationships. These relationships were mediated by the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. This study furthers understanding of ECH by including representations of dyadic relationships and suggests an avenue for the creation of interventions for improving attitudes toward interracial relationships.

T1  - Iraq's Mental Health Crisis
AN  - 1417525482; 201332153
AB  - The mental health experiences of Iraqis during nearly ten years of international occupation have been underexamined. Contrary to media disinformation concerning "troop withdrawal" and "combat operation reductions," U.S. companies constructed permanent military bases and mega-embassies in Iraq. Added to which, some twenty thousand, UK mercenaries (from companies such as ArmorGroup and Aegis) are still operating in the country. Mental health specialists, including psychiatrists and psychologists, point to the fact that pre-invasion trauma is the underlying factor of Iraqis' mental health disorders, which the 2003 invasion exacerbated; pre-invasion trauma included the Anglo-American-imposed economic sanctions (which devastated the country), the terror of Saddam Husseins' torture regime, and the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). Improvements in mental health are hampered by a considerable lack of services in the country, stigmatic public attitudes to mental health disorders, ongoing traumas (such as sectarian violence and terrorism), and the disparity of the amount of attention given to the Western aggressor-states' military veterans and their Iraqi civilian counterparts.

T1  - Terrorist Events and Attitudes toward Immigrants: A Natural Experiment
AN  - 1438548938; 201340301
AB  - Using a quasi-experimental research design, this study examines the effect of terrorist events on the perception of immigrants across 65 regions in nine European countries. It first elaborates a theoretical argument that explains the effect of events and points to economic conditions, the size of the immigrant population, and personal contact as mediating factors. This argument is evaluated using the fact that the terror attack in Bali on October 12, 2002, occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey. The findings from this natural experiment reveal considerable cross-national and regional variation in the effect of the event and its temporal duration. The analysis on the regional level supports the argument about contextual variations in the response to the event and a second analysis based on the 2004 Madrid bombing confirms the study's conclusions. Implications of the findings for societal responses to terror attacks, the literature on attitudes toward immigrants, and survey research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagined intergroup contact promotes cooperation through outgroup trust
AN  - 1364700973; 201323148
AB  - The present research aims to investigate whether salience of memberships during imagined contact is necessary for producing generalized positive attitudes toward the outgroup and promoting intergroup cooperation. After a warm-up task that involved reciprocal self-disclosure during the imagined interaction with an outgroup member, we manipulated interpersonal versus intergroup features of imagined contact. Results indicated that participants who imagined a conversation with a Muslim focusing on intergroup differences subsequently reported more positive attitudes and cooperative intentions toward Muslim immigrants compared to either participants who imagined the interaction at the interpersonal level or participants in a control condition. Moreover, these effects were found to be mediated by outgroup trust. These findings attest to the strength of interventions based on imagined intergroup contact and suggest a possible implementation of the technique.

T1  - Improving intergroup attitudes via mediated intergroup contact in a bilingual setting
AN  - 1463012904; 201345887
AB  - This paper explores the role of mediated intergroup contact in improving intergroup attitudes between Italian speakers and German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy. Specifically, we examine how German-language television consumption affects attitudes towards the German-speaking group among Italian-speaking youth. The data (N = 229) were collected among Italian-speaking secondary school students in 2011. As expected, the results indicated that more German TV use was associated with more positive attitudes toward German speakers. A cognitive mediator (intergroup understanding) had a greater influence than an affective one (intergroup anxiety) in mediating the effect of TV use on attitudes. The effect of TV use on attitudes was greater among those who had less personal intergroup contact, but there were no differences in the effects of television based on variations in the local ethnolinguistic vitality of the two groups. Findings and implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Media Framing of Terrorism: Implications for Public Opinion, Civil Liberties, and Counterterrorism Policies
AN  - 1151969013
AB  - This study presents experimental findings on the impact of media framing of the 2005 London bombings. A total of 371 American participants were exposed to one of two frames to test their effect on public attitudes towards civil liberties and Muslims, and support for counterterrorism policies. Results show that the "domestic homegrown" frame produces greater increases in fear than the "international" frame. This leads to greater support for restricting civil liberties of Muslims and, under certain circumstances, general feelings of negativity toward Muslims. The study also finds support for the hydraulic effect of framing in that the domestic homegrown frame suppresses party identification in attitude formation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Unnecessary Roughness: ESPN's Construction of Hypermasculine Citizenship in the Penn State Sex Abuse Scandal
AN  - 1125219993; 201240664
AB  - This essay undertakes an analysis of ESPN's coverage of the "Penn State sex abuse scandal" during the first week following the release of the November 2011 Grand Jury presentment, which indicted former Penn State college football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky on 40 counts of criminal sexual abuse. Understanding ESPN's coverage-its particular framing of this story-is important and instructive, for it reveals how the news media shape public attitudes and opinions, pressure public officials, and model agentive citizenship in response to public traumas. Specifically, it is argued that ESPN's visual-narrative framing of the scandal perpetuates a hypermasculine (and heteronormative) fantasy of violent vigilante justice that reduces political agency to personal and private acts.

T1  - Disabling communications? A capabilities perspective on media access, social inclusion and communication policy
AN  - 1494750455; 201402949
AB  - Digital information and communication technologies feature prominently in programmes to promote social inclusion and to implement extensive reform in public service provision across Europe. The transition to an all-digital communications environment and the digital 'switchover' of public services bring to the fore a need to rethink access as a goal of public policy. This article probes patterns of internet diffusion among disabled people using capabilities framework and resource-based models of access. The analysis highlights the multi-dimensional character of media access capability as the space to evaluate policies for social inclusion; the relational character of disability as a phenomenon of the interface between personal circumstances and structural disadvantage; a capability failure resulting from a gap in policy commitment to promote universal access for disabled people and other excluded groups; and a requirement for policies sensitive to the need for additional resources to equalize the media access capabilities of these individuals.

T1  - On the F word: A corpus-based analysis of the media representation of feminism in British and German press discourse, 1990-2009
AN  - 1221409167; 201245362
AB  - Research in social psychology has shown that public attitudes towards feminism are mostly based on stereotypical views linking feminism with leftist politics and lesbian orientation. It is claimed that such attitudes are due to the negative and sexualised media construction of feminism. Studies concerned with the media representation of feminism seem to confirm this tendency. While most of this research provides significant insights into the representation of feminism, the findings are often based on a small sample of texts. Also, most of the research was conducted in an Anglo-American setting. This study attempts to address some of the shortcomings of previous work by examining the discourse of feminism in a large corpus of German and British newspaper data. It does so by employing the tools of Corpus Linguistics. By investigating the collocation profiles of the search term feminism, we provide evidence of salient discourse patterns surrounding feminism in two different cultural contexts.

T1  - "The Littlest Science" Revisited
AN  - 1125224100; 201240036
AB  - I revisit Allan Mazur's 1968 claim that sociology is "The Littlest Science." In doing so, I review four decades of disciplinary battles on how sociology might raise its scientific profile. I examine data on public attitudes toward sociology as a science and how sociology is perceived by the larger scientific community. I conclude that taking a more interdisciplinary perspective will improve the scientific status of sociology. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gendered Capital: Childhood Socialization and the "Boy Crisis" in Education
AN  - 896168766; 201121939
AB  - This study examined the effect of gender socialization on kindergarten grades using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten Cohort. The sample consisted of 6,394 children (3,177 girls; 3,217 boys) from across the United States. MANOVA and follow-up tests revealed that both boys and girls tend to participate in gender-typed activities. Girls are more likely to have positive school attitudes and exhibit positive social behavior; boys are more likely to have negative school attitudes. Regression analyses indicated that participation in "female" activities and positive social behavior positively affect grades; participation in "male" activities has no direct effect. Positive attitudes positively affect the grades of girls; negative attitudes negatively affect the grades of boys. Teacher evaluation practices are also considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What's in a Name? The Effects of the Labels "Fat" Versus "Overweight" on Weight Bias
AN  - 1545064598
AB  - This research examined the effects of the labels "fat" vs. "overweight" in the expression of weight bias, with the prediction that the label "fat" biases individuals to respond more negatively than does the label "overweight." In Study 1, participants' attitudes toward people labeled as fat were less favorable than were their attitudes toward people labeled as overweight. In Studies 2 and 3, although participants chose similar-sized figures to depict fat and overweight targets, weight stereotypes and weight attitudes were more negative toward people labeled as fat than those labeled as overweight. In addition, the endorsement of weight stereotypes mediated the biasing effect of the "fat" label on weight prejudice. Implications of this work for prejudice researchers and for public attitudes are discussed.

T1  - Exploring the representation of orality: the use of vocatives in two Spanish-speaking films, Machuca and Volver
AN  - 1022501252
AB  - This paper investigates how vocatives are exploited in the fictional language of two Spanish speaking films: 'Machuca', a Chilean film (2004) and 'Volver', a Spanish film (2006). The aim of this paper is to determine the manner in which the use of vocatives in these films mirrors the functions that they have in naturally occurring data and how they are exploited in order to enhance the representation of orality in the fictional dialogues. Vocatives are considered to be one of the distinctive features of natural speech (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad and Finegan, 1999; Leech, 1999; McCarthy and O'Keeffe, 2003). The presence of vocatives in films and in similar fictional texts appears to be a contributory factor in the establishment of the social markers of the interactions in which the characters of the film engage, signalling levels of social distance, as well as levels of power and solidarity that the viewing audiences can recognise. Previous research has shown that the use of vocatives, although apparently non-essential for the achievement of particular communicative goals, serves an important social role in a communicative interaction, projecting the level of intimacy established between the participants (McCarthy and O'Keeffe, 2003). The importance of understanding pragmatic variation will be highlighted by comparing the use of vocatives in the two different cultural and linguistic settings represented in the films.

T1  - The Art of Narrating and the Question of Cultural Acknowledgment: The Case of <i>Die Kinder von Golzow</i> and a Reunified Germany
AN  - 1994216862
AB  - Some twenty years since the reunification of Germany, the cultural and interpersonal communication between eastern and western Germans remains problematic – complicated by oversimplified media representations of the GDR-past that induce an attitude of mistrust towards eastern Germans as well as making them feel unacknowledged. This paper explores the question of German integration post-1989 through an analysis of the documentary series Die Kinder von Golzow (Winfried and Winfried, 1961–2005). The aim is to show how the series, even if marginal in the public memory, offers a cultural meeting ground by narrating the recent past from the perspective of everyday-life. The paper argues that the construction of a political community is not only the result of institutional politics, but also of everyday praxis. In other words, it is necessary to distinguish between two levels of integration in the case of the reunification of Germany: on the one hand the acceptance of institutions of the Federal Republic; and on the other the exchange of historical (collective and individual) experiences, since these form the basis of a cultural and mutual acknowledgment of identity and difference among eastern and western Germans.

T1  - Widening the Psychiatric Gaze: Reflections on PsychoDoctor, Depression, and Recent Transitions in Japanese Mental Health Care
AN  - 1037877392; 201233863
AB  - Japan has one of the world's highest rates of psychiatric institutionalization, and popular images of mental health care and public attitudes toward mental illness there have been stigmatized for decades. However, there are transitions underway that are reshaping the mental health care landscape as well as affecting public representations of mental illness. Those transitions include attempts to promote community-based care, move away from long-term hospitalization, reduce stigma, increase utilization of services, and bring clinical psychological services under the national health insurance umbrella. This article discusses one cultural representation in which those transitions are brought into relief: a 2002 television series entitled PsychoDoctor that portrayed the clinical practice of a psychiatrist. The article analyzes the messages inherent in the series about the nature of mental illness, the everyday-ness of sufferers, and the expanded repertoire of treatments now available. In so doing, the article suggests that the efforts of progressive clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and mental health activists to put forth new images of mental illness and mental health care are now having a degree of success in the arena of popular culture.
