T1  - Suburban commons: the rise of suburban social movements and new urban commons in marginalized neighbourhoods in Stockholm
AN  - 2653085885
AB  - The Swedish universal welfare state has transformed since the 1990s into a mixed welfare model with increasing deregulation, recommodification, and reverse distribution from the public to the private sector where capital and influence have concentrated. In major cities such as Stockholm, this has resulted in a polarization where groups in the city centre and residential areas have accumulated wealth and resources while groups in marginalized suburbs and neighbourhoods have faced increasing social exclusion and marginalization. Public sector social work has long focused on individual case work, whereas this development calls for increasing community work initiatives. In this article, we analyse the rise of urban social movements mobilizing for inclusion, influence, and social justice as important aspects of contemporary community work in the Swedish urban periphery. Through analysis of semi-structured interviews with community workers and activists as well as media articles, reports, and web-based materials, the results show how the mobilization of the organization Megafonen has contributed to the development of new social institutions and urban commons.

T1  - Creating online participatory research spaces: insights from creative, digitally mediated research with children during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2651148299
AB  - Our article draws on research undertaken with children during the 2020‐21 COVID-19 pandemic in order to consider the potential of digitally mediated participatory research for child-centred research practice. Our specific focus is on how children’s inclusion can be centred in the absence of opportunities to meet in person. We reflect on how we sought to support children’s engagement through offline and online creative activities and explore how these digitally mediated spaces can facilitate children’s inclusion, creative engagement and dialogue. We offer examples from our arts-based, digitally mediated research to consider how researchers might work remotely, yet inclusively, in contexts where children have been marginalised and their voices silenced. Our research suggests that scaffolding creative activities through bespoke digital animation and asynchronous chat can facilitate children to participate in ways of their choosing. However, to address equity of inclusion researchers must attend to the contingencies of children’s digital, material and social exclusion.

T1  - Racial Ideology in Government Films: The Past and Present of the US Information Service’s <i>Men of the Forest</i> (1952)
AN  - 2679722319
AB  - Movies beyond the scope of Hollywood and entertainment have shaped notions of race in American culture since the early decades of cinema. A range of nontheatrical sponsors and creators in the US made films to serve practical functions in society—to inform, to organize, to persuade, to promote, etc. The US federal government was a major sponsor of many of these films, which provided American and foreign audiences depictions of race that differed considerably from popular commercial images. For example, Men of the Forest, a film made in 1952 by the United States Information Service focuses on the Hunters, a Black family who owns land and a forestry business in rural Georgia. A documentary of sorts, the film highlights Black life, work, and land ownership in the South in ways not seen in popular feature films of the day. Yet, in the film and others like it, histories of institutional racism are woven into cinematic form and content in ways that are distinct from the entertainment industry. The creators of Men of the Forest omit details of segregation in the South to emphasize the Hunter family as examples of American democracy, a choice suited to the film’s Cold War purpose: to counter the anti-American message of Soviet propaganda for foreign audiences. On one hand, by producing and distributing the film, the federal government acknowledged Black farmers and landowners in the Jim Crow South. On the other hand, it avoided the structural inequality surrounding the Hunters to frame their reality as an example of American democratic progress for international circulation. Today, government films like Men of the Forest prompt contemporary reflection on the institutional histories they represent and their evolution into the present. The film and many others are available online due to the digitization of collections from the National Archives, Library of Congress, and elsewhere. With this increase in access, contemporary scholars have the ability to investigate how the federal government and its various internal entities mediated racial ideologies with moving image technologies. As an example of such research, this essay examines Men of the Forest by focusing on the past and present contradictions that arise from its depiction of a Black family with land and an agricultural business in rural Georgia. Two recent events shed light on the histories reflected in the film and their contemporary significance. In 2018, Descendants of Men of the Forest, The Legacy Continues—a documentary created by family members of the film’s original participants—contextualized the original production as evidence of the Hunter family’s legacy in the community of Guyton, Georgia. Underlying this local effort, Men of the Forest serves as an important historical event and record of the family and the community. On a broader scale, in March 2021, Congress passed a large relief package for disadvantaged minority farmers, intended to help alleviate decades of systemic racism in government agricultural programs. Lawsuits from white farmers and conservative organizations followed quickly, challenging the provision of government aid based on race. In this federal context, Men of the Forest exposes an institutional image of individual success that downplays the structural racism facing people of color, especially those with agricultural livelihoods. Even as politics and legislation evolve, this vision of democracy once exported by the federal government has widespread currency and accumulating effects. The connections between Men of the Forest and these recent events reveal the racial politics at play in government films and the ways in which they take shape in the real world beyond the screen.

T1  - To do or not to do? Technological and social factors affecting vaccine coverage
AN  - 2623900431
AB  - This paper investigates the role of crucial technological and social factors in enhancing or undermining vaccine coverage rates at the country level worldwide. Employing five country-level databases, it explores how different combinations of technology diffusion (that is, social media penetration) and social conditions (functional literacy and attitude toward science) affect the level of vaccine coverage. The analyses are based on two built ad-hoc longitudinal datasets of 36 and 40 countries worldwide, employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA) approach. The findings highlight that, at the country level, the absence of high social media penetration, combined with an above-average level of functional literacy and positive attitude toward science, enable vaccine coverage to reach the level recommended by health institutions and authorities.

T1  - Epistemic Exclusion of Women Faculty and Faculty of Color: Understanding Scholar(ly) Devaluation as a Predictor of Turnover Intentions
AN  - 2615863001
AB  - Faculty diversity has received increased attention from researchers and institutions of higher education, yet faculty demographics have not changed substantially for many underrepresented groups. Several barriers to the retention of women and faculty of color have been offered, including a lack of belonging, discrimination, social exclusion, and tokenism. Epistemic exclusion, scholarly marginalization rooted in disciplinary and identity-based biases, is theorized to act as another barrier to the retention of these faculty. The present study examines the effect of scholarly devaluation, a primary component of epistemic exclusion, on faculty workplace outcomes using data from 1,341 tenure-track faculty from a predominantly White, research-intensive institution. We found that women and underrepresented faculty of color reported higher perceptions of scholarly devaluation. Further, scholarly devaluation was associated with higher intentions to leave the university and this relationship was mediated by lower job satisfaction and poorer perceptions of the workplace climate. Notably, the negative consequences of perceiving scholarly devaluation were found for all faculty, not just women and faculty of color. We discuss the implications of these findings for retaining marginalized faculty and for institutions of higher education more broadly.

T1  - Can Online Communication Prevent Depression Among Older People? A Longitudinal Analysis
AN  - 2609041751
AB  - Evidence on the association between internet usage and incidence of depression remains mixed. We examined the associations between different categories of internet usage and developing clinical depression. We used data from the 2013 and 2016 waves of the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) comprising 12,333 physically and cognitively independent adults aged ≥65 years. Participants were engaged in seven categories of internet usage: communication with friends/family, social media, information collection about health/medicine, searching for medical facilities, purchase of drugs and vitamins, shopping, and banking. We found that internet use for communication had a protective influence on the probability of developing clinical depression defined as the Geriatric Depression Scale scores ≥5 or self-reported diagnosed depression. Our findings support the role of online communication with friends/family in preventing clinical depression among older people. Online communication could be particularly useful in the COVID-19 crisis because many families are geographically dispersed and/or socially distanced.

T1  - “We Don’t Have Those American Problems”: Anti-Black Practices in Canada’s Rap Music Marketplace, 1985–2020
AN  - 2678457756
AB  - Beginning in the early to mid 1980s, Hip Hop culture appeared on Canadian stages and in homes, even as it was limited in supply on commercial radio and television. Unlike their American counterparts, mainstream Canadian emcees (many of whom were racialized as Black and identified with the city of Toronto) were notably dependent upon personal finances, under-resourced independent record labels, distribution deals, and state and not-for-profit grant monies to subsidize the conceptualization, production, and promotion of their art. Labelled “urban music” in an attempt to spatialize and covertly reference Blackness, Hip Hop in Canada, from the outset, was mapped against, in conflict with, and outside of the national imaginary. While building local scenes, an independent label system, and a cross-Canada college radio, television, and live music infrastructure and audience, Hip Hop artists developed spaces of resistance, circumvented industry-generated obstacles, and defined success on their own terms — all of which suggested that they were not solely at the will of the dominant white music industry. And yet artists simultaneously encountered anti-Black practices that constrained the creation and sustenance of a nationwide Hip Hop infrastructure and denoted an inequitable structuring of support for the arts in Canada. By examining the interface of Blackness, art, and the racial economy of Canada’s creative industries, this article will outline instances of Canada’s anti-Black racism as well as the challenges Hip Hop artists and industry professionals have faced in the areas of recording and label relations, music sales, broadcasting regulations, and the accolade system. These social relations — many of which are rooted in longer histories of race relations and anti-Blackness in Canada — resulted in industry-wide policies, practices, norms, and ideologies that unfairly disadvantaged Black artists and undermined the realization and marketplace potential of a Hip Hop infrastructure within and beyond Canada.Alternate abstract:
Depuis le début des années 1980 jusqu’au milieu de cette décennie, la culture du hip-hop est apparue sur la scène canadienne et dans les ménages, même si sa diffusion était limitée sur les radios et télévisions commerciales. À l’inverse de leurs confrères américains, les principaux rappeurs canadiens (nombre d’entre eux furent racialisés comme Noirs et s’identifièrent à la ville de Toronto) dépendaient notamment de leurs budgets personnels, de la modicité des ressources de maisons de disque indépendantes, des contrats de distribution, ainsi que des subventions d’organismes publics et sans but lucratif pour financer la conceptualisation, la production et la promotion de leur art. Étiqueté comme étant de la « musique urbaine » dans une tentative visant à faire discrètement référence aux Noirs et à les spatialiser, le hip-hop au Canada, dès le départ, a été mis en correspondance avec des pratiques extérieures à l’imaginaire national, en conflit avec ce dernier. Tout en bâtissant des scènes locales, un système de disque indépendant, une radio et une télévision universitaires pancanadiennes, ainsi qu’une infrastructure musicale et des prestations devant un public, les artistes de hip-hop parvinrent à développer des espaces de résistance, à contourner des obstacles créés par l’industrie musicale et à définir le succès en leurs propres termes, toute chose qui suggère que ces artistes ne dépendaient pas exclusivement de la volonté de l’industrie musicale à dominante blanche. Pourtant, au même moment, ces musiciens faisaient face à des pratiques discrimatoires qui entravèrent la création et le développement d’une infrastructure du hip-hop à l’échelle du pays, ce qui traduisait un traitement inéquitable en matière de soutien aux artistes canadiens. En examinant l’interface noir, art, et l’économie raciale des industries créatives au Canada, le présent article donne un aperçu des cas de racisme anti-Noir ainsi que des difficultés rencontrées par les artistes de hip-hop et des professionnels de l’industrie en ce qui concerne l’enregistrement et les relations avec les maisons de disque, les ventes de disques, la réglementation régissant l’industrie de la radiodiffusion, ainsi que le système de reconnaissance et de récompense des artistes. Ces relations sociales, dont bon nombre sont enracinées dans une longue tradition de relations raciales et de racisme à l’égard des Noirs au Canada, ont donné lieu à des politiques, des pratiques, des normes et des idéologies à l’échelle de l’industrie qui ont injustement défavorisé les artistes noirs et compromis la réalisation et le potentiel du marché d’une infrastructure du hip-hop au Canada et ailleurs.

T1  - Taking responsibility for the tooth: A semiotic and thematic analysis of oral health and disease in the TV show ‘Embarrassing Bodies’
AN  - 2578074465
AB  - Oral health and dentistry are seldom the subject of medical reality TV. This study investigates whether the dental segments within the British medical reality show, ‘Embarrassing Bodies’, may contribute to the anthropological understanding of oral health and social status, through semiotic and thematic analysis. This methodology involves close examination of both the visual and narrative themes within the programme. The show presents mouths afflicted by oral disease as traumascapes, the framing of which provides voyeuristic appeal. The portrayal of dental disease as negatively affecting human flourishing through shame and the inhibition of intimacy was common across the analysed cases. The key themes of intimacy and social distance; discipline, blame and personal responsibility; carnography; disciplining gaze and authority; and redemption and rebirth were identified through analysis. The cases also present a strong correlation between a lack of personal responsibility and the development of dental disease within the wider context of social class, with the dentist as a disciplining authority, enforcing professional and societal norms.

T1  - The social neuroscience of music: Understanding the social brain through human song
AN  - 2626955464
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that people can adapt quickly to ensure that their social needs are met after being forced to isolate and socially distance. Many individuals turned immediately to music, as evidenced by people singing from balconies, watching live concerts on social media, and group singing online. In this article, we show how these musical adaptations can be understood through the latest advances in the social neuroscience of music-an area that, to date, has been largely overlooked. By streamlining and synthesizing prior theory and research, we introduce a model of the brain that sheds light on the social functions and brain mechanisms that underlie the musical adaptations used for human connection. We highlight the role of oxytocin and the neurocircuitry associated with reward, stress, and the immune system. We show that the social brain networks implicated in music production (in contrast to music listening) overlap with the networks in the brain implicated in the social processes of human cognition-mentalization, empathy, and synchrony-all of which are components of herding; moreover, these components have evolved for social affiliation and connectedness. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a starting point for an improved understanding of the relationship between music and the social brain, and we outline goals for future research in the social neuroscience of music. In a time when people across the globe have been unable to meet in person, they have found a way to meet in the music.

T1  - A video intervention for every straight man: The role of preattitudes and emotions in vicarious-contact effects: GPIR
AN  - 2573357340
AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact can help to reduce prejudice. We tested the effect of a controlled, video-based vicarious-contact intervention on straight men’s (implicit and explicit) attitudes toward gay men. Findings of Experiment 1 (n = 99 German participants) failed to show direct effects but were in line with the idea that negative (situation-specific) emotions mediate the intervention effect. Experiment 2 (n = 108 U.S. participants) expanded findings: straight men with antigay preattitudes reported less negative intergroup emotions toward gay men after watching the vicarious-contact video (compared to the control condition); and less negative intergroup emotions were related to more positive attitudes toward gay men. For straight men with positive preattitudes, findings were in line with the hypothesis that positive intergroup emotions toward gay men were the relevant mediator. We discuss the moderating role of preattitudes to explain processes underlying vicarious-contact effects.

T1  - The media image of Chinese older people: From stigmatic stereotype to diverse self-representation
AN  - 2566220289
AB  - From the perspective of communication and media studies, this article explores a comparison between the image of older adults presented on media and online self-representation facilitated by the use of smartphones. The qualitative textual analysis was conducted with a sample (228 posts, from 1 January to 31 December,2019) selected from a representative WeChat Public Account targeting at older adults in China. The results demonstrate that leisure and recreation is the most frequently mentioned topic (58%) with memories of past life receiving the least references (3%). The striking features of popular posts among older people include a highly emotional tone, bright colours and multimedia. Sentiment analyses shows 68.42%, 13.16% and 18.42% of positive, neutral and negative emotions, respectively. A generally positive attitude of self-representation is in a sharp contrast with the stigmatic media image of older adults. The article concludes that the visibility of Chinese older people may help to reduce the stigma surrounding old age in China.

T1  - Age-related differences in the perception of COVID-19 emergency during the Italian outbreak
AN  - 2544356778
AB  - ObjectivesOlder adults have been identified as a high-risk population for COVID-19, therefore it is crucial to understand how they perceived and reacted to the emergency. We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures.Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18–29 years), middle-aged (30–50 years), and older (65–85 years) adults’ self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules.Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged.Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.

T1  - Race/Ethnicity, Parental Support, and Youth Depressive Symptoms: A Moderated Longitudinal Mediation Analysis
AN  - 2543895151
AB  - Racial/ethnic disparities in depression exist among youth in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine if parental support trajectories in adolescence explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and depressive symptom trajectories in adulthood. A two-step longitudinal parallel process analysis with multigroup structural equation modeling was conducted with a nationally representative sample of youth (N = 5300; 48.5% female; M = 13.33 (Range:12–15) years at baseline). While parental support trajectories did not mediate the relationship between race/ethnicity and depressive symptoms, parental support trajectories were related to depressive symptom trajectories in adulthood. Immigrant generation status also moderated the relationship between race/ethnicity and depressive symptom trajectories. The results demonstrate the impact of parental support on later mental health outcomes regardless of race/ethnicity.

T1  - Terrorizing Muslims: Communal Violence and Emergence of Hindutva in India
AN  - 2561335887
AB  - Independent India has witnessed a surge of right-wing militant Hindu extremism since the 1980s. The long term political and ideological goal of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is to create a Hindu Rashtra through propagating Hindutva. To realize this goal, proponents of Hindutva radicalize youth and children with conservative and fictional thoughts which lead to Islamophobia. This paper examines the link between radicalization and spread of Hindutva discourse, and communal violence. It also surveys campaigns used by the VHP to prevent proselytism. The paper also analyses how RSS aims to rewrite textbooks and control education patterns and establish conservative schools to further its interests. Findings of the paper also indicate that governments have been either complicit or negligent while dealing with Muslim riot victims. Analysis of news article regarding communal violence involving Hindus and Muslims indicate that the media acts as an echo chamber and enable Hindutva and Islamophobia in India.

T1  - The Absent Black Father: Race, The Welfare-Child Support System, and the Cyclical Nature of Fatherlessness
AN  - 2561963896
AB  - The perception of Black fathers is that they are largely absent from their children's lives, and that such absence-and the ensuing experience of growing up fatherless-is a direct cause of social issues in Black communities. Through media representations and policymaking, the absent Black father narrative has taken shape over the past fifty years, giving rise to the belief that fatherlessness is a distinctly Black issue. To safeguard against misplaced assumptions, this Comment proposes a new, cyclical model by which to view fatherlessness. Rather than a linear process that ascribes the blame for Black plight to Black fathers, this Comment posits that socially constructed notions of race and stringent welfare-child support laws perpetuate the absent Black father stereotype. This cycle begins with a Black father being absent from the home; he then has child support enforced against him, irrespective of his ability to pay; consequently, the child takes on the identity of being fatherless and the father who cannot pay child support is rendered deadbeat. This produces real social consequences, which feed back into the social perception of Black fatherlessness. Through this lens, this Comment assesses incentives in state child support enforcement and questions whether states are actually motivated to push Black fathers out of their homes. Ultimately, this Comment concludes that understanding fatherlessness as both socially and legally constructed can help eliminate the trope of the absent Black father.

T1  - Using Twitter to Understand the Effects of the Cameroon Anglophone Crisis on Social Determinants of Health
AN  - 2577525683
AB  - Insufficient opportunities to collect data on public health exist in armed conflict regions. Increased use of social media during war and conflict has allowed for data collection in situations where information is usually difficult to obtain. In this study, Twitter, a public social media platform, was used as a source of data and information to gain insight into how the Cameroon Anglophone Crisis impacts public health in the population. Our findings revealed that Twitter was being used to share information and call for action. Analysis of tweets revealed 8 distinct themes, which illustrated the impact of the crisis on the social determinants of health: neglect from government related to the social determinants of health; education; loss of employment; increased poverty; housing and homelessness; social exclusion and oppression; women and gender inequality; and health services. This study provides insight into the significant impact on public health in Cameroon caused by the Anglophone Crisis, and demonstrates the potential benefits of social media for gathering information about public health in crisis situations.

T1  - Exploring religiosity and attitudes towards Christians and non-believers among recent Muslim refugees to Finland
AN  - 2516240751
AB  - This study is among the first to investigate the religiosity patterns, identity motives and attitudes towards Christians and non-believers among recent Muslim refugees in Finland (N = 128). There are two novelties in this study. First, it applies the religious orientation framework to study religious identities among Muslim refugees in Europe. Second, it combines a variable- and person-centred approach to study religiosity in the context of intergroup relations. Using the variable-centred approach with a multiple mediation analysis, we found that refugees' extrinsic religiosity was associated with more positive attitudes towards Christians. Neither intrinsic religiosity nor participants' religious identity motives were associated with out-group attitudes. Using the person-centred approach with a Two-Step cluster analysis, we showed that individuals with higher levels of intrinsic as compared to extrinsic religiosity and those with pronounced religious identity motives were more biased towards non-believers than towards Christians. Attitudes towards Christians and non-believers were similarly positive in a group characterised by equal levels of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity. We discuss these findings in light of the role of religiosity in understanding Muslim refugees' attitudes towards receiving societies.

T1  - The Cycle of Violence: Examining Attitudes Toward and Experiences of Corporal Punishment in a Representative German Sample
AN  - 2477170666
AB  - The use of corporal punishment (CP) is controversial despite the negative consequences of its use that have been documented. Consequences include the use of CP by those who experienced CP themselves, described in the theory of the cycle of violence. There are little data on the cycle of violence, especially on those who break it and in representative samples. This study examines the cycle of violence in a representative sample by analyzing experiences of and attitudes toward CP. Attitudes toward, and own experiences of, CP by their parents were assessed in a sample of 2,519 individuals (female 54.6%, age range = 14-99 years, M = 48.9 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of participants who support and oppose CP. Breaking the cycle, defined as having experienced CP and opposing CP, was examined. Factors associated with positive and negative attitudes toward CP were identified using group comparisons and binary logistic regression. The majority of the sample opposed CP (56%), whereas one third supported less severe forms of CP and 8.2% also supported severe CP. Those supporting CP reported having experienced CP by their parents more often. Of those who had experienced CP, 47% were identified as breaking the cycle. Female gender, younger age, not being divorced, and being married and living together, as well as a higher level of education were associated with breaking the cycle. Even though CP was legally banned in Germany, a relatively high proportion still reports positive attitudes toward and experiences of CP. The ban of CP by the federal government seems to be an effective measure to change attitudes on a societal level as rates were lower in comparison with earlier studies. Future studies should examine interactions between different types of CP, attitudes toward its use, and additional mediating factors.

T1  - Confidence in social institutions, perceived vulnerability and the adoption of recommended protective behaviors in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2509312367
AB  - The current worldwide COVID19 pandemic has required the rapid and drastic adoption of social distancing and protective measures as the leading method for reducing the spread of the disease and death. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of such measures in a large sample of the Brazilian population. We relied on recreancy theory, which argues that confidence in the ability of social institutions and perceived vulnerability to the disease are central factors predicting the adoption of these behaviors. Our results, drawn from 7554 respondents, indicate that self-confidence in the ability to carry out these behaviors, confidence in the ability of social institutions such as the government, hospitals, health workers and the media to cope with the pandemic crisis, and risk perceptions are associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors. Our results expand the recreancy theory and show that beyond the main effects, the effect of perceived vulnerability depends on the values of self-confidence and confidence in social institutions. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - SDP's Winning Strategy for a Post-COVID-19 Era
AN  - 2555682802
AB  - The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic left its mark irrevocably and demonstrated how small our globalized world remains. Its significant health, economic, and emotional effects impacted everyone's daily lives, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, class, religion, or gender. In doing so, the pandemic reinforced our interdependence and refocused attention to the fact that we are all citizens of the same fragile world. Our shared humanity was highlighted in new ways as communities worldwide, despite their differences, sought common guarantees: the ability to earn decent livelihoods, access to healthcare, the well-being of loved ones, and the comfort offered by families and friends, no matter how socially-distanced they may be. Many believed the lack of connective tissue was due to the absence of real-time competitions. Throughout the ensuing months, social media revealed just how much people missed watching live sports, engaging in the rituals and conversations that surround them, and playing/engaging in sports activities on multiple levels.

T1  - Group-level resistance to health mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic: A groupthink approach
AN  - 2446025536
AB  - Public health interventions, such as mandated vaccinating or quarantining during an epidemic, are necessary to limit the spread of communicable diseases, but in many cases, certain groups resist these initiatives. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, antiquarantine groups protested the mandate to socially distance and remain at home, claiming these directives violated their right to assemble, travel, and work. The current analysis examined media descriptions of these antiquarantine groups to determine if these groups' divergent responses to a legally and medically warranted health initiative resulted from groupthink: the deterioration of judgment and rationality that sometimes occurs in groups. In support of this possibility, accounts of these groups indicated that (a) the conditions that cause groupthink, including high levels of cohesion and isolation, were present and potent within these groups and that (b) the groups exhibited many of the symptoms of groupthink, including group illusions and pressures to conform. Given the ubiquity of these groups-for centuries, public health interventions have generated opposing antiregulation reactions-no amount of planning may be sufficient to prevent such groups. However, a theory-driven approach based on groupthink suggests that group-level interventions that directly address the processes that cause groupthink, such as isolation, conformity pressure, and cohesion, could reduce the influence of such groups on their members and on society.

T1  - Coping with social wounds: How social pain and social anxiety influence access to social rewards
AN  - 2438219833
AB  - Background and objectives: Prior studies have shown that people display signs of increased social approach motivation and affiliative behaviour in response to social exclusion. This response is considered an adaptive strategy that serves to repair damage to social networks and increase access to mood-enhancing social rewards. However, heightened trait social anxiety (SA) has been linked to decreased approach motivation and responsiveness to social rewards. In the current preliminary experimental study, we tested whether trait SA inhibits the expected increase in social approach following the pain of exclusion. We then tested whether diminished social approach is associated with reduced positive affect. Methods: Participants played a game of Cyberball and were randomly assigned to receive significantly fewer passes (exclusion condition) or an equal number of passes (control condition) as other players. Subsequently, participants were given the opportunity to engage in an online social interaction activity with avatars they believed were other participants. Results: Analyses revealed that the exclusion condition led to greater social pain than the control condition. Across conditions, greater social pain was associated with higher levels of approach motivation in anticipation of the social interaction activity, but only for individuals with lower levels of trait SA. Finally, when controlling for levels of trait SA, social pain was associated with positive affect following the social interaction activity, but only for individuals with higher levels of approach motivation. Limitations: Participants consisted predominantly of female undergraduates, limiting generalizability of these data. As well, hypotheses were supported for the measure of approach motivation but not the measure of approach behaviour. Finally, this study was not powered to enable moderated mediation analyses, which would have provided the most direct test of the hypothesized model. Conclusions: Heightened approach motivation in the face of social pain may facilitate increased positive affect. However, higher levels of trait SA dampen approach motivation. Future well-powered studies should use moderated mediation analyses to test the hypothesized model more parsimoniously.

T1  - The normalization of exclusion through a Revival of whiteness in Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign discourse
AN  - 2435504620
AB  - This article is based on the thesis that the language employed during the Trump campaign and the narrative created in his public speeches and social media posts played a decisive role in increasing white voter turnout and thus contributed to a significant extent to Trump’s victory. I argue that Trump won the presidency not despite having run what the Washington Post called “the most racist, xenophobic, misogynistic campaign for president in memory,” but because of it. The often openly abusive, hateful, and nativist discourse of the Trump campaign is the result of a strategic decision to create a winning coalition, a new, old covenant, of white Americans eager to reinstate a vision of a pre-diversity America. In his campaign speeches, Trump employed a number of discursive strategies that supported the normalization of verbal behavior that was previously seen as unacceptable. These include the creation of fear, racialization, discrimination, stigmatization and de-stigmatization, scapegoating and victimization, as well as othering and social exclusion. All of these strategies need to be seen against the background of discursively constructed imaginaries of whiteness where the exclusion of un-American others in Trump’s campaign discourse is closely linked with an articulation of America as a white nation.

It was hypothesized that there would be differences in participants attitudes based on experimental condition, with participants exposed to negative portrayals reporting more negative attitudes compared to the other experimental conditions. Factors related to participant susceptibility to media portrayals were also examined and were hypothesized to include participant age, race, biological sex, social class, and political and religious affiliation. Significant differences were found based on experimental condition for viewing immigration as an economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity threat as well as physical benefits of immigration, intolerant attitudes toward immigrants, and affective-behavioral and cognitive Islamophobia. Participants who were primed with negative media portrayals reported more negative attitudes. In addition, biological sex, race, social class, and political and religious affiliation were found to relate to participant susceptibility to media portrayals of immigration and refugees. Implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Demonization and violence as tools of institutional power: the social cage of Thailand
AN  - 2423456792
AB  - Demonization has been used as tool for the maintenance of ruling regimes throughout history. Institutionalized, it becomes regime policy, exemplified in the extreme by the German Nazi regime’s demonization of Jews. Dehumanized imagery is used to distinguish ‘others’, i.e. social, cultural, political, and/or economic out-groups, from ‘normal’ members of society and to support the power and control ambitions of those who hold or seek to hold dominant societal positions. Demonization is institutionalized through interaction among a variety of cultural carriers including religion, news media, and popular culture. It is used as an excuse for social exclusion and violence. It is most dangerous when it receives tacit acceptance or active support by central societal institutions, including government. The current article considers the processes and products of demonization in Thailand as it has appeared in national politics. Demonization has proven to be a strategic tool deployed by Thailand’s ‘social cage’ to harm those who have sought political change and threaten its established institutional interests.

T1  - How language shapes prejudice against women: An examination across 45 world languages.
AN  - 2419108107
AB  - Language provides an ever-present context for our cognitions and has the ability to shape them. Languages across the world can be gendered (language in which the form of noun, verb, or pronoun is presented as female or male) versus genderless. In an ongoing debate, one stream of research suggests that gendered languages are more likely to display gender prejudice than genderless languages. However, another stream of research suggests that language does not have the ability to shape gender prejudice. In this research, we contribute to the debate by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) method which captures the meaning of a word from the context in which it occurs. Using text data from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project (that contains text from billions of publicly facing websites) across 45 world languages, covering the majority of the world's population, we test for gender prejudice in gendered and genderless languages. We find that gender prejudice occurs more in gendered rather than genderless languages. Moreover, we examine whether genderedness of language influences the stereotypic dimensions of warmth and competence utilizing the same NLP method.

T1  - The dual path of the rejection (dis)identification model: A study on adolescents with a migrant background
AN  - 2408790854
AB  - Ethnic‐based rejection, especially when prolonged over time, can result in withdrawal (e.g., resignation) and antisocial (e.g., delinquent) behaviors. Rejection (dis)identification literature suggests that identification with the minority (ethnic) group and disidentification with the majority (national) group mediate the relationship between rejection and different dimensions of well‐being. Through secondary analyses of survey data from an international sample of adolescents with a migrant background (N = 1,163) we tested the predictions that, following chronic experiences of rejection, disidentification from the national (rejecting) group will increase withdrawal and feelings of resignation whereas identification with the ethic (rejected) group will have a protective role toward delinquent behaviors. Results of the path analysis were consistent with these hypotheses without significant differences between immigrant generations. The study sheds light on the multifaceted nature of identification processes following social rejection and contributes to the integration of the rejection‐identification model with classical theorizations of social exclusion.

T1  - Home‐made biopolitics: India’s migrant workers between bare life and political existence
AN  - 2431010893
AB  - As India went into lockdown to fight Covid‐19, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers began to walk their way home, hundreds of kilometres away. As harrowing images of ‘portable households’ – women, men and small children carrying their few belongings with them – started to pour into the media, it became clear that the urgency of social distancing had been substituted by preoccupation about sheer hunger. Visual comparisons between this exodus and the one that took place on the occasion of the Partition of India (1947) also began to circulate. More than disastrous geopolitics, the exodus signalled the expulsion of those suddenly deprived of their daily wages and hence no longer able to sustain themselves in their migration destinations.

T1  - Stay away or stay together? Social contagion, common identity, and bystanders’ interventions in homophobic bullying episodes: GPIR
AN  - 2330295351
AB  - Two studies explored the link between social contagion concerns and assertive bystanders’ behavioral intentions in homophobic bullying episodes. Study 1 (N = 216) examined if adolescents’ social contagion concerns (i.e., fear of being misclassified as gay/lesbian) relate to decreased behavioral intentions to help victims of bullying, by increasing negative attitudes towards lesbians and gay men. Study 2 (N = 230) further explored if inclusive identity representations (i.e., one-group or dual-identity) were related to decreased concerns of social contagion, thereby increasing adolescents’ assertive behavioral intentions. Results (partially) confirmed both expected mediations: social contagion concerns were associated with decreased assertive behavioral intentions via increased negative attitudes towards lesbians and gay men (Study 1); one-group representations, but not dual-identity representations, were associated with more assertive behavioral intentions via decreased social contagion concerns (Study 2). These findings extended previous studies illustrating the underlying mechanisms through which social contagion concerns and common identity affect assertive bystanders’ behavioral intentions.

T1  - Devils from our past: liberal Islamophobia in Austria as historicist racism
AN  - 2309191004
AB  - This paper examines discourses of liberal Islamophobia in Austria, analysing interviews with journalists from national newspapers, magazines and TV station. Using a theoretical framework that combines a Gramscian analysis with methods of discourse analysis, it identifies "temporalization" as an effective discursive mechanism in the construction of the Muslim "Other" as a "folk devil". It argues that liberal Islamophobia works as a historicist racism, which allows differently positioned subjects to invest into, and reproduce, a mythical space of representation where the Muslim "Other" figures as a "devil from our past", embodying everything Austrian society has supposedly done away with in the years of political reform after 1968.

T1  - SOCIALLY DESIRABLE REPORTING AND THE EXPRESSION OF BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OF RACE
AN  - 2413373786
AB  - In recent decades, dramatic developments in genetics research have begun to transform not only the practice of medicine but also conceptions of the social world. In the media, in popular culture, and in everyday conversation, Americans routinely link genetics to individual behavior and social outcomes. At the same time, some social researchers contend that biological definitions of race have lost ground in the United States over the last fifty years. At the crossroads of two trends—on one hand, the post-World War II recoil from biological accounts of racial difference, and on the other, the growing admiration for the advances of genetic science—the American public’s conception of race is a phenomenon that merits greater attention from sociologists than it has received to date. However, survey data on racial attitudes has proven to be significantly affected by social desirability bias. While a number of studies have attempted to measure social desirability bias with regard to racial attitudes, most have focused on racial policy preferences rather than genetic accounts of racial inequality. We employ a list experiment to create an unobtrusive measure of support for a biologistic understanding of racial inequality. We show that one in five non-Black Americans attribute income inequality between Black and White people to unspecified genetic differences between the two groups. We also find that this number is substantially underestimated when using a direct question. The magnitude of social desirability effects varies, and is most pronounced among women, older people, and the highly-educated.

T1  - Parents' phubbing increases Adolescents' Mobile phone addiction: Roles of parent-child attachment, deviant peers, and gender
AN  - 2315507611
AB  - Phubbing is a kind of social exclusion and is used to indicate the interruption mobile phone usage has on a social relationship. Theoretical and practical evidence illustrates that parents' behavior have a strong influence on adolescents' deviant behaviors. The present study aimed to determine if adolescents' mobile phone addiction increase after being phubbed by parents, and examine effects of the mediating roles of parent-child attachment, deviant peer affiliation, and moderating role of gender. The study sample comprised 1007 adolescents (518 girls and 489 boys). Multivariable regression with bootstrap sampling was executed to test the moderated mediation. Results revealed that parents' phubbing was positively related to adolescents' mobile phone addiction (β = 0.30, p < .001). Parent-child attachment and deviant peers was found to mediate the relationship between parents' phubbing, ab = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.09], and adolescents' mobile phone addiction ab = 0.03, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.05]; while gender was found to moderate the indirect effect of parents' phubbing on mobile phone addiction through deviant peers; the indirect effect was stronger for boys than for girls. These findings illustrate that parents' phubbing is a risk factor for adolescent mobile phone addiction.

T1  - Impairment, socialization and embodiment: The sexual oppression of people with physical disabilities
AN  - 2272039859
AB  - People with disabilities face multiple forms of social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression, including in the domain of sex and sexuality. From a critical psychoanalytic viewpoint, social responses to persons with impairments are strongly unconsciously mediated, and often dominated by projections based on archaic anxieties about dependency, vulnerability, and shame. Where disability meets sexuality, these defenses may be more prominent still, resulting, for one example, in the prejudiced myth that people with disabilities are disinterested in, or not capable of, sex. Using this theoretical stance, this paper examines how the developmental role of family and societal influences on the social constructions of sexuality and disability are internalized, resisted, and negotiated by two South Africans with physical disabilities. Data are drawn from interview material elicited via photovoice methodology. The interview narratives and photographic images are used to explore how sexual oppression may be internalized, creating intra-psychic barriers to inclusion for this already structurally disadvantaged group.

T1  - E-Racing together: How starbucks reshaped and deflected racial conversations on social media
AN  - 2258135340
AB  - In March 2015, Starbucks introduced its #RaceTogether campaign to encourage patrons to discuss race and ethnicity in global culture. Public reaction to #RaceTogether was largely critical and resulted in Starbucks' abandoning the campaign within a year. Through an analysis of 5000 #RaceTogether tweets, this study examines how users engaged the campaign and each other. This study draws three conclusions. First, most #RaceTogether posts featured extremist and racist positions. Second, #RaceTogether posts deflected race conversations and critiqued the organizations role in national racial discourses. Finally, posts in the digital space critiqued Starbucks as a location for inter-racial dialogue because of brand perception.

T1  - Explaining Differences Within and Between Countries in the Risk of Income Poverty and Severe Material Deprivation: Comparing Single and Multilevel Analyses
AN  - 2162262427
AB  - This study investigates the differences between the risk factors of income poverty and severe material deprivation by assessing to what extent both indicators are subject to the same underlying household-level and country-level determinants. Given that these two indicators encompass the majority of the Europe 2020 social inclusion target group, it is crucial for policy makers to better know which determinants are effective in explaining the differences within and between countries in the risk of these two target components. We employ a series of single-level and multilevel logistic multinomial models to explain differences between those who suffer from income poverty ‘only’, from severe material deprivation ‘only’, from both problems and none. The comparative use of single-level and multilevel methods allow for the first time to confront the respective within and between-country explanatory power of both types of models. In addition to the usual econometric approach of identifying significant relationships, we employed the Shapley decomposition method to compare the relative contribution of independent variables at the household-level (i.e. work intensity, household education, household costs, socio-demographic variables) and country-level (i.e. size of social spending (total, in-cash, in-kind), pro-poorness of social benefits, median income levels and the unemployment rate) to within and between-country explained variance measures. We apply our method to the cross-sectional European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions for the year 2012.

T1  - Secrecy versus disclosure of mental illness among adolescents: II. The perspective of relevant stakeholders
AN  - 2222858778
AB  - Background: The burden of mental illness (MI) is exacerbated when adolescents with MI are confronted with stigma and social exclusion. Adolescents face the difficult decision whether or not to disclose their MI. Focus groups (FGs) were conducted with parents of adolescents with MI as well as with teachers, mental health professionals (MHPs) and adolescents without MI.Aim: To collect information from relevant stakeholders on secrecy versus disclosure of MI among adolescents.Methods: Thirteen FG sessions with 87 participants were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis to identify major themes.Results: Selective disclosure and social media as a potential way of disclosure emerged as dominant themes. Negative aspects of disclosure on social media were discussed. Stigma and labeling were seen as disadvantages of disclosure. Social support was perceived as one advantage of disclosure. Distinctive features of adolescence, such as self-discovery, appeared as specific problems. Parents, teachers, MHPs and adolescents without MI were considered important for disclosure. Participants discussed how to help adolescents with their dilemma between disclosure and secrecy.Conclusions: The findings suggest that disclosure decisions are personal and influenced by the individual's environment. Implications for interventions that aim to support adolescents with MI in this regard are discussed.

T1  - The Trials of Women Leaders in the Workforce: How a Need for Cognitive Closure can Influence Acceptance of Harmful Gender Stereotypes
AN  - 2100105866
AB  - Women leaders in the workforce are adversely affected by two sets of stereotypes: women are warm and communal but leaders are assertive and competent. This mismatch of stereotypes can lead to negative attitudes toward women leaders, however, not all individuals will be equally sensitive to these stereotypes. Men and women characterized by a need for cognitive closure (the desire for stable and certain knowledge) should be particularly sensitive to these stereotypes because they can be stable knowledge sources. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward women leaders in the workforce would vary with individuals’ need for closure, independent of their gender, and that (b) binding moral foundations (a concern for the larger group and its norms and standards) would mediate this association. In two studies, MTurk workers completed measures of negative attitudes toward women managers (Study 1, n = 149), stereotyped beliefs of women as not wanting or deserving high status positions in the workforce (Study 2, n = 207), as well as need for cognitive closure, moral foundations, social desirability, gender, and political orientation. Our results were consistent with our hypotheses and suggest that attitudes toward woman managers can reflect acceptance of pre-existent norms. If these norms can be changed, then changes in attitudes could follow.

T1  - Welcome or not? – Natives’ security feelings, attachment and attitudes toward acculturation of immigrants
AN  - 2216908037
AB  - Cultural diversity due to immigration has become a key topic in many societies today. The question of how the native population experiences these developments is of prime importance for intercultural relations and sets the base for acculturation of immigrants. Drawing on attachment and multiculturalism research, we supposed here that general and specific feelings of security might be related to more positive attitudes toward cultural diversity, whereas feelings of threat might be related to less openness. More precisely, the present study investigated how natives’ general attachment (secure or fearful) as well as their specific feelings of (cultural or economic) security might be related to their expectations about acculturation of immigrants in the multicultural context of Luxembourg. The sample included N = 134 Luxembourg nationals with an average age of M = 45.02 (SD = 17.41) who filled out an online questionnaire. Results revealed that self-reported fearful general attachment was positively related to more unwelcoming acculturation orientations. Relations between general attachment and acculturation orientations were mediated by feelings of cultural security, which had strong effects on host nationals’ (un)welcoming acculturation orientations over and above general attachment. Findings suggest that (un)welcoming orientations toward immigrants, entailing openness for cultural contact and exchange, are related to feelings of cultural and economic security which are partly biased by a general secure or fearful attachment. Feelings of security seem thus to provide a secure base for tolerance and openness to cultural diversity which are needed in order to deal successfully with the challenges of today’s multicultural societies.

T1  - The Reception of Immigrants and Refugees in Western Countries: The Challenges of Our Time
AN  - 2151163790
AB  - In a rapidly changing world, the challenges of migration, as well as its potential benefits, are hotly debated. Recent years have seen new challenges as a result of unprecedented levels of migration, instability following the Global Financial Crisis, economic and security concerns surrounding immigration, and negative portrayals of immigrants by some Western leaders. These developments make it all the more important to understand the psychological processes underpinning attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, support for particular immigration policies and responses to changing policies, the role of portrayals of immigrants in the media, and the consequences of immigration attitudes and policies. This special issue brings together researchers interested in the topic of immigration from a psychological perspective, with a focus on understanding the reception of immigrants and refugees in Western countries. In this introductory article, we outline the background to this special issue and briefly describe each article included.

T1  - “An Australian-style points system”: Individualizing immigration in radical right discourse in the 2015 U.K. General election campaign
AN  - 2136511846
AB  - Analyses of racist discourse have often involved data from contexts concerning issues of human mobility. A great deal of this literature points to the extent to which people draw on the tropes of liberalism to justify social exclusion, and in particular to warrant negative evaluations of outgroups. Using media data from political debates involving the radical right-wing U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) in the U.K. General Election campaign of 2015, the present article highlights a different rhetorical strategy by which exclusion can be warranted by speakers arguing for a reduction in immigration. This novel strategy explicitly avoids any negative characterization of outgroups, and instead advocates the individualization of immigration decisions. This is exemplified in UKIP’s policy of basing the United Kingdom’s approach to immigration on an “Australian-style points-based system.” This was invoked by UKIP representatives in the debates as a straightforward “off-the-shelf” system that would enable the U.K. to “take back control” of immigration, while ensuring that immigration decisions were based on individual merit rather than on group membership. As such, the points system could also be invoked specifically to anticipate and counter accusations of racism and/or xenophobia. The findings are discussed in relation to the tacit ideological assumptions underpinning UKIP’s policy, specifically around psychologization, the reliance on an acultural version of Australia, and the tacit use of categorical accounting.

A total of 199 undergraduates responded to a questionnaire assessing time attitude and present-orientation before and after the assignment to contemplate death. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that present-orientation has a direct effect on the outcome, but the view of death does not have a mediated effect. The results of ANOVA also supported the direct effect of present-orientation. The analysis of the individual description showed that present-orientation has relevance with how to think life after contemplating death. The relationships between contemplating death and young adults’ ego identity which is closely related to time perspective were discussed.

T1  - Intergroup Socialization: The Influence of Parents' Family Communication Patterns on Adult Children's Racial Prejudice and Tolerance
AN  - 2108877889
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of family communication environments on children's intergroup socialization. Adult children (n = 200) reported on their parents' conformity and conversation orientations and their own racial attitudes and intergroup orientations. Results evidenced ingroup bias, social dominance, and identification with parent as mediators of the positive relationship between conformity orientation and racial prejudice and the negative relationship between conformity orientation and racial tolerance. Results also revealed that children from consensual and protective families harbor the most racial prejudice and least racial tolerance. Future directions related to intergroup contact interventions, racially diverse families, and qualitative assessments of parent-child interactions are discussed.

T1  - What can María Zambrano contribute to mediation and to the philosophy of mediation?
AN  - 2159996641
AB  - From a specific point of view, mediation is the process whereby a third party helps to change their attitude from an adversarial one to a collaborative one which allows them to work together in finding and creating solutions to their conflict. Mediation deals with conflict from its own perspective and it has its own status as a dispute resolution process in the systems of justice, where it is recognized. The Philosophy of Mediation has been developing as a discipline, which analyses the status of mediation as knowledge. It studies its nature, its constituent elements, its ontological foundations and its connection with other disciplines. This article argues that it is possible to include certain basic principles of the philosophy of María Zambrano in the Philosophy of Mediation framework. Those elements are essential for understanding the world of human conflict since they provide a new perspective from which to see dispute resolution methodologies. They can be summed up in the idea of including the hidden as the substrate of the visible, revealing the underlying forces of human existence. Within the context of the mediation, the understanding of these forces could help to resolve conflicts.

T1  - Trading Races: Albescence, Staining, Xenoface, and Other Race-Switching Practices in American Popular Culture
AN  - 2109281888
AB  - Given these conventions, it should come as no surprise that in the Syfy Channel's miniseries adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End (2015), Karellen, the alien envoy of the technologically advanced demon-like alien Overlords, is portrayed by a white Englishman (Charles Dance).

[...]the Overlords have been rendered a deep, saturnine red, an interesting departure from the novel, which describes them as possessed of an "ebon majesty" (Clarke 61), a not insignificant plot point in the narrative since Clarke implies that their blackness played an important part in transforming Earth's racial attitudes, so much so that the novel's black protagonist, Jan Rodricks, lives in a world from which antiblack racism has disappeared (Clarke 83).

[...]it should come as no surprise that the argument against cinematic blackwashing replicates that against its theatrical counterpart, launched most famously by August Wilson who objected to the practice because it "required black actors to deny the specificity of their culture and history in order to participate in 'white' plays that got credit for being universal without having to examine their own racial politics," and because it increased the difficulty for black playwrights to get their plays produced (See Catanese, 2008, p. 18).

According to English-language media and Internet coverage of the controversy, it would appear that many Japanese are not offended by the change or are resigned to it.

According to statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, from 2005 to 2013 the estimated number of cosmetic procedures for Asian Americans increased 125%, Hispanics, 85%, and blacks, 56%.

T1  - Factors Affecting Heterosexual Attitudes to Same-Sex Marriage in Australia
AN  - 2084167862
AB  - Same-sex marriage (SSM) has been a contentious topic in recent times. Despite current trends indicating that support for same-sex marriage is on the rise in Australia, attempts to introduce marriage equality legislation have failed. This study examined influential factors affecting attitudes towards same-sex marriage in Australia. A sample of heterosexual Australians completed a survey regarding their attitudes to marriage equality, homophobia, beliefs about a nature or nurture basis for same-sex attraction, common assumptions and beliefs about the etiology of same-sex attraction and social desirability. Believing that the etiology of same-sex attraction is nature-based predicted positive attitudes towards same-sex marriage whereas thinking sexual orientation is nurture-based predicted negative attitudes. Mediation analysis was used to assess the relationship between etiology beliefs and attitudes towards same-sex marriage. Homophobia fully explained the effect of nature beliefs and partially explained the effect of nurture beliefs on attitudes to same-sex marriage. Given that attitudes towards same-sex marriage are not created in a vacuum, the study also explored what people felt were their most influential sources of beliefs about the origins of same-sex attraction. The implications of the research findings for those lobbying for marriage equality in Australia are discussed.

T1  - Is social isolation a public health issue? A media analysis in Aotearoa/New Zealand
AN  - 2061801549
AB  - Recognition of the health effects of social isolation has led to the media framing it as a public health issue. In this paper, we examine how the media frame social isolation among older people and how the public respond to this framing. Using framing analysis, we analysed an online article, embedded video content and 369 comments posted in response to this article. The article used a recognisable public health framing to understand the causes of social isolation as structural, supported by a video which presented the private face of a public health problem. The online comments largely resisted this framing, arguing that social isolation reflected an individual deficit, best remedied through individual actions such as joining groups or having a positive attitude. Families were also viewed as responsible for the social lives of their members, and social isolation was attributed to neglectful families. Commenters also suggested that alleviating social isolation was the responsibility of neighbours and volunteers. These three arguments accounted for 88% of the comments. Much less commonly, social isolation was described as due to the march of Western civilisation. This analysis shows how the public are active in their response to, and largely rejection of, framing social isolation as a public health issue. Although the health impacts of social isolation were endorsed, this was insufficient for structural explanations to prevail. Public health campaigners need to understand how individualising accounts of health issues are used to undermine public health explanations so as to most effectively challenge them.

T1  - White Nationalism in Congress and Gatsby
AN  - 2491993285
AB  - Now, more than ever, we need to find a way to be sure that all of the diverse students we teach can engage in difficult conversations in our classrooms about racism, religious prejudice, and white nationalism. These conversations, however, can be risky work in our current political climate, particularly as higher education is identified by critics like AttorneyGeneral Jeff Sessions as an "echo chamber of political correctness" (Ruiz 2017). We would argue that many of our great canonical American texts offer us remarkably interesting material with which to enable conversations about inequality and injustice in the United States and that teachers must seize the opportunity to use these texts to foster these conversations in our classrooms.1 We offer the following discussion of The Great Gatsby as a model for undertaking this important work.

T1  - Media, conflict and diaspora audiences
AN  - 2049548240
AB  - Emergence of diaspora communities has resulted in diasporic media playing a key role in enabling a reconnection of diasporic populations with a mediated homeland. This becomes more poignant amongst diaspora communities that feel marginalized, racially discriminated against and battle threats of xenophobia, Islamophobia and other forms of social exclusion in their adopted Western homes. This makes mediated co-presence more powerful than physical co-presence as diaspora individuals try to find community at a distance. Taking the Somali diaspora community as a case study, this article explores how diasporic media content is consumed amongst conflict-generated diaspora audiences. When conflict dynamics are manifested within diaspora social networks, the re-creation of conflict takes place, which then facilitates the engagement of diaspora with homeland conflicts. But their views, reactions and concerns regarding diasporic media content also indicate their potential for deliberatively engaging with it.

T1  - More than a Media Moment: The Influence of Televised Storylines on Viewers’ Attitudes toward Transgender People and Policies
AN  - 2015610332
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the power of entertainment narratives to influence attitudes and behaviors; fewer have examined the effects of TV portrayals on attitudes toward marginalized groups. The present study is among the first to explore how entertainment narratives depicting transgender individuals influence viewers’ attitudes toward transgender people and related policies. The study examines the impact of exposure to a TV storyline on Royal Pains (USA Network) and cumulative effects of viewing other TV series featuring transgender individuals. An online survey of 488 U.S. viewers of Royal Pains was conducted (391 had seen the relevant episode). ANCOVAs revealed exposure to both the Royal Pains’ storyline and other storylines portraying transgender individuals were associated with more supportive attitudes toward transgender people and policies. Mediation models revealed that for viewers of the Royal Pains’ storyline, the relationships between political ideology and attitudes toward transgender people and policies were mediated by identification with the main characters and the emotion of hope. Disgust mediated viewers’ attitudes toward transgender people, but not policies. Post hoc analyses revealed that exposure to transgender narratives reduced the influence of viewers’ political ideology on their attitudes. The attitudes of more conservative viewers became increasingly positive as they saw more media portrayals of transgender individuals. These findings highlight the potential for entertainment narratives to influence attitudes toward marginalized groups, and they demonstrate the importance of emotion in the context of divisive topics. Social, political, and public health implications are discussed.

AN  - 2036727326
AB  - Identity categorisations are socio-cultural constructs embedded in discourses of power that locate diversity within a hierarchic frame. This is especially true when identity discourses entail a relation to the nation-state. In Italy, as in most of Europe, media, political and institutional discourses depict 'Gypsies/Roma' as dangerous 'Nomads' and strangers-at-home. As a result, despite various attempts to tackle anti-Gypsyism, Roma and Sinti communities living in Italy are still subject to ethnicisation, racialisation and criminalisation processes as well as spatial segregation, social exclusion and marginalisation. This special issue addresses a critical discussion on the transformation, manipulation and strategic uses of 'Gypsy', 'Roma' and 'Nomad' categories in Italy over the last fifty years. The aim is to offer an in-depth reflection on categorisation processes, the ways in which categorisations are used in different contexts and by different social agents, and their practical effects on Roma and Sinti communities.

T1  - Barriers to disclosing child sexual abuse (CSA) in ethnic minority communities: A review of the literature and implications for practice in Australia
AN  - 2032480942
AB  - Research on child sexual abuse (CSA) among ethnic minority communities in Australia is essentially absent. To begin to address the gap, a systematic literature review was conducted; which necessarily borrowed from overseas to help inform the national context. A wide array of barriers to disclosure were identified, suggesting that this is a fundamental issue for ethnic minorities. The most significant of these barriers appears to be the need to protect family name. This also leads to non-supportive and protective responses from non-offending mothers, however this experience (although more intense) is shared with the Western mainstream. In comparison, fear of stigmatising their whole community is a unique barrier and highlights that racism is a significant and additional burden. The findings suggest that service worker training in Australia is critical for informing professionals of: the importance of family reputation for collectivist groups; the importance of responding supportively and protectively to child victims who have disclosed to them first; the cross-cultural complexities that surround construals of 'child safety'; educating non-offending mothers about the importance of at least believing their child's disclosure (associated with mediating mental illness among victims, but also culturally appropriate because it acknowledges the protective role of family cohesion in collectivist cultures and the high motivation to avoid social exclusion -- the most common reprisal for shaming the family name); exploring acculturation as a possible predictor of disclosure; and the risk of racism being overlooked or minimised. Overall, it is argued that practice informed by a well-developed national research agenda is critical.

T1  - College Students' Experiences With Anonymous Social Media: Implications for Campus Racial Climate
AN  - 2008058631
AB  - Given the limited research surrounding students’ use of anonymous social media platforms, as well as the predominant use of quantitative methodologies in measuring aspects of campus climate (Hurtado, Griffin, Arellano, & Cueller, 2008; Rockenbach, Mayhew, & Bowman, 2015), we conducted a qualitative pilot case study with three participants to gather preliminary data on the following research questions: 1.

Public institutions such as Clemson University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also considered bans of the app, yet questions of free speech, amid related concerns, led these campuses to refrain from taking such action (Schaeffer, 2015).

Additionally, although we did not focus explicitly on participants’ own racial identities, research has shown that White students are less likely than Black students to believe that racial discrimination is a prevalent issue-a potential topic worth examining in the context of anonymous social media (Rankin & Reason, 2005).

[...]as noted most recently in an Inside Higher Ed piece, Straumsheim (2016) suggested that students across college campuses were losing interest in the use of Yik Yak-with the app dropping from number three on the iPhone operating system download chart in 2014 to number 447 in 2016-due in large part to a phone number verification feature that had shifted the app away from anonymity (McAlone, 2016).

T1  - Diversity of attitudes to English in non-professional public discourse: A focus on Lithuania: An analysis of the narratives people tell about English as a global language in the local context of Lithuania
AN  - 1944329320
AB  - This paper stems from the ongoing debate on the changing role and status of English in different parts of the world, with a special interest in the socio-historical background of a post-Soviet country. The international status of English has given rise to different reactions among speakers, ranging from attraction to resentment (cf. Onysko, 2009: 34). These reactions are expressed in public online discourse, which provides a rich resource of empirical evidence to study public attitudes and language ideologies. Digital media offers an especially important strategic site to disseminate ideologies and shape public opinions. This paper analyses the spectrum of discourses operating within Lithuanian digital media to perpetuate attitudes towards English and the values associated with it.

T1  - Acceptance of Prostitution and Its Social Determinants in Canada
AN  - 1917800532
AB  - The nature of collective perception of prostitution is understudied in Canada. Except some rudimentary reports on the percentages of the key legal options, multivariate analysis has never been used to analyze the details of public opinion on prostitution. The current study explores the trend of public attitude toward prostitution acceptability in Canada over a 25-year span and examines the social determinants of the acceptability of prostitution, using structural equation modeling (SEM), which allows researchers to elaborate both direct and indirect effects (through mediating variables) on the outcome variable. Results show that the public has become more acceptant of prostitution over time. In addition, the less religious, less authoritarian, and more educated are more acceptant of prostitution than the more religious, more authoritarian, and less well educated. The effects of religiosity and authoritarianism mediate out the direct effects of age, gender, gender equality, marriage, marriage as an outdated institution, Quebec, race, and tolerance. The findings may serve as a reference point for the law reform regarding the regulation of prostitution in Canada.

T1  - Shouting and providing: Forms of exchange in the drinking accounts of young Australians
AN  - 2008946284
AB  - Introduction and AimsAustralian health promotion campaigns encourage people to manage their alcohol consumption by avoiding involvement in a form of round drinking known as ‘shouting’. We consider this individualist advice in light of our analysis of the social relations established by young people through collective drinking, in which we conceptualise friends, family and work colleagues as participants in complex networks of exchange.Design and MethodsData were gathered during in‐depth, semistructured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork conducted in a socioeconomically disadvantaged outer suburb of Melbourne, Australia. The interview sample comprised nine men and seven women of diverse ethnic backgrounds, with a median age of 21 years.ResultsWe identified two types of exchange—‘shouting’ and ‘providing’—enacted by round drinking and other collective drinking practices. ‘Shouting’ is a form of balanced reciprocity in which participants take turns buying drinks for all others in the group. It is an immediate, direct exchange of alcoholic gifts that are equivalent in value. ‘Providing’ is characterised by indirect reciprocity in which the social aspects of the transaction are emphasised over the value of the goods exchanged. In addition to risking social exclusion, rejecting this form of collective drinking may also risk rejecting the other resources exchanged in this form of sharing, such as food, transport and accommodation.Discussion and ConclusionsExchanges of alcoholic gifts complicate the straightforward application of individualist health promotion advice. Social relations need to be taken into account when designing health promotion interventions that seek to reduce alcohol‐related harm. [Murphy DA, Hart A, Moore D.

T1  - Moving Beyond Comprehensive Immigration Reform and Trump: Principles, Interests, and Policies to Guide Long-Term Reform of the US Immigration System
AN  - 1928165340
AB  - This paper introduces a special collection of 15 papers that chart a course for long-term reform of the US immigration system. The papers look beyond recent legislative debates and the current era of rising nationalism and restrictionism to outline the elements of a forward-looking immigration policy that would serve the nation’s interests, honor its liberal democratic ideals, promote the full participation of immigrants in the nation’s life, and exploit the opportunities offered by the increasingly interdependent world. This paper highlights several overarching themes from the collection, as well as dozens of proposals for reform. Together, the papers in the collection make the case that: 
* Immigration policymaking should be embedded in a larger set of partnerships, processes, and commitments that respond to the conditions that force persons to migrate. 
* The US immigration system should reflect liberal democratic values and an inclusive vision of national identity. 
* It is incumbent on policy and opinion makers to publicize the broad national interests served by US immigration policies. 
* Policymakers should, in turn, evaluate and adjust US immigration policies based on their success in furthering the nation’s interests. 
* The United States should prioritize the gathering and dissemination of the best available evidence on migration and on the nation’s migration-related needs and programs, and should use this information to respond flexibly to changing migration patterns and new economic developments. 
* Immigrant integration strengthens communities and represents an important, overarching metric for US immigration policies. 
* The successful integration of the United States’ 43 million foreign-born residents and their progeny should be a national priority. 
* An immigration federalism agenda should prioritize cooperation on shared federal, state, and local priorities. 
* An immigration federalism agenda should recognize the federal government’s enforcement obligations; the interests of local communities in the safety, well-being and participation of their residents; the importance of federal leadership in resolving the challenges posed by the US undocumented population; and the need for civil society institutions to serve as mediators of immigrant integration. 
* Immigration reform should be coupled with strong, well-enforced labor standards in order to promote fair wages and safe and healthy working conditions for all US workers. 
* Fairness and due process should characterize US admission, custody, and removal decisions. 
* Family unity should remain a central goal of US immigration policy and a pillar of the US immigration system. 
* The United States should seek to craft “win-win” immigration policies that serve its own interests and that benefit migrant-sending states. 
* US immigration law and policy should be coherent and consistent, and the United States should create legal migration opportunities for persons uprooted by US foreign interventions, trade policies, and immigration laws. 
* The United States should reduce the size of its undocumented population through a substantial legalization program and seek to ensure that this population never again approximates its current size.

T1  - Revisiting the Basics: Understanding Potential Demographic Differences With John Gottman's Four Horsemen and Emotional Flooding
AN  - 1913112875
AB  - It has been found that the presence of negative communicative techniques and emotional flooding in marital relationships negatively relates to marital satisfaction. However, current literature has not consistently included known demographical differences (e.g., race, gender, etc.) to truly test how these variables impact marital satisfaction. This study investigated the specific impact that both emotional flooding and negative communicative techniques had on 591 married individuals' marital satisfaction while controlling for gender, race, and length of relationship. The results indicated that emotional flooding tends to decrease as marriages go on, and refusing to talk with the partner had the greatest negative impact on relationship satisfaction regardless of demographical differences. Suggestions are provided for how therapists and practitioners can use these findings to assist couples who are using negative communication techniques and are, subsequently, experiencing marital dissatisfaction.

T1  - Reclaiming Urban Youth Identity through Language in Kenya: The Case of Koch FM Radio
AN  - 2007457297
AB  - Kenya’s urban youths in Nairobi’s informal and low income settlements have had to contend with an identity crisis, economic deprivation, marginalization in leadership and governance and general stigmatization. Moreover, they have borne a heavy burden both as victims and perpetrators of crime, wanton sex trade and drug abuse. This has led to the emergence of a special language variety in the form of an urban slang (Sheng) that the youth initially used to exclude their parents and the authorities from their perceived criminal acts. However, since the enactment of a new constitution that has expanded the democratic space and created broader awareness of individual rights and liberties, Kenya’s urban youth in Nairobi have given new roles to Sheng by making it a symbol of youth’s autonomy and creativity. This article uses the case of the youth-initiated Koch FM which is a model urban community radio station that primarily uses urban slang in its presentations. Through this station, the socio-economically disadvantaged youths create and maintain social networks in the form of support groups, theatre and income generating clubs with the objective of creating wealth, thereby boosting identity through assertive self-expression. The youth can then articulate and influence policy on social, political and economic affairs by sharing information on health, HIV/AIDS, political representation and governance roles. This case study demonstrates that a common language can be an effective unifier since it transcends social, economic, religious, ethnic, political and gender barriers.Alternate abstract:La jeunesse urbaine kenyane des quartiers défavorisés de Nairobi est confrontée à une crise d’identité, à la privation économique, à la marginalisation dans les postes de direction et de gouvernance et à la stigmatisation générale. En outre, ces jeunes ont eu à assumer le lourd fardeau en tant que victimes et auteurs de crimes, du commerce sexuel et de la toxicomanie. Cela a conduit à l’émergence d’une variété linguistique spéciale sous la forme d’un argot urbain (Sheng) que les jeunes utilisaient initialement pour commettre leurs actes criminels à l’insu de leurs parents et des autorités. Cependant, depuis la promulgation d’une nouvelle constitution qui a élargi l’espace démocratique et créé une plus grande prise de conscience des droits et libertés individuels, la jeunesse urbaine kenyane à Nairobi a donné de nouveaux rôles au Sheng en en faisant le symbole de l’autonomie et de la créativité des jeunes. Cet article se fonde sur le cas de Koch FM initiée par les jeunes, qui est une station de radio communautaire urbaine modèle utilisant principalement l’argot urbain dans ses émissions. Grâce à cette station, les jeunes socio-économiquement défavorisés créent et entretiennent des réseaux sociaux sous la forme de groupes de soutien, de clubs de théâtre et de génération de revenus visant à créer de la richesse, stimulant ainsi l’identité grâce à une auto-expression affirmée. De ce fait, les jeunes peuvent articuler et influencer la politique sur les affaires sociales, politiques et économiques en partageant les informations concernant la santé, le VIH/sida, la représentation politique ainsi que les rôles en matière de gouvernance. Cette étude de cas démontre que le langage commun peut être un unificateur efficace puisqu’il dépasse les obstacles sociaux, économiques, religieux, ethniques, politiques et sexistes.

T1  - Discovering The Child's Disability: Challenges with Parenting and Implications for Social Work Practice in South Africa
AN  - 1840682042
AB  - This paper sought to investigate the consequences of discovering that children have disabilities and their implications for parenting. The study upon which the paper has been based took the form of a literature review. There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that parents tend to blame themselves upon discovering that a child of theirs has a disability. Some parents experience great difficulty in obtaining medical or educational information to assist them to deal with the disabilities of their children. In addition, the children themselves are often subjected to mistreatment as a result of their ignorance, particularly as a result of having little or no knowledge or understanding of sexuality. Disabled children are also often subjected to being excluded from inalienable human rights such as having access to an acceptable quality of education. In the light of the challenges which they face in these respects, it is recommended that there should be a concerted and a committed endeavour to maximise public awareness and education through the printed, audio and visual media, in order to bring an end to the stigma and the additional challenges, such as social exclusion, which often accompany disabilities for children, by promoting and monitoring inclusive systems for communities and all institutions which are dedicated to meeting the needs of children, including schools.

T1  - Opposing the veil in the name of liberalism: popular attitudes to liberalism and Muslim veiling in the Netherlands
AN  - 1801901788
AB  - Is popular antagonism towards Muslim veils in Europe rooted in an exclusionary 'enlightenment liberalism'? By examining different conceptions of liberalism and readings of veiling in a Dutch survey from 2014, we present the first study that investigates this question empirically. We thus bring together two hitherto largely unconnected literatures. The first is the work on immigration and ethnicity, which has shown the centrality of enlightenment liberalism in anti-Muslim media and policy discourses. The second is the literature on anti-Muslim attitudes in public opinion, which explains support for veil bans as the result of perceiving veils as threatening the respondent's own, supposedly liberal, values - but has failed to distinguish between different conceptions of liberalism and thus reached inconclusive results. This, we show, can be remedied by distinguishing between 'enlightenment liberals', who hold negative attitudes, and 'reformation liberals', who hold positive attitudes towards Muslim veils.

T1  - Migration in Differentiated Localities: Changing Statuses and Ethnic Relations in a Multi-Ethnic Locality in Transylvania, Romania
AN  - 1813616228
AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of scholars have started to analyse the effects of migration in societies of emigration. This scholarship often depicts migration as a powerful process generating 'levelled' processes of diffusion of money, goods, ideas, and values, ultimately changing entire communities and regions of origin. The paper diverges from this view and argues for a differentialist approach in researching processes of migration and social change. I substantiate this claim by analysing patterns of migration and social change in a multi-ethnic community in Romania that consists of Hungarians, Romanians, and Roma. The research fieldwork consisted of qualitative interviews and participant observation. 
By using a perspective inspired by the literature on critical social capital and mechanisms of migration, I show that local social differentiation profoundly affects not only the development of migration but also the relationship between migration and social change. As I unfold in the paper, social closure based on ethnic and class/group membership had a strong effect on the ways in which Hungarians, Roma, and Romanians migrated towards Hungary, Italy, and Germany, as well as on the economic niches they occupied in countries of destination. The enrichment of some Roma and the new social position they gained reveals that migrant localities are contested social spaces where migrants' new social statuses and the ideas and values they bring back with them are weighted and negotiated against local values and systems of classification.

T1  - Assessing the Impact of a Media-based Intervention to Prevent Intergroup Violence and Promote Positive Intergroup Relations in Burundi
AN  - 1784567762
AB  - The present study (N=1074) examined the impact of a theory-driven media intervention aimed at violence prevention and intergroup reconciliation in Burundi. We used a novel methodology utilizing audio-based surveys to assess attitudes related to intergroup conflict and reconciliation among community members. We conducted a propensity score analysis to estimate the causal effects of the intervention by examining differences between listeners and non-listeners of the radio dramas. The results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on several social psychological outcomes (tolerance, in-group superiority, social distance, intergroup trust, responsibility attributions, trauma disclosure and competitive victimhood). However, listeners and non-listeners did not differ in obedience toward leaders or historical perspective taking; and the results for active bystandership, one of the main foci of the intervention, were mixed. Furthermore, the results show that the impact of the intervention sometimes depends on listeners' personal experiences of victimization. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - The collective need to be inside, the individual spectacle of the outer: Critical Discourse Analysis of the construction of discursive representations about transvestites on Argentinean television
AN  - 1770385632
AB  - For many decades, the Argentinean travesti (transvestite) community has suffered appalling life conditions due to discrimination, social exclusion and (until the enacting of the Gender Identity Law) official denial of their identities. Using qualitative methodology and from the frame of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this article studies how some Argentinean television programmes from 1993 to 2010 constructed discursive representations about travestis. The analysis reveals two opposing combinations of linguistic resources (strategies) regarding the State abuses suffered by the travestis, their need for social inclusion and their collective fight for their human rights: while the travestis who participate in the programmes reinforce these aspects, the television presenters systematically mitigate them. The discursive representations thus built by the programmes tend to maintain a 'postmodern' status quo, which could explain why the Argentinean Gender Identity Law was not accompanied, in 2012, by a public debate as resounding as the one that accompanied same-sex marriage in 2010.

T1  - LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, BUT WHAT IF I'M BLACK?
AN  - 1867156485
AB  - Assembled on the foundation that all men being created equal, the United States Constitution was established to maintain a democratic government and prevent a dictatorial nation. However, the protection of natural born rights is not enforced and therefore racial injustices prevent human equality. The social injustices of African American men are common headlines for media coverages daily. It is believed that the Civil Rights Movement ended racism, however the legacy of segregation and racism continue to negatively influence the advancement of black men. The lives of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown and Chavis Carter serve as a reminder of our justice system and its continued failure for the African American culture. Black men continue to struggle with the burden of high levels of unemployment and being the majority incarcerated; which is believed to stem from the disciplinary criminal justice policies. This research seeks to explore progressive ways to move toward racial equality.

T1  - Attitudes About Human Trafficking: Individual Differences Related to Belief and Victim Blame
AN  - 1757704444
AB  - Human trafficking is believed to oppress millions of people worldwide. Despite increased media attention and public awareness campaigns in recent years, no empirical research has examined public attitudes about human trafficking. The present study examined gender, sexual trauma history, and attitudes about human trafficking as they related to belief of a sex-trafficking scenario and willingness to blame the victim for the situation. Undergraduate students (N = 409) at a large private university in the Northeastern United States completed measures in which they responded to a vignette portraying sex trafficking in the United States. Participants also reported their personal trauma history and completed a Human Trafficking Myths Scale. Results indicated that gender and human trafficking myth acceptance, but not sexual trauma history, were significantly related to participants' belief of the sex-trafficking scenario and their perception of the victim's responsibility. Potential implications and directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - The role of social desirability bias and racial/ethnic composition on the relation between education and attitude toward immigration restrictionism
AN  - 1750999821
AB  - Social scientists note individuals tend to respond favorably to sensitive topics in surveys, but few consider factors triggering these responses. This study uses unique data to examine respondents' racial/ethnic attitude under direct and indirect modes of elicitation. In particular, the list experiment provides a cloak of anonymity to a random subsample of individuals that allows them to respond truthfully about their racial/ethnic attitudes. By comparing responses between administration modes, this study evaluates whether social desirability pressures mediate, and racial/ethnic composition moderate, the relation between education and racial/ethnic attitudes. Findings indicate an initial positive relation between education and racial/ethnic attitudes, but desirability bias mainly drives this relation. Furthermore, there is some support racial/ethnic composition moderates the influence of social desirability on education. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331914000986]

T1  - Mediating between state and citizens: the significance of the informal politics of third-party representation in the global south
AN  - 1784139499
AB  - This article argues that we should take more seriously the role of intermediaries in relationships between states and citizens in the global south. More specifically it holds that the practice of mediation, the third party representation of citizens to states and vice versa, is a widespread and important political practice in this context. Largely distinct from the contentious politics and popular mobilisation of social movements, mediation is more a politics of negotiation and bargaining by representatives. Developed as an emergent analysis from multiple case studies, mediation is a broad concept that includes practices that at other times might be described as lobbying, clientelism and coercion, but that we conceptualise in terms of claiming legitimacy to speak for the poor and marginalised, and theorise in terms of a democratic deficit between formal political institutions and these groups. In addition to identifying different kinds of mediators, the article categorises mediation in terms of the orientation and nature of various mediatory practices. Lastly, the article identifies at least three explanations for mediation including the endurance of pre-democratic political relations and practices, new forms of social exclusion in post-colonial democracies and the erosion of state authority brought about by neo-liberal policies and globalisation.

T1  - Online and Offline Social Participation and Social Poverty Traps: Can Social Networks Save Human Relations?
AN  - 1750208107
AB  - In this study, we develop an evolutionary game model to analyze how human relations evolve in a context characterized by declining face-to-face interactions and growing online social participation. Our results suggest that online networks may constitute a coping response allowing individuals to "defend" their social life from increasing busyness and a reduction in the time available for leisure. Internet-mediated interaction can play a positive role in preventing the disruption of ties and the weakening of community life documented by empirical studies. In this scenario, the digital divide is likely to become an increasingly relevant factor of social exclusion, which may exacerbate inequalities in well-being and capabilities.

T1  - Online Islamophobia and the politics of fear: manufacturing the green scare
AN  - 2100413818
AB  - Negative attitudes and explicit racism against Muslims are increasingly visible in public discourse throughout Europe. Right-wing populist parties have strengthened their positions by focusing on the 'Islamic threat' to the West. Concurrently, the Internet has facilitated a space where racist attitudes towards Muslims are easily disseminated into the public debate, fuelling animosity against European Muslims. This paper explores part of the online Islamophobic network and scrutinizes the discursive strategies deployed by three 'prominent' online actors. By combining social network analysis and critical discourse analysis, the study shows that Islamophobic web pages constitute a dynamic network with ties to different political and geographical milieus. They create a seemingly mainstream political position by framing racist standpoints as a defence of Western values and freedom of speech. The study also shows that Islamophobic discourse is strengthened by xenophobic currents within mass media, and by the legitimization of intellectuals and political actors.

T1  - Extended contact through cross-group romantic relationships
AN  - 1709474886
AB  - Cross-group romantic relationships are an extremely intimate and often maligned form of intergroup contact. Yet, according to intergroup contact theory, these relationships have the potential to improve the intergroup attitudes of others via extended contact. This study combines the interpersonal and intergroup literatures to examine the outcomes associated with knowing a partner in a cross-group romantic relationship. Results suggest that cross-group romantic partners encounter greater disapproval toward their relationships than same-group partners and, as a result, their relationships are perceived more negatively. Nevertheless, extended contact with cross-group partners, controlling for participants' cross-group friendships and romantic relationships, predicts more positive attitudes toward cross-group dating and positive intergroup attitudes in general, mediated by perceived ingroup norms toward cross-group relationships.

T1  - Mentoring and Mothering Black Femininity in the Academy: An Exploration of Body, Voice and Image through Black Female Characters
AN  - 1713975533
AB  - This paper examines the ways in which body, voice, and image are portrayed in contemporary media productions that persist in creating negative identity constructs for Black women. Much of what is consumed by mainstream culture is a skewed, caricatured perception of Black women created by those outside of their demographic. More recent and limited works by and about Black women attempt to dismantle this phenomenon and are moving in the right direction by offering images of empowerment; however these presentations of the Black female experience are still distorted and conventionalized. This essay encourages additional portrayals that affirm and explore a wider array of Black female experiences.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1662632272
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies.

T1  - PRIMING WITH ENERGY DRINKS MAY PROMOTE MEN'S TOLERANCE OF SOCIAL PAIN
AN  - 1767330095; 201605554
AB  - In advertising of caffeinated energy drinks, there appears to be a consistent emphasis reinforcing masculine identification. Greater tolerance of social pain in a situation of exclusion is a characteristic particularly identified with masculinity. In this study, we tested the priming effect of an energy drink on men's social pain tolerance in the situation of experiencing social exclusion in Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game. We recruited 93 men who were undergraduate students at a university in Taiwan to participate in an experimental study. Results showed that the men exposed to a popular caffeinated energy drink (Red Bull) tolerated being excluded from a greater number of throws in Cyberball than did those with a neutral prime or no prime. Induced conformity to masculine norms mediated the link between the energy drink prime and increased tolerance of social pain. These findings suggest that mere exposure to energy drinks may lead men to behave according to masculine norms in a seemingly unrelated domain. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Internet and new modes of political participation: online versus offline participation
AN  - 1660024366; 201506433
AB  - Political participation refers to all forms of involvement in which citizens express their political opinion and/or convey that opinion to political decision-makers. Some of the most innovative forms of political participation developed during the past decade are based on the use of online communication tools. There is still no consensus in the scientific literature, however, about the impact of online communication on citizens' civic and political engagement. The main goal of this article is therefore to understand whether specific online and/or offline political participation patterns exist especially among young people who are known to be the most fervent Internet users. The analysis utilizes survey data on various forms of offline and online political engagement among undergraduate students from 2011. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Framing pandemic management: New governance, science or culture?
AN  - 1634236213
AB  - Management of a pandemic engages multiple sites, where previously settled or uncontroversial understandings may be transformed by global and domestic forces. This article examines, the iconography of social distancing implicated in the discourses of 'quarantine' and 'risk control' in public health, and the tension between scientific and popular media readings of the contours of acceptable public health models for managing particular pandemics. The role of culture in shaping and reshaping borders, at an operational level is explored, as a basis for explaining the apparent paradoxes in the way historic and contemporary pandemics are actually managed, and the different ways particular pandemics are framed. The article argues, that a rational-scientific approach to pandemic management is insufficient and that a more nuanced socio-political blend of science, culture and public perceptions offers a more substantial basis for public health policy.

T1  - Improving Intergroup Attitudes through Televised Vicarious Intergroup Contact: Social Cognitive Processing of Ingroup and Outgroup Information
AN  - 1738477514; 201538487
AB  - In an experiment, participants exposed to depictions of an intergroup interaction between a border patrolling U.S. citizen and an illegal immigrant demonstrated changed attitudes toward illegal immigrants depending on the valence of the portrayal. Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U.S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The devil is in the details: Abstract versus concrete construals of multiculturalism differentially impact intergroup relations
AN  - 1542000590; 201426969
AB  - Three experiments integrated several theories in psychology and sociology to identify the conditions under which multiculturalism has positive versus negative effects on majority group members' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities. On the basis of social cognitive construal theories, we predicted and found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms by highlighting its broad goals reduced White Americans' prejudice toward ethnic minorities relative to a control condition, whereas construing multiculturalism in concrete terms by highlighting specific ways in which its goals can be achieved increased White Americans' prejudice relative to the same control (Experiments 1 and 2). Using social identity threat research, we found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms decreased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity, whereas construing it in concrete terms increased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity; threat in turn fueled prejudice (Experiments 2 and 3). Perceivers' political orientation moderated the effects of multiculturalism construals on prejudicial attitudes and social distancing behavioral intentions (Experiment 3). Symbolic threat to national identity but not realistic threat to national resources mediated these effects. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate when multiculturalism leads to positive versus negative intergroup outcomes, why, and how political orientation shapes prejudice and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities.

T1  - "Honk Against Homophobia": Rethinking Relations Between Media and Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1445186226
AB  - The theory of "symbolic annihilation" or "symbolic violence" has been used in academic literature to describe the way in which sexual minorities have been ignored, trivialized, or condemned by the media. This article aims to de-center research from issues of media representation to consider the capacity for minority groups to proactively use new media and its various avenues for interactivity, social networking, and feedback to fight social exclusion. This work suggests that new media has become a space in which the nominally marginal in society may acquire "social artillery"--a term used to describe how sexual minorities utilize their expanding and more readily accessible social connections in digital space to combat instances of homophobia. The research draws on the results of an inquiry into the relation between media and a regional youth social justice group in Australia tackling homophobia. The research demonstrates that the group is becoming increasingly adept and comfortable with using a cross-section of media platforms to fulfill their own objectives, rather than seeing themselves as passive subjects of media representation. This article argues that this sets an example for other socially excluded groups looking to renegotiate their relation with the media in regional areas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An exploration into the influence of academic and social values, procrastination, and perceived school belongingness on academic performance
AN  - 1680154001; 201515487
AB  - The results of a structural equation model showed that a tendency to procrastinate, assessed early in college students' first term, was positively related to social values, assessed as concerns over social exclusion, but was negatively related to academic task values and grade goal-setting. The results suggest that procrastination may be a partial mediator of the influence of academic and social values on perceived school belongingness. In addition, the tendency to procrastinate had a direct negative relationship with self-regulatory self-efficacy and perceived school belongingness and was positively related to perceived stress near the end of the term. There was also a statistically significant negative total effect of procrastination on performance-approach and mastery-approach goal orientation and end-of-term grade point average (GPA). Statistically significant positive total effects of performance-approach and mastery-approach achievement goal orientations on GPA were found. However, while a statistically significant direct positive effect of performance-approach orientation on GPA was found, a direct relationship between mastery-approach orientation and GPA was not statistically significant.

T1  - Bullying Among Spanish Secondary Education Students: The Role of Gender Traits, Sexism, and Homophobia
AN  - 1494299824; 201404764
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the combined influence of gender stereotypes, sexism, and homophobia on attitudes toward bullying and bullying behavior. A total of 1,500 Spanish adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age (49.3% girls and 50.7% boys) completed a questionnaire that included measures of bullying, attitudes toward bullying, gender-stereotyped personality traits (instrumentality and expressiveness), hostile and benevolent sexism, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. First, the findings demonstrated that boys scored significantly higher on all the variables assessed except on benevolent sexism. Two similar models were obtained for both sexes. Benevolent sexism and, in boys, more positive attitudes toward gay men predicted more negative attitudes toward bullying when mediated by more expressive gender traits. An inverse pattern was also observed: Hostile sexism predicted more favorable attitudes toward bullying when mediated by instrumental gender traits. Attitudes toward bullying were highly correlated with bullying behavior. The five-predictor variables (including attitudes toward bullying) explained 58% of the variance of bullying behavior in girls and 37% of such variance in boys.

T1  - When Immigration Policies Affect Immigrants' Lives: Commentary
AN  - 1667951625; 201511655
AB  - I write this commentary on the day that a federal judge decided to green-light Section 2B, the 'show me your papers' provision, of Arizona's SB 1070, thus clearing the way for the most controversial portion of this law to take effect. State and local police in Arizona will now be required to verify the legal status of individuals they lawfully stop, detain, or arrest if they have reasonable suspicion that the individual is an undocumented immigrant. Public officials supporting this law contend that SB 1070 is necessary and that undocumented immigrants living and working in Arizona pose a far greater risk and cost the state much more than the law's potential for widespread racial profiling. A central finding in the article by Amuedo-Dorantes et al. is that such tough-on-immigration policies, designed either at the federal or state level, do not have a consequential impact on undocumented immigrants' experiences in securing social, legal, and health-related services.

T1  - Examining the Hostile Media Effect as an Intergroup Phenomenon: The Role of Ingroup Identification and Status
AN  - 1448995880; 201343457
AB  - This approach conceptualizes the hostile media effect (HME) as an intergroup phenomenon. Two empirical studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental, examine the HME in the context of the abortion debate. Both studies show that ingroup identification and group status qualify the HME. Pro-choice and pro-life group members perceived an identical newspaper article as biased against their own viewpoint only if they considered their ingroup to have a lower status in society than the outgroup. In addition, only group members with a stronger ingroup identification showed a HME, particularly because of self-investment components of ingroup identification. Taken together, the findings confirm the important influence of ingroup status and ingroup identification on the HME. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Australian Aboriginal Muslims in Prison
AN  - 1438556098; 201340261
AB  - Australian Aboriginal Muslims in prison are a minority population that has provoked public and political concerns due to its conversion to Islam. In the past decade, Muslims across the globe have become all but synonymous with terror in the global debate, and have frequently suffered forms of social exclusion. Aboriginal Muslim prisoners, having survived on the margins of Australian society, now find themselves branded through the impact of global discourse on Islam and terror and live under the intensified gaze of both the media and agencies of the State. Our curiosity was raised by the fact that a conversion by a small number of Aboriginal inmates has created alarmist media statements, drawing on statements made by both mainstream Australians as well as representatives of the State. Our aim is to query these claims and to highlight the need for constructive analysis of the conversion to Islam amongst all groups of people. This article also brings for the first time in the field, such an extended analysis of quantitative data on this issue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Iraq's Mental Health Crisis
AN  - 1367557478
AB  - The mental health experiences of Iraqis during nearly ten years of international occupation have been underexamined. Contrary to media disinformation concerning "troop withdrawal" and "combat operation reductions," U.S. companies constructed permanent military bases and mega-embassies in Iraq. Added to which, some twenty thousand, UK mercenaries (from companies such as ArmorGroup and Aegis) are still operating in the country. Mental health specialists, including psychiatrists and psychologists, point to the fact that pre-invasion trauma is the underlying factor of Iraqis' mental health disorders, which the 2003 invasion exacerbated; pre-invasion trauma included the Anglo-American-imposed economic sanctions (which devastated the country), the terror of Saddam Hussein's torture regime, and the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). Improvements in mental health are hampered by a considerable lack of services in the country, stigmatic public attitudes to mental health disorders, ongoing traumas (such as sectarian violence and terrorism), and the disparity in the amount of attention given to the Western aggressor-states' military veterans and their Iraqi civilian counterparts.

T1  - Environmental concern and fertility intentions among Canadian university students
AN  - 1139513350
AB  - Little is known about how environmental concern in young adulthood may shape childbearing attitudes and intentions. Here, we examine the relationship between individual environmental concern, fertility intentions, and attitudes toward reproduction in a sample of Canadian university students, N = 139. General environmental concern and pollution-related health concerns both predicted a less positive attitude toward having children. Further, attitude toward having children mediated the negative relationship between pollution-related health concerns and personal fertility intentions. This study offers an important early step in empirical examination of the association between environmental concern and fertility.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bringing the Media in: Newspaper Readership and Human Rights
AN  - 1559006421; 201432608
AB  - Cross-national studies examining human rights outcomes have seldom considered the role of the news media. This is unfortunate, as a large body of work in media studies suggests that the news industry effectively educates citizens, shapes public attitudes, and stimulates political action. I juxtapose these two literatures in a cross-national context to examine the print media's impact on a state's human rights performance. First, examining micro-level evidence from the World Values Survey, I show that an individual's level of media consumption, including newspaper readership, is positively associated with participation in human rights organizations. Next, I present macro-level evidence regarding the aggregate effect of a society's newspaper readership on its human rights record. Analyzing an unbalanced dataset with a maximum of 459 observations across 138 countries covering four waves during the 1980-2000 period, I use ordered probit regression to examine the relationship between a state's newspaper readership and its Amnesty International rating. I find that newspaper readership exerts strong, positive effects on a state's human rights practices net of other standard predictors and temporal/regional controls. Moreover, the effect of readership is robust to a number of alternative specifications that address concerns with ceiling effects, measurement bias, influential observations, sample composition, mediation, endogeneity, and the impact of alternative forms of media consumption (i.e., the Internet and television). Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Argentine Folklore Movement: Sugar Elites, Criollo Workers, and the Politics of Cultural Nationalism, 1900-1955
AN  - 1017869716
AB  - Oscar Chamosa's new monograph, The Argentine Folklore Movement: Sugar Elites, Criollo Workers, and the Politics of Cultural Nationalism, 1900-1955, is the latest addition in a new and rapidly growing historiography that challenges the notion of Argentina's whiteness by critically examining notions of race, regionalism and culture.

[...]the author analyses how folklore emerged upon the national stage through radio and institutional sponsorship during the Depression (Argentina's 'Infamous Decade'), and the triumph of mass politics in the post-war period.

[...]recently, scholars traditionally paid more attention to class identity.

T1  - Modeling Adoption Attitudes: Recalled Maternal Warmth, Affection for Children, and Parenting Motivation
AN  - 1283640396; 201305860
AB  - We tested a model for predicting adoption attitudes: that remembered parental warmth is associated with more positive attitudes toward adoption and that this relationship is mediated by motivation to parent and liking of children. One hundred and eighty-seven university students participated in the study. Controlling for participant gender and adoption experience, the model was supported for maternal warmth, but not for paternal warmth. Specifically, the relationship between recalled maternal warmth and more positive attitudes toward adoption was mediated positively by liking of children and negatively by motivation to parent. The results implicate both childhood experiences and contemporary motives and preferences in adoption attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - White ghettos: The 'crisis of multiculturalism' in post-unification Germany
AN  - 1125219793; 201240705
AB  - This article traces the shifts in German discourses about multiculturalism and the failed experiment of multiculturalism from the early 1990s into the 21st century by analyzing anxieties about emerging 'ethnic ghettos' and 'parallel societies' in Europe. In these discourses, 'Europe' functions simultaneously as an example for the failures of multiculturalism and as a bastion of western values in need of protection. The second part of this article shifts to a discussion on creative political interventions that expose these tensions and contradictions and emphasize the historic dimension of racialized exclusion in Germany and the European context. They describe the effects of social exclusion and propose (often syncretic) translocal forms of solidarity and activism. In their irreverent, playful and performative interventions, activists and artists develop strategies to counter the essentialist culturalisms that underpin the debates about European integration, multiculturalism and the crisis of multiculturalism in the German context.

T1  - Gold fever(?): Sport and national identity -- The Hungarian case
AN  - 1081863295; 201236156
AB  - Owing to the changes in its technological and economic environment, the national contexts that previously defined the world of sport have changed dramatically. The contribution of sport in defining national identity has been discussed by many scholars across a range of national contexts. However, there has not been a critical examination of the role of sport in articulating Hungarian identity. This is somewhat surprising given that Hungary has been very successful in international sporting competitions producing a society that is rich in sport-related collective memories. The objective of this article is to explore the relationship of sport and national identity in Hungary within the context of globalization and social change. Using document analysis and a survey of a representative sample (n = 1027) of the Hungarian adult population the research focuses on public attitudes to sport, and within these, the different aspects of national identity. The achievements of elite Hungarian athletes are emphasized by (sport) politicians and by the media, having an impact on the opinions and expectations of citizens. The results show that for the majority of Hungarian society elite-sport success is important, however, identification decreases in cases of failures and scandals. Issues that are not related to elite sport are not as prominent although these may strengthen national integration regardless of performance success.

T1  - Ethnic-Racial Socialization and Adjustment Among Latino College Students: The Mediating Roles of Ethnic Centrality, Public Regard, and Perceived Barriers to Opportunity
AN  - 863442951; 20582621
AB  - Parents' efforts to socialize their children around issues of ethnicity and race have implications for well-being in several life domains, including academic and psychological adjustment. The present study tested a multiple mediator model in which parental ethnic-racial socialization was linked to psychological adjustment through two dimensions of ethnic identity (ethnic centrality and public regard) as well as two types of perceived barriers to opportunity (language and economic). Data were drawn from a sample of Latino students (N = 227; 65% women) attending a highly selective university. Results suggest that cultural socialization was related to self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and physical symptoms, and that part of its association with self-esteem was mediated by ethnic centrality beliefs. In contrast, preparation for bias had few direct associations with adjustment in this sample; this type of ethnic-racial socialization primarily functioned through its association with public regard and perceived language barriers to upward mobility. Moreover, in predicting self-esteem, public regard and perceived language barriers exhibited equally important roles as mediators of preparation for bias. These findings extend previous research, and implications for future research on ethnic-racial socialization among Latinos are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Liberalizing Telecommunication in Nigeria: Argument for a Democratic Model
AN  - 881461223; 201116782
AB  - In this discussion, we assess the liberalized telecommunication sector in Nigeria against the backdrop of the social and economic realities of a developing society such as ours. In doing so, we demonstrate that the contemporary telecommunication policy in Nigeria is based on a transmission model of communication, a situation which has several negative socio-economic implications, chief among which are economic disempowerment and social exclusion. In the alternative, we advocate a different model for telecommunication policy-making. Such recourse, we argue, can lead to greater democratization of telecommunication and satisfy the communal, cultural and ritual exigencies which Carey's model expects communication policy to satisfy. The model being proposed here is the community -- cultural -- ritual model of democratic telecommunications. Such an approach is also in keeping with the emancipatory theory of media. It is expected that a recourse to this model will safeguard the participation of all sectors of the society whether rich or poor, majority or minority. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Will the "Real" Candidates for President and Vice President Please Stand Up? 2008 Pre- and Post-Debate Viewer Perceptions of Candidate Image
AN  - 862597092; 201110602
AB  - This study of the 2008 first presidential and vice presidential debate builds on past research on viewers' perceptions of candidate images. Going back to the Kennedy-Nixon debates in 1960, image research has been conducted in most presidential election cycles. Findings consistently show that viewers enter the debates with perceptions of candidates' character and leadership qualities and that the debates tend to reinforce rather than change images unless the viewers are undecided or not well informed about a candidate. The results of the 2008 study confirmed trends from past research but also provided some surprises in that most changes in image perception were for Senator Joe Biden, the longest-serving public official in the race. The study concludes that media often assume knowledge about candidates that might not exist and that in the 2008 match-ups, the debates did not provide the "game changer" that the McCain-Palin ticket needed to overcome a growing movement toward the Obama-Biden ticket that began shortly before the first debate.

T1  - Diasporic nationalism and the media: Asian women on the move
AN  - 1928608646
AB  - * Drawing on empirical research in London, this article explores how young Korean, Japanese and Chinese women make sense of transnational lives and the media, and paradoxical consequences for identities. It argues that the tendency to celebrate transnational mobility is often separated from mundane reality and obscures actual conditions and experiences of social exclusion. It further argues that the ethnic media arise at the heart of the paradox of transnational experience, as electronic mediation intensified by the Internet provides a necessary condition for the possibility of diasporic nationalism. Diasporic nationalism emerges as reactionary ethno-nationalism within global knowledge diasporas of people who appear to be bilingual cross-cultural negotiators moving regularly between different cultures and participating in exchanges across national borders. Diasporic nationalism becomes particularly potent and perhaps more salient through transnational flows and movement, nationalizing both transnational spaces and the Internet's simultaneously dis-embedding and re-embedding capacities in forming a partial yet unending connection with home. *

T1  - New Voters, New Outlook? Predispositions, Social Networks, and the Changing Politics of Gay Civil Rights
AN  - 902080268; 201122680
AB  - Objectives: This study examines the factors that shape public acceptance of homosexuality and support for same-sex marriage across age cohorts. Methods: We analyzed data from two national surveys. We constructed hierarchical logistic and hierarchical ordinary least squares regressions for relevant age cohorts in order to test our hypotheses and explore our research questions. Results: Our models suggest that personal contact has a greater impact on the attitudes of younger respondents, positively influencing public acceptance of homosexuality. Alternatively, religious and ideological predispositions have a greater impact on the attitudes of older individuals. When examining public support for gay marriage, we find that younger individuals have higher levels of deliberative engagement with the issue debate, while older individuals rely more heavily on their predispositions when determining issue stance. Interestingly, measures of media exposure are not significantly related to either public acceptance of homosexuality or support for same-sex marriage, suggesting that other factors may have a greater impact on public attitudes at this point in time. Conclusion: The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the emergence of a new political generation and the continuing struggle for gay civil rights.

T1  - Deservingness versus values in public opinion on welfare: The automaticity of the deservingness heuristic
AN  - 835112327; 201101011
AB  - Public attitudes towards welfare policy are often explained by political values and perceptions of deservingness of welfare recipients. This article addresses how the impact of values and perceptions varies depending on the contextual information that citizens have available when forming welfare opinions. It is argued that whenever citizens face deservingness-relevant cues in public debate or the media, a psychological 'deservingness heuristic' is triggered prompting individuals spontaneously to think about welfare policy in terms of who deserves help. This is an automatic process, equally influential among the least and the most politically sophisticated. Moreover, when clear deservingness cues are present, the impact of values on opinions vanishes. These arguments are supported by data from two novel experimental studies embedded in separate nationwide opinion surveys. The findings revise conventional wisdom of how values and heuristics influence public opinion and have major implications for understanding dynamics in aggregate welfare opinion and attempts from political elites to manipulate public opinion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How intragroup dynamics affect behavior in intergroup conflict: The role of group norms, prototypicality, and need to belong
AN  - 822519079; 201068357
AB  - This study explores the role of intragroup dynamics in intergroup conflict. In a computer-mediated negotiation experiment (N = 107), we investigated how a group representative's standing in the group, group norm, and the representative's need to belong influence behavior in intergroup negotiations. We hypothesized that the extent to which peripheral representatives adhere to group norms is contingent on their need to belong, whereas prototypical representatives behave in norm-congruent ways regardless of their need to belong. In support of this idea, results showed that prototypicals behaved more cooperatively when the group norm prescribed cooperation rather than competition. By contrast, peripherals only adhered to the group norm when they had a high need to belong. These findings suggest that peripherals only represent the interests of their group when doing so furthers their self-interest. We discuss implications for theorizing about prototypicality, social exclusion, and conformity to group norms. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - An Investigation of the Determinants of Stigmatization and Prejudice Toward People Living With HIV/AIDS
AN  - 1866473592
AB  - The components and determinants of HIV/AIDS stigma and prejudice were investigated in an online-questionnaire study. The results show that the components of the attitude toward people with HIV/AIDS consist of social distance, demands for political measures, negative stereotypes, and attribution of responsibility to people living with HIV/AIDS. Besides antigay attitudes and false beliefs about ways of infection, the HIV/AIDS attitude is connected to and depends on social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Structural equation modeling indicated that antigay attitudes and false beliefs function as mediator variables for SDO and RWA. Implications of the results are discussed.

T1  - Mediators of the Contact--Prejudice Relation among South African Students on Four University Campuses
AN  - 743066561; 201043377
AB  - Intergroup contact is undoubtedly associated with lower levels of self-reported prejudice. In some situations, however, contact may have little or no association with prejudice. Studies conducted in apartheid South Africa rarely found such an association. Apartheid was overturned in 1994, but there have been few explicit tests of the relationship since then. The present study explored the relation between contact and prejudice in a large (N= 2,599) and diverse nonprobability sample of South Africans. Participants were recruited from four universities. In addition, factors were explored that might modulate the contact--prejudice relation, or have independent effects. The relation between prejudice and contact was larger for affective prejudice (r^D#~ |.35|) than for social distance (r^D#~ |.2|). Analysis showed that the effects of contact were not reducible to those of other variables, although the contact--prejudice relation was mediated in many instances. Adapted from the source document.
