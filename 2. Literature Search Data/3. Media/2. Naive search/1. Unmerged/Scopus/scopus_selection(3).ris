AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet, social media networks have become the primary platform for people to express their views. In addition, network public opinion has a considerable influence on society. Thus, considering the significant impact of online public opinion on society, it is necessary to study and analyze the propagation process for public opinion. In this study, we propose the Media and Interpersonal Relationship-SEIR (MI-SEIR) model based on the SEIR model. Our proposed model considers the impact of media transmission and interpersonal relationships on opinion propagation. Our MI-SEIR model divides the propagation nodes into three categories: support, neutral and opposition. There is a discussion mechanism between these nodes that represents the node's viewpoint value evolution rule based on the node firmness, influence of nodes, quality of media coverage and parameters of infection. The state transition of nodes is decided based on the change of opinion value. Our simulation experimental results show that this model is more representative of the real propagation of online public opinion and is thus of practical significance for research and opinion analysis applications. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The present article analyzes the rising discourses in the Orlando shooting discursive event, which took place on June 12, 2015 in the United States. Deemed constitutive of the American Muslim identity, the new rhetoric of estrangement emerging during the media coverage of the shooting is probed into using Critical Discourse Analysis. Ideological Square theory is adopted to shed light on the mental representations between the notion of the positive, in-group ‘Us’ and that of the negative, out-group ‘Them,’ hence an ideological split between Muslim and non-Muslim Americans. In addition to Van Dijk’s CDA-based tool, the study avails itself of Quantitative Content Analysis as an auxiliary approach to lay the numerical foundation, which consists in providing the occurrences of the statements imbued with the prevailing discourses. The data analyzed were collected from CNN and Fox News via LexisNexis Online Academic Database, and coded and analyzed using Atlas.ti Data Mining software program. The study has resulted in revealing discourses of estrangement subverting America’s proclaimed character religious pluralism and the constitutional ground on which the country is erected. The results and implications can be viewed in the discussed frames serving as a discursive extension of what is labeled ‘war on terror,’ of which the American Muslim community is the major recipient. The analysis is also done against the backdrop of religious pluralism and its suggested notions of tolerance, respect, and integration. © 2019, Academy of Islamic Studies, Dept of Islamic History and Civilization, University of Malaya.

AB  - The factors influencing the dissemination of public opinion on social media, the main carrier of public opinion, are diverse, complex and changeable. Existing studies of influential factors of public opinion dissemination focus on the information itself and information sources in the dissemination process, failing to consider the comprehensive influence of multidimensional factors, such as information content, sources and channels. This study takes the identification of multidimensional influential factors of social media information dissemination as the research object and comprehensively sorts out the influencing factors of public opinion. To improve the scientific basis and accuracy of the research, multidimensional factors, including information characteristics, dissemination network structure and user-level attributes, are selected to analyze the effect of influential factors in different dimensions on the dissemination of social media public opinion information using econometric models. Three main conclusions of this paper are as follows: (1) The traditional information characteristics (information content) and information source attributes (user-level factor) are not the only key factors affecting information dissemination, while the information channel (network structure) is worth more consideration. (2) Netizens tend to pay more attention to the psychological and emotional attributes of information when forwarding public opinions. The communication mode in which offline social elites enlighten the public no longer exists; whether a user is a network celebrity or lives in the central area no longer significantly affects public opinion dissemination. (3) The higher the total amount of information users release, the more the information would interfere with the public opinion. This is mainly because users with a higher level of activity may release more invalid information about advertising that has nothing to do with public opinion events. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Due to multiple reasons, social media and microblogs have gained a lot of interest from researchers in the field of Sentiment Analysis recently. Social media platforms comprise one of the most perfect environments of speech and mind expression. This study aims to perform Sentiment Analysis on Twitter platform to identify the polarity of tweets involved in a trending hashtag or event in Twitter. The chosen method for this study is to use ensemble Machine Learning approach using Naïve Bayesian combined with Support Vector Machine, followed by semantic analysis to improve its accuracy. The outcome of the proposed model will be able to determine the polarity of any given text "tweet" to generate a comprehensive statistical report regarding the public's opinion in a certain matter. These reports can be beneficial to marketing specialists, managers, and even Governments to collect the population thinking in order to enhance the standards of living in a region. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS

AB  - Purpose: With the rapid development of internet technology, open online social networks provide a broader platform for information spreading. While dissemination of information provides convenience for life, it also brings many problems such as security risks and public opinion orientation. Various negative, malicious and false information spread across regions, which seriously affect social harmony and national security. Therefore, this paper aims to minimize negative information such as online rumors that has attracted extensive attention. The most existing algorithms for blocking rumors have prevented the spread of rumors to some extent, but these algorithms are designed based on entire social networks, mainly focusing on the microstructure of the network, i.e. the pairwise relationship or similarity between nodes. The blocking effect of these algorithms may be unsatisfactory in some networks because of the sparse data in the microstructure. Design/methodology/approach: An algorithm for minimizing the influence of dynamic rumor based on community structure is proposed in this paper. The algorithm first divides the network into communities, and integrates the influence of each node within communities and rumor influence probability to measure the influence of each node in the entire network, and then selects key nodes and bridge nodes in communities as blocked nodes. After that, a dynamic blocking strategy is adopted to improve the blocking effect of rumors. Findings: Community structure is one of the most prominent features of networks. It reveals the organizational structure and functional components of a network from a mesoscopic level. The utilization of community structure can provide effective and rich information to solve the problem of data sparsity in the microstructure, thus effectively improve the blocking effect. Extensive experiments on two real-world data sets have validated that the proposed algorithm has superior performance than the baseline algorithms. Originality/value: As an important research direction of social network analysis, rumor minimization has a profound effect on the harmony and stability of society and the development of social media. However, because the rumor spread has the characteristics of multiple propagation paths, fast propagation speed, wide propagation area and time-varying, it is a huge challenge to improve the effectiveness of the rumor blocking algorithm. © 2019, Qingqing Wu, Xianguan Zhao, Lihua Zhou, Yao Wang and Yudi Yang.

AB  - Exposure to media content can shape public opinions about tobacco. Accurately describing content is a first step to showing such effects. Historically, content analyses have hand-coded tobacco-focused texts from a few media sources which ignored passing mention coverage and social media sources, and could not reliably capture over-time variation. By using a combination of crowd-sourced and automated coding, we labeled the population of all e-cigarette and other tobacco-related (including cigarettes, hookah, cigars, etc.) ‘long-form texts’ (focused and passing coverage, in mass media and website articles) and social media items (tweets and YouTube videos) collected May 2014-June 2017 for four tobacco control themes. Automated coding of theme coverage met thresholds for item-level precision and recall, event validation, and weekly-level reliability for most sources, except YouTube. Health, Policy, Addiction and Youth themes were frequent in e-cigarette long-form focused coverage (44%-68%), but not in long-form passing coverage (5%-22%). These themes were less frequent in other tobacco coverage (long-form focused (13-32%) and passing coverage (4-11%)). Themes were infrequent in both e-cigarette (1-3%) and other tobacco tweets (2-4%). Findings demonstrate that passing e-cigarette and other tobacco long-form coverage and social media sources paint different pictures of theme coverage than focused long-form coverage. Automated coding also allowed us to code the amount of data required to estimate reliable weekly theme coverage over three years. E-cigarette theme coverage showed much more week-to-week variation than did other tobacco coverage. Automated coding allows accurate descriptions of theme coverage in passing mentions, social media, and trends in weekly theme coverage. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article elaborates on Jean Baudrillard's ideas about the moral effects of the rise of the consumerist society, and also on Patrick Stokes. conceptual distinctions between different reactions individuals can display when faced with moral decisions. I start from Baudrillard's viewpoint that in the consumerist society, characteristic for the occidental post-modern world, the need (necessity) itself has been replaced by the desire to consume per se. The Western individual perceives abundance as a natural right, and this is transforming both the meaning of work and the value of its products. In essence, Baudrillard describes a form of alienation, with effects that transcend the commercial realm of commodity consumption, and which is better understood within the moral domain. Patrick Stokes exploits the Kierkagaardian concept of interesse while expressing his view of moral vision. He is designing a thought experiment that reveals a fundamental distinction between radically different moral reactions of hypothetical individuals, even when they are sharing the same cultural, educational, political or religious background. Starting from these two positions, I analyze a few situations and events from the world of contemporary tennis, revealing how universal values get to be ignored, or contextualized under the influence of social prejudice and schemas. My conclusion is that, nowadays, we are witnessing a reshaping of the way people regard and act on their values, especially in the realm of social media. Thus, situations that should be approached by the appeal to values such as truth, justice, and humanity, in fact get to be interpreted in a biased way, due to the existence of some pre-existing patterns of understanding. © 2019 Universitatea "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" din Iasi.

AB  - The report surveys the literature on communications and public opinion change, the aim being to improve the media effectiveness of Department of Conservation (DoC) staff working in public awareness and publicity areas. The impact of a public information message or campaign is affected by a large number of interacting factors. These include the effects of different media, the content and presentation of the message, psychological and demographic differences in the audience, and cultural values that differ by country or that change over time. No general theory is available, and some of the research is ambiguous or contradictory. However, the literature does offer frameworks for thinking about the issues, and insights that can be used in the field. Various recommendations are made. These include identifying the specific audiences and the customised messages most appropriate for a particular issue; devising the mix of media and interpersonal communication channels which best suit an individual issue; remaining flexible in the choice of media and in other decisions; and focusing on interactive media and dialogue with audiences. © 2019, New Zealand Department of Conservation.

AB  - Using a random sample of posts on Weibo, this study content analyzes the extent to which Weibo opinion leaders’ tweets are associated with the shifts and variations of public opinion—in terms of topic salience, emotional reactions, agent of responsibility, motivation for condemnation, rhetorical techniques, conviction of blame, and emotional intensity—in the case of the Tianjin Explosion. Building upon a burgeoning research agenda examining the role of Chinese Weibo in the context of two-step flow, this study found that opinion leaders generally reinforce Weibo users’ subjective assessment (e.g., attitudes and emotional responses) of the incident. An overwhelming sleeper effect is also observed in that most posts by the opinion leaders did not contribute to peaks until 2–3 days later. All opinion leaders achieved between one and three peaks. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Anti-EU sentiment has been sweeping the continent recently. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Euroscepticism has been rising in national and European party politics, the European public opinion, national referendums as well as in the European media coverage sceptically criticising the European integration and its achievements. Under those conditions, when the EU is also suffering from an existential crisis, Euroscepticism has become much more mainstream in European politics. In this framework, this study discusses mainstreaming Euroscepticism at the levels of political parties, public and the media. It starts with the puzzle of contested meanings of Euroscepticism. Then, it unravels the complexity and diversity of opposition towards Europe by focusing on the typologies of Euroscepticism.Finally, it shows how Euroscepticism occupies a prominent space in European politics, society and media. Overall, the paper argues that Euroscepticism has become increasingly embedded in the mainstream political debates throughout Europe. © 2019 Universitatea Alexandru Ioan Cuza.

AB  - The current era has brought about major changes in the way people connect to each other, and social media is a major pillar of this change. In this new communication and connecting environment, companies are under pressure to constantly adapt and become present on platforms where their customers are while being sustainable and profitable in the long run. On the other hand, traditional marketing research challenges have led to the expansion of new research approaches like neuromarketing as a means to gather the most accurate data ever from customers. When referring to how we can use neuromarketing research within the social media context, the current paper aims to fill a gap in the current literature: Using neuromarketing research in social media while taking into consideration both companies' purposes and customers' sought-after benefits. This aim is achieved through two pieces of research that shed light on a model where these purposes are matched with the corresponding benefits, showing the degree of acceptability of four major neuromarketing applications. This model is a stepping stone towards discovering how social media neuromarketing research can be a pillar of sustainable business communication as part of the broader perspective of sustainability in terms of business growth. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, in the North China Plain (NCP), most counties and suburban rural regions are promoting the "coal to gas" program under the situation of strong government support of large and medium-sized centralized biogas production (CBP) projects. This paper is aimed at the CBP projects, focuses on rural residents' "willingness to use (WTU)", "willingness to buy (WTB)" and the influencing factors for WTU/WTB. Through the analysis of rural residents from Hebei and Shandong provinces that belong to NCP in this survey, we find that 85% of respondents support the CBP program and the WTB is 63.15 CNY/year per capita, which is much lower than the cost of rural CBP in existing survey regions. The participation of rural residents is not only a manifestation of personal and family characteristics; understanding of environmental knowledge, attitudes, and household energy practices are more important. These non-economic factors seriously affect WTU/WTB. Hence, it is necessary to appropriately increase the government revenue to such projects, strengthen government guidance and publicity, improve the environmental knowledge and attitude of rural residents and guide residents' practice. Based on a fully understanding of residents' consumption decision mechanism, we establish a financial support mechanism due to the demand response, adopt a correct calculation for financial support, such as a reasonable subsidy rate, and seek the greatest commonality of cost, financial support, and demand. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper analyzes the awareness and attitudes of the Chinese public toward genetically modified (GM) foods with different types of labeling and evaluates the impact of public confidence in the government management of GM food labeling has on their attitude. From 2015 to 2016, we conducted a series of surveys to collect data from 1730 respondents, which included consumers, farmers, media, and local agricultural officials in agricultural departments. The results show ~60% of the Chinese public do not know that they usually consume or purchase GM products or products containing GM ingredients. Nearly 80% of the Chinese public are accepting foods labeled as not containing GM ingredients, 57% are accepting foods without labeling, and ~40% are accepting GM-labeled foods. The respondents with a lack of confidence in the government are less likely to embrace GM foods. Those that are more aware of GM products are more likely to accept GM labeled foods. The group having the most positive attitude toward GM-labeled foods is the media, followed by agricultural officials, while the group having the most negative attitude toward GM labeled foods is farmers. Our findings provide an empirical basis to inform GM food labeling policy discussions and possible revisions, which may promote the development of GM foods in China. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines the ways in which current affairs related to diversity and difference, nationally and globally, are represented to Australian children in children’s digital news media and through family discussions. The discussion is based on qualitative research that explores parents’ views and practices in addressing news media and diversity and difference issues with their children. In addition, this project includes a discursive analysis of stories found in Behind The News (BTN), the primary digital news media source for Australian children, aged 8–13 years, from 2015–2018. The news stories are related to three significant topics: the marriage equality debate, refugees and terrorism. Within feminist post-structuralist, post-developmentalist and critical theorist frameworks, a focus is given to examining the dominant discourses that prevail in the stories, which provide insight into how childhood and children’s access to certain types of knowledge is viewed and regulated through media and family practices. Drawing on thematic and Foucaultian discursive analyses, the pilot study findings demonstrate that children’s news media is closely scrutinised and regulated, with major news stories framed within dominant discourses of childhood innocence, as well as the agenda and particular interests of the producers of children’s new media. These topics, which have dominated news in recent years, are frequently considered by some adults as inappropriate or difficult topics to discuss with children. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are playing a major role in removing poverty in the rural India today. The group based model of self help is widely practiced for poverty eradication, rural development and empowerment of women. Self help as a strategy for social development places emphasis on self reliance, human agency and action. It aims to mobilize people, to give them voice and build people‟s organizations that will overcome barriers to participation and empowerment. The central idea of self help is the formation of groups, concept of a community and the development of egalitarian relationships that will promote people‟s well being. SHGs serve as a medium of delivering micro credit to the members and reduce their dependence on explicative informal credit delivery system consisting of money lenders, land lords, traders etc. Empowerment has thus helped women to realize their identity, capability, strengths and power. They have also greater self-confidence and awareness of their rights, are more assertive and more vocal in mixed forums. Women have gained a measure of freedom from irrelevant customs, traditions, practices and prejudices. Thus, the process helped women to understand and realize their unique potential, develop courage to think and act independently, express what they desire, suffer, feel, speak out and express freely, and explore their distinct growth and development. © IJSTR 2019.

AB  - This is an exploratory study that aims to answer the question of whether and to what extent regional media are influential in shaping political awareness and its role in influencing public opinion, especially that of young people. We examined regional media in Egypt, more precisely in the Suez Canal Region. To ensure the validity of our results, we deployed a number of different data collection methods: the collection, analysis, and integration of quantitative and qualitative research. The results reveal that regional media have the potential to contribute effectively in raising youths' political awareness of the public policy-making process. The recommendations specified are the elimination of red tape, governmental bureaucracy, and centralization in the management of regional radio and television is required; also necessary are financial independence and the restructuring of the organizational hierarchy of all state-run regional media.

AB  - This study applies the theory of planned behavior and value-attitude-behavior hierarchy model to examine the influence of green product consumption values on the green product buying attitude and green product purchase behavior. Additionally, unlike the previous studies, the current study explores the moderating effects of the role of government and media exposure in the relationships. Data was collected by an online survey from 238 green product consumers in China. Structural equation modeling was applied for testing the hypothesized relationships. The results of the study have indicated that ecological value and economical value have not significantly influenced the green product buying attitude. In contrast, the health and safety values of green product have positively influenced the green product buying attitude. Moreover, the buying attitude of consumers has a significant positive effect on green product purchase behavior. Furthermore, the results showed that the role of government and media exposure have significantly moderated the relationship between safety value and buying attitude of green product. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate long-term patient satisfaction and symptoms after successful Essure sterilization and the influence of negative publicity on patients' opinion. Design: Survey study. Setting: Two nonacademic hospitals. Patient(s): All 924 women who underwent successful Essure sterilization between 2003 and 2009. Intervention(s): A questionnaire was sent between 2008 and 2010 and in 2018. Main Outcome Measure(s): Patient satisfaction, symptoms, and the influence of negative publicity on patients' opinion of Essure sterilization. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 29 months, 689 of 924 women (74.6%) responded to the first questionnaire. Of these women, 673 of 689 (97.7%) was satisfied with their Essure sterilization and 607 of 689 (88.1%) recommended Essure sterilization to other women. Of the 689 women, 71 (10.3%) reported having symptoms after Essure sterilization for which they had to consult a physician. Most reported symptoms were menstrual and abdominal pain. After a median follow-up of 144 months, 317 of 577 women (54.9%) responded to the second questionnaire. A total of 157 of 317 (49.5%) women reported having symptoms and in 51 (16.1%) women the Essure devices were surgically removed. Among these women, 29 (57%) reported that their symptoms disappeared afterward and 33 of 51 (65%) women reported that negative publicity had somehow affected their decision to undergo surgery. Conclusion(s): After a follow-up of 144 months, approximately 50% of the women reported having symptoms and 16% underwent Essure removal surgery. Publicity had a negative influence on patients' opinion of Essure sterilization, as well as an effect on the decision-making process regarding Essure removal. These data are important when facing women with possible Essure-related complaints. © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine

AB  - Given the tremendous growth of social media platforms, people have been actively spreading not only information in general, but also political opinions. Many research efforts have used social media content to analyse and predict the public opinion towards political events. This work presents an analytical study for measuring the political public opinion towards the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by using Twitter data. The study uses a novel data analysis model that leverages two levels of analysis: country-level analysis and individual-level analysis. The country-level analysis aims to explore the country's overall attitude towards Palestine by: 1) Identifying counties that generated the most topic-focused tweets, 2) Measuring the friendliness of each country towards Palestine. 3) Analysing the change of sentiment over time. The individual-level analysis aims to analyse data based on the activity and background of individuals. The attitudes of opinion leaders and ethnic groups were analysed and discussed in light of countries' attitudes. The rich experience provided in this study through the proposed model for multi-level analysis, the step-by-step procedure, the variety of analysis techniques and the discussion of results can be informative for other developers and data analysts who are interested in analysing social media sentiment about political conflicts in particular. © 2019, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

AB  - The paper applies modern industrial economic theories to give an overview of the emerging phenomenon of digital personal assistants (DPAs). A DPA is an automated system that serves personal usage only and interacts with the user in natural language, meanwhile applying original and third-party services to obtain information and perform various actions. We analyze the economic benefits of increasing usage of DPAs, such as reduction of transaction costs, procompetitive effects, and boosting the e-commerce economy. Besides benefits, however, adopting DPA in life may also contain some risks and downsides, which may reduce the positive welfare effects or even lead to decreasing welfare: biased services, market power on the DPA market and economic dependence on a dominant DPA, potential leveraging of DPA suppliers’ market power into neighboring markets, personalized data (ab)use and privacy, media bias and manipulation of public opinion, and loss of autonomy. We identify the degree of effective competition and the degree of rationality of consumer behavior as the most relevant factors for either the advantages or the disadvantages to prevail and derive first regulatory implications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In China, haze weather has become a major public concern and is frantically discussed by the public. Many people express their views, opinions, or complaints on social media. Effectively extracting this useful information may help to improve our understanding of how the public perceive and respond to haze, and could potentially contribute to environmental policy-making. In this paper, we study how the public perceive haze during haze weather and how this perception changes with seasons based on comment data from a major social media platform in China, Weibo, and using several social network methods, including perceptual keyword cloud mapping, complex network topology characteristics, and social perception analysis. The results showed that the public’s perception was focused on the causes of haze in spring, enjoyment of life and travel in summer, measures to prevent haze in autumn, and the adverse effects of haze on human health in winter. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A wide variety of social media platforms have become integral to contemporary forms of social engagement, including mass protests. Twitter is considered specifically indicative of public attitudes in this regard. This study attempts to examine the feasibility of using Twitter sentiment analysis to predict the 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Tweets representing public opinion are clustered by means of the ‘StreamKM++’ algorithm into three classes (likely, neutral and unlikely). The resulting prediction model for the three classes (using Naïve Bayes) was 96.75 per cent. As such, this study offers a promising way to perform an online prediction of social movements. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The study of the relationship between online social media use and offline political action has mostly limited itself to an examination of political participation (or civic engagement) patterns. Does social media use also relate to the formation of citizens’ voting preferences during an election campaign? We examine this question using individual-level public opinion survey data collected during the 2012 provincial election campaign in Quebec. We find that the relationship between voting intention and social media use is significant, that it is stronger than that found for traditional (or offline) media use, and that it is stronger in the case of voting intention in favor of non-mainstream political parties. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - During the 2015 migration wave, Hungary was a transit, rather than a target, country for migrants fleeing from North Africa and the Middle East to Europe. In reaction to this, Viktor Orbán’s right-wing populist government built a wall on the country’s southern border and launched an anti-migration communication campaign, portraying itself as the saviour of European, Hungarian and Christian values. This article reconstructs the messages and effects of this campaign. It finds that in a context of limited political and media pluralism, an anti-migration campaign may exert a significant impact on public opinion and political behaviour. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Muslim communities have frequently been the victim of vilification and discrimination in Australia and the broader Asian region. This article discusses and compares the narratives around Muslim vilification in Australia and Sri Lanka. Despite the fact that these two nations are vastly different in size, demographics and cultural history, I will argue that there are remarkable similarities in how Muslims are subject to attack in both nations. The hate speech occasioned against Muslims in Sri Lanka and Australia is shaped by almost identical narrative structures and is cultivated in similar online environments. In both cases, anti-Muslim animus is fuelled by a fear of displacement and perceived contamination of what nativists regard as ethnically sovereign territory. I will argue that the underlying sub-text in both cases is owed to a repulsion to the physical presence of Muslims which can be understood in terms of Mary Douglas' concept of the moral pollutant. © 2019 Australian Social Policy Association

AB  - Policy Points Political advertising can influence which issues are public policy priorities. Population health–relevant issues were frequently referenced in televised political advertising in the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 US election cycles, with about one-fourth of all ads aired mentioning traditional public health and health policy topics and more than half referencing broader determinants of population health. The volume of population health–relevant issues referenced in political ads varied by geography, political office, political party, and election cycle. Ads referencing broader determinants of population health (such as employment, education, or gender equality) rarely tied these determinants directly to health outcomes. Context: Political discourse is one way that policymakers and candidates for public office discuss societal problems, propose solutions, and articulate actionable policies that might improve population health. Yet we know little about how politicians define and discuss issues relevant to population health in their major source of electoral communication, campaign advertisements. This study examined the prevalence of references to population health–relevant issues conveyed in campaign advertising for political office at all levels of government in the United States in 2011-2012 and 2015-2016. Understanding advertising as part of the political discourse on topics of relevance to population health yields insights about political agenda-setting and can inform efforts to shape opinion. Methods: We conducted a content analysis of all English-language, candidate-related campaign advertisements aired on local broadcast, national network, and national cable television in the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 election cycles (3,980,457 and 3,767,477 airings, respectively). We analyzed the volume of coverage in these ads about issues relevant to population health, including narrowly defined public health issues as well as a broad range of other social, economic, and environmental factors that affect population health. Findings: Across both election cycles and all electoral races, 26% of campaign advertising discussed issues relevant for the narrowly defined conceptualization of public health and 57% discussed issues pertinent to topics within the more expansive population health conceptualization. There was substantial variation in population health–related content in ads across election cycles, by level of political office, political party, and geographic area. Geographic variation indicates that where a person lives affects their potential exposure to political communication about various health-related topics. Conclusions: Political campaign ads in the United States frequently referenced population health–relevant content at all levels of government, although the ads rarely connected population health–relevant issues to health. Variation in volume and content of these references likely shaped public opinion and the public will to address population health–related policy. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This article analyzes the outcomes of the key healthcare reforms undertaken in Poland and assesses how successful they have been. Contrary to the governmental perspective on success, understood in terms of economic efficiency, we define it in terms of patient satisfaction. As such, health policy is treated as a political system's response to the problems emerging in the public agenda. The analysis therefore focuses on the responsiveness of the healthcare system through patients’ eyes. This analysis takes three main reforms undertaken in post-1989 Poland as reference points. These were: Regional Sickness Funds (Kasy Chorych, 1999); the National Health Fund (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia, 2003/2004); and the waiting lists package and the oncological package (pakiet kolejkowy and pakiet onkologiczny, 2015). Each introduced key institutional changes, but also sparked media interest, public attention, and mass discourse. The article presents the main goals and the most important consequences of the reforms for patients. For the purposes of the analysis, the following patient-oriented indicators of reform success were chosen: (1) public satisfaction with healthcare, (2) waiting times, (3) number of health professionals. The assembled data from national and international databases leads to the conclusion that the reforms have not succeeded. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine the characteristics of Internet memes created and disseminated by proponents and opponents of vaccinations. A quantitative content analysis was performed on 234 pro- and antivaccine memes culled from the vaccination fan pages with the greatest number of followers on Facebook. Coding variables included whether the meme was pro- or antivaccine, percentage of factually incorrect claims, mention of the out-group, persuasive appeals (emotion, fear, and rationality), degree of sarcasm, and number of reactions and shares. The most prevalent themes concerned vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccine injury/safety/autism, and conspiracy theories. Independent t tests indicated that provaccination memes were more likely to use sarcasm whereas antivaccination memes were more likely to contain emotion and fear appeals and inaccurate claims. The percentage veracity of the claims in each meme was fact-checked using authoritative scientific sources. A path analysis applying structural equation modeling revealed that memes containing characteristics that were antivaccine (vs. provaccine), appealed to emotion, and appealed to rationality significantly contributed to greater likelihood of social media reactions and shares. Additional analysis determined that both pro- and antivaccination memes tended to contain more gist than verbatim information, and both groups did not significantly differ on this gist-to-verbatim variable. Findings offer insights to understand the persuasion tactics that provaccine and antivaccine groups apply in memes to persuade others via social media. Understanding these techniques will enable the development of health communication strategies to combat false and damaging vaccine information disseminated on the Internet. © 2019 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the relationship between reason and passion on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo, with an emphasis on the coexistence of emotional and rational arguments as well as how they predict message retransmission. It found that public discussions on the microblogging site are mostly emotional. However, advanced reasoning was also present in emotional discussions, which manifested itself in making appeals to the common good and using logical coherence. Although emotion and rationality are not mutually exclusive, they do produce different retransmission outcomes, with emotion positively related to reposts and the appeal to the common good receiving fewer shares. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conformation of opinion in a society is analyzed in diverse studies, following diverse perspectives, methods and tools. Previous studies are basically descriptive, predictive, and not aiming at modeling the real situation. In this paper, we present a preliminary model representing the process of conformation of public opinion from the perspective of opinion mining, by using the Multilevel Fuzzy Cognitive Map (MFCM), which, in turn, is employed to evaluate the quality of the public opinion. This paper examines the capabilities of such model, for both, knowledge description and knowledge extraction about opinions presented in a certain topic, allowing the assessment of the quality of public opinion. This is very valuable for decision making, as well as for social and political analysis. We give special attention to the influence of the media on public opinion, because of its importance in the actual western society. The design of the MFCM, its concepts and relationships, are presented. The concepts describe the relevant aspects from which public opinion emerges, covering the social, technological and biological domains. The results are encouraging: the model permits to identify the media preferred by the public in order to understand better significant matters, including the high esteem that the new communication media hold, in contrast with the little merit that the traditional communication media enjoys, as well as the confidence and credibility in the information sources (from both, new and old media) diminish in time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years consumers’ concerns regarding the environmental impact of food production has significantly increased, also due to food sustainability, food safety and food security issues. A number of certification systems for environmental-friendly products have been created e.g. water-saving labels and fishery sustainable labels. Among various environmental issues, the protection of biodiversity has recently gained popularity both in public opinion and in scientific debate. This paper describes the results of a Choice Experiment on wine consumers to estimate their willingness to pay for biodiversity conservation practices in vineyards. The survey was conducted by direct interviews at a wine tasting event in an Italian winery located at Montefano (Marche). The results show that consumers are willing to pay a premium price for wine certification that takes into account biodiversity not only for medium-high price wines, but also for low-price wines. Finally, quality of wine and organic certification remain important attributes in wine purchasing choices related to expensive wines. © 2019 UniCeSV, University of Florence

AB  - Communication plans are fundamental for the success of conservation programs, especially when dealing with alien species. In a media-saturated society the effectiveness of communication could be evaluated through the information reported by the media, as an indicator of public attitudes towards a particular issue. We evaluated the effectiveness of a communication campaign by analysing the perception of the media towards management activities to control grey squirrel populations. A media content analysis was performed to classify the news in categories regarding their attitude towards the project. A total of 166 articles were analysed, which corresponds to a mean of one article every 9 days along the 4-years project. News followed peaks of interest in specific periods, generally related with milestones of the project. Half of the negative news regarded management activities in an urban area, despite the softer management approach adopted, with surgical sterilization of animals instead of their euthanasia after live-trapping. A reinforcement of the communication focused in Liguria inverted the trend of negative news which decreased over time, indicating the effectiveness of communication activities. Public support is fundamental for the successful implementation of eradication and control plans. Considering the role of media in informing and driving public opinion, media monitoring is routinely included in the development of management projects. We suggest that a media content analysis can be used as a performance indicator to evaluate the communication effectiveness of conservation projects, helping to identify negative trends so to proactively react. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: The ageing population is increasing, and negative attitudes towards older people are all too common and largely overlooked. However, little research has examined how ageist, prejudice, and discrimination, that often occur in healthcare settings, impact the community's perceptions of entering Residential Aged Care (RAC) in the future. In particular, studies have not investigated how contact with RAC influences individuals’ attitudes towards RAC facilities, residents and staff. This study is the first to examine individuals’ resistance towards living in RAC using the contact hypothesis, a theory of prejudice reduction. Aims: To explore how positive or negative contact with RAC residents and staff impacts individuals’ behavioural intentions towards entering RAC in the future. To examine whether perceptions of trust, independence and RAC staff mediate the relationship between contact and behavioural intentions towards entering RAC in the future. Design: A cross-sectional survey design. Method: Data were collected via online surveys using contact (positive or negative), trust, independence, perceptions of RAC staff and resistance levels (mild refusal or extreme refusal) measures. Participants (n = 373) from Australia and USA were recruited using social media, word of mouth and Amazons Mechanical Turk. Findings: Individuals who experienced negative contact with RAC residents and staff were more likely to report intense resistance to RAC, “I would rather die than enter RAC”. Whereas, positive contact with RAC residents and staff was associated with reductions in the adverse appraisal of RAC staff; a diminished perception that individuals lost their independence, and an increased trust in RAC residents, facilities and staff. Participants from USA reported greater levels of resistance towards RAC in comparison with participants from Australia. This study demonstrates how interactions with RAC residents, facilities and staff are critical in shaping attitudes towards RAC. Implications for practice: It is recommended that the public are exposed to opportunities where they can experience positive contact with RAC. RAC facilities can promote interaction between the public and RAC residents through encouraging participation in community partnership programs/intergenerational programs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - We apply a mixed-method design centred on the deployment of metaphors to explore the role that language plays in the structuring of the public discourses of unconventional hydrocarbon development (UHD) across three major developed economies. We analyse UHD-related metaphorical devices deployed in broadsheet newspapers in Australia, the UK and the USA between January 2006 and May 2018. We develop an innovative Type Hierarchy Approach to metaphors by mapping through directed graph hierarchies. These allow concept-mapping analysis in terms of supertypes and subtypes, i.e. concepts ordered in terms of generality and inclusion as in “rapid expansion” → “explosion”. We find two broad discourses, each containing metaphorical constructions: economic gain across temporal horizons (incorporating boom, bonanza, revolution and death metaphors); and risk tolerance and decision-making (incorporating gamble and insanity metaphors). At the level of individual metaphors, deployment trends and patterns can be mapped along country borders rather than for example political alignment. Boom and bonanza appear most widespread in the USA, whereas UHD as a revolution is more closely associated with UK newspapers. Over time, UHD-related metaphor use decreases in all three countries, potentially reflecting an increasing public acceptance of UHD and moving shale gas from unconventional to conventional hydrocarbon development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exemplification research has consistently shown effects of vox pops’ exemplars on audience judgments, whereby people tend to follow the opinion of a few fellow citizens. In this study, we gain some insight into why—and especially for whom—ordinary citizens are such influential “opinion-givers.” Importantly, we look at populist attitudes as a potential moderator for exemplification effects by comparing news reports containing vox pops with purely journalistic news reports providing the same arguments. In a web-based experiment, we show that both perceptual and persuasive effects are moderated by participants’ populist attitudes, and thus, their resonance with the “voice of the people.”. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - Background: Medical decisions made by celebrities have a profound influence on medical decisions made by the general population. Google Trends (GT) is a free, online resource with virtually no barriers to use that allows for tracking of global search volumes as a proxy for determining public interest. In this study, we utilize GT to characterize the significant and measurable effects that the May 2013 announcement of Angelina Jolie's BRCA-influenced prophylactic mastectomy, May 2015 announcement of Kylie Jenner’s lip augmentation, April 2017 announcement of Caitlyn Jenner’s gender affirming surgery and February 2014 media attention given to Kim Kardashian’s rumored buttock augmentation had on corresponding surgical procedure volumes. Methods: GT databases of search volumes were collected for terms related to prophylactic mastectomy, lip augmentation, gender affirming surgery and buttock augmentation categories from January 2004 to March 2019 using the “related queries” feature. Mean search volumes prior to respective announcements were compared to that of the period starting 6 months after. Additionally, the percent change from the month preceding respective celebrity announcements was compared to the month of the announcement for each search term. Results: For mastectomy, all terms demonstrated peak interest during May 2013. Following Jolie’s announcement, interest in “mastectomy” rose 1328%, “prophylactic mastectomy” rose 324%, “BRCA1” rose 316%, “BRCA2” rose 138% and “BRCA gene” rose 354%. Long-term interest was higher after May 2013 than beforehand for all terms except “prophylactic mastectomy” (each, p < 0.001). Following Kylie Jenner’s announcement, interest in “lip augmentation” rose 43%, “lip enhancement” rose 37%, “lip fillers” rose 3233%, “lip implants” rose 8% and “lip injections” rose 13%. Long-term interest was higher after May 2015 than beforehand for all terms except “lip augmentation” and “lip enhancement” (each, p < 0.001). Following Caitlyn Jenner’s announcement, “gender affirming surgery” rose 119%, “gender reassignment” rose 186%, “gender reassignment surgery” rose 203% and “transgender surgery” rose 35%. Long-term interest was higher after April 2017 than beforehand for all terms except “sex change” (each, p < 0.001). Following Kardashian’s rumored injections, interest in “butt enhancement” rose 34% and “butt implants” rose 100%. Long-term interest was higher after February 2014 than beforehand for all terms (each, p < 0.001). Conclusions: GT data trends correlate with shifts in real-world healthcare utilization and healthcare-related public interest caused by high-profile public events, making it a useful tool for real-time prediction of trends in public health in response to a variety of observable influences.

AB  - The epidemic of political disinformation in social media has in part triggered the transition to the post-truth era in which emotional and ideological appeals are more influential in shaping public opinion than objective facts. In this study we examined the cognitive and affective responses that political disinformation prompted in Facebook, as the most popular social media platform. Through text analysis of user comments corpora on nearly 2,100 political posts from popular sources in Facebook, we found that compared to true news, political disinformation received significantly less analytic responses from Facebook followers. While the results indicated greater anxiety in responses to true news, responses to political disinformation were filled with greater anger and incivility. We also found similar (low) levels of cognitive thinking in responses to extreme conservative and extreme liberal disinformation. Contrary to prior research findings, our results indicated that responses to extreme liberal disinformation in Facebook were filled with greater anger and incivility. This suggests that the incivility and outrage in online political discourses should not be attributed to a specific political party without considering the concurrent political events. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - He Jiankui et al. conducted an experiment that resulted in the birth of the first human babies with germline gene editing. Initial and predominant communications of their work occurred via social media and outside of the norms for reviewing, approving, and engaging around work in science. This case provides an opportunity to reflect on the evolving and increasing presence of social media in science, its strengths, weaknesses, and the potential to develop applications that improve how we review, approve, and engage around the work of science. Social media use in science presents significant challenges. The potential benefits of addressing these challenges and developing new social media tools include greater transparency, access, and engagement—and could nurture the public's trust.

AB  - Until recently, social media were seen to promote democratic discourse on social and political issues. However, this powerful communication ecosystem has come under scrutiny for allowing hostile actors to exploit online discussions in an attempt to manipulate public opinion. A case in point is the ongoing U.S. Congress investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, with Russia accused of, among other things, using trolls (malicious accounts created for the purpose of manipulation) and bots (automated accounts) to spread propaganda and politically biased information. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation campaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation. We collected a dataset of 13 million election-related posts shared on Twitter in the year of 2016 by over a million distinct users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the identified Russian trolls as well as users sharing posts in the same time period on a variety of topics around the 2016 elections. We use label propagation to infer the users’ ideology based on the news sources they share. We are able to classify a large number of the users as liberal or conservative with precision and recall above 84%. Conservative users who retweet Russian trolls produced significantly more tweets than liberal ones, about 8 times as many in terms of tweets. Additionally, trolls’ position in the retweet network is stable overtime, unlike users who retweet them who form the core of the election-related retweet network by the end of 2016. Using state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimate that about 5% and 11% of liberal and conservative users are bots, respectively. Text analysis on the content shared by trolls reveal that conservative trolls talk about refugees, terrorism, and Islam, while liberal trolls talk more about school shootings and the police. Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, it is mainly conservatives who help amplify their message. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Issues related to ethnic-cultural diversity often make the news headlines in popular media and have attracted extensive attention in the political arena, as well as in academic research in psychology, political sciences, and sociology. Political scientist Robert Putnam reported that increased diversity is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including less trust, a decreased sense of community, more prejudice, and more cynicism and mistrust toward politics and politicians. Yet given that follow-up studies have often revealed mixed results, a novel approach to understanding the effects of diversity is needed. Here, we address the impact of diversity from a Person × Context interaction perspective, demonstrating that diversity aggravates the negative attitudes that already exist among certain individuals. Specifically, we review the accumulated evidence showing that people high in authoritarian attitudes are particularly sensitive to diversity and prone to react with increased negativity to out-groups, politicians, the political system, and democracy. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The aim of the article is to contribute to an understanding of the attitudes of post-communist Europe’s inhabitants towards gambling, and of their opinions concerning which activities can be regarded as gambling. The Attitudes Towards Gambling Scale (ATGS-8) questionnaire was used in the survey, ensuring the international comparability of the results. For the subsequent in-depth analysis of attitudes we mainly used multidimensional statistical methods. The survey, conducted in 2017, had 1092 respondents. The least negative attitudes to gambling were found in the younger age groups, while the attitudes of senior citizens were the most negative. Concerning participation in gambling, 68.4% of the respondents had taken part in at least one of the range of gambling activities offered as choices. Participation in gambling is an important factor influencing the overall attitude of the respondents to gambling. Of equal importance was the range of intensity in their perceptions of which games can be considered to be gambling, with four similarly perceived types of gambling identified. The research shows that gambling is perceived negatively by the population of the Czech Republic. The explanation may be found in the substantial media coverage of gambling related to changes in the legislation and the tightening of restrictions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article analyses the discourse about the opposition politician Alexei Navalny in Russian media. Navalny has been actively engaging with his audience through social media and online platforms; however, some media continue to ignore the politician, practically not covering his activities. The article analyses the intensity and sentiment of the media coverage of Navalny based on data from Medialogia. It is concluded that the media in general do cover the politician’s activities and attempts to deliberately ignore news about him are only made by TV stations. However, news about Navalny is often negative. While blogs offer a more positive outlook on the politician’s activities than do the other types of media that the article considers, the majority of the coverage of Navalny in Russian media is of a critical nature. In addition, an analysis of positive and negative news in various types of media suggests that the way the politician’s activities are covered primarily involves not information about what he did or did not do but rather the various media interpretations of these actions. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Social media websites can be used as a data source for mining public opinion on a variety of subjects including climate change. Twitter, in particular, allows for the evaluation of public opinion across both time and space because geotagged tweets include timestamps and geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude). In this study, a large dataset of geotagged tweets containing certain keywords relating to climate change is analyzed using volume analysis and text mining techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Latent Dirichlet allocation was applied for topic modeling to infer the different topics of discussion, and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner was applied for sentiment analysis to determine the overall feelings and attitudes found in the dataset. These techniques are used to compare and contrast the nature of climate change discussion between different countries and over time. Sentiment analysis shows that the overall discussion is negative, especially when users are reacting to political or extreme weather events. Topic modeling shows that the different topics of discussion on climate change are diverse, but some topics are more prevalent than others. In particular, the discussion of climate change in the USA is less focused on policy-related topics than other countries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Two research objectives underlay the present research. First, we tested how frustrated psychological needs caused by the refugee-influx influence the endorsement and selection of refugee-relevant information. Second, we tested how information selection processes contribute to the development of exclusionary attitudes that counteract the integration of refugees into host countries. In a laboratory study (n = 181), frustrated psychological needs decreased participants’ endorsement of a refugee-friendly essay (vs. a control essay). Additionally, frustrated needs led to a biased selection of refugee-hostile over refugee-friendly information and such selection biases, in turn, predicted higher levels of ingroup defense and prejudice toward refugees. The findings imply that host societies’ receptiveness to refugees is influenced by the maintenance of basic psychological needs. © 2019 The Authors European Journal of Social Psychology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media’s portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security’s placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Recent advancements in the development of information and communication technologies have revolutionized risk and crisis communication. This research explored how social media facilitates information seeking, interpretation, and dissemination during extreme weather. Using Twitter data collected during a tornado-warned storm, this study explored the activity of different actor groups. The findings demonstrate that weather professionals and weather enthusiasts acted as “key stewards” who facilitated discussion during the event. Citizens engaged in the dialogue predominately by retweeting and by sharing personal observations of the storm. The results highlight the usefulness of Twitter for the propagation of both official and unofficial storm-related information. This study also supports previous research that suggests that tweet activity may be a reliable indicator of public attention. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Interviews with ordinary people on the street are commonplace in everyday news coverage. These vox pops often voice an explicit opinion or talk about personal experiences. Editorial guidelines exist about the way they should be introduced, as they are not representative of the population. Drawing on an experiment using television news items, we test the influence of vox pop characteristics on perceived public opinion and personal opinion. Results show that vox pop viewpoints have a substantial influence. Moreover, vox pops stating opinions are more influential than vox pops giving personal testimonies. No influence was found of the vox pops’ introduction. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of television consumption patterns on changes in attitudes toward depicted social out-groups. Participants were randomly assigned to view six episodes of Amazon’s Transparent, a comedy-drama program about a family whose father comes out as a transgender woman, in either one 3-hr (“binge-watching”) session or six weekly half-hour (“appointment-viewing”) sessions. Across both groups, we found exposure to the narrative reduced anti-transgender prejudice. Counter to the predictions of the extended elaboration likelihood model and the entertainment overcoming resistance model, however, improvement in prejudice toward transgender people was not predicted by narrative or character involvement. Rather, reduction in prejudice was an outcome of viewing condition, such that those who viewed the program on a schedule of one episode per week exhibited lower levels of postexposure prejudice than those who binge-watched, and their attitudinal changes were more persistent 3 weeks later. Results are discussed in the context of the original elaboration likelihood model, proposing mechanisms for further testing. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - Provided is an overview of early developments relating to the public opinion research industry in Canada prior to the arrival of the American pollster George Gallup's Gallup Poll, which first began appearing in Canadian newspapers in 1941. In particular, this article puts forward (1) an overview of the early use in Canada of survey research techniques, (2) how government agencies and academics were involved in collecting and processing quantitative data relating to Canadian attitudes and behaviours, and (3) how the private sector, including advertising agencies and market research firms, were developing ways to conduct public opinion research relating to consumers and media, including print media and radio. Together, these activities provided a foundation for what would become a fully developed marketing and public opinion research industry in Canada. © 2019 University of Toronto Press.

AB  - Previous research has found language used to describe individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD; e.g., "addict," "substance abuser") contributes to and elicits negative bias among the general public and health care professionals. However, the prevalence in which recovering individuals use these labels to self-identify and the impact of such labels are unknown. The current pilot study, a cross-sectional design, examined the usage of two labels ("addict," "person with a SUD") as well as the differences in recovery outcomes among individuals in recovery. Participants (n = 54) used both labels at high rates ("addict": 66.67%; "person with a SUD": 38.89%), though mutually exclusive use was lower ("addict" only: 35.19%, "person with a SUD" only: 7.5%). Common label use settings included mutual-aid recovery meetings, with friends and family, and on social media. Analysis of variance tests found no statistically significant differences between label groups for recovery capital, self-esteem, internalized stigma and shame, flourishing, or length in recovery. Descriptively, participants using only "person with a SUD" had more positive outcomes, although these individuals also had higher levels of internalized shame. Results suggest that language may have only a marginal impact on individuals in recovery, although professionals and the general public should continue to avoid using stigmatizing labels. Additionally, many individuals in recovery have the ability to discern context and setting, switching between positive and negative labels as appropriate. Future research is warranted given these pilot findings and should focus on long-term impacts of self-labeling and internalized stereotypes among individuals in recovery. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - With news pushed to smart phones in real time and social media reactions spreading across the globe in seconds, the public discussion can appear accelerated and temporally fragmented. In longitudinal datasets across various domains, covering multiple decades, we find increasing gradients and shortened periods in the trajectories of how cultural items receive collective attention. Is this the inevitable conclusion of the way information is disseminated and consumed? Our findings support this hypothesis. Using a simple mathematical model of topics competing for finite collective attention, we are able to explain the empirical data remarkably well. Our modeling suggests that the accelerating ups and downs of popular content are driven by increasing production and consumption of content, resulting in a more rapid exhaustion of limited attention resources. In the interplay with competition for novelty, this causes growing turnover rates and individual topics receiving shorter intervals of collective attention. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This article will address two major related issues regarding Arab culture as an integral part of the globalization ethos. In order to expand the conceptual parameters of globalization and cultural studies, the exclusivity of political and economic globalization will be interrogated in favor of a more diverse, humanitarian definition of the term. At the heart of this argument, inflected by interdisciplinarity and the literature and theory of postcolonial studies, is tolerance, respect, and recognition of difference and for the marginalized voices of the "other." The theoretical framework challenges the stereotyping, homogenization, and misrepresentation of Arabs, colonialist ideas that have been carried over into the practice of globalism and the marginalization of Arab history and culture within world heritage. It is my hope to correct the negative perceptions about the Arab people, mainstream misperceptions of politicians, the media, and public discourse. The article will underscore the diversity and complexity of the identity and history of people in the Middle East and North Africa. Although in the West Arabs are usually synonymous with Muslims, a discussion of Islam and/or Islamophobia will not be addressed in this article. The first part will elaborate on the historical context of the creation of the modern Arab world. Next, various definitions of the main domains of globalism and their correlation to the contemporary Arab world will be summarized. Integrated into both sections are two major issues: The creative resistance that has accompanied the founding of the modern Arab world and the impact of globalization on Arab society, concepts that have played out in the containment of this region. © 2019 Arab Studies Quarterly.

AB  - The current research focuses on the role of both physical and virtual environments in facilitating subtle and blatant prejudice reduction of the Jewish majority toward the Arab minority in Israel. This research was conducted through an online survey of 450 Jewish students who use digital media daily. Virtual contact and exposure to negative content about Arabs on digital media were found to reduce subtle prejudice. We found that face-to-face contact reduces both types of prejudice, whereas the effect of traditional media was not found. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - The imprisonment rate in New Zealand ranks seventh among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Yet the imprisonment of Indigenous people is on par with the United States, which has the world’s highest incarceration rate. Almost 70% of the prison population in New Zealand is comprised of people racialized as non-White. In 2016, the National Government proposed to spend $2.5 billion over a 5-year period to build new prisons (1,500 prison beds) to accommodate a growing prison population. This study assessed public attitudes toward the need for more prisons and the equity of treatment of individuals within the criminal justice system. Findings from a 2016 and 2017 quantitative survey of 5,000 respondents each year revealed that roughly half of the respondents believed the proposed spending for new prisons to be extremely to somewhat necessary. A large proportion of respondents also believed Māori and Pākehā, if convicted of the same crime, are treated similarly within the criminal justice system. New Zealand scholars have critiqued news media coverage of contentious sociopolitical issues, such as crime and prisons, for employing tactics that have worked to construct a morally and culturally deficit “Other” while normalizing whiteness, rendering it invisible and raceless. This article concludes that this process masks racial disparities of individuals located within the criminal justice system and preserves the ideal that prisons are a normal function of the social landscape. © 2018 Georgia State University.

AB  - Political interest is one of the most important individual-level predictors of news media use, public opinion formation, and engagement. When, how, and why some citizens develop a strong interest in politics is, however, less clear. This study analyzes the development of political interest during the formative years of adolescence, using a five-wave panel study among Swedish adolescents, covering a period of 4 years. Based on the citizen communication mediation model, we analyze how interest in political and current affairs news among family and friends influence adolescents’ political interest. Taken together, while the findings lend support for several of the hypotheses, mechanisms, and processes derived from the communication mediation model, parents appear more important than peers when it comes to shaping adolescents’ political interest. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Many states have criminalized “revenge porn,” an increasingly common form of online sexual abuse. Yet, we know little regarding attitudes toward these laws. Through an original survey of nearly 500 U.S. residents, we find widespread public support for criminalization, but support varies by respondent’s self-identified gender and revenge porn type. Women favor criminalization more than men, but support falls among women and men when the subject created the media, colloquially known as “selfies” or “noodz.” Results suggest that women expressing their sexuality are deemed less deserving of protection, reinforcing feminist legal critiques of criminal law as insufficient to prevent sexual abuse. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus vaccination and pre-exposure prophylaxis represent two different emerging preventive tools. Google Trends was used to assess the public interest toward these tools in terms of digital activities. Worldwide web searches concerning the human immunodeficiency virus vaccine represented 0.34 percent, 0.03 percent, and 46.97 percent of human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome treatment–related Google Trends queries, respectively. Concerning temporal trends, digital activities were shown to increase from 0 percent as of 1 January 2004 percent to 46 percent as of 8 October 2017 with two spikes observed in May and July 2012, coinciding with the US Food and Drug Administration approval. Bursts in search number and volume were recorded as human immunodeficiency virus vaccine trials emerged. This search topic has decreased in the past decade in parallel to the increase in Truvada-related topics. Concentrated searches were noticed among African countries with high human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome prevalence. Stakeholders should take advantage of public interest especially in preventive medicine in high disease burden countries. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Off-site construction (OSC) has become the direction of China's construction transformation owing to the disappearance of demographic dividend and demand of environmental sustainability. Although the Chinese government has made efforts to promote OSC, its development progress remains slow. According to technology acceptance theory, the positive attitude and sufficient understanding of the public are of great significance to the advancement of new technology transformations. No relevant study has investigated people's awareness of OSC, and social media platforms provide big data for social science research. Accordingly, this study adopts web crawler technology combined with two methods of text mining, which are topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to explore public attitude toward OSC based on data collected from Sina Weibo. The research findings of this study are as follows: The attention status of the public toward OSC was greatly fluctuated but generally showed an upward tendency. The release of relevant government policies also significantly influenced the attention status of the public. What the public most concern about OSC was the building attributes and performance, such as connection issues, earthquake resistance, and waterproof property. Moreover, the Chinese public had relatively positive sentiments on OSC, and most of them expressed their interest and curiosity about OSC. The leading causes of public negative sentiments were safety issues, technical level, high prices, simplistic design and unemployment, indicating that popularization of the updated information on building performance, supportive policy and long-term significance of OSC was far from enough. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In August 2018, Denmark became the latest European country to ban the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public. Indeed, several European countries such as France, Belgium and Austria have already implemented a ban on the wearing of the niqab in public places in these countries on the basis that the niqab is a symbol of gender oppression, Islamist fundamentalism and lack of integration. This issue has been the subject of heated media, political and public debates; however, the voices of veiled Muslim women remain unheard. Within the framework of Critical Race Feminism, the paper draws on qualitative interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the United Kingdom (UK), in order to explore their views on legislation banning the wearing of the niqab in public. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora’s use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu’s theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants’ references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by ‘the wealthy’ [Ruiz, 2008. “Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy.” Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/02/social-networks-vip-tech-personal-cx_nr_0502style.html]. We analyse the term ‘naco’, a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although substantial literature exists on child sexual abuse (CSA), little is known about abuses children encounter in northern Uganda, a post-conflict area. Media reports have indicated a high incidence for CSA. The study, firstly, explored boys’ and girls’ experiences of sexual abuse by adults in this post-conflict region and secondly, interventions directed at improving the current situation of children at risk of child abuse and the survivors were investigated as well. The study was guided by radical feminism and nested ecological framework theories. Semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 43 sexually abused children. Narrative responses were audio recorded and transcribed. Content qualitative analysis was used to understand sexual offenses from children’s perspectives. Participants mentioned the following as the most perilous situations; laxity in parental roles, cultural norms, and practices, patriarchal attitudes, child sexual desires and attitudes, family breakdown and alcoholism. The study found many reported cases of CSA in the region. The results imply the exigent need of separate units specifically for reporting and handling child sexual offenses, need for personnel training on gender issues and filing system in child protection agencies and family programs for both fathers and mothers on child protection strategies for prevention and mitigation of CSA. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - How do online media increase opinion polarization? The "echo chamber" thesis points to the role of selective exposure to homogeneous views and information. Critics of this view emphasize the potential of online media to expand the ideological spectrum that news consumers encounter. Embedded in this discussion is the assumption that online media affects public opinion via the range of information that it offers to users. We show that online media can induce opinion polarization even among users exposed to ideologically heterogeneous views, by heightening the emotional intensity of the content. Higher affective intensity provokes motivated reasoning, which in turn leads to opinion polarization. The results of an online experiment focusing on the comments section, a user-driven tool of communication whose effects on opinion formation remain poorly understood, show that participants randomly assigned to read an online news article with a user comments section subsequently express more extreme views on the topic of the article than a control group reading the same article without any comments. Consistent with expectations, this effect is driven by the emotional intensity of the comments, lending support to the idea that motivated reasoning is the mechanism behind this effect. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Up until now, the literature on sociological approaches to translation has mainly focused on the self-perceptions of translators. This article analyses the coverage devoted to non-literary translation and translators in the print media in Switzerland. What perceptions of translation are newspapers circulating? Are these hetero-images positively or negatively connoted? A qualitative thematic analysis is conducted on four daily newspapers in Switzerland - Tages-Anzeiger, St. Galler Tagblatt, Le Temps and 24 Heures (two important newspapers for each of the two major official languages) - over a period of one year (spring 2013 - spring 2014). The analysis shows the scarcity and negativism of discourse about non-literary translation in Switzerland: it is depicted as a risky, costly, lonely and peripheral business - results that would need to be compared across media and countries. Understanding the construction of external 'translation talk' may help social actors such as translators or professional societies fight against existing prejudices about translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer affecting women around the world in which the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the one of the recognized causative agent affecting women health. In response to this health issue, the Malaysian government had officially implemented the HPV immunisation programme for secondary schoolchildren in 2010 at the age of 13 years old and above. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sociodemographic determinants of knowledge and attitude among students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) towards the HPV vaccination programme. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-administered questionnaires, recruiting 374 UTAR's students as the respondents by using convenience sampling method. Respondents were categorized as having good/poor level of knowledge and positive/negative attitude towards HPV vaccination. Results: Over half of the respondents were females (64.5%) and the majority were aged 20 years old and below (55.8%). Generally, 54.7% of the total respondents had a high level of knowledge towards HPV vaccine while 57.5% of the total respondents showed a negative attitude towards HPV vaccine. Female respondents aged 20 years old and below showed good knowledge (56.4%) and a more positive attitude (55.8%) towards HPV vaccine. Students from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS) exhibited higher knowledge (67.3%) and positive attitude (62.4%) as compared to the Faculty of Accountancy and Management (FAM) which showed only 32.7% of knowledge and 37.6% of positive attitude towards the HPV vaccination. Conclusion: The majority of UTAR students possess good knowledge regarding HPV vaccination. Nonetheless, they demonstrated a negative attitude towards HPV vaccination, depicting the necessity to impart and further intensify the sense of health awareness among all students, especially among male students. The judicious use of social media apart from the conventional mass media should be an advantage as to enhance the practice of HPV vaccination among them and thereafter minimize the health and economic burdens of cervical cancer. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The refugee sanctuary movement in the United States has shifted to include undocumented immigrants fleeing violence and economic strife. Given the negative tenor of coverage of undocumented immigration, and ties between framing and policy views on immigration, how the media frames sanctuary cities is likely to impact public perceptions of these cities and their policies. To assess media coverage of sanctuary policies, we analyzed articles from five national newspapers from 1980 to 2017 with both human content analysis and dictionary-based computational analysis. We find that framing around religion/morality and conflict has decreased, while stories focusing on crime and partisanship have increased. We discuss implications for public opinion and the likelihood that the American public will take their cues from media framing and elite discourse when it comes to sanctuary policies. © 2019, © 2019 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

AB  - Shark attacks have increased globally and are one of the most widely reported human-wildlife conflicts. Reflecting global trends, the number of recorded attacks has increased in Australian waters. Whether positively or negatively affected, stakeholders potentially often pressure authorities to mitigate economic and human risks when developing shark management policies. This article used discourse analysis to review how attitudes toward management approaches were attributed in Australian newspapers to a range of stakeholders. The most frequently attributed stakeholders were journalists and public office holders; victims, commercial operators, and scientists were least attributed. Although most measures were portrayed as supported by a majority of stakeholders, there was apparent misalignment between reported public and policymaker attitudes, especially regarding lethal control. Despite the ramifications (e.g., social, biological) of shark management and policymaking, reporting of science-informed facts and use of scientists to inform debate were low. Opportunities exist for increased engagement among scientists, journalists, and policymakers. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Based on data from a nationwide Annual Social Survey, the current study investigated the correlation between digital variables and perceived employability among the Jewish majority and Arab minority in Israel.In line with the human capital theory, Internet use for study and digital skills was positively correlated with perceived employability for the Jewish majority. Our findings among Arab participants only partially support our hypotheses. The positive correlation between digital skills and perceived employability corresponds to human capital theory. In contrast, our findings show negative effects for obtaining online services from government offices and e-mail use on perceived employability. These findings should be taken into consideration by e-government media authorities and policymakers, as e-government media have a strong influence on public opinion. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The immigration issue seems to have consolidated a top position on the European political agenda, and the body of literature devoted to explaining attitudes toward immigration continues to expand. Alongside established models focusing on threat perceptions as the central mechanism behind anti-immigration attitudes, increased attention has been paid to the role of media. The aim of the present study is to test the effects of media use on attitudes toward immigration from regions that are perceived to be remote versus those close to the host society. Moreover, the study goes beyond previous research by investigating reciprocal relationships between the use of specific media types and attitudes toward immigration. While the empirical findings suggest that the effects of using traditional news media is weak, right-wing alternative media appears more powerful in influencing immigration attitudes. Specifically, the results indicate that the use of right-wing alternative media reinforces negative attitudes toward perceived remote immigration. At the same time, the use of right-wing alternative media appears to stimulate more positive attitudes toward perceived close immigration. Further, reciprocal relationships were found between right-wing alternative media use and attitudes toward immigration. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - With the accelerating process of globalization and the development of its technological dimension, more and more opportunities and channels are available to the terrorist groups in the world to mobilize resources and advocates. “Islamic State of Iraq and Sham” (ISIS), as the most modern terrorist-excommunicative group (Takfiry), has been able to utilize the Internet and social networks highly adeptly. While ignoring the function of long-term structural and essential factors underlying the formation of ISIS, and also combining the networked society theory and triple forms of identities proposed by Manuel Castells with theoretical discussions on identity making, networking, and mobilization of media, the current article seeks to analyze the role of cyberspace and social networks as accelerating and opportunistic agents in mobilizing resources and disseminating ISIS. Using an explanatory analytical research method, the current article mainly intends to find a reply to the question: What has been the role of online social networks in connection with ISIS as an excommunicative and terrorist group? According to the research hypothesis, due to ISIS’s subtle, prevocational-emotional and targeted utilization of online social networks, the networks have played the role of an accelerator and opportunity maker in some areas including network building, guidance of public opinion, identity making, and the promotion of project identity of this terrorist group. The general conclusion obtained from the article is that ISIS, as the most terrifying and the most modern group equipped with cyber media, has been able to attract many forces out of fanatical religious groups, unemployed people, criminals, etc., worldwide. Additionally, with the recruitment of fanatics, ISIS has been able to accomplish identity making and network building. As a result, regional security and even security in Western countries is also highly endangered. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common disorder that still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in the UK National Health Service. Charities and voluntary organizations offer mental health services, but they are still struggling to promote these services to the individuals who need them. By analyzing social media (SM) content using machine learning techniques, it may be possible to identify which SM users are currently experiencing low mood, thus enabling the targeted advertising of mental health services to the individuals who would benefit from them. Objective: This study aimed to understand SM users' opinions of analysis of SM content for depression and targeted advertising on SM for mental health services. Methods: A Web-based, mixed methods, cross-sectional survey was administered to SM users aged 16 years or older within the United Kingdom. It asked participants about their demographics, their usage of SM, and their history of depression and presented structured and open-ended questions on views of SM content being analyzed for depression and views on receiving targeted advertising for mental health services. Results: A total of 183 participants completed the survey, and 114 (62.3%) of them had previously experienced depression. Participants indicated that they posted less during low moods, and they believed that their SM content would not reflect their depression. They could see the possible benefits of identifying depression from SM content but did not believe that the risks to privacy outweighed these benefits. A majority of the participants would not provide consent for such analysis to be conducted on their data and considered it to be intrusive and exposing. Conclusions: In a climate of distrust of SM platforms' usage of personal data, participants in this survey did not perceive that the benefits of targeting advertisements for mental health services to individuals analyzed as having depression would outweigh the risks to privacy. Future work in this area should proceed with caution and should engage stakeholders at all stages to maximize the transparency and trustworthiness of such research endeavors. © 2020 Universitetet i Oslo.

AB  - PURPOSE: Digital storytelling (DST), broadly speaking, is a storytelling method that is interwoven with digital media. It is commonly used in educational settings or human services to support various sorts of social advocacy. While many of these DST practices have devised methods to engage marginalized groups to express their voices, they lack parallel initiatives to enable audiences to understand those voices. This study examined a story-retelling workshop model called StoryAd, which utilizes productions from DST activities to facilitate face-to-face contact. The workshop itself is also a lite version of DST activity. METHOD: A pilot study was conducted in Hong Kong in 2019. Participants enrolled online, met offline, and their advertisement ideas might go online and contribute back to the stories. The workshop model was evaluated using a one-group pretest-posttest design. The participants were 45 Hong Kong Chinese, aged 18-60. RESULTS: Participants' critical thinking disposition, self-esteem, perspective-taking, and curiosity toward new information increased, while their need for cognitive-closure decreased. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study has proved the feasibility and acceptability of the workshop model. It also opens the discussion about extending DST pedagogy to engage and influence story-readers.

AB  - Tegal Regency has the highest unmet need for family planning at 14.54%, Klaten Regency’s unmet need is still high at 14.40%. The aim of this research is to analyse the factors causing the unmet need in Tegal and Klaten Regencies. The research population includes all the women of reproductive age in couples, with total number of 483,144 and the samples set, selected by simple random sampling of 268 respondents. The result show that is a significant correlation between the number of live children unmet need (p = 0.001), correlation between attitude and unmet need (p = 0.007), correlation between attitude and knowledge (p = 0.001), correlation between age groups and unmet need (p = 0.035), correlation between opinion on contraceptives as a sin and unmet need (p = 0.002), correlation between the respondent’s beliefs that contraceptives are against their religion and the unmet need (p = 0.028), and correlation between social media exposure and unmet need (p = 0.001). The family planning field counselors experience a harder work load as the work areas are getting wider. The paper concludes that perception and knowledge about the definition of unmet need by the family planning field counselors is very limited. The roles of religious and community leaders in providing counseling on contraceptives and unmet need are limited. Based on this study it is suggested that communication, information and education should be developed using interactive dialog method, coordination by and roles of the family planning field counselors should be improved, and family income and wealth should be increased through a family welfare income increasing program. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - How can scientists and risk assessors best communicate with each other, the media, the public, and policy makers what is known, what is guessed, and what is still unknown or uncertain about how changes in air pollution affect human mortality? Current practice includes emphatic pronouncements, striking headlines, and colorful infographics about deaths attributed to air pollution. Important qualifications, uncertainties, and unverified assumptions are often buried deeply in technical paper if they are stated at all. Although some sensational claims about air pollution mortalities have proved to be mistaken, errors and corrections receive little or no attention from media, policy makers, or interest groups who helped to spread the original sensational claims. More encouragingly, substantial recent progress has been made in technical methods for quantifying and communicating what is known about how reducing exposure affects health risks and uncertainties. These advances make it possible to better describe and explain both what we now know and what we are still uncertain about for human health effects of interventions that reduce pollution levels. We review progress in accurate communication about deaths caused by air pollution and discuss how advances in quantitative risk assessment and risk communication can provide a more useful basis for informing public opinion and policy deliberations – one that is more accurate and that answers more relevant questions – than the infographics and sensational claims that dominate risk communication about air pollution deaths today. © 2019 The Author

AB  - Mainstream economic theories went through an intellectual crisis during the recession that hit Western economies in the late 1970s. Academic debates extended to public media and mass culture, starting with the TV shows led by John Kenneth Galbraith (The Age of Uncertainty) and Milton Friedman (Free to Choose). Such a translation of ideas and language had a spillover effect on the academic community. The simultaneous pursuit of honors in distinct fields raises the question of the role of economists in the public debate. By shifting the focal point beyond the notions of expertise and public opinion, this article explores the mechanisms of the conquest of the public sphere by experts and intellectuals, and its consequences on the field of economics. © 2019, University of Toronto.

AB  - The Independence of judicial activism is largely driven by people's perception from the role of the courts in a democratic country. While some believe that judicial activism is necessary for the protection of public interests, others are in the opinion that judiciary functions, The Honorable courts are required to interpret law and not to enact laws. For the purpose of this empirical study Descriptive research is used to show the public opinion on judicial activism, Convenient sampling method is used to collect the samples. Samples are collected with special reference to Chennai. The sample size is 1605. Dependent factor are the factors that influence judicial activism; no cause of action arises against media and rewritten judgments with personal option. It has significant impact of chi square is the research tool used in this research. The primary sources are taken from the general public in the form of survey method and also the secondary data from other journals and web sources. The outcome of the research is that by carrying out chi square test the value is 0.00 for all the three tables hence it is proved that null hypothesis is rejected at all. Media has the right to publish the facts. The reason why public support judicial activism because administration have been apathetic and non performing prevails .The aim of the research is to study about the judicial activism in India with preference to media. © 2020 Mattingley Publishing.

AB  - Oriental representations of Muslims are often manifested in a society’s media, literature, theatre and other creative means of expression. However, these representations, which are often historically and conceptually one-sided, have adverse repercussions for Muslims today, potentially leading to Islamophobia. Orientalism of Muslims in Western writings and discourses have been much discussed, debated and disproved, yet some works of literature continue to disseminate many of the earlier Oriental assertions about Islam/Muslims: that of being terrorists, misogynists, barbaric or uncivilized compared to the civilized West. Sherry Jones’ The Jewel of Medina (2008) chronicles the history of Islam from the time of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, through the voice of his youngest wife Aisha. This paper argues that there is more to the image of the Muslim than what is portrayed by Western writers. Through an "(un)reading” of Sherry Jones’ text, this paper unravels the misconceptions regarding early and forced marriage with a view to address the ways in which these misconceptions could lead to Islamophobia. Using Edward Said’s theory of Contrapuntal reading, which urges the colonized to unread Western canonical texts to unearth the submerged details, this paper identifies and puts to question non-conforming depictions of Muslims in Sherry Jones’ The Jewel of Medina (2008) - while placing the text in its historical space - in an effort to mitigate the growing stereotyping of Muslims and to address misconceptions with regard to Islamic history. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

AB  - India-China border has not been formally demarcated and there are areas where both sides have differing perception of Line of Actual Control (LAC), and its perception on ground have led to a number of skirmishes and standoffs, Doklam being the most recent. The differentiating factor in this standoff was that it took place in a third country, Bhutan. This crisis will remain an important indicator of Indian and Chinese strategic behaviour in any future crisis between the two emerging powers. This will also reflect on India’s relations with other countries in South Asia and vice versa. A major aspect of Indian strategic behaviour that emerged from this crisis was that India can play the game of military brinkmanship and win it. During this crisis, the Chinese strategy of Three Warfares was in full flow and all three components—public opinion/media, legal and psychological warfare—were unleashed on India. This article is based on Indian and Chinese government briefings and press releases, media both print and electronic of the two countries, social media, journals, government reports, and books of the two countries. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - There is no doubt about the usefulness of public opinion toward different issues in social media and theWorld WideWeb. Extracting the feelings of people about an issue from text is not straightforward. Polarity lexicons that assign polarity tags or scores to words and phrases play an important role in sentiment analysis systems. As English is the richest language in this area, getting benefits from existing English resources in order to build new ones has attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years. In this article, we propose a new translation-based approach for building polarity resources in resource-lean languages such as Persian. The results of empirical evaluation of the proposed approach prove its effectiveness. The generated resource is the largest publicly available polarity lexicon for Persian. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - People can share their thoughts and opinion through Social Media which can easily widespread. So many public issues and political views are also discussed on social media. HIV/AIDS is also one of the important topics discussed. This work aims to classify HIV/AIDS related twitter data. Since the twitter data is highly dimensional, it is essential to do reduce dimensionality of the data to attain better classification results. Tweets are collected using keyword search and necessary pre-processing steps are carried out. Then feature extraction methods such as Bag of Words (BOW) model and TF-IDF are implemented. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques are used for dimensionality reduction. Finally, classification is carried out and the results are discussed. © BEIESP.

AB  - Opinion mining is an important area of research in the recent years which combines web mining with computational intelligence to collect opinions through websites, social media, company data analysis and customers. Opinion mining algorithms collect opinions from websites and classify them using the mining process such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and other classifiers. Moreover, opinion mining is useful in business since it highlights the positive or negative attitude of their students as well as the products and services. This helps the business managers to improve their method of services and to modify the products which will suit the student interests. Sentiment analysis is a type of opinion mining technique which uses natural language processing and other computational intelligence techniques to make effective decisions. © IJSTR 2019.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to assess household preparedness for emergency events and its determinants in China. Design A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3541 households in China in 2015. Participants Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome measures Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. Results Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286). Conclusion Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. Lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Posting countermessages is commonly used as a strategy to combat false rumors spreading online. The effectiveness of countermessage exposure has been investigated in past studies, but little is known about its repercussions. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of rumor control by investigating the factors impacting the effectiveness of countermessage exposure. A total of 164 participants were asked to judge the believability of rumor and factual tweets before and after countermessage exposure in a web-based experiment. Two forms of countermessage were compared to examine the effects of countermessages on belief change in the target tweets. One was subjective countermessages based on personal experiences, and the other was objective countermessages based on evidence. The results showed that objective countermessages reduced belief in rumor tweets, whereas subjective countermessages strengthened false beliefs. In addition, the half of the participants who were exposed to objective countermessages randomly mixed with subjective countermessages formed negative attitudes not only toward the rumor tweets but also toward the factual tweets. The results also showed gender differences in response to countermessage exposure; women tended to be more susceptible to countermessages and changed their beliefs regarding the target tweets negatively after the exposure. We discuss the practical implications of the results associated with the adverse effects of countermessage exposure. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: Beauty and an attractive body shape are particularly important during early adulthood, as both are related to greater mating success, positive social feedback, and higher self-esteem. The media may further influence common features of beauty. We tested whether higher body‐dysmorphic disorder (BDD) scores were associated with sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Additionally, we expected that a link between higher BDD scores and higher perceived media pressure would be mediated by lower self‐esteem (SE). Method: 350 young Iranian adults (mean age: 24.17 years; 76.9% females) took part in the study. Participants completed questionnaires covering sociodemographic data, sociocultural attitudes towards appearances, and SE, while experts rated participants for symptoms of body dysmorphic disorders. Results: Higher BDD scores were associated with higher scores for sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, while SE was not associated with BDD or sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Higher scores for sociocultural attitudes towards appearance and media pressure predicted higher BDD scores, while SE had no influence. Conclusion: Among young Iranian adults, sociocultural attitudes towards appearances and BDD scores, as rated by experts’, were related, while SE was not. The shared variance between symptoms of BDD and sociocultural attitudes towards appearance was low, suggesting that other factors such as mating and career concerns together with social feedback might be more important in explaining symptoms of body dysmorphic disorders. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Dementia is a serious public health problem. The more extensive dementia knowledge is, the more conducive it is to early prevention and treatment of dementia. However, no assessment of the general population’s dementia awareness has been conducted so far in China. Thus, this study assessed the national public knowledge of dementia based on mobile internet in China. We assessed 10,562 national respondents recruited based on the most popular social networking service in China, WeChat and analyzed the data using quantitative methods. The overall correct rate of total dementia knowledge was 63.14%. Only half of the participants (50.84%) could identify risk factors accurately. The level of dementia knowledge was positively associated with high education, city residency, and experience of exposure to information on dementia. The sandwich generation (aged 20–60 years) had the highest level of dementia knowledge. Chinese people were found to have a low level of knowledge about dementia, especially those aged over 60 years, with low education and living in rural areas. Further educational programs and campaigns are needed to improve dementia knowledge, with greater focus on the older population as the target audience, emphasis on dementia risk factors as educational content, correcting misconceptions about dementia, and providing more experience of exposure to dementia. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Influenza is an acute respiratory infection. It is a contagious viral illness which can cause moderate to severe symptoms. However, high-risk groups, including children, can develop a severe condition requiring hospitalization that may, in severe cases, result in death. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of Saudi parents toward the influenza vaccine and identify potential barriers to receiving the influenza vaccination. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a questionnaire comprising 27 validated questions to assess parental awareness, knowledge, and attitudes toward the influenza vaccine. The overall attitude of the participants was positive (94.7%). However, their knowledge was generally poor (61.7%). Most participants were aware of the seasonal influenza vaccine (85.5%) and their children were up-to-date with the child national vaccination program vaccines (92.7%). Medical staff and awareness campaigns were the commonest sources of vaccine information. Significant predictors for knowledge about and attitudes toward the influenza vaccine included educational level, working in the medical field, monthly income, awareness of the seasonal influenza vaccine, having received the vaccine as parent, and having a child already vaccinated. Adherence to the influenza vaccination regimen for parents and their children was low. More educational campaigns are needed to increase knowledge about the vaccine. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Twitter is a valuable source for learning about public opinion and political communication. Applying data mining to Twitter content (i.e., “Twitter mining”) offers a way to analyze large numbers of tweets to help us understand political associations the public makes. However, the use of incivility and sarcasm in political discourse may pose a challenge for Twitter mining in the context of politics. In this study, we apply Twitter mining to the 2018 confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to look for possible changes in public opinion of the Court in the wake of the confirmation hearing and to determine whether sarcasm in political messages on Twitter can alter the results of computational methods when using large datasets. Examining two waves of tweets, one in the days immediately following the confirmation and one a month later, we find evidence of a shift in public opinion as associations between the Supreme Court and partisanship emerge only in the latter period. Using sentiment analysis, we also demonstrate that sarcasm led to over-categorization of positive tweets, which altered the results by suggesting that the public viewed partisanship on the Supreme Court favorably. © 2019

AB  - The recovery of California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) populations is an environmental success story, but it has created new challenges given their interactions with sport fisherman. Economic losses to the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) stems both from the loss of fish, as well as the costs of fuel and time spent traveling to new fishing areas to avoid pinnipeds. Management solutions require a firm understanding of the public's perceptions of an issue. To address this shortcoming, we surveyed recreational anglers' perceptions of California sea lions and conducted a content analysis of media coverage of California sea lions in Southern Californian newspapers. We found that as anglers' knowledge of California sea lions increased, their subjective knowledge of the Marine Mammal Protection Act increased as well and they were less likely to advocate the use of lethal removal to manage sea lion issues. Avid fishers were more likely to consider shooting all sea lions as acceptable, and less likely to view controls to restrict human activity from sea lion areas as favorable. Anglers that expressed negative sentiments after an interaction with sea lions while fishing were more likely to view punishing the sea lion favorably, but less likely to view exposing the sea lions to pain as favorable. Our content analysis showed that most articles were about tourism and entertainment and the majority of articles focused on negative effects to sea lions. The media's framing might obscure the successful recovery of California sea lions and flame growing management concerns with stakeholders like anglers, dock workers, and marina occupants. Our survey showed that among stakeholders, increased understanding of the animals increased understanding of the regulatory context of their recovery and repellents as a socially acceptable means of managing the conflict. Thus, we have shown that knowledge among the public and stakeholders will enhance management efforts. Conservation management professionals can influence public attitudes by interacting with the media as well as using communications strategies that highlight the ecological mechanisms behind the conflict as well as the management actions. © 2019

AB  - In the last decade, social media gained a very significant role in public debates, and despite the many intrinsic difficulties of analyzing data streaming from on-line platforms that are poisoned by bots, trolls, and low-quality information, it is undeniable that such data can still be used to test the public opinion and overall mood and to investigate how individuals communicate with each other. With the aim of analyzing the debate in Twitter on the 2016 referendum on the reform of the Italian Constitution, we created an Italian annotated corpus for stance detection for automatically estimating the stance of a relevant number of users. We take into account a diachronic perspective to shed lights on users’ opinion dynamics. Furthermore, different types of social network communities, based on friendships, retweets, quotes, and replies were investigated, in order to analyze the communication among users with similar and divergent viewpoints. We observe particular aspects of users’ behavior. First, our analysis suggests that users tend to be less explicit in expressing their stances after the outcome of the vote; simultaneously, users who exhibit a high number of cross-stance relations tend to become less polarized or to adopt a more neutral style in the following phase of the debate. Second, despite social media networks are generally aggregated in homogeneous communities, we highlight that the structure of the network can strongly change when different types of social relations are considered. In particular, networks defined by means of reply-to messages exhibit inverse homophily by stance, and users use more often replies for expressing diverging opinions, instead of other forms of communication. Interestingly, we also observe that the political polarization increases forthcoming the election and decreases after the election day. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There are both environmental and genetic factors which are associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) development. The primary objective of this study was to examine the predictors associated with people's attitudes towards second hand smoke exposure being a risk factor for development of MS. Methods: The data set was drawn from the Health Canada: Smoking Survey conducted in 2004 and 2005 by Environics Research Group in partnership with Health Canada to survey the public in the province of British Columbia (N = 1468), Newfoundland (N = 1442), Quebec (N = 1404), Ontario (N = 1443) and Saskatchewan (N = 1413). A multilevel mixed effects logistic regression model analysis was carried out in order to determine whether people's perceptions of second hand smoking as a risk factor for MS varied based on the province of residence. Results: Age, sex, having a household member who smoked inside their home, if respondents were bothered by second hand smoke exposure and smoking status were associated with increased odds of people agreeing to second hand smoke exposure being a risk factor for MS development. The province of residence was also a factor in people's perceptions. Conclusion: The study results could guide in the development of stop second hand smoking campaigns on social media, TV and bus stop shelters and enforcement of stricter policies on smoking areas. This could help raise awareness about the risk of second hand smoking and its detrimental effect on people living with MS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On August 9, 2017, South Korea announced a new measure to expand National Health Insurance (NHI) coverage, which was nicknamed “Mooncare.” At the early stage of its implementation, the interpretation of a policy by social actors influences its success and the formation of social conflicts around it. This study sought to identify the strategies for interpreting Mooncare in newspapers and government documents and examine the conflicts between them. Therefore, this study used text mining methods that are well-suited to processing large amounts of natural language data. Findings revealed that, while the conservative newspaper The Chosun Ilbo tended to highlight the financial feasibility of Mooncare, the liberal newspaper The Hankyoreh emphasized the change in rationality of government from the previous administration implied by Mooncare. Additionally, medical newspapers tended to adopt the perspective of healthcare providers and to focus on the changes in the medical system that may threaten them. In contrast, general newspapers tended to adopt the perspective of Mooncare's beneficiaries. Finally, government documents were found to focus on simply introducing the benefits of Mooncare, not responding to the framings of various media. This study identified how various social actors interpreted Mooncare. The results suggest that the government should assume a more active role in the meaning making of the policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: The prototype of the “recidivist pedophile-child murderer” widely portrayed in the media is that of a (moral) monster. The horror and incomprehension of acts that are considered to be immoral, abnormal, and pathological, lead to the view that sex offenders must be “crazy”, “sick” or “perverse”. Attitudes towards sex offenders are generally very negative, and most people think they should be punished severely and locked up for as long as possible, especially child molesters. Women are slightly more understanding. The professionals who work with sex offenders (criminal justice system, care-workers) tend to have more positive perceptions. The aim of this study is to develop French-language tools to assess negative attitudes towards sex offenders. A further aim is to compare the attitudes of professionals, including people working in a CRIAVS (a regional center that provides guidance to professionals working with sex offenders), with those of other people. We will factor in history of sexual abuse, personality traits and emotional distress of the respondents. Method: Participants and procedure. The sample consisted of 405 people (mean age 25.51 ± 9.70 years, 15–70; 58% women). One-third of the respondents were care-workers, of whom 20% (n = 29) worked in a CRIAVS or in a treatment center for sex offenders. They were recruited via a web-based questionnaire created using Sphinx software. Material: The scale of negative social representations of sex offenders comprised 27 items, mostly worded in a derogatory way (e.g. “People who engage in acts of sexual violence are really monstrous”, “… have no place in society”; “… are people just like us”; “… should above all be given treatment”; “… do things that are totally incomprehensible”; “… are obviously very violent”; “… can never stop”). This questionnaire was the subject of a pre-test study. We also translated the Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders (ATS 21) scale, which is structured around three factors (Trust, Intent and Social Distance), each with 7 items. The material also included a personality trait scale (Big Five Inventory-10 items), an emotional distress scale (General Health Questionnaire-12 items) and questions about any history of sexual abuse experienced personally or by a close friend or relation. Results: A principal component factor analysis of responses to items of negative attitudes towards sex offenders yielded a two-factor varimax-rotated solution explaining more than 45% of total variance. The first factor, “Segregation of sex offenders”, concerned items conveying the view that sex offenders should be excluded from society, that they cannot live with other people, that they are monstrous, etc. The second factor, “Sick People”, concerned items giving the view that sex offenders needed above all to be treated, but also related to the fear they inspire, and the impulsive and serious nature of their acts. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were respectively 0.94 and 0.67 (0.93 overall). The results showed strong correlations between ATS (ATS and its 3 factors: Trust, Intent and Social Distance) and the “Segregation of sex offenders”, as well as a significant correlation between Trust (ATS) and “Sick People”. The results showed an effect of age and level of education on the social representations of sex offenders, with less favorable attitudes among the youngest and those with the lowest level of education. There were weak links with personality traits (lower scores on Conscientiousness and higher scores on Neuroticism) and with emotional distress (higher scores on Anxiety-depression). There were also differences between women and men, with women showing greater tolerance than men, although they also scored higher on the “Sick People” factor. There were differences between people living in rural areas, whose attitudes were more negative than those living in urban areas. Finally, the attitudes of care-workers, particularly those working in a CRIAVS or treating sex offenders, were less negative than those of the other participants. Discussion: This study is the first step in the development of a scale of negative attitudes towards sex offenders (with satisfactory internal and external psychometric qualities). Results are consistent with previous data. Pejorative attitudes are an obstacle to the care and rehabilitation of sex offenders. This tool could be used by CRIAVS professionals to evaluate the attitudes of the people or professionals attending their awareness or training programs. This study extends work on the “monster” figure and the segregation of “social deviants”. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Drones are currently being used for commercial, public safety, hobby, and scientific research purposes. Short term and long term forecasts show extensive utilization of drones in various sectors. Yet, it is uncertain if general public accepts this highly potential drone congestion. This quantitative survey study explored public acceptance of drones by using the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) model and using statistical analysis to decrease the uncertainty. The KAP model was utilized in a recent survey study to understand the public opinion of drones. This survey instrument was thoroughly redesigned to better understand general public's knowledge and attitudes of forty different drone applications, and associated risk perceptions. The practice section was redesigned as well to better understand how public uses drones personally and on company level. The results showed that drones were not well accepted at present except for public safety and scientific research applications. Commercial and hobby uses are not supported. Public sees the drones as a risky technology that directly interferes with their privacy. Moreover, public is not aware of most of the future drone applications, and many current applications. The survey was distributed to both general public and stakeholders to represent both part of the society (153 fully completed surveys). A qualitative risk analysis was conducted in this study as well. By considering the results, this study recommends that public and private institutions should collaborate to develop risk mitigation and response strategies to minimize the risks. Also, public needs to get informed on these strategies through mass media and educational institutions. This might help improving the reputation of drones from killer machines or privacy interrupters towards a technology that helps our society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Public expenditure on mental health education has grown exponentially in the past two decades. A qualitative study using focus groups was used to explore whether the experience of stigma among 22 mental health service users improved over time. We identified five major themes on changes in social stigma, perceived stigma, and stigma coping. Stigmatizing and discriminatory experiences were still common in workplace, healthcare system, and relational aspects but some participants perceived that there were reductions in social stigma. Participants believed that media portrayal and celebrity effect were important in fostering greater acceptance toward people with mental illness and the importance of family support and stigma resistance for minimizing the harmful impacts of stigma. The findings are important in the future design of public educational and stigma reduction programs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) require management to mitigate their impact on ecosystems. The success of management decisions often depends on whether they are socially acceptable and to what extent people are willing to be actively involved in an early warning and rapid response system (EWRR). We administered a nation-wide public poll to assess people’s knowledge on plant, insect and fungal IAS; their perception of IAS as an environmental problem; and their support for different IAS management measures. Most respondents (76%) knew the term IAS, and more than half (62%) provided a correct definition. Species with more media attention and those that are easily visible are more frequently identified correctly. Almost all respondents (97%) support an EWRR system; however, there is heterogeneity in terms of the types of actions people approve of. Non-lethal measures garner more support than lethal ones. Gender and previous knowledge also affect the level of agreement. The willingness-to-pay question largely confirmed this, as people were divided into four classes according to their preferences for either biological, mechanical or chemical measures to control IAS; completeness and location of removal; and having an EWRR established. Mechanical removal is the most preferred treatment in two of the four classes, and complete removal is preferred over partial removal in one of the four classes. Having an EWRR is consistently supported in all classes, and removal in urban areas is preferred over removal in forestland in only one class. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents a framework that articulates the complete tourist experience with reference to a traditional local event in Macau—A-Ma Festival. The Stimulus Organism Response (S-O-R) framework is deployed to depict the festival experience as a continuous and multistage process. The festivalscape concept provides an elaboration of the festival construct by considering how attendees form enduring attitudes. The authors use the concept as a medium for conveying key festival messages and values from the attendee perspective. They identified a high incidence of spontaneous involvement in the festival. Festival attendance provided respondents with a considerable enhancement of the destination experience. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Social media not only provide platforms for the public to obtain information about a disease but also allow them to share their opinions and experiences about it. Methods: This study analyzed 3000 tweets systematically selected from over 1 million tweets posted during the 2015 California measles outbreak. Results: News updates were the most tweeted messages (41.4%), followed by personal opinions (33.7%), resources (19.4%), personal experiences (2.5%), and questions (1.6%). Susceptibility was the most discussed health belief (21.8%), followed by cues to action (18.9%) and severity (13.0%). Individuals were significantly more likely to discuss severity. Nonprofit organizations were significantly more likely to offer cues to action than other user types, and media were less likely to include cues to action than other user types. Pro-vaccine tweets were more likely to contain links to traditional mainstream media sources such as newspapers and magazines, and anti-vaccine tweets were more likely to link to emerging news websites. Conclusions: Understanding who posts what on social media during an infectious disease outbreak allows public health agencies to better assess the public's attitudes, sentiments, and needs in order to provide timely and effective information. © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

AB  - This study analyzed the agenda-building capacity of political public relations messages of the Saudi and the U.S. governments during Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East and scrutinized their influence on the media coverage and public opinion. The findings indicate that all three levels of agenda-building received solid empirical support from the data: governmental information subsidies significantly influenced media coverage and public opinion on the level of issues and stakeholders (1st level), their attributes (2nd level), and networked co-occurrences of issues/stakeholders (3rd level of agenda-building). Traditional information subsidies emerged as a powerful tool driving the agenda-building process. The study confirms the effective capacity of public relations communication to build the media and the public agendas in non-Western media culture and expands the applicability of the agenda-building network analysis research to the Middle Eastern media market. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The human psyche is profoundly shaped by its cultural milieu; however, few studies have examined the dynamics of cultural influence in everyday life, especially when it comes to shaping people’s automatic, implicit attitudes. In this quasi-experimental field study, we investigated the effect of transient, but salient, cultural messages—the pop-cultural phenomenon of celebrity “fat-shaming”—on implicit anti-fat attitudes in the population. Adopting the “copycat suicide” methodology, we identified 20 fat-shaming events in the media; next, we obtained data from Project Implicit of participants who had completed the Weight Implicit Association Test from 2004 to 2015. As predicted, fat-shaming led to a spike in women’s (N=93,239) implicit anti-fat attitudes, with events of greater notoriety producing greater spikes. We also observed a general increase in implicit anti-fat attitudes over time. Although these passing comments may appear harmless, we show that feedback at the cultural level can be registered by the “body politic”. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Crises are inevitable for any company, and the fate of a company’s image rests in how well they are responded to. Few studies have experimentally tested the impact that common types of company responses can have on consumers’ perceptions when a negative complaint has been made online. This research sought to expand the strategies put forth for crisis management by image restoration theory (IRT) using best practice research within the context of social mediated crisis communication. An online experiment examined the effect of a company’s response to an online complaint (i.e., professional apology, personal apology, deleting the comment, ignoring the comment, control group) on participants’ perceptions of the company (i.e., perceptions of company caring, attitude). The potential for perceptions of company caring to mediate the relationship between these expanded strategies and IRT’s ultimate aim of attitude change was also tested. An apology, whether professional or personal, improved participants’ perceptions compared to deleting or ignoring the complaint. Caring significantly mediated the relationship between response strategy and participant attitude. Compared to a control group, which had no transgression, ignoring or deleting the complaint led to negative attitudes about the company, while responding to the complaint with a personal or professional apology led to positive attitudes about the company via perceptions of company caring. Results indicate that online complaints could also be seen as opportunities to improve a company’s image, as attitudes toward the company were highest when a transgression occurred and was responded to positively, compared to not having the transgression take place at all (i.e., control condition). Potential extensions to current image repair strategies in the social media environment are discussed. © 2019, Reputation Institute and Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like most strategic communicators, are challenged with breaking through the saturated international media environment as they attempt to influence public opinion. Yet, before strategic communicators can build an agenda, they must get attention from the public. The current study examined how NGOs’ network positions in the public Twitter discussion of the global refugee crisis influenced the public engagement NGOs received during two news events. Drawing from network theory and research, we posed two parallel sets of hypotheses. First, we predicted that NGOs with characteristics of “star” network structures will be well-situated in the network to garner attention. Second, we hypothesized that the “village” around an NGO also contributes to capturing attention. The results from our regressions offer evidence to support both hypotheses. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Background: The legalization of medical and recreational cannabis is a topic of continued debate in countries around the world. It has been suggested that medical cannabis legalization influences cannabis legalization for recreational purposes through increased media attention toward the positive health effects of cannabis. However, the nature of media coverage is likely to vary across mass media and online sources (internet and social media). In addition, effects of information engagement on attitudes may vary depending on whether information was actively sought or obtained incidentally during patterns of regular media use (scanned). Methods: This study uses data from an online survey of Israeli adults (N = 554) to test the association between information seeking and scanning about medical cannabis (from mass media and online sources) and attitudes toward medical cannabis. Furthermore, we test indirect effects of media engagement on attitudes toward cannabis legalization through medical cannabis attitudes. Results: Seeking and scanning for information about medical cannabis from online sources, but not from mass media sources, were associated with positive attitudes toward medical cannabis. Engagement with medical cannabis information from online sources was also indirectly associated with greater support for cannabis legalization, through positive attitudes related to medical cannabis. Conclusion: The results suggest that one mechanism through which medical cannabis legalization is associated with cannabis legalization for all purposes is public engagement with information about medical cannabis in the media, particularly from the internet and social media channels. As increasingly more jurisdictions are expected to legalize medical cannabis, with resulting increase in media attention, support for recreational cannabis legalization may be expected to grow. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vox pops are seemingly unscripted interviews with ordinary people that are usually employed to represent public opinion in news broadcasts. It is the most common form of audience participation through mainstream television, but at the same time its use in news production has been, and still is, under discussion. Vox pops are controversial not just in themselves, but also in the way they are represented. This article conceptualizes vox pops in the age of digital television and problematizes this kind of audience participation in journalistic practice. It critically examines the role of vox pops in today’s television news programs and frames these processes as minimalistic forms of participation and as strategies for mediated authenticity. Through content and textual analysis, this research presents the evolution of the representation of vox pops in Spanish news broadcasts between 2010 and 2016. Attending to the participatory process, the identification of the citizens selected for interviewing, and their newsworthiness, different configurations are analyzed. The text concludes by reflecting on the need to recover vox pops as a practice for relational journalism and as a more balanced invitation to audience participation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The initiation of economic reforms in the 1990s led to major recastings in the media-state-market relationship in India. Looking specifically at the television news media space, the age-old monopoly of the state broadcaster Doordarshan was challenged by the mushrooming of a host of private television news media. Private participation in the television news sector was in sync with the logic of market capitalism. Market-based news model radically altered the nature of production, representation and consumption of news. This paper makes an inquiry into one such predominant aspect of news production, the ascendancy of views/opinion based prime time programming in television news media, in contemporary India. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with journalists, the paper attempts to make sense of the reasons, the nature and significance and the likely impact of such programming on the nature of public discourse in India. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article investigates the patterns of Europeanization of the Italian public sphere during the 2019 European Elections campaign. Europeanization is meant as a multifaceted process. The visibility and salience of the European Union (E.U.) within the public debate is realized by dynamics involving different actors, in terms of interactions, connections and contaminations between different public spheres. The aim of the article is to clarify whether and to what extent the Italian media covered the E.U. during the European Parliament (E.P.) elections campaign and more precisely to assess through which dynamics of Europeanization the E.U. entered the domestic public debate. We relied on data from a human content analysis carried out on 10 Italian media outlets during the seven weeks before election day. Our findings suggest that, compared to 2014, the visibility of E.U. and E.U. related issues is increasing within Italian media coverage. Italian media still maintain a neutral approach to the issue, resisting to Eurosceptic claims from political parties and public opinion. With regard to the Europeanization, we found that media tend to focus on the vertical dimension especially, providing visibility to domestic actors addressing the E.U. and its political actors. Elements of horizontal Europeanization, instead, are mainly referred to events from other E.U. member states, with few connections among political actors. All in all, our results confirm the idea of a growing centrality of the E.U. within national public debate combined with signals of more structured and substantial Europeanization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Clubfoot is a treatable abnormality that can be managed with early intervention. However, there is a lack of public knowledge regarding clubfoot, which can delay treatment. This study aimed to assess the public awareness of clubfoot and knowledge regarding the importance of treatment in early childhood. Methods: This cross-sectional survey spanned 6 months, from June through November 2018, and involved persons living in Saudi Arabia. To collect data on public awareness of clubfoot risk factors, treatment, and prognosis, a questionnaire was developed by orthopedic experts and disseminated online. The target population included people of both genders and all age groups from the general population, regardless of their knowledge of someone with clubfoot. Results: By the end of the study period, 746 participants completed the online survey. In total, 520 of the respondents (69.7%) had never heard about clubfoot syndrome. Among the participants, 5.4% had a child with clubfoot syndrome and 4.6% were aware of clubfoot because they had an affected child. The top resource accessed by respondents for obtaining knowledge about clubfoot was social media channels (38.4%), followed by obtaining knowledge from relatives and friends (19.9%). The most reported perceived cause of clubfoot was hereditary and genetic disorders (58.4%), followed by neurological disorders (39.9%). Conclusions: Results show that there is low public knowledge of clubfoot which may be attributed to a lack of awareness campaigns. We recommend increasing awareness regarding clubfoot through social media platforms and public campaigns in key locations, such as malls, as this may encourage people to seek early treatment. This is important because early management of clubfoot is less invasive and with regular follow-up, leads to better patient outcomes. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In linguistic large group emergency decision-making (LGEDM), the linguistic information of large numbers of decision makers (DMs) needs to be fused to reach a collective decision. During the decision process, individual linguistic risk appetites and the provision of incomplete information under time pressure need to be considered. In this paper, we define the generalized asymmetric linguistic D number (GALDN) and propose a corresponding fusion method to effectively express and fuse the incomplete linguistic information of a large group of DMs. In this novel method, a GALDN-extended linguistic preference relation that satisfies additive consistency is designed. Moreover, the public opinions related to emergency events on social media are taken into consideration in the LGEDM. The themes of public concern are regarded as a fundamental basis for criteria selection. Finally, a case study about a fire and explosion accident is employed to justify the validity of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On the 4 February 2019, the Western Cape Department of Health's Facebook page announced the implementation of a school-based vaccination campaign aimed to administer the first doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in public schools to Grade 4 girls who are nine years old. This announcement was met with a flurry of social media responses posted on the campaign's Facebook page. This study identifies determinants of vaccine hesitancy amongst responses provided by social media users to this post. On 8 March 2019, we conducted a qualitative study including all 157 comments to the Facebook post. The post had 659 ‘emotion’ reactions: 574 “likes”, 62 “loves”, 21 “angry faces”, 2 “laughs”, 2 “wows” and 1 “sad face”. An overwhelming majority (636/659 i.e. 97%) of reactions were favourable to the HPV vaccination campaign. Out of the 157 comments, we judged 52 (33%) of them to be ‘hesitant’, suggesting that people with negative reactions though few in number, were more likely to be vocal deniers. Concern around the safety of HPV vaccines including effects on reproductive health was the most common theme identified. Other emerging themes included: risk of cervical cancer perceived as being low, issues around consent, concerns that girls are being used for research, questionable vaccine effectiveness, use of the school-based strategy for the campaign, risk-benefits calculations of HPV vaccination and constraints such as stock-outs. Knowing someone who had been affected or being at risk of cervical cancer, having knowledge about the causes of cervical cancer, confidence in the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, knowing the vaccine was being used in high income settings, and having strong recommendations from the World Health Organisation and key actors seemed to increase the willingness to accept the vaccine. The magnitude and causes of HPV vaccine hesitancy need to be investigated to ensure the success of this programme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper addresses the issues of identity crises caused by transcultural exchange, the political unconscious of the rise of China, and the cultural politics of transnationality in Ha Jin’s The Boat Rocker. The Boat Rocker is a novel which reveals the betrayal, displacement, and conspiracy lurking behind such concepts as national loyalty, trust in traditional values, and identification with one’s roots. The Boat Rocker is also a timely reflection of the momentous election year of 2016 in which it was written, addressing fears of foreign-sponsored sedition, propaganda and the manipulation of media, the malleability of public opinion, the unholy alliance between the U.S. and Chinese state governance, and the post 9/11 political environment which led the U.S. to that point. The novel takes the form of a self-reflexive dialogue in which China sees itself reflected in America and America in China. In the process of exchanging languages and culture, the Chinese characters adapt to the American way of life, producing a unique form of Americanness with special Chinese characteristics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research explores the effects of visual representations of immigrants and refugees in U.S. news outlets. Study 1 examined news photographs about immigrants and refugees that were shared on Twitter by regional news outlets in all 50 states. Most photos contained either a human interest frame, featuring immigrants and refugees as everyday people, or a political frame, showcasing politicians. Study 2’s experiment determined the effects of these visuals on participants’ emotions and, in turn, their attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. The political frame increased negative emotions, leading to negative attitudes. The human interest frame increased positive emotions, enhancing positive attitudes. © 2019, © 2019 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - How does media use and individualsʼ senses of political efficacy affect their attitudes towards immigrants in southern Europe? While studies of the media offer contrasting results concerning their effects on anti-immigrant sentiments, research on political efficacy shows that citizens who feel able to influence politics may develop more positive attitudes towards immigration. In this article, public perceptions of non-European immigrants, in the host countries, are analysed over time (2014–2017) using Eurobarometer data. By analysing the links between attitudes towards immigration, media use, and political efficacy during the migration crises using multivariate analysis, I find that in times of crisis the use of (traditional and new) media, and political efficacy, positively affect people’s attitudes towards non-European immigration. © 2019, © 2019 The Founding Editors, Contemporary Italian Politics.

AB  - This study examined the effects of joining and actively participating in electronic-cigarette-related social media communities (SMCs), along with e-cigarette-related subjective norms, and social identification with other electronic-cigarette (e-cigarette) users, on current e-cigarette users’ attitudes toward quitting, self-efficacy, and intention to quit. Results (n = 1016) indicated that greater e-cigarette-related social media use, more positive e-cigarette-related subjective norms and greater identification with other e-cigarette users, resulted in significantly more negative attitudes toward quitting, lower self-efficacy and lower intention to quit. E-cigarette-related social media use also interacted with subjective norms to influence intention to quit, and with identification with other e-cigarette users to influence self-efficacy. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The doctor-patient relationship may be affected by the indiscriminate use of social media platforms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the content of the photos posted on medical students’ Facebook accounts to determine whether they have posted private patient information and compare this to their self-reported behavior of posting such photos. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of medical students from a Peruvian private university. With their permission, we reviewed their Facebook accounts for the publication of photos or documents that included private patient information (face, name, diagnosis, medical exams). Those who allowed access to their Facebook accounts were also asked to complete an online survey. We assessed variables related to sociodemographic aspects, self reported Facebook use, and what type of private patient information they posted. Results: A total of 160/220 students joined the study, 59% were women, mean age: 20 years. 25.7% self-reported having posted private patient information in their Facebook profiles but we found such information on 33.1% of the students’ pages. Of the pages where private patient information was found, in 94% of cases, the patients’ faces were identifiable, and in 7.6%, the patients’ real names appeared. However, only half of the students believed that the information in their Facebook post might affect or influence the doctor-patient relationship. Association with narcissism, gender, and account privacy was not found. Having uploaded more than 250 photos (OR:2.90; CI95%:1.14-7.39) and posting photos tagged with the location of a hospital (OR:4.02; CI95%:1.36-11.9) were associated with having posted photos containing private patient information. Conclusion: One out of three of medical students posted patients’ private information on their personal Facebook profiles. Development, dissemination, and implementation of guidelines related to ethics in social media platforms are needed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary study to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) associated with antibiotic use among medical students (MS) and non-medical students (NMS) at Kathmandu University, Nepal. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1223 students for a cross-sectional study. In total, 1222 questionnaires collected from 609 MS and 613 NMS were regarded as effective. A t-test and Chi-square test were applied to analyze the data. A total of 25 out of 39 questions in the KAP survey were found to have statistical significance. The MS showed higher levels of knowledge/attitude/practice associated with antibiotic use than the NMS. Significant gaps were found in and between the MS and NMS in the first and final years of study. Interventions, such as lectures, courses, workshops, and seminars on antibiotic use, along with internet and media campaigns, etc., are needed to improve the awareness and change the behavior of both the MS and the NMS of universities with regards to the rational use of antibiotics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Since 2000, Vladimir Putin has used various means to consolidate a non-democratic regime in Russia. While regime support comes from many factors, the literature lacks consensus on whether social media use (SNS) associates with public support for non-democratic regimes. This study analyses whether using particular SNS platforms associate with more positive or negative evaluations of the regime in Russia. The mixed findings show that Russian SNS users have very nuanced attitudes towards the regime and its actors. Further, while Facebook and Twitter users are more critical of political actors and their work in protecting democracy, other platform-specific associations are additive. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women’s sexual orientation. Two hundred cisgender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - High-choice media environments allow people to cocoon themselves with like-minded messages (confirmation bias), which could shape both individual attitudes and perceived prevalence of opinions. This study builds on motivated cognition and spiral of silence theory to disentangle how browsing political messages (both selective exposure as viewing full articles and incidental exposure as encountering leads only) shapes perceived public opinion and subsequently attitudes. Participants (N = 115) browsed online articles on controversial topics; related attitudes and public opinion perceptions were captured before and after. Multi-level modeling demonstrated a confirmation bias. Both selective and incidental exposure affected attitudes per message stance, with stronger impacts for selective exposure. Opinion climate perceptions mediated selective exposure impacts on attitudes. © 2019, © 2019 National Communication Association.

AB  - Disdain for empirical science has a long history dating back to eighteenth-century debates about the Earth’s surface formation. Scientific debates over global catastrophic flooding and the Earth’s geologic age were resolved by the mid-nineteenth century, but subsequent nonscientific debates about the Earth’s age and biological evolution spawned a distrust of science that hardened in the twentieth century. Disregard for science grew in the United States with abandonment of science-based policy by government and manipulation of public opinion by social media. Consequently, climate change denial was readily accepted by a preconditioned antiscience culture. Expansion of antiscience sentiment led to rejection of conventional news outlets and information verification in a “post-truth” era in which alternate realities are acceptable despite clear contradictions with observable facts. Critical reasoning and vetting of information are in decline, which leaves democracy vulnerable to manipulation. Reliable information is available but obscured by disinformation. Public scrutiny of information and demand for fact checking and reporting of sources are essential given growth of alternative media that have no checks on the verity of content. Academics should get involved in popular media to counter propaganda and to reconstruct a culture of critical reasoning by voters and science-based decisions by policymakers. Key Words: antiscience, critical reasoning, democracy, history of science. © 2019, © 2019 by American Association of Geographers.

AB  - This study deals with the penetration of the Internet in all spheres of life, including its increasing influence on the political views of people. Internet memes are becoming a specific reflection of modern reality and a new kind of socio-political discourse. Therefore, the study aimed to study and analyze the most popular Internet memes in the Chinese media space, compare the main trends in modern Chinese, and determine their connection with key events within China and abroad. The main result of the study was the identification of new linguistic and cultural characteristics in the compilation of the Internet meme. Moreover, during the study, it was proved that most of the Internet memes are socially or politically colored, some of them penetrate from unofficial Internet space to a higher language level and are included in the generally accepted active language reserve. © Kamla-Raj 2019.

AB  - Women’s health is of particular concern in India as numbers involving Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) are rising alongside Reproductive and Sexual health disorders. Women’s health must, therefore, encompass women’s sexual and reproductive health, as well as NCDs. Media coverage of issues related to women’s health plays a vital role in increasing awareness, influencing public opinion, and motivating change in health policies. Hence, this study was designed to assess news coverage of women’s health in India. Method: Online daily news media exclusively covering health in India from June 2018-May 2019 were systematically analyzed, and articles concerning women’s health were identified. The articles were taken from two national online daily news media reporting in English language about women’s Reproductive and Sexual health and Noncommunicable diseases, and the pieces were coded and analyzed. Results: Out of a total of 240 articles, 108 relevant to the study were identified from two online news media which enjoyed high readership. The articles were a mix of news, features, and commentary/interview. The articles covered various disease types (Reproductive and Sexual Health, CVD, Cancer, Respiratory Diseases, Diabetes, Mental Health, General Wellbeing, and Other).The article coverage included research study findings from India, international agencies / countries, or global. Prevention, diagnostics and therapy, location or context of the news, and the stakeholders were also covered. The analyses show reportage mostly covering diseases affecting women’s Reproductive and Sexual Health and Cancer. Limited information was provided on most of the significant Non-communicable Diseases like Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), Diabetes, Chronic respiratory diseases. The rate of NCDs affecting women in India is galloping. The skew in the article coverage of conditions may create a gap in awareness about more pressing NCDs and hence may fail to influence policy actions at the governmental or industry level. Further the articles mentioned stakeholders like the government, global/international agencies or countries, and individual. There was a lesser mention of industry. Some lost opportunities in the media coverage have been identified as lack of a balance in the articles published on diseases, lack of comprehensiveness in terms of disease burden, stakeholder role or lack of suggestions for policy changes. Conclusion: Gaps exist in the current online news media coverage on women’s health in India, suggesting the need for more comprehensive coverage of diseases and influencing policy action of the government and industry. Through better coverage of the major NCDs, quantification of the health burden and suggestion for policy actions, the media can play a critical role in galvanizing India’s movement on women’s health. These data suggest opportunities for government and industry. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.

AB  - The form and functions of political discourse have considerably taken a new orientation with the evolving ways of communication. Twitter is a platform that is increasingly preferred by the political elites for the purpose of gaining public acclaim and propagating political ideologies. The political discourse on Twitter requires a critical attention toward linguistic structures and strategies to uncover the relationship between language and social practices. For this purpose, tweets of two eminent Pakistani political figures are chosen for unmasking a variety of discourse strategies at work from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (CDA) through the socio-cognitive model of ideological square. The analysis uncovers the hidden ideological structures and strategies realized through a number of rhetorical moves in the selected tweets. The cognitive binary of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation help achieving political domination and legitimization of political actions by controlling the public opinion. The underlying motives vary and are context bound such as the aims to topple a government or to restore public faith in the governance. This research is significant for political discourse analysts as well as the general public, as a means for analytical activism propagated by any CDA inquiry, and paves way for further research in the use of social media platforms for political purposes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Disorder of autistic spectrum has a high rate of spread in Russia and the world. Russian statistics is subject to deformities in relation to the disease. People diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and their families are socially excluded. It manifests itself in the institutional plane and in the discursive media space. In the institutional environment, positive changes occur to solve the problem: The work of public organizations and special - virtual and real - social media platforms are intensifying, the information space of messages and news about autism is increasing, the conservative state system is gradually transforming measures of social and educational policies in an inclusive manner. However, at the institutional level of the mass media and public opinion, a wary and often prejudiced attitude towards people and children with mental disorders continues to persist. Among all types of disabilities, mental disorders are the most discriminated. This prevents the implementation of measures of social inclusion by civil society institutions and the state. Intensive informational and educational work with the Russian population is required to overcome myths and stereotypes regarding children and adults with ASD. © BEIESP.

AB  - Theoretical research on political communication between MPs and the public has focused on the role, activities, and perceptions of the MPs themselves without noting the existence of an intermediate layer: parliamentary assistants (PAs). This study attempts to investigate how the public perceives, practically and ethically, the (non)involvement of MPs, that is, reliance on PAs for SNSs (social network sites) communication with the public and to fill out the theoretical void in the discourse process. Questionnaires were sent to all 120 members of the 20th Israeli Knesset (MKs), with 44 responding. We examined the extent of their involvement and the MKs’ use patterns of Facebook, creating a model of four MK involvement levels. The idea was to check the extent of PAs’ authoring posts on behalf of MKs, what we call “Postwriting” (= post ghostwriting) in the MK’s name (or giving the impression that the MKs had themselves posted). Then we conducted a public opinion poll (N = 505) in order to discern what the public thought about the nature of its relationship with MKs on Facebook, compared to the findings that emerged from the model of the MKs’ involvement in actual practice. The two parts of the study also enabled us to investigate the ethical perceptions and implications arising from the study. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A repeated argument to invalidate the legitimacy of a debate on Catalonia’s independence is the existence of a spiral of silence affecting unionist supporters. However, we find inconclusive empirical evidence to sustain this claim. Although survey data show that willingness to talk about secession is higher among proindependence supporters both in face-to-face and online environments, multivariate regression models – taking into account the perception of the opinion climate – reveal a different and more complex picture. Pro-independence supporters are highly mobilized particularly in like-minded and private environments, but this enthusiasm decreases when they perceive their ideas not to be shared by the majority, whereas unionist supporters show a more stable pattern irrespective of the opinion climate. In publicly exposed arenas like social media, where activists abound, willingness to talk is lower and differences between both sides are minimal. Overall, the results are hardly consistent with the patterns of behaviour that would be expected in a spiral of silence. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Twitter is an important source of information that people frequently contribute to and rely on for emerging topics, public opinions, and event awareness. Crisis-relevant tweets can potentially avail a magnitude of applications such as helping authorities and governments become aware of situations and thus offer better responses. Onemajor challenge toward crisis-awareness in Twitter is to identify those tweets that are relevant to unseen crises. In this article, we propose an automatic labeling approach to distinguishing crisis-relevant tweets while differentiating source types (e.g., government or personal accounts) simultaneously. We first analyze and identify tweet-specific linguistic, sentimental, and emotional features based on statistical topic modeling. Then, we design a novel correlative convolutional neural network which uses a shared hidden layer to learn effective representations of the multi-faceted features. The model can discover salient information while being robust to the variations and noises in tweets and sources. To obtain a bird's-eye view of a crisis event, we further develop an approach to automatically summarize key information of identified tweets. Empirical evaluation on a real Twitter dataset demonstrates the feasibility of discerning relevant tweets for an unseen crisis. The applicability of our proposed approach is further demonstrated with a crisis aider system. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - A communication platform such as social media often works to change or influence opinions when it comes to political views. Microblogging platforms such as Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram enable users to con-tribute new postings which are publicly visible. Twitter stood out as overpowering news equipment, giving information to the world. It is very common for users to logo on to this site for immediate update on recent happenings like natural disasters, political events etc. Due to the enlarging reputation of Twitter, this aroused spammers to circulate false information. The proposed scheme seeks to reduce the spread of false information in Twitter using blockchain consensus algorithm, along with classification and machine learning algorithms. A "tweet" gets posted based on the validation provided by the nodes in the blockchain. The system works according to the sensitivity of the tweet. © BEIESP.

AB  - Background: Social networks such as Twitter offer the clinical research community a novel opportunity for engaging potential study participants based on user activity data. However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. Researchers have voiced the need for involving users’ perspectives in the development of ethical norms and regulations. Objective: This study examined the attitudes and level of concern among Twitter users and nonusers about using Twitter for monitoring social media users and their conversations to recruit potential clinical trial participants. Methods: We used two online methods for recruiting study participants: the open survey was (1) advertised on Twitter between May 23 and June 8, 2017, and (2) deployed on TurkPrime, a crowdsourcing data acquisition platform, between May 23 and June 8, 2017. Eligible participants were adults, 18 years of age or older, who lived in the United States. People with and without Twitter accounts were included in the study. Results: While nearly half the respondents—on Twitter (94/603, 15.6%) and on TurkPrime (509/603, 84.4%)—indicated agreement that social media monitoring constitutes a form of eavesdropping that invades their privacy, over one-third disagreed and nearly 1 in 5 had no opinion. A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents’ general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P<.005). We found associations between respondents’ Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P<.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). As Twitter literacy increased, so did people’s concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs obesity vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information. Conclusions: The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Accurate confidence—confidence that reflects the accuracy of knowledge—can be relevant for decision-making in areas of high uncertainty. Accuracy of confidence is of particular importance in the area of climate change where scientifically correct information exists alongside misinformation in the public discourse and media. Here we assess the accuracy of confidence in climate change knowledge in a national German sample (n = 509). The accuracy of the confidence of the citizens in their climate change knowledge was only around half of what it could be based on the accuracy of their knowledge. Moreover, the accuracy of confidence controlling for knowledge accuracy was lower for climate change than for two benchmark comparisons: general science knowledge in another national German sample (n = 588), and climate change knowledge in a scientist sample (n = 207). Although these results cannot necessarily be generalized to the population of all indicators of climate change knowledge, the results suggest that the confidence of citizens in their climate change knowledge is unnecessarily fuzzy given their actual knowledge. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Progress in advanced vehicular technologies and computer science leads to driverless vehicles becoming a reality. The standard ambulances might be replaced by driverless ambulances operated by an autopilot that provides passengers with a secure regime. Therefore, the study's aim was to collate two different countries regarding the consumers' preparedness to travel on such autonomous ambulances. To obtain a more demonstrative result, a questionnaire survey was conducted in two countries (Hungary and Kazakhstan). It also gathered 'affect' measures in order to figure out if 'affect' served as a medium between the ambulance mode and readiness to ride, and to understand whether emotions play any role during the decision making. The necessary data were collected through the so-called Autonomous Ambulance Acceptance Questionnaire. After conducting 't-Test', 'ANOVA', and Mediation analysis, the findings have been discussed. The results help to realize the necessity of developing educational guides to prepare potential patients for Autonomous Vehicles technology. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper examines and deconstructs the Rio Scale, focusing primarily on the recently published Rio Scale 2.0 concept, from the perspective of a social scientist. I argue that although there is value in developing tools to help astronomers and other scientists communicate their perceptions about the significance of a contact event to the media and the general public, the Rio Scale 2.0 remains problematic conceptually and, thus, does not represent a robust method for assessing or communicating the import of a valid contact. Therefore, it should not be used as a method for informing the media or the general public about scenarios that involve the detection of valid signals suggesting the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

AB  - In Recent Years, Social Emotion In Recent Years Acquires Natural Language Processing Researchers’ Attention, Because Of Analyzing User-Generated Emotional Documents On The Web. But, These Emotions Has Noisy Instance Mixed And It Is Great Dispute To Acquire The Textual Meaning Of Short Messages. Definition: In General, Large-Scale Datasets Will Have Many Noisy Data, Which Can’t Be Used Readily And Also It Is Costly, Because Of Ambiguity Of Various Informal Expressions In User-Generated Comments. It Is Very Tedious One To Recognize The Similar User Documents From The Entire Social Media Text Message. Furthermore, Online Comments Are Characteristically Categorized By A Sparse Feature Space, Which Makes The Respective Emotion Classification Task A Complex One. Methodology: Three Major Contributions Were Done In This Work In Order To Rectify These Problems, They Are: Development Of A Novel Mutation Bat Optimization Based Sparse Encoding (MBO-SC) Which Transforming The Sparse Low-Level Features Into Dense High-Level Features, Was The 1st Contribution, Next Is, An Enhanced Weight Based Convolutional Neural Network (EWCNN) To Target-Specific Layer. It Influences The Semantically EWCNN Classifier To Include Semantic Domain Knowledge Into The Neural Network To Bootstrap Its Inference Power And Interpretability. Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Is Proposed To Minimize The Similarity Among Two Documents. Uses: It Is Quite Constructive In Recommending Products, Collecting Public Opinions, And Predicting Election Results. Proposed Work Is Distinguished With The Existing Methods, With The Metrics Such As: Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificity, F-Measure And Accuracy. From The Experimental Result It Is Confirmed That The Quality Of Learned Semantic Vectors And The Performance Of Social Emotion Classification Can Be Enhanced By Proposed Models. © BEIESP.

AB  - Strong anti-Islamic sentiments increased dramatically after the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States, leading to an uptick in prejudice and the perpetration of hate crimes targeting Muslims. Sikh men and boys, often mistaken for Muslims, suffered as collateral damage. The overall health of both communities has been adversely affected by these experiences. Faced with such realities, communities and parents often adopt adaptive behaviors to foster healthy development in their children. In this paper, drawing on interviews with 23 Sikh parents from 12 families, we examine Sikh parents’ ethno-religious socialization of their children. The confluence of media stereotyping and mistaken identities has shaped Sikh parents’ beliefs regarding their children’s retention/relinquishment of outward identity markers. Sikh parents, in general, are concerned about the safety of their boys, due to the distinctive appearance of their religious markers, such as the turban. They are engaged in a constant struggle to ensure that their children are not identified as Muslims and to protect them from potential harm. In most of the families in our study, boys were raised to give up wearing the indicators of their ethno-religious group. In addition, many parents took responsibility for educating the wider community about their ethno-religious practices through direct communication, participation in cultural events, and support of other ethno-religious minorities. Policy implications are discussed. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Narratives of the mid-18th-century state as drifting towards oligarchy and closure have long been superseded by accounts stressing its responsiveness to outside interests and opinion. Participatory election rituals, crowd activity and the expansion of print media demonstrate that political activism was not limited to a narrow circle of elites, even after the passage of the 1716 Septennial Act. Additionally, as an institution after 1688 the Westminster parliament rendered itself useful to propertied society through its passage of greater amounts of legislation. However, while the strength of party and trajectory of electoral participation is well mapped, as are addresses to the crown, the petitioning of interest groups has had few systematic quantitative surveys. This article first sets out the chronology of petitioning to both houses of parliament from 1660 to 1788, demonstrating that petitioning was at its height before 1722, rather than rising to its greatest levels with the reform movements in the 1780s. Second, the article demonstrates the role of petitioning in expanding the political nation beyond the boundaries of parliamentary boroughs, and why, on occasion, petitioning involved women and illiterate men. Third, in order to emphasize the continuity in petitioning and its contribution to the formation of public opinion, the article compares the different roles that concurrent subscription practices envisaged for the public. Finally, the article argues that despite the rising tendency to cite numerical strength to arbitrate political divisions, petitioners continued to legitimise their voices on the basis of representing collections of reasons and interests rather than opinion. © 2019 The Author.

AB  - Social media is an important tool for disaster prevention and management. To reveal the public responses to disasters on social media in the context of East Asian culture, an urban flood disaster event that occurred inWuhan City, China, in the summer of 2016 was selected as a case. Data were collected from Sina-Weibo, which is the earliest and most popular social media platform in China. We categorized a total of 17,047 messages into four types, analyzed the Pearson correlation between information dissemination and precipitation, and identified the important accounts and their messages in the social networks by visualized analysis. The results show that there is a one-day lag between participation and public response. Message dissemination has a steeply downward trend over time, that is, a long tail effect. Information disseminates quickly within two hours, and then dissemination declines after four hours, with opinion messages disseminating faster than other types of messages. Famous news organizations and several celebrities play a leading role in social networks. In general, the participation of Chinese netizens in disaster events is lower than that of people inWestern countries, and social media is not yet used as a tool for disaster response. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. We adapted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Popular Opinion Leader model to implement an intervention tailored for African American individuals that leverages an academic-community partnership and community-based social networks to disseminate culturally appropriate lupus education. Methods: Academic rheumatologists, social scientists, and researchers in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL partnered with local lupus support groups, community organizations, and churches in neighborhoods with higher proportions of African Americans to develop curriculum and recruit community leaders with and without lupus (Popular Opinion Leaders; POLs). POLs attended four training sessions focused on lupus education, strategies to educate others, and a review of research methods. POLs disseminated information through their social networks and recorded their impact, which was mapped using a geographic information system framework. Results: We trained 18 POLs in greater Boston and 19 in greater Chicago: 97% were African American, 97% were female; and the mean age was 57 years. Fifty-nine percent of Boston POLs and 68% of Chicago POLs had lupus. POLs at both sites engaged members of their social networks and communities in conversations about lupus, health disparities, and the importance of care. Boston POLs documented 97 encounters with 547 community members reached. Chicago POLs documented 124 encounters with 4083 community members reached. Conclusions: An adapted, community-based POL model can be used to disseminate lupus education and increase awareness in African American communities. Further research is needed to determine the degree to which this may begin to reduce disparities in access to care and outcomes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate doctors’ intentions to raise a patient safety concern by applying the socio-psychological model ‘Theory of Planned Behaviour’. Design: Qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Setting: Training venues across England (North West, South East and South West). Participants: Sampling was purposeful to include doctors from differing backgrounds and grades. Main outcome measures: Perceptions of raising a patient safety concern. Results: While raising a concern was considered an appropriate professional behaviour, there were multiple barriers to raising a concern, which could be explained by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Negative attitudes operated due to a fear of the consequences, such as becoming professionally isolated. Disapproval for raising a concern was encountered at an interpersonal and organisational level. Organisational constraints of workload and culture significantly undermined the raising of a concern. Responses about concerns were often side-lined or not taken seriously, leading to demotivation to report. This was reinforced by high-profile cases in the media and the negative treatment of whistle-blowers. While regulator guidance acted as an enabler to justify raising a concern, doctors felt disempowered to raise a concern about people in positions of greater power, and ceased to report concerns due to a perceived lack of action about concerns raised previously. Conclusions: Intentions to raise a concern were complex and highly contextual. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is a useful model to aid understanding of the factors which influence the decision to raise a concern. Results point to implications for policymakers, including the need to publicise positive stories of whistle-blowers and providing greater support to doctors. © 2019, The Royal Society of Medicine.

AB  - Objectives:The aim of this study was to evaluate women's opinions about menopause and the sources of information they use to deepen their understanding of the topic.Methods:Population-based study with 749 Brazilian women aged 45 to 60 years. The answers to the question "What is menopause?" were typed and coded, and categories that emerged from the interviewees' own speech were created. The answers to the question: "Where or from whom did you get information about menopause?" were also analyzed.Results:The mean age of women was 52.5 (± 4.4) years. Of them, 68% were postmenopausal. According to 67.5% of the interviewees, the concept of menopause encompassed changes in the menstrual cycle and hormones. For 48%, menopause meant physical changes such as "hot flushes and vaginal dryness." For 22.7%, menopause represented psychological changes. The concept of menopause was associated with some change in sexuality for 7.6% of the interviewees. Approximately 18% could not explain what menopause meant. Regarding the sources of information, 44.5% of the women attributed this knowledge to friends and relatives. Doctors or health services were mentioned by 44.3% of women. Television or radio was cited by 22.0%; magazines, newspapers, or books were cited by 14.0%; and the Internet was cited by 6.8% of women. Fifty-two women (6.9%) reported having no source of information about menopause.Conclusions:Most of the interviewees relate the term "menopause" to physiological events. There seems to be a suppressed demand for information on the various aspects of the menopausal transition among middle-aged Brazilian women. © 2019 by The North American Menopause Society.

AB  - Social media use has become an integral part of children’s and adolescents’ lives. It has become a novel way of interaction among people and influences people’s social lives and public opinion as well as people’s purchasing decisions and businesses. Any website or platform that allows social interaction is considered to be a social media site. Social media use among children in 25 European countries has been reported to be 38% among 9–12 year olds and 77% among those aged 13–16 years. All these children report having their own profile on at least one social network site. While social networking provides children and adolescents with many opportunities and benefits, it also carries many risks. Among the benefits are socialization and communication enhancement, improving learning skills, positive impact on education and getting health information. Potential risks of social media use include falsifying age and identity, cyberbullying, sexting, Facebook depression, gamification, glamourization, cyberostracism and sleep disturbances. Conclusion: Paediatricians play a vital role in promoting the physical, mental and social welfare of all children. There is a critical need for paediatricians to play an active role, guiding children and families appropriately through the impact of social networking, in order to become a real driver of children’s development. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Using in-depth interview data from 30 young Black men of West Indian background, we examine their experiences with and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. Their experiences lead these men to contend that the system, especially police authorities, do not differentiate between Blacks based on ethnicity and subsequently treat West Indians and African Americans in a similar manner, that is, race trumps ethnicity. These men discuss their concerns about stereotypes of minorities, especially as they are reflected in the media, as the primary reasons for their treatment. However, these men also provide nuanced accounts in which not all system actors engage in discriminatory behavior. These accounts rest on an immigrant lens regarding criminal justice, which may indicate a more favorable outlook compared to their native-born Black counterparts. Overall, though, the interview data suggest that a Black–White divide regarding such perceptions will persist in an era of substantial sociodemographic change. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - From time to time the popular media draws attention to hate crimes and hate groups, evoking images of Nazi-Germany and the rise of fascism. The geographic association between hate groups and hate crimes is uncertain. In this research we ask whether hate crimes are co-located and correlated to the presence of hate groups to explore a potential association between these two phenomena. Publicly available point level data on hate crimes and hate groups collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) were aggregated to unitary framework of hexagonal grid cells of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) at multiple scales for consistent analysis. We explore the effects of proximity by interpreting a co-location map, deploying a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for count data, and apply a Spatial Lag Model (SLM) at multiple scales, to ascertain the effects of the size of the aggregation units on the relationship between hate groups and hate crimes. Controlled or uncontrolled for spatial dependence, at all scales, the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) shows that an average of 39.5% of the hate crimes was correlated with hate groups. These results are consistent with the existing research but show that in most instances spatial dependence was present, regardless of the size of the aggregation unit or the distance to neighboring cells. Our future research will consider additional racial, economic and social variables using a DGGS. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The factors that affect formation and dissemination of public opinion have been studied for a long time. However, the findings are disparate and fragmented, given the characteristics of netizens and new media in the Big Data era. To this end, this article introduces eight mechanisms working on formation and dissemination of public opinion on network. Based on system dynamics, this article further proposes a comprehensive causal relationship model to explore the factors affecting the consequence of public opinion on network. Particularly, the role of government is taken into consideration in this model. A simulation with Vensim PLE is conducted. The results of the simulation indicate that group polarization among netizens, opinion leaders, the quantity of media audience, the frequency of media report, government attention, and warning mechanism for public opinion crisis affect the consequence of public opinion on network significantly. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2019, IGI Global.

AB  - Introduction: Surveys suggest a dichotomy in how citizens view research for public benefit and research for commercial gain. Therefore, a research initiative, such as a learning health system, which works for both public and commercial benefit, may be controversial and lower public trust. Methods: This study aimed to investigate what informed citizens considered to be appropriate uses of health data in a learning health system and why they made those decisions. Two-paired 4-day juries were run, with different jurors but the same purpose, expert witnesses, and facilitators. Overall, 694 people applied; 36 jurors were selected to match criteria based on demographics and privacy views. Jurors considered whether and why eight exemplars of anonymised patient data were acceptable. The exemplars were either planned initiatives to improve care pathways (Planned Examples) or possible commercial data uses (Potential Examples). Results: These citizens' juries found that all Planned and two of the Potential Examples were considered appropriate by most, but not all, jurors because they could deliver public benefit. In general, positive health outcomes for patients were more acceptable than improved efficiency of services for the NHS, although they recognised that the latter also improved health. Jurors had concerns about whether improving efficiency would lead to inequitable distribution or closure of services, based on their existing understanding from media reports. Commercial gain that accrued secondary to this benefit was acceptable, with some jurors becoming more accepting of commercial uses as they understood them better. Prioritising profit, however, was unacceptable, regardless of any governance arrangements. Conclusions: Jurors tended to be more accepting of data sharing to both private and public sectors after the jury process. Many jurors accept commercial gain if public benefit is achieved. Some were suspicious of data sharing for efficiency gains. Juries elicited more informed and nuanced judgement from citizens than surveys. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Although young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, they may be more heterogeneous as a group than is typically appreciated. Thus, the present study used a person-centered data-analytic approach to determine profiles of HIV-related risk among YBMSM and whether these profiles could be distinguished by age, HIV status, and socioeconomic risk (i.e., socioeconomic distress). YBMSM (N = 1808) aged 18 to 29 years completed a survey of sociodemographic characteristics, HIV status, and HIV-related behavioral and attitudinal factors (i.e., safer-sex self-efficacy, negative condom attitudes, being in difficult sexual situations, being in difficult sexual relationships, HIV treatment optimism, perceived HIV stigma). Latent profile analysis was used to identify HIV risk profiles and whether age, HIV status, and socioeconomic distress were associated with these profiles. Four profiles emerged: low-, medium-, and high-risk profiles, respectively, and a mixed profile characterized by a tendency to be in difficult sexual situations and relationships while also reporting high safer-sex self-efficacy and low negative attitudes toward condom use. Difficult sexual situations emerged as the key defining indicator of whether a profile reflected higher or lower risk. Younger age, being HIV-positive, and socioeconomic distress were associated with having a higher-risk profile. Given that unique risk profiles emerged that were differentially predicted by sociodemographic characteristics and HIV status, these findings have implications for tailoring interventions to the needs of different subgroups of YBMSM. Also, disempowering or risky sexual situations and relationships among YBMSM must be addressed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the recent trends, the world has stepped into a multimedia era for enhancing business, recommendation systems, and information retrieval, etc. Multimedia data is highly rich in contents which express different human emotions. Several issues for emotion detection from multimedia images & videos have been addressed in this domain, but a very less effort has been applied for text data. The evaluation of deep learning has outperformed traditional techniques in sentiment analysis tasks. Inspired by the work done in the field of sentiment analysis, a deep learning based framework has been implemented on multimedia text data for the task of fine-grained emotion detection. The presented work introduces a new corpus which expresses different forms of emotions collected from a TV show’s transcript. A manual annotation of the corpus has been conducted with the help of English expert annotators. As an emotion detection framework, this paper proposes a sequence-based convolutional neural network(CNN) with word embedding to detect the emotions. An attention mechanism is applied in the proposed model which allows CNN to focus on the words that have more effect on the classification or the part of the features that should be attended more. The main aim of the work is to develop a framework such a way to generalize to newly collected data and help business to understand the customer’s mind and social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics. Experiments conducted on the dataset shows that the proposed framework correctly detects the emotions from the text with good precision and accuracy score. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to characterize the Portuguese general population's knowledge and attitudes about postpartum depression, and analyze its sociodemographic and clinical correlates. Design: A cross-sectional internet survey. Setting: Participants were recruited through advertisements on social media websites, in thematic forums and by email. Participants: A total of 621 people in the general population (88.1% women) participated in the study. Measurements: Participants were questioned about sociodemographic and clinical data, personal contact with postpartum depression, awareness of public education campaigns about postpartum depression and knowledge and attitudes towards postpartum depression (outcome variables). Findings: The sample presented a good level of knowledge and positive attitudes about postpartum depression despite the existence of some gaps in knowledge and some stereotypes. Personal contact with postpartum depression was associated with higher levels of knowledge (p < .001) and more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression (p < .001) and participants who assisted to public education campaigns reported higher levels of knowledge about postpartum depression (p < .001). Lower levels of knowledge and more negative attitudes about postpartum depression were found in men and older and less educated people. Key conclusions and implications for practice: These results show the importance of awareness-raising and education campaigns directed at the general population, particularly focusing on people who can act as the postpartum women's support network (e.g., partners, parents, in-laws), to increase the level of knowledge and to foster more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression. © 2019

AB  - Foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria are being reported at an increasing rate in the United States. We performed a text-mining analysis to look at nearly 13,000 tweets from two foodborne Escherichia coli outbreaks in 2018. Concerns from the public included staying informed about contaminated lettuce, recognizing signs of infection, and holding responsible farms accountable. At the end of the second outbreak, comments were focused on assessing symptoms, using the traceback process to locate outbreak sources, and calling for better food labeling practices. © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

AB  - ‘If it bleeds, it leads’, events characterised by fatalities, are likely to attract high levels of media coverage. This study adopts a multidisciplinary approach to investigate public discourses on the MH17 tragedy in Malaysia and the United Kingdom. First, corpus-based discourse analysis was employed to explore the construction of the Malaysian Airlines tragedy MH17 in four selected Malaysian and British newspapers. In addition, an attitudinal study examining 50 Malaysian and 50 UK nationals’ perceptions of the tragedy was conducted. Keywords analysis revealed an overall tendency for the news media to construct the air tragedy through classifications between ‘us’ and ‘others’. Specifically, important ‘Us’ (Malaysian elites) and non-important ‘Other’ (non-Malaysian) in the Malaysian newspapers, versus good ‘Us’ (the West) and evil ‘Others’ (Russia) in the British newspapers. The attitudinal analysis shows, for both the Malaysian and the UK respondents, the most salient associations with the MH17 tragedy related to ‘conflicts’. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - We report on a study of the longitudinal effects of the 2014 World Cup on the host Brazil's overall image and for tourism intentions in three other countries (total sample = 207). Brazil's image declined significantly 2013–2014 on some but not all measures and improved amongst a significant minority. The mixed outcomes are explained by the moderating effects of respondent personality, their involvement in the event (rather than in the sport being hosted) and their perception of the news they had been exposed to. Those who held a relatively negative attitude towards Brazil before the event tended to be positively influenced by positive media, watching the closing ceremony and by searching for news about Brazil. Those relatively high in Openness to Experience were less likely to report a reduction in attitude. The net effect was an improvement in tourism intentions, mainly among those less likely to visit pre-event and a decline among most others. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective Psychiatric disorders are often considered the leading cause of violence. This may be due to a stereotype created by media and general opinion.Method The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) was used to evaluate the severity of aggressive and violent behaviors in 400 patients who attended a post-acute psychiatric service in Milan from 2014 to 2016 and suffered from different psychiatric disorders. The psychopathological clinical picture was evaluated by Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The study also assessed the possible correlation between epidemiologic and sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, and aggression and violence.Results Of the total number of subjects, 21.50% showed a MOAS score >0, 11.50% presented mild aggression (0-10 MOAS weighted score), 9% moderate aggression (11-20), and 1% severe aggression (MOAS >20). With respect to violent behaviors, 16% of patients showed a score >0 in one MOAS subscale other than verbal aggression according to violence definition. The severity of clinical picture seemed to be related to higher weighted MOAS score. Multivariate testing of different sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that violence was related to unemployment status, and significantly correlated to compulsory admission (TSO), suicide attempts (TS), and personality disorders, while the severity of clinical psychiatric picture seemed to play a secondary role.Conclusion Results have shown that personality disorders and sociodemographic factors, including economic factors, seem to be major determinants of violence among patients diagnosed with mental disorders. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - With the explosive growth of social media on the Internet, people are expressing an increasing number of opinions. As for objectives like business decision making and public opinion analysis, how to make the best of these precious opinionated words is a new challenge in the field of NLP. The field of opinion mining, or sentiment analysis, has become active in recent years. Since different kinds of deep neural networks differ in their structures, they are probably extracting different features. We investigated whether features generated by heterogeneous deep neural networks can be combined by multi-view learning to improve the overall performance. With document level opinion mining being the objective, we implemented multi-view learning based on heterogeneous deep neural networks. Experiments show that multi-view learning utilizing these heterogeneous features outperforms single-view deep neural networks. Our framework makes better use of single-view data. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The killing of Cecil the Lion in July 2015 generated considerable media attention worldwide. We measured public interest in Cecil's death to examine the degree to which this high-profile incident represented the type of focusing event that public policy scholars often emphasize as being important for triggering policy change. Finding that public interest in lion conservation spiked in the weeks immediately following the incident, we then analysed whether this focusing event led to policy changes to restrict trophy hunting in eight countries (USA, Spain, France, Russia, Canada, South Africa, Germany and Mexico) that most frequently import lion Panthera leo trophies. The surge in public attention seems to have had only a limited impact on the adoption of significant new policy, although it may have hastened changes in some countries. © 2017 Fauna & Flora International.

AB  - Background: When integrating power-To-gas (PtG) in the biogas sector (BGS), it is essential to consider how risk is perceived and handled since it influences technology uptake, acceptance, and legitimacy. In this study, we aimed to identify factors that determine how risks are managed in the BGS grounded on stakeholders' perceptions of environmental and safety risks, and the socio-political, technological, and economic challenges associated with the adoption of PtG in this industry. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 experts located throughout Germany. They represented relevant institutions associated with the development of the BGS and PtG. Participants included expert stakeholders from science, industry, associations, and politics. The interview data were assessed by the use of thematic qualitative text analysis, followed by inductive reasoning, based on holistic and axial coding of the transcribed interviews. Results: The participants predominantly trusted existing regulations to ascertain that environmental and safety risks from this energy concept are under control. The expert stakeholders were convinced that except for farm-based biogas facilities, there is adequate know-how in the BGS to appropriately manage risks of biogas and PtG technologies and thus prevent potential negative externalities. Furthermore, they were inclined to identify socio-political challenges, such as public criticism of biogas, and missing financial incentives as the most relevant matters to the development and adoption of PtG in this sector. The interviewees mainly identified politicians as responsible actors to handle identified risks and challenges. Such risk rationalities are characterized as hierarchist in the cultural theory of risk perception. Conclusions: Possible reasons behind the prevailing high level of risk tolerance among the participants of this study could be related to (1) strong reliance on governmental action, technical protocols, and the perception that others are responsible for risk management in the BGS; (2) a high confidence in expertise in the biogas industry to control risks; and (3) the tendency of experts to advocate biogas and PtG, linked to possible professional roles and motivational factors. These aspects may influence them to attenuate the urgency to prevent accidents and environmental risks, even if this can have undesirable consequences when incorporating PtG in the biogas industry. While critical environmental and safety risks are not acknowledged and adequately tackled, societal controversies may accentuate to the disadvantage of the BGS and the potential benefits linked to the integration of PtG in this field. We recommend implementing measures that enhance risk awareness within this community, urge interest groups to adopt collaborative risk management strategies and consider the involvement of multiple stakeholders in risk assessment and control, and likewise, address the particularities of the social context in defining strategies for risk management and communication. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the level of public trust in disaster response actors, i.e. the government, civilian disaster response institutions, the military, NGOs and the media. Design/methodology/approach: The data source is the 2015–2016 Slovenian Public Opinion Survey, which used face-to-face interviews (computer-assisted personal interviewing software), and a standardised instrument (questionnaire). A two-stage probability sampling design with stratification at the first stage was applied. The first stage involved a probability proportional to size selection of 150 small areas (statistical areas), where the size measurement was a the number of adult persons in the Central Population Register. The second stage involved the simple random sampling of 12 persons from each of the 150 primary sampling units. A total of 1,024 adult residents participated in the survey. Findings: The findings suggest that trust in the government under normal situations is low; however, it becomes slightly higher during disaster conditions. Civilian disaster response institutions (especially firemen and civil protection), the military and NGOs (humanitarian and other volunteer organisations) are highly trusted before and during disasters. Trust in the authorities and media to inform the public in a timely and comprehensive manner about the disaster is also relatively high. Research limitations/implications: Perhaps in another period of research, disaster-related experiences of the population might be different, which could certainly change the survey results about trust. Nevertheless, the main finding that low pre-disaster trust can be recovered during a disaster by adequate performance of the institution is not jeopardised. Originality/value: The survey results are original. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change, but high levels of acknowledgment and engagement are needed to lead to changes toward more sustainable behaviours. In this aspect, media plays an important role in shaping individuals' awareness about climate change. This study aims to analyse Iberian media coverage about climate change to further discuss its influence on the public's engagement with the subject. A total of 449 news were collected from Iberian newspapers. Their characteristics were analysed through quantitative content analysis. Data shows important journalistic bias toward a national framing, mainly focusing on drought and its impact on agriculture. The debate is focused on technological and political discourses. The gaps found on the Iberian media coverage may contribute to public's low levels of acknowledgement and engagement, not enhancing the possibility of change in individuals' behaviours for more sustainable actions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article uses visitor research to explore public attitudes to the British Museum and perceptions of its relationship to the history of the British Empire. Firstly, it provides an analysis of direct messages received by the Museum over a twelve month period via letters, emails and comments on social media platforms. Secondly, it draws on short interviews undertaken with visitors upon arrival at the Museum before entry. Thirdly, it draws on formative and summative evaluation for two recent British Museum special exhibitions that explicitly addressed imperial and colonial histories, ‘Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilization’ (23 April–2 August 2015) and South Africa: The Art of a Nation’ (27 October 2016–26 February 2017). Finally, it draws on focus groups (April 2018) held to explore perceptions of the Museum held by culturally active non-visitors. Collectively this insight highlights the Museum’s vast potential to inform contemporary debates about empire by developing new approaches to displaying and interpreting its collection. © 2019, © 2019 Third Text.

AB  - This study investigated how the prevalent visual depiction of obesity in the media promotes stigmatization of obese individuals. Particularly, this study proposed and tested the two sequential mechanisms which were not explicated in the previous models but indispensable in stigma research: (1) the disease avoidance response (i.e. discomfort for physical contact) and (2) dehumanizing perception. Results of two experiments overall supported the extended model: the headless photos of obese individuals triggered the disease avoidance responses, which sequentially increased the dehumanizing perception of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. The identity trait (e.g. gender) match increased readers' level of social identification with obese people and alleviated the disease avoidance response when they saw the photo of the obese model as a whole being. By contrast, the opposite effects (i.e. disidentification and heightened discomfort) were found when the participants saw the headless photo of the obese model of the same gender. © 2019, © 2019 National Communication Association.

AB  - This study examines editorial political cartoons outside the United States that featured U.S. former President George W. Bush. It plans to assess how the U.S. President was depicted in editorial cartoons in Western media and whether he was identified as a stereotypical threat during his US-led war on terrorism and the invasion of the Iraq war in 2003. Editorial cartoons chosen for this analysis is based on a case study of editorial cartoons selected from a paper in New Zealand, a country whose government did not support the Iraq War in principle and a country that enjoys higher press freedom than the United States (Sheffield, 2013). Generally editorial cartoons are political in nature, making them quite significant during times of great controversy. New Zealand, a Western nation with close historic, cultural and linguistic ties with the United States, had its Labor Party-led refuse to be a part of the US-led war on terrorism. The Otago Daily Times (ODT), the newspaper selected as the case study for the current analysis, is the only major newspaper in New Zealand that is locally owned with a significant impact on public opinion (See Kabir&Bourk, 2012). This makes the exploration of its editorial cartoons and their potential influences significant in making generalizations about similar content made available in other free Western media that held parallel views toward the former U.S. President and his led war on terrorism. Despite the appearance of political cartoons in all major newspapers worldwide, researchers are yet to show increased interest in researching this format of media representation. This study therefore is an attempt to cover this deficiency. © 2019. American Communication Association.

AB  - The leaked email accounts of Putin's aide on Ukraine, Vladislav Surkov, are vast primary source collections that shed light on the backstage happenings of the Kremlin's politics in the Donbas war. Surkov is an excellent dramaturg; he writes scripts, casts actors, analyzes their performance and narratives, runs promotions, and puts the repertoire into motion to achieve intended reactions of the target audience. Methods and resources employed against Ukraine have much in common with political technology that helps the Kremlin to manipulate public opinion as well as election systems using pseudo-experts, technical parties, fake civic organizations and youth movement such as Nashi, and covert media techniques. Moscow tactically promoted the myth of Novorossiya-later the circumstances forced Surkov to replace it with Donbas. These tactics gave false credibility to separatists who would voice Moscow's objections to any attempts of Ukraine to drift westward, creating an illusion in the domestic and international audience: the separatists are not puppets of Moscow but desperately fight against Kyiv junta for their localized identity, and Russia is just there to offer them a helping hand. The Russian policy toward Ukraine after the 2013 fall is an extension of its virtual domestic politics, but not traditional diplomacy at all. © 2019 Association for the Study of Nationalities.

AB  - The Internet's relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the formation of a media consumption culture in the information-rich multiconfessional and bilingual region of the Russian Federation – the Republic of Tatarstan. The authors of this article conducted a survey of 200 respondents aged 19-55 who are active users of the RuNet. The survey was carried out among students of the Kazan State Institute of Culture and Kazan Federal University, as well as media professionals from the Republic of Tatarstan. The anonymous survey was conducted in January-March 2019. Of all the respondents participated in this survey, 56% were aged 19-20. Eighty-three percent of the respondents were female – students, teachers and media workers of the Republic of Tatarstan. Sixty-five percent of them combined their education with work. Ninety-eight percent of the respondents received information from the Internet, 76% watched information programs on television, 27% listened to the radio and only 7.5% of the respondents still read newspapers. Sixty-eight percent of the surveyed trusted messages received from news agencies, while 78% trusted news messages received from news aggregators. Ninety percent of the respondents trusted information received from online media; 11% trusted the information received from social networks and only 4.5% of the respondents trusted the information discussed in blogs. The high percentage of trust to information obtained from the media and the low percentage of trust to information obtained from blogs indicates the current culture of media use and media literacy of the population in the situation with fake news. Of all the respondents answering the question "Do you refer to the source of information you use on the Internet?", 91.5% answered positively. Disturbingly, 92.5% of the surveyed believe that they do not have to pay for the information received from online media. The authors explain the refusal to pay for content with a small amount of exclusive and analytical materials in the information field of the Republic of Tatarstan. © BEIESP.

AB  - This scientific research deals with the actual problem, that is the study of the language of criminal chronicles in the Western Ukrainian media discourse in the 1920-1930s. Object of analysis is news reports on gender violence in popular Western Ukrainian newspapers of the interwar twenty years. The chosen methodology is feminist discourse-analysis which allows us to identify the media representations of gender identity and to find out what ideological discourse has had symbolic hegemony, which gender regime was supported by language. It turns out that the language of criminal news fixes symbolic mechanisms for establishing power regimes. The texts of criminal news show gender stereotypes and prejudices against women, which traditionally functioned and articulated in public discourse. Gender violence was explained (and justified) by personal, religious and social reasons. The problem of domestic violence attracted journalists from the 1920s and 1930s. Victim women who dared to challenge patriarchal customs were appraised extremely subjectively, biasedly, often – in a negative way. Publications about sexual crimes (rape, sexual harassment) were rare, since this topic was banned in the Western Ukrainian public discourse of the 1920s-1930s. In Western Ukrainian popular magazines, the language of criminal news construed a gendered society, deleting power for men and exposing a woman to objectification. Journalists used certain linguistic strategies to support the dominant gender regime: author's intentionality, peculiar journalistic formulation and focus of information, the specifics of structuring material and hidden meanings of the text. © BEIESP.

AB  - It is commonly believed that the general public is heavily dependent on the media for its political news and views and that, as a consequence, the media exercise a strong influence over public opinion and behaviour. However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They have their own ways of gathering political information about the world around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than harmful for democracy. © The Author 2019.

AB  - In this article we reflect, from a theoretical and critical perspective, on how public opinion is currently shaped by social networks, focusing on the case of Twitter. Going beyond a purely sociological or factual concept of public opinion, we will offer arguments for expanding its meaning while proposing a model of deliberative democracy. In order to do so, we use some well-known constructs from the field of social communication, such as the spiral of silence or digital niches, which provide a referent for interpreting the phenomenon of social networks from a critical hermeneutics. The analysis of Twit-ter as a platform for public opinion also aims to provide the keys to building an educational outlook, understanding that one of the purposes of this area in a democracy is to educate citizens about digitally formed currents of opinion, especially those supporting populist political movements and aggravated by the spread of fake news. After delving into the socio-political dimension of social networks such as Twitter, we conclude by proposing a normative concept of interactive public opinion, a proposal that will be specified in a set of educational competences at the epistemological and civic ethical level relating to the democratic use of social media. © 2019, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

AB  - Australian media invests considerable attention in asylum seekers and their children, especially those arriving by boat. In this paper, we provide an analysis of Australian newsprint media published during the term of Australia’s Gillard’s government (2010-2013). This period is critical as it coincides with rising numbers of boat arrivals to Australian shores, fear towards Muslims, and growing Islamophobia. At the time, there were government promises to move children from offshore immigration detention into community-based detention, that would involve living among mainstream Australian society. A data set of 46 articles from major Australian newspapers articles was subject to a discourse analysis of representations of children in both the written texts and in silences. Manipulative tactics of ‘risk framing’ and ‘dispersed intentionality’ were identified as discursive acts aimed to confuse compassion and deviancy with respect to asylum seeker children presumed to be from Islamic backgrounds. We argue that this was achieved through binary characterizations in which Muslim parents and people smugglers were constructed as deviant alongside intentional silences, that may have otherwise elicited compassion for asylum seeker children. We propose that this period of media reporting is foundational to understanding the rise of Islamophobic discourses and the implication of Muslim children in Australia. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The successful use of social media to manipulate public opinion via bots and hired individuals to spread (mis)information to unsuspecting users reached alarming levels due to the manipulations during the 2016 US elections and the Brexit deliberations in the UK. Fake interaction such as "liking" and "retweeting" are staged to foster trust in the posts of bots and individuals, which makes it difficult for individuals to detect the posts that are part of greater schemes. We propose an approach based on supervised learning to classify collections of tweets as "organized" when they inhabit premeditated intent and as "organic" otherwise. Features related to users and posting behavior are used to train the classifiers using 851 data sets totaling above 270 million tweets. Further classifiers are trained to assess the effectiveness of the selected features. The random forest algorithm persistently yielded the best results with scores greater than 95% for both accuracy and f-measure. For comparison purposes, unsupervised learning methods were used to cluster the same data sets. The Gaussian Mixture Model clustered [organized vs organic] data set with 99% agreement with the labels. The success of using only behavioral features to detect organized behavior is encouraging. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Objectives and importance of study: News media portrayal of public health issues influences public opinion, policy action and decision making. This study aimed to analyse the use of ‘nanny state’ frames in Australian news media coverage; identify the stakeholders invoking this frame; determine which public health–related policies attract such framing; and investigate whether ‘nanny state’ framing is directly challenged in news coverage. Study type: A qualitative framing analysis. Methods: Articles featuring the term ‘nanny state’ that were published in Australian print newspapers during matched periods between March and September in 2017 and 2018 were sourced through Factiva, coded and analysed for content and ‘nanny state’ framing. Content analysis was used to identify any public health–related issues that the terminology nanny state was applied to, and who was portrayed as imposing the nanny state. Frame analysis was used to analyse what meanings are co-presented with the phrase nanny state. Results: Out of 81 print newspaper articles that included the term ‘nanny state’, 19% linked the term to restricting personal choice or creating dissatisfaction with too many health-related rules and regulations broadly, across a range of issues, including: bike helmets, e-cigarettes, firearm restrictions, seatbelts, pool fences and smoking bans. The next most frequent links were to regulations on alcohol (17%), road safety (14%), obesity-related issues (7%) and tobacco control (6%). Of the 81 articles, 53% appeared in news publications owned by News Corporation Australia, 20% in Fairfax Media (Nine Entertainment) publications, 17% in Daily Mail and General Trust and 10% in publications owned by other organisations. Governments were the entity most frequently framed as imposing the nanny state. Most nanny state framings (73%) were negative towards public health controls and focused on policies and regulations. Nanny state was portrayed as an assault on freedom and choice (14%) and used to attack proponents of nanny state controls (11%), while few articles framed the nanny state (7%) in a favourable light. Conclusions: ‘Nanny state’ is a rhetorical device commonly used in Australian news media that may contribute to discrediting of the regulation of a range of health-related issues. News Corp publications are a major propagator of nanny state rhetoric in Australian newspaper media. Public health advocates are not commonly represented within nanny state debates within the news media. © 2019 Sax Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to find out whether countries with different media systems differed when exercising political influence (1) on political coverage and (2) in the exchanges of journalists and sources. France and Germany are suitable objects of comparison because Hallin and Mancini (2004) and others argued that French journalism showed higher levels of political parallelism. Hence, we should expect to find more influence in the French context. However, Hallin and Mancini did not focus on the rules shaping exchanges at the individual level. Taking this as our starting point, we compared high-ranking political journalists’ (N = 284) perspectives on their interaction with political elites presenting them two statements measuring political influence. Our results suggest that French journalists perceived greater political influence on news content than did German journalists. In contrast, journalists working in France perceived that their political views had less influence on access to information than did their German counterparts. These results are in line with institutional and cultural differences between the countries’ politics-media contexts and suggest that political parallelism at the individual level plays a stronger role in the interactions of political journalists and political sources in Germany. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is ranked as the most frequently diagnosed cancer site among women in Saudi Arabia. Several studies in Saudi Arabia have reported low awareness of BC and significant obstacles to early presentation among Saudi women. A key sociocultural obstacle against breast screening and early detection of BC in several conservative cultures is that men manage women’s choices and activities. The aim of this research is to find out the key background knowledge, attitudes, and related practice among male partners in the city of Abha in relation to women’s BC prevention and means for early detection. Methods: A cross-sectional study targeting husbands aged 20 years or older chosen from the outpatient clinics in the Urban Primary Health Care Centers in Abha City. Through questionnaires, interview data were collected regarding knowledge about BC and wife practices and attitudes towards BC. Results: The study included 832 husbands. The study showed that only 20.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9–24.1) of husbands had heard about mammography and only 22.1% had heard about breast self-examination among women as a screening test for BC. The most commonly mentioned variations that might occur in relation to BC were size changes (45.6%). The leading source of BC knowledge was from television (48.9%), and the least-mentioned source of information was healthcare workers (22.4%). Husbands mentioned that only 9.3% of wives had been examined before by mammography. In a multivariate logistic regression of male factors associated with wives’ practices and attitudes towards BC, only good knowledge among husbands was a significant factor. Conclusions: The study documented the low level of BC knowledge among male partners. There is an urgent need to pay more consideration to disseminating awareness among men, as they are associates, and they must be armed with proper awareness. There is an urgent demand for establishing a national program and educational campaigns towards BC. Stressing the advantages and access to free mammography is necessary. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fake news about climate change refers to fabricated information that mimics the appearance of legitimate reporting but is intended to mislead consumers. In light of concerns about fake news regarding climate change and other topics, researchers and media providers have been searching for ways to limit its spread and influence. This study tested the effect of two simple interventions, both of which primed critical thinking, on individuals’ evaluation of the credibility of real and fake news about climate change on Facebook. Through an online experiment (n = 2,750 participants), participants either read a series of guidelines for evaluating news online, or read and then rated the importance of each guideline; a control group was not exposed to guidelines of any type. We found that participants exposed to both types of guidelines reported a reduced likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news about climate change on Facebook. Importantly, exposure to these guidelines did not diminish individuals’ likelihood to trust, like, or share legitimate climate news. The effect sizes for both types of intervention were small. However, because of the scale and speed at which social media operates, even a small reduction in users’ likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news could be meaningful and impactful. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The role of mass media in society keeps the problem of manipulative influence distinction and the contiguous phenomena, chief among which is objectivity and authenticity of news items, current. The research provides a detailed study of the information broadcasting mechanisms in the media area, defines the problems, impeding an impersonal reproduction and disclosure of information, clarifies the verification methods, and gives their topology. In this research, we examined how the mass media of different countries presented the same event to the public. The publications of four mass media, concerning such an event as the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit), have been determined as an object of the analysis. The chosen mass media refer to the countries, which are not the direct participants of that process: Russia, the USA, and Ukraine. D. Brewer’s criteria were used to define the objectivity of the news items. A relative sentiment of the news, which became the objective analysis basis, has been identified using linguistic rate with Eureka Engine intelligence system. The obtained results predominantly confirmed the hypothesis, that the mass media of different countries would represent the process of the UK withdrawal from the EU according to the country’s policy and interpret the facts in their favor. All the four mass media demonstrate the partiality when broadcasting the current situation in the matter of Brexit. The concepts being the semantic kernel elements of mass media publications have emotional coloring. The sentiment analysis of the publications resulted in the conclusion that only one of the four mass media gave a neutral assessment of the Brexit situation. The other three held to the political stance of their edition or government. The research results indicate that the problem of mass media objectivity remains relevant. The correctional impact on public opinion through mass media is extremely high. Therefore, forming the personal attitude toward the situation or event should occur with using several verifications methods and mass media sources at once. © Media Watch.

AB  - China is now becoming a fundamental market for the prosperity and growth of the world’s tourism economy. It promotes the rapid development of foreign tourism and brings some influences to social life. Chinese tourists are highly concerned with foreign media at home and abroad; the Vietnamese Media is the same. Based on the theoretical framework, this paper analyzes the Chinese tourists report towards the Vietnamese Media “VnExpress” 2018 and discusses the construction of Chinese tourists’ image from the three views of macroscopic, the middle, and microcosmic of the news text framework. From there, it shows the tendency and prejudice of the Vietnamese media. The study found that “VnExpress” has a clear tendency; the image of Chinese tourists is full of negatives. At the same time, it indirectly involves events on political issues; Vietnamese media also maintain strong political sensitivity. Moreover, it emphasizes the integrity of Vietnam’s territorial sovereignty, the particularity of history and culture, and strengthening the sense of identity of Vietnamese readers. © Media Watch.

AB  - This paper builds on scholarship of welfare chauvinism in Europe to present evidence of the relationship between xenophobia and family leave policies in contemporary Russia. I argue that popular anti-immigrant moods pressure government into providing more generous family benefits to Russian families while proposing restrictions to migrants. Findings are based on elite interviews, as well as content analysis of mass media, policy documents, public speeches, and party manifestos. I show that xenophobia is widespread in Russia among the public and policymakers alike, and find that xenophobia is embraced by policymakers to guide decisions regarding the allocation of social benefits. © 2019 The Regents of the University of California

AB  - What is known on the subject?: People with a diagnosis of personality disorder often experience stigma both outside of, and within, mental health services. The media contribute to people's understanding of mental health issues, and negative portrayals appear to lead to increased negative attitudes in readers. Relatively little is known about how the press represent personality disorder, and the types of messages that people with this disorder may be receiving, which may impact on their understanding of themselves and emotional well-being. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: The key findings indicate that in a 10-year period, the representation of personality disorder in the popular tabloid press in the UK was characterized by the frequent use of language of violence. The research approach enabled the study to identify significant patterns in the language used, rather than only using a checklist of words that the press are directed to avoid. This adds to our understanding about the images repeatedly presented that may affect how readers treat people with a diagnosis of personality disorder and affect the self-esteem of those with the diagnosis. What are the implications for practice?: Mental health nurses are well placed to address issues of stigma both in terms of the general public's beliefs and the impact it has on those who use mental health services. A greater understanding of the messages in the press can help nurses to support service users who are vulnerable to believing that their lives will start to reflect the negative messages they have read. Abstract: IntroductionMany people with a diagnosis of personality disorder experience stigma, and the press’ representations may contribute to those processes. To date, little is known about how the press write about people with personality disorder and analysis of language used is often limited to checklists of words to avoid. AimThe aim of the study was to explore the linguistic characteristics of press articles about personality disorder in popular tabloids in the UK and consider the implications for stigmatization. MethodCorpus linguistics was used to examine a 50% sample of all articles published by the popular press in the UK, from 2008 to 2017, that referred to personality disorder (n = 260). ResultsThe findings identified a range of words that constructed narratives of violence. DiscussionThe method enabled the findings to expand the current level of knowledge in the field, identifying patterns in the use of the language of violence, which may contribute to the processes of self-stigma. Implications for practiceGreater understanding of the messages in the press can sensitize nurses to common misconceptions about the disorder, how these may have become internalised and the need for psycho-social interventions to address the impact of self-stigma on self-esteem. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Public opinions play a pivotal role in public participation and decision-making in mega construction projects. The rise of technology and social media has facilitated the online public debate on social impacts derived from mega construction projects. This study presents a novel approach to analyze the evolution of public opinions through social media. This analysis framework covers: the temporal patterns of online messages, evolution of frames, and evolution of users. Such novel approach is employed to analyze the evolution of online public opinions on a mega construction project. Content analysis and a number of curve fitting methods were innovatively combined. Results show that social event had dual diffusion cycles while the formation mechanism of each cycle was completely different. The key parameters of Bimodal Gaussian model can depict the characteristics of online diffusion of public opinions. Elites and media organizations form the crucial nodes in the online diffusion process. The sequence of each frame and their share in the total number of frames are determined by preference of elites and media organizations. These findings are useful to develop effective strategy for public engagement, and to prevent and intervene the social conflicts. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Why did a Conservative UK government decide to cut back road building during a time of austerity in the 1990s, whereas a Conservative-led Coalition government decided to substantially increase road building during a time of austerity after 2010? This study aims to answer that question drawing on 32 interviews with ministers, advisors and others, and secondary analysis of media coverage and public opinion. It uses Critical Realist methods in a more specific way than previous studies, representing the key actors, causal mechanisms and changes in underlying social structures in diagrammatic form. It concludes that three mechanisms: a rational response to changing transport circumstances, changing economic ideology prompted by the recession of 2007–9 and public opinion, influenced by the protest movement in the 1990s, explain the contrasting decisions. It identifies key actors who influenced government decisions and explains how a Critical Realist analysis questions the traditional concept in transport studies of causal factors and their relative importance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The operating environment of water infrastructure is inherently dynamic due to factors such as water-related events, media coverage of such events, or changes in institutional expectations. This dynamic environment impacts public perceptions of infrastructure services and providers. In an effort to understand public views regarding water infrastructure, decision makers may periodically assess perceptions to aid in pursuing successful community-supported management strategies. However, single cross-sectional samples from previous studies do not consider the changes in perceptions over time. This study assessed dynamic perceptions of local water providers using two surveys deployed in 21 US shrinking cities, before (2013) and after (2016) media attention on nationwide water infrastructure challenges arising from events such as the Flint water crisis. Questions of interest pertained to whether respondents trust their water providers and want to partake in participatory processes of local utilities. Results indicated a statistically significant change in perceptions, highlighting the importance of temporal sampling. Statistical modeling revealed that geographic parameters typically have homogeneous impacts, indicating localized factors influencing utility-customer relationships in shaping perceptions, whereas demographic parameters have heterogeneous impacts. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A substantial body of research indicates that television news consumption is associated with criminal stereotyping. However, less is known about how online media, such as Internet news and social media news consumption, is associated with such attitudes. Using a multisite sample of mostly young adults, the current study examines the relationships between multiple types of online news consumption and crime news engagement on racially typifying African Americans as violent, property, and drug offenders. Findings reveal that Internet news consumption is negatively related, but social media news consumption is positively related, to racially typifying African Americans as criminals. Beyond consumption, social media crime news engagement is negatively related to racial typification. Last, there is some evidence that the association between online media consumption and engagement varies by race and political ideology. Findings and direction for future research is discussed. © 2019 Eastern Sociological Society

AB  - Forests play an increasing role in bioeconomy policies, providing the material for bio-based products. However, public opinion regarding forest management in Europe is contested, which is considered a potential drawback for the social license to operate for the forest-based sector. News media articles on forest management are considered an important source of information for public opinion building processes because media provides and creates images. Therefore, this study investigates online news media coverage to analyze existing media representation of forest management using a qualitative content analysis. German-language articles were collected over a period of one year (01/13/2016–01/12/2017) with Google Alert, using the search term “Forstwirtschaft” (Engl. forest management). The sample consists of 613 articles from online nation-wide and regional newspapers, as well as other online news media platforms. The results reveal that the online news media coverage on forest management concentrates on regional media, and the media representations are condensed to ten core topics: state of forests, forest conservation, forest management, technology, work force, forest products, economic performance, promotion and events, political issues, and recreation. There are differences in terms of article frequency and content across different media. A substantial part of the articles reports on ecological and economic aspects of forests, which illustrates the challenge presented by the forest as a central raw material supplier that needs to be managed sustainably. In conclusion, this represents a potential risk for the societal acceptance of a forest-based bioeconomy. Thus, in order to support public opinion building processes regarding forests' potential for bioeconomy, a shift in the publicly communicated topics regarding forest management is required. © 2019

AB  - In recent years, western media coverage is frequently filled with issues relating to Islam, which are unfavorable to Muslims. The attitudinal consequences of such media messages are widely discussed; however, empirical research is scarce. This study uses large-scale panel data on adolescents in combination with newspaper data and takes advantage of an extensive fieldwork period during which media salience of Muslims has fluctuated. All unmeasured time-invariant characteristics are accounted for by adopting a fixed-effects panel design. The results provide evidence of immediate attitudinal responses to media salience: the more media salience of Muslims on the day of survey participation, the more negative adolescents feel about Muslims. However, the results do not point toward a secondary transfer effect because media-induced negative attitudes toward Muslims were not transferred to ethnic minorities. Findings of this study advance current research by providing evidence for the effect of daily variations in media salience on attitudes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Their discontent is mostly related to their midwives’ disrespectful or negative attitudes. Objective: To explore women's experiences and perceptions of disrespect and abuse from their maternity care providers in a low resource rural setting in Zimbabwe. Design: A critical, qualitative research methodology, using in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions, was employed to capture rural women's experiences during antenatal care, postpartum care, and the use of maternity waiting homes’ services. Setting: Three rural health centres in Mutare district, Manicaland Province in eastern Zimbabwe. Participants: A total of 20 purposively sampled women, 16–30 years of age, who were accessing various stages of maternal health services, were recruited from three conveniently selected rural health centres. Eight women participated in the in-depth interviews. A further eight women were discussants in the first focus group, and a further four women participated in the second focus group. Findings: Multifaceted and interconnected factors contribute to midwives’ attitudes and behaviours towards their clients. Midwives’ subjective perceptions, women's social status, and health system constraints (i.e., availability of trained midwives and quality of midwifery training) in rural and poorly resourced community, often result in inappropriate services, negative attitudes, abusive treatment, and disrespectful behaviour towards women. Poor treatment in maternity care directly contribute to adverse health outcomes and women's satisfaction with services. Conclusion and implications for practice: Women's social status, level of education and age, were perceived to influence the quality of care or treatment they received. Improving women's experience of maternal care requires targeted interventions at the interpersonal level between a woman and her health care providers, as well as at the level of the health care facility and the health system. The results of this study challenge all tiers of health personnel including policy makers, in low resource settings to reappraise the present situation thereby challenging these established behaviours, to ensure that the continuum of maternity care is respectfully and socio-culturally delivered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alcohol consumption increases the risk of several cancers, but public awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer is low. Research indicates that public opinion about alcohol related policies can be influenced by mass media campaigns and awareness of alcohol as a carcinogen. The objective of this study was to test whether a mass media campaign intended to raise awareness of the relation between alcohol and cancer is associated with higher public awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer, and higher levels of support for alcohol related policies. Cross-sectional surveys of a nationally representative sample of N = 6000 Danish adults were conducted pre- (n = 3000) and post campaign (n = 3000) in 2017–2018. Awareness of alcohol as a cancer risk factor significantly increased between the pre and post campaign survey (approximately 5 percentage points). The proportion of respondents who supported minimum unit pricing, a ban on alcohol advertising, and mandatory nutrition labelling was significantly higher post campaign than pre campaign, while support for limited number of retail outlets and limited sale hours were unchanged. For males, but not females, higher support for an 18 year age limit for purchasing alcohol, age limits for buying alcohol at secondary education school parties, and increased enforcement of age limits was found after the campaign than prior to it. Conclusively, the results show that a mass media campaign was associated with an increase in awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer as well as alcohol policy support at a population level. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - In every society, the main purpose of the criminal justice system is to maintain social order and ensure that citizens comply with the law. To do this effectively, the police and court systems need citizen cooperation and obedience, and willingness to assist with criminal investigations and report crimes to the police. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between confidence in the media and confidence in the criminal justice institutions in South Africa. The study tests two objectives: to assess South Africans’ level of confidence in the police and courts, and to determine whether citizens’ levels of confidence in both the print and televised media will influence their levels of confidence in the police, courts, and in the criminal justice system in general. Utilizing data from the World Values Survey, results reveal a significant and positive relationship between confidence in the media and confidence in the criminal justice institutions. Policy implications of this observation are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Aquaculture in Norway is expected to grow radically in the years to come. From both the government and from the industry itself, there is a demand for developing policies that can accommodate this intensification in activity. However, the aquaculture industry in Norway is also met with considerable skepticism and resistance. Both NGOs and several researchers have voiced concerns in the media, expressing a need for more insight into this resistance. This article explores the attitudes of local residents and stakeholder groups towards aquaculture through a qualitative field study in a small coastal community. Data shows that attitudes are not necessarily a matter of being for or against aquaculture. The issue at stake is sustainability, as what residents and stakeholder groups want is sustainable aquaculture. However, how the different groups interpreted sustainability differed, both between groups and depending on the circumstances. Our analysis shows that interpretations are embedded in different world-views or orders of worth. In this article, we give empirical insight into the expressed attitudes of various stakeholder groups, discuss the underlying values and indicate possible implications these findings can have for policy-making in the Norwegian coastal zone. © 2019

AB  - Propaganda is a mechanism to influence public opinion, which is inherently present in extremely biased and fake news. Here, we propose a model to automatically assess the level of propagandistic content in an article based on different representations, from writing style and readability level to the presence of certain keywords. We experiment thoroughly with different variations of such a model on a new publicly available corpus, and we show that character n-grams and other style features outperform existing alternatives to identify propaganda based on word n-grams. Unlike previous work, we make sure that the test data comes from news sources that were unseen on training, thus penalizing learning algorithms that model the news sources used at training time as opposed to solving the actual task. We integrate our supervised model in a public website, which organizes recent articles covering the same event on the basis of their propagandistic contents. This allows users to quickly explore different perspectives of the same story, and it also enables investigative journalists to dig further into how different media use stories and propaganda to pursue their agenda. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rapid decline of traditional media in China, the party-state faces the growing challenge of shaping public opinion online. This article engages with one response to this challenge-A state-sanctioned digital media experiment aimed at creating a new form of journalism that appeals to the public and helps to disseminate Party propaganda. We analyse the emergence of a national success story, Shanghai-based model media outlet Pengpai, and its diffusion across different regions. We argue that the synergy between local officials and media entrepreneurs has propelled Pengpai's national fame. We further demonstrate that while there has been a cross-national attempt to diffuse this model, it has produced mixed results owing to a number of factors, including the superficial commitment of local officials and media professionals. These findings demonstrate that state-sanctioned decentralized experimentation can deliver unpredictable results in the sphere of media policy, and they further question the capacity of the party-state to effectively reinvent public persuasion in the digital age. © 2019 SOAS University of London.

AB  - Attitudes towards immigration are among the core predictors of attitudes toward the European Union. However, even though most citizens learn about immigration through the media, we lack a comprehensive account of how media coverage of immigration influences support for the European Union. In this study, we use a combination of European Social Survey and Media Claims data to investigate the effects of the visibility and valence of immigration and refugee media coverage on political trust in the European Union in 18 countries between 2012 and 2016. Our results show that media coverage of immigration and refugees influences trust in the European Union; however, the effects depend on citizens’ ideological leaning and content characteristics. Furthermore, we find that the impact of immigration attitudes on trust in the European Union becomes more important over the course of the refugee crisis. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Participation in first-in-human (FIH) clinical trials is a valuable contribution to science. This study aims to investigate the Saudi public's attitude toward FIH clinical trials, identify their willingness to take part in it, and their preferences for participating in these kinds of trials, given the fact that the Saudi FDA has never approved such studies in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted in February 2018. It was based on a self-reported survey distributed by convenience among Saudi adults visiting a national festival in Riyadh and through social media. Data were analysed using descriptive and bivariate statistics, as well as linear and binary logistic regression. Results: Study participants who were invited and completed the survey were 657. The percentage mean score of participants’ attitudes and concern was 70.1 ± 16.4 and 58.3 ± 15.3 respectively. Almost 71.5% expressed their intention to enroll in such trials. Higher attitudinal scores were reported by those who perceived healthcare services as good/excellent (adj.P < 0.001), and by those who had less concerns (adj.P = 0.005). Less educated participants were 1.75 [1.04–2.93] times more likely to enroll in future clinical trials, adj.P = 0.035. For every one unit increase in the attitudinal score, study participants were 1.03 [1.02–1.04] more likely to enroll in future trials, adj.P < 0.001. In contrary, for every one unit increase in concern scores, the odds of enrollment decreased among study participants by 0.98 [0.97–0.99], adj.P = 0.017. The factors causing people to decline participation were mainly fear of the unknown, social reasons, religious reasons, moral reasons, and the concern over human beings being treated as animals. The preferred duration for participation was 1–3 days (n = 268, 57%). Participants revealed their preferences of clinical trial studies were in favor: (a) vaccines (n = 209, 44.5%); (b) treatment drugs (n = 232, 49.4%); and (c) medical devices (n = 310, 66.0%). Conclusion: The Saudi public community showed a high level of enthusiasm for participation in future FIH clinical trials, yet they had some reservations. Increasing public awareness about the benefits of clinical trials and conduction process helps to alleviate the concerns of the Saudi people and to increase their likelihood of enrollment. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Turnout in second-order elections, like those for the European Parliament, is notoriously low, especially among younger voters. This study compares five pathways in which exposure to poll coverage can affect turnout: bandwagon voting, strategic turnout, increased information efficacy, campaign cynicism and perceived electoral importance. The mediation analyses are combined with Covariate Balancing Propensity Score matching to better account for selection effects. Analyses of a four-wave panel survey of young voters (N = 747) in the 2014 European Parliament Election show that exposure to polls in election coverage predominantly stimulates interest and turnout among young voters. This is in line with the perspective that poll coverage increases perceived electoral importance. Poll coverage can thus play a beneficial role in activating the potential among young voters to engage with (second-order) elections. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Media discourse has a profound effect on public opinions. Prior research, the majority of which has been conducted internationally, shows that print media constructions of intimate partner violence (IPV) operate within a patriarchal framework which normalizes and constructs men’s violence against women as acceptable. This research explored Queensland’s print media representation of IPV. Results show that the reporting of IPV is episodic, sensationalistic, prone to perpetrator sympathizing, and fails to contextualize IPV as an ongoing pattern of intentionally abusive behaviour. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Social media are recognized as important outlets for youth political expression, yet the affordances of different platforms may shape the forms and styles of expression that young people deploy. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the ways social media affordances shape youth voice, this article examines young people’s political expression on the popular app musical.ly in the context of the 2016 US presidential election. Employing quantitative and qualitative content analysis on 1651 youth-created videos, we examine how young people use platform affordances, political hashtags, and memetic dimensions to convey a range of expressive political practices. In particular, through the analysis of content, form, and stance, our research illuminates how social media afford collective political expression for youth, by allowing them to deliberately connect to an assumed like-minded audience with similar beliefs through the use of shared symbolic resources. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the Canadian public’s perspective regarding clinical trials. Methods: We surveyed 1602 Ontario and British Columbia residents to ascertain their understanding of and willingness to participate in clinical trials. Results: Clinical trials are regarded positively with overall perceptions that they provide societal and personal benefits. Most respondents were somewhat (49%) or very willing (19%) to participate in a clinical trial. This increased with age and level of education. It was also greater among those with poor or very poor health, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those who had previously been invited into a clinical trial, all of which were correlated with age. Still, there was room for improvement in awareness and understanding of clinical trials. Forty-three percent of those surveyed felt not very informed or not at all informed and 37% had no opinion regarding clinical trials. Respondents would most often turn to their treating physician if considering participating in a clinical trial and least often to social media. Conclusion: While Canadians’ views about clinical trials are generally positive, they are somewhat muted and a significant minority feels poorly or not at all informed. They are less willing to participate in clinical research than Americans and are roughly equivalent to Europeans. While clinicians are the top choice for learning about clinical trials, they have little or no training and little time for this role. As we move toward integrating clinical trials into the practice setting, these issues of time, training, and resources must be addressed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus populations of Windermere, England’s largest natural lake in the Lake District of north-west England, have been studied since the 1940s. However, the species’ cultural importance has a much longer history and these populations have been fished since 1223. As early as 1660, Arctic charr were exploited in a high-profile commercial net fishery and greatly enjoyed by locals and in a ‘potted’ form by wealthier members of UK society. However, overfishing led to substantially decreased catches and commercial netting was stopped in 1921. Local fishing for Arctic charr persists to the present as a small recreational plumb-line fishery using artificial lures. These fishing activities and resulting catches have long held great cultural interest for the local community and visiting national and international tourists. The cultural importance of the Arctic charr populations of Windermere has recently been the subject of national media interest that culminated in a 2017 documentary film highlighting environmental issues facing the Arctic charr and also celebrating the role of this iconic species in the cultural life of Windermere. In addition, international recognition of the Arctic charr populations of Windermere also contributed to the Lake District becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2017. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Approaching issues through the lens of nonnegotiable values increases the perceived intractability of debate (Baron & Spranca in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 70, 1–16, 1997), while focusing on the concrete consequences of policies instead results in the moderation of extreme opinions (Fernbach, Rogers, Fox, & Sloman in Psychological Science, 24, 939–946, 2013) and a greater likelihood of conflict resolution (Baron & Leshner in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, 183–194, 2000). Using comments on the popular social media platform Reddit from January 2006 until September 2017, we showed how changes in the framing of same-sex marriage in public discourse relate to changes in public opinion. We used a topic model to show that the contributions of certain protected-values-based topics to the debate (religious arguments and freedom of opinion) increased prior to the emergence of a public consensus in support of same-sex marriage (Gallup, 2017), and declined afterward. In contrast, the discussion of certain consequentialist topics (the impact of politicians’ stance and same-sex marriage as a matter of policy) showed the opposite pattern. Our results reinforce the meaningfulness of protected values and consequentialism as relevant dimensions for describing public discourse and highlight the usefulness of unsupervised machine-learning methods in tackling questions about social attitude change. © 2019, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine a case of companies cooperating with the State to prevent a public controversy over nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster and achieve mutually beneficial policy outcomes. It analyses the private and public communication of pro-nuclear corporate, political and regulatory actors. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the political economy theory, the study examines how actors mobilised power by accessing an existing social network to agree a joint public communication strategy in order to ensure public support for the continuation of nuclear power generation in the UK. It traces discursive frames from their inception in private communication to their reproduction in public communication and their dissemination via the media. Findings: The study provides evidence of pro-nuclear actors cooperating behind the scenes to achieve consistent public pro-nuclear messaging. It finds evidence of four discursive frames: avoiding knee-jerk reactions, lessons learned, safety and nuclear renaissance. In combination, they guide audiences’ evaluation of the consequences of the Fukushima disaster for the UK in favour of continuing the commercial use of nuclear energy. Originality/value: The private e-mail exchange between pro-nuclear actors presents a unique opportunity to examine the mobilisation of less visible forms of power in the form of agenda setting (manipulation) and discursive framing (domination) in order to influence policy outcomes and shape public opinion on nuclear energy. This is problematic because it constitutes a lack of transparency and accountability on part of the State with respect to policy outcomes and restricts the civic space by curtailing the articulation of alternative interests and voices. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study examined the processes through which media frames and onset controllability, independently or jointly, influence support for policies to help postpartum depression patients. A 2 (Frame: episodic vs. thematic) x 2 (Onset controllability: controllable vs. uncontrollable) experiment (N = 306) found that a thematic frame (vs. episodic) exerted a stronger impact on policy support, and such effect was serially mediated by attributions of individual/societal responsibility and empathy toward women suffering from postpartum depression. However, the relative efficacy of a thematic frame (vs. episodic) at increasing policy support depended on perceived controllability of the cause for postpartum depression; a thematic frame induced significantly greater policy support than an episodic frame when the cause was perceived to be controllable, but not when the cause was perceived to be uncontrollable. This study contributes to the literature on media framing by collectively addressing cognitive and affective processes in forming policy attitudes and identifying onset controllability as a potential boundary condition for the framing effects. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using Web-resources derived from social media platforms, the CSS uses a spatially-situated social network graph to harvest user-generated content from selected organizations and members of the public. This allows ‘passively’ contributed social media-based opinions, along with different variables, such as time, location, social interaction, service usage, and human activities to be examined and used to identify trending views and influential citizens. The data model and CSS are used for demonstration purposes to identify geotopics and community interests relevant to municipal affairs in the City of Toronto, Canada. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In recent years, the outbreak of numerous environmental risk incidents aroused widespread public concern about the amplification mechanism of environmental risk in China. However, few studies have investigated the influence path of environmental risk perception on behavioral responses in Chinese context from a micro perspective. In this article, we develop a multidimensional path model from environmental risk perception to behavioral responses, which aims to investigate how the public’s environmental risk perception influence its different behavioral responses, including environmental radical behavior, environmental concern behavior and environmental protection behavior. A survey data from Chinese General Social Survey 2013 (CGSS2013), was used to test the model, including questions related to information channel (e.g., media use, interpersonal network), cognitive evaluation (e.g., environmental value, public’s evaluation of environmental governance) and environmental knowledge. The results indicate that both information channel factors and cognitive evaluation factors can significantly influence the progress that from environmental risk perception to behavioral responses, of which both media use and environmental value play the amplification role in the transform process, while interpersonal network and public’s evaluation of environmental governance would inhibit public’s risk perception transforming into environmental behavior. Besides, environmental knowledge displays a key bridge role between information channel factors and cognitive evaluation factors. This research findings also demonstrated the evolution paths of three environmental behaviors under the same level of risk perception, namely, risk transformation and diffusion, risk perception enhancement and risk attenuation respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study focused on the increase in refugee-related discourse in Korean society with the recent inflow of asylum seekers to Jeju Island. The purpose of our study was to understand the trends in public opinion concerning the acceptance of refugees by analyzing the content of refugee-related video commentary on YouTube. Topic modeling was conducted to analyze the main points, context, and ideas in the comments. The results indicated that the media mainly focus on the pros and cons of refugees, restricting the refugee issue to the problem of acceptance with a narrow focus on the case of Jeju Island. Refugee acceptance was treated as overwhelmingly unacceptable in the comments. We found that commenters often used negative discourse in the comments as a device for reproducing and amplifying hate speech. © 2019, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection of race, law and medical authority in Gilded Age New York through an examination of the trial and execution of Chastine Cox. This case was a media sensation due to two controversies which played out in the courtroom and the court of public opinion. For the public, Cox’s race inflected the debate over the crime and execution. Within the courtroom, however, controversy centred on the interpretation of medical evidence, which raised the possibility that Cox was not guilty. In particular, the defence strategy centred on medical theories of suspended animation, making use of new medical evidence about the line between life and death to prompt uncertainties both about the possibility of murder and the reliability of medical professionals. This paper demonstrates the ways in which anxieties about life, death, law, race and medicine were negotiated in courts of law and public opinion. © 2019 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we are proposing a compact CNN model for facial expression recognition. Expression recognition on the low quality images are much more challenging and interesting due to the presence of low-intensity expressions. These low intensity expressions are difficult to distinguish with insufficient image resolution. Data collection for FER is expensive and time-consuming. Researches indicates the fact that downloaded images from the Internet is very useful to model and train expression recognition problem. We use extra datasets to improve the training of facial expression recognition, each representing specific data source. Moreover, to prevent subjective annotation, each dataset is labeled with different approaches to ensure annotation qualities. Recognizing the precise and exact expression from a variety of expressions of different people is a huge problem. To solve this problem, we proposed an Emotion Detection Model to extract emotions from the given input image. This work mainly focuses on the psychological approach of color circle-emotion relation[1] to find the accurate emotion from the input image. Initially the whole image is preprocessed and pixel by pixel data is studied. And the combinations of the circles based on combined data will result in a new color. This resulted color will be directly correlated to a particular emotion. Based on the psychological aspects the output will be of reasonable accuracyThe major application of our work is to predict a person’s emotion based on his face images or video frames This can even be applied for evaluating the public opinion relating to a particular movie, form the video reaction posts on social Medias. One of the diverse applications of our system is to understand the students learning from their emotions. Human beings shows their emotional states and intentions through facial expressions.. Facial expressions are powerful and natural methods that emphasize the emotional status of humans.The approach used in this work successfully exploits temporal information and it improves the accuracies on the public benchmarking databases. The basic facial expressions are happiness, fear, anger, disgust sadness, and surprise[2]. Contempt was subsequently added as one of the basic emotions. Having sufficient well labeled training data with variations of the populations and environments is important for the design of a deep expression recognition system.Behaviors, poses, facial expressions, actions and speech are considered as channels, which convey human emotions. Lot of research works are going on in this field to explore the correlation between the above mentioned channels and emotions. This paper highlights on the development of a system which automatically recognizes the emotion represented on a face. A neural network approach combined with digital image processing is used in classifying the universal basic emotions such as Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, Surprise and Fear. Colored frontal face images are given as input to the proposed system. The input face image is preprocessed and feature point extraction method is applied to extract a set of selected feature points. Finally, the set of values obtained after processing those extracted feature points are taken as input to the neural network to recognize the emotion contained.The three major steps in any automatic deep face emotion recognition model are pre-processing, deep feature learning and deep feature classification. © BEIESP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of hepatitis B and C patients towards the disease. METHODS: The cross-sectional, descriptive, questionnaire-based study was conducted at the Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) and its allied hospitals, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from October to December 2017, and comprised hepatitis B and C patients aged ≥18 years who were visiting the outpatient department. A structured, close-ended, 30-item questionnaire was used to collect data which was then analysed using SPSS 23. . RESULTS: Of the 399 patients, 230(57.6%) were women, 103(26%) did not have any formal education, and TV, radio and the internet was the main source of information regarding hepatitis for 138(34.6%) patients. The overall mean age was 42.82}11.78 years. The sample showed poor knowledge with a mean score of 7.33}2.03, adequate attitude with a mean of 4.33}1.19, and poor practice with a mean of 2.97}1.05. Correlation was statistically significant between knowledge and practice (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of imperative knowledge of hepatitis in patients was the main reason for negative attitude and poor practices.

AB  - Background: Adverse events are underreported in research studies, particularly randomized controlled trials and pharmacovigilance studies. A method that researchers could use to identify more complete safety profiles for medications is to use social media analytics. However, patient's perspectives on the ethical issues associated with using patient reports of adverse drug events on social media are unclear. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the ethics of using social media for detecting and monitoring adverse events for research purposes using a multi methods approach. Methods: A multi methods design comprising qualitative semistructured interviews (n=24), a focus group (n=3), and 3 Web-based discussions (n=20) with members of the public was adopted. Findings from a recent systematic review on the use of social media for monitoring adverse events provided a theoretical framework to interpret the study's findings. Results: Views were ascertained regarding the potential benefits and harms of the research, privacy expectations, informed consent, and social media platform. Although the majority of participants were supportive of social media content being used for research on adverse events, a small number of participants strongly opposed the idea. The potential benefit of the research was cited as the most influential factor to whether participants would give their consent to their data being used for research. There were also some caveats to people's support for the use of their social media data for research purposes: The type of social media platform and consideration of the vulnerability of the social media user. Informed consent was regarded as difficult to obtain and this divided the opinion on whether it should be sought. Conclusions: Social media users were generally positive about their social media data being used for research purposes; particularly for research on adverse events. However, approval was dependent on the potential benefit of the research and that individuals are protected from harm. Further study is required to establish when consent is required for an individual's social media data to be used. © 2019 Su Golder, Arabella Scantlebury, Helen Christmas.

AB  - After the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, there was confusion among the public caused by uncoordinated information about radiation provided by diverse channels. We explored the association between information sources regarding reconstruction progress after the disaster and mental fatigue in Fukushima. We used data from the annual public opinion survey by the Fukushima Prefectural Government on its policies from 2013 to 2015, which contained survey responses from 1,300 community residents randomly selected from the 28 municipalities in the Fukushima Prefecture. The survey contained a question assessing mental fatigue: “How often do you usually feel mentally tired or depressed?" In total, 2,130 participants (758 participants in 2013, 699 participants in 2014, and 673 participants in 2015) were analyzed. The respondents were classified as two categories, “high mental fatigue” and “low mental fatigue,” based on their responses to this question. Overall, the proportion of participants with high mental fatigue was 13.2%. There was no association between the year of survey or occupation and high mental fatigue. Cluster analysis was performed to classify information sources. Then, we conducted a crosssectional analysis of the associations between clusters of information sources and high mental fatigue. We found that unreliable information sources, such as “Internet” and “a combination of TV, radio, and word of mouth,” were significantly associated with high mental fatigue, compared with reliable information sources, such as “municipal public relations in addition to major media (newspaper, TV, and radio).” These findings provide important insights into how information sources affect mental fatigue following a disaster. © 2019 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) is posing great challenge for most countries in the world, which can cause severe negative impacts to the environment and human health. Waste-to-energy has great potential in China because of its technological maturity and policy support at the national level. However, there are significant conflicts between the huge market demand and strong public opposition. It is imperative to examine the public perception of waste-to-energy, especially for developing countries where a large number of projects are under construction or have been approved. The public perception of waste-to-energy was carried out by a questionnaire survey in this research. A total of 650 questionnaires were distributed and 629 questionnaires were returned, with a response rate of 96.8%. The results show that the public showed general concern in regard to environmental issues. Respondents had an overall positive attitude towards waste-to-energy, but it varied according to the demographic details of residents, such as age, education, and income. Recognition level of the benefits was higher than the concern of associated risks. Multiple linear regression shows that awareness of environmental issues had no impact on public attitude towards waste-to-energy, while public awareness and perceived benefits had notable positive impacts. Perceived risks had a positive correlation with public attitude. In order to promote the development of MSW incinerators, the government should make more publicity efforts. Rural residents, people over 50 years old, and people with low education and low income are the major groups which should be focused on to enhance the public perception. The findings provide a theoretical and practical reference for enhancing the social acceptance of waste-to-energy development. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Extraction and analysis of public opinions from social network data can provide interesting outcomes and inferences about product, service, event or personality. Twitter is one of the most popular medium for analyzing the public sentiment through user tweets. Feature specific opinion analysis provides highly accurate and effective classification and categorization of public opinions. This paper focuses on developing an opinion mining framework for automated analysis of tweet opinions using efficient feature selection and classification algorithms. For this purpose, an Improved Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (IDEA) is developed by enhancing the optimization performance of the Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA). The limitations of DEA are the insufficient exploration and exploitation properties in local optimum solutions and also impact the convergence rate. These shortcomings are overcome by the proposed IDEA algorithm. In this work, first the tweets are collected and pre-processed to extract the features using Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and n-grams aided by a dictionary. Using IDEA, the feature subset candidates are selected and the outcomes are fed as input to the baseline classifiers to obtain highly accurate opinion classification. The evaluation of the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using the two feature selection approaches of DEA and IDEA are performed over cancer and drug tweets datasets and the results illustrate that the classification accuracy of opinions is enhanced significantly through the IDEA based feature selection than the traditional DEA algorithm. These results justify the utilization of the proposed IDEA algorithm for improving the opinion mining applications in different fields. © BEIESP.

AB  - Previous research into public perceptions of live prey feeding has been focused on terrestrial animals. The reasons for this likely relate to the difficulty humans have in being compassionate to animals who are phylogenetically distantly related. In order to test these assumptions, the general public (two groups; one who had just visited an aquarium; and one group who had just visited a zoo), aquarium professionals in the UK/US and terrestrial zoo animal professionals (UK) were investigated to see how they would differ in their responses when asked about feeding various live aquatic animals to one another. Likert based surveys were used to obtain data face to face and via online social media. Demographics in previous research identified a lower acceptance of live prey feeding by females, however in aquatic animals this was not reflected. Instead, separations in perception were seen to exist between participants dependent on whether they had just visited a zoo or aquarium, or worked with animals. © 2019 Marshall et al.

AB  - Nowadays, based on mobile devices and internet, social network services (SNS) are common trends to everyone. Social opinions as public opinions are very important to the government, company, and a person. Analysis and decision of social polarity of SNS about social happenings, political issues and government policies, or commercial products is very critical to the government, company, and a person. Newly coined words and emoticons on SNS are created every day. Specifically, emoticons are made and sold by a person or companies. Newly coined words are mostly made and used by various kinds of communities. The SNS big data mainly consist of normal text with newly coined words and emoticons so that newly coined words and emoticons analysis is very important to understand the social and public opinions. Social big data is informally made and unstructured, and on social network services, many kinds of newly coined words and various emoticons are made anonymously and unintentionally by people and companies. In the analysis of social data, newly coined words and emoticons limit the guarantee the accuracy of analysis. The newly coined words implicitly contain the social opinions and trends of people. The emotional states of people significantly are expressed by emoticons. Although the newly coined words and emoticons are an important part of the social opinion analysis, they are excluded from the emotional dictionary and social big data analysis. In this research, newly coined words and emoticons are extracted from the raw Twitter's twit messages and analyzed and included in a pre-built dictionary with the polarity and weight of the newly coined words and emoticons. The polarity and weight are calculated for emotional classification. The proposed emotional classification algorithm calculates the weight of polarity (positive or negative) and results in total polarity weight of social opinion. If the total polarity weight of social opinion is more than the pre-fixed threshold value, the twit message is decided as positive. If it is less than the pre-fixed threshold value, the twit message is decided as negative and the other values mean neutral opinion. The accuracy of the social big data analysis result is improved by quantifying and analyzing emoticons and newly coined words. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Many individuals access and share health information on social networking sites. Previous studies have analyzed the social media site Twitter to discern public opinion related to health phenomena such as antibiotics, concussions, and flu. Physical therapy-related online discussions have not been studied. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore content, participants, and structure of physical therapy-related discussions on Twitter. Design: This study was observational. Methods: Over 12 weeks, more than 30,000 physical therapy-related tweets were collected. A random sample of 100 tweets underwent preliminary analysis to determine broad categories including tweet author, tone, and theme. A second random sample of 100 tweets was analyzed to confirm categories. Once categories were established, a new sample of 1000 tweets was randomly selected for analysis and categorization. All study investigators categorized a shared collection of tweets to establish inter- and intrarater agreement. Twitter conversations were visualized using NodeXL. Results: Intrarater and interrater agreement for tweet categorization was 95% and 89%, respectively. The distribution of the intended audience was 35.5% professional, 35.5% broad reach, and 29% public. The gross distribution of tweet tone was 63.1% neutral, 31.4% positive, and 5.6% negative. Twenty-eight percent of tweets were authored by physical therapists/physical therapist assistants and nearly one-half were categorized as "marketing." Tweets tended to be "isolated," not within a conversation, or consist of conversation within "tight crowds." Limitations: This study was purely observational. Social media content can be highly influenced by temporal events, which limits the generalization of specific findings. Conclusions: Study results indicate that the reach of physical therapy-related tweets may not be as broad as intended by the author. Physical therapy professionals and the hospitals/clinics that employ them may need to implement strategies to be more intentional in reaching a broader audience with online messages. © 2019 American Physical Therapy Association.

AB  - Public participation plays an important role of traffic planning and management, but it is a great challenge to collect and analyze public opinions for traffic problems on a large scale under traditional methods. Traffic management departments should appropriately adopt public opinions in order to formulate scientific and reasonable regulations and policies. At present, while increasing degree of public participation, data collection and processing should be accelerated to make up for the shortcomings of traditional planning. This paper focuses on text analysis using large data with temporal and spatial attributes of social network platform. Web crawler technology is used to obtain traffic-related text in mainstream social platforms. After basic treatment, the emotional tendency of the text is analyzed. Then, based on the probabilistic topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation model), the main opinions of the public are extracted, and the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data are summarized. Taking Nanjing Metro as an example, the existing problems are summarized from the public opinions and improvement measures are put forward, which proves the feasibility of providing technical support for public participation in public transport with social media big data. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Natural Protected Areas face the challenge of conciliating attractions with satisfaction of their different stakeholders without compromising their own resources. Marketing can play an important role to this challenge from a macromarketing perspective. No studies are found in the literature on the integral assessment of marketing practices in Natural Protected Areas. For the first time, it proposes a marketing audit in Natural Protected Areas to fill that gap applying the Importance-Performance Analysis matrix, useful in strategic decisions, through interviews with directors of Natural Protected Areas. The main strengths, weaknesses, and deficits in the application of marketing are identified. The presence of a restricted and biased attitude towards marketing was noted among directors. In addition, the marketing behaviour is studied in two of the main social networks (Twitter/Facebook), comparisons were established in the USA, Spain, Italy and Mexico, identifying behavioural profiles in five groups in accordance with the 26 indicators under analysis. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Aims and method Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that is stereotypically stigmatised as untreatable and associated with violence. Several authorities have suggested that changing the name, for example to psychosis, would reduce such stigmatisation. We aimed to compare attitudes to schizophrenia and psychosis on Twitter to see if psychosis was associated with less negative attitudes. Tweets containing the terms 'schizophrenia', 'schizophrenic', 'psychosis' or 'psychotic' were collected on www.twitter.com and were captured with NCapture. On NVivo, tweets were coded into categories based on user type, tweet content, attitude and stigma type by two independent raters. We compared the content and attitudes of tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and psychosis/psychotic.Results A total of 1120 tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and 1080 referring to psychosis/psychotic were identified over two 7-day periods; 424 original tweets for schizophrenia and 416 original tweets for psychosis were included in the analysis. Psychosis was significantly more commonly included in tweets expressing negative attitudes (n=131, 31.5%) than schizophrenia (n=41, 9.7%) (χ2 = 237.03, P &lt; 0.0001). Of the personal opinions or dyadic interactions, 125 (53.4%) in the psychosis data set were stigmatising, compared with 33 (24.6%) of those in the schizophrenia set (χ2 = 44.65, P &lt; 0.0001).Clinical implications The terms psychosis/psychotic are associated with a significantly higher number of tweets with negative content than schizophrenia/schizophrenic. Together with other evidence, this suggests that changing the name of schizophrenia to psychosis will not reduce negative attitudes toward the condition.Declaration of interest S.L. has received personal fees from Otsuka and Sunovion, and personal and research fees from Janssen. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of migrant children's perceived discrimination on their social adaptation and the moderating effect of their city identity. In addition, differences in the relationships among the aforementioned variables were compared across two school types in terms of public schools and privately operated migrant schools. A cluster sampling method was used to survey 410 junior high school students in China using the Social Adaptation Assessment Questionnaire, the Perceived Discrimination Questionnaire for Individuals, and the City Identity Questionnaire as measures. Results showed that perceived discrimination significantly and negatively affected the social adaptation of migrant children. The relationship between perceived discrimination and social adaptation was moderated by the city identity of migrant children in private schools but not by those in public schools. Under the condition of high or medium city identity, discrimination negatively predicts social adaptation; under the condition of low city identity, however, discrimination does not predict social adaptation. In conclusion, perceived discrimination is an important factor regarding the social adaptation of migrant children, and their relationships vary by different types of city identity and schools. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Modeling the opinion dynamics of transit system riders is key to understanding their needs, motivations and sensitivities for service changes. This can make planning and operations processes to match user profile, hence promoting more transit usage with positive results on sustainable development. This research work investigated the triangulation of social (how users are related to each other)and semantic (what issues/topics are on user minds)network analysis as well as sentiment analysis (how do they feel about these topics)of social media interactions for supporting better underrating of transit user opinions and levels of satisfaction. We used data from the Twitter account of TransLink (Vancouver transit agency); tracked them over 11 month period; compared them to similar data from two other Canadian cities; and, in so doing, contrasted the results in days with disruptions and days with normal operations. Our research work developed a methodology that can be guide agencies in this regards. First, the social network should be qualified as a viable community (small world), not just a random graph (with sparsely connected nodes). It should be clustered into sub-communities based on their connectivity and the issues they discuss. Second, we used a lexicon for customer satisfaction to detect topics in tweets. Linking topics to sentiments (user view of them)can be used as indicator for their opinion. Studying the variations of topics and sentiment across sub-communities, we can observe the origination of ideas. By tracking the evolution of the social network, we could study the potential impacts of social interaction (possibly learning)on opinion dynamics. In the specific case of Vancouver data, sentiment was negative, indicating a lower levels of satisfaction across all topics. However, this negativity should be taken in context—many social media interactions (especially Twitter)have negative sentiment. Interestingly, analysis of sentiment levels in days with disruption, particularly those related to public safety incidents, showed lower levels of negative attitude. This contrast could be an indirect measure of trust: while customers may not be satisfied with services, they trust that the agency is doing its best to protect them. Analysis of customer social networks showed that the sub-network of the most influential players closely matched of the full network in terms of topics and sentiment. Analysis of sub-communities shows that the network is not a venue for disseminating information by the agency. Many sub-groups, especially the ones we call medium-size groups (defined in our work as having between a 1000 and 10,000 nodes), portray a more of inter-customer interactions. It seems this is where discussions and topics evolve. The results of our analysis is specific to Vancouver and to the data and period investigated. They should not be generalized given the evolutionary nature of social media contents and the dynamics of opinion. Our methodology, however, can be used as benchmark or a starting point to conducting similar analysis in other agencies. The interpretation, as always, will remain context-sensitive (influenced by local conditions). Transit agencies should conduct such analysis frequently; experiment with adjusting its steps and the proposed algorithms to their local conditions; and establish a mechanism for the frequency of such analysis. More importantly, they should always triangulate the results of such analysis against findings from other sources of data such as community meetings and customer surveys. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Based on two theoretical approaches—contact theory and threat perception theory—in combination with meaningful encounter and media perspective and using the example of two neighbourhoods in Zagreb, this paper aims to explore several issues related to asylum seekers: (1) the definition and perceptions of asylum seekers expressed by locals; (2) attitudes towards asylum seekers in relation to vicinity to an asylum seeker centre and contact with asylum seekers on the neighbourhood level; and (3) the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. The survey was conducted in the period of November 2015 to January 2016, using a systematic random sample (N = 299) in two selected neighbourhoods of the City of Zagreb: Dugave and Trnje. Each neighbourhood represents a specific surrounding in relation to the proximity of asylum seekers. In terms of location and contact with the asylum seekers, significant differences were found in all obtained latent dimensions of attitudes towards asylum seekers and attitudes based on locational attributes regarding asylum seeker reception: Dugave residents (located closer to the reception and accommodation centre) expressed, in general, more negative attitudes towards asylum seekers and their reception in Croatia than their counterparts in Trnje. The specific timeframe (the 2015–2016 sequence usually referred to as “European Migration Crisis”) and the spatial context chosen for conducting the survey allows for spatialised and comparative findings. The discussion further develops the perceptive role played by media in a context of highly-mediatised migration, and the nature of contact in shaping more positive or negative attitudes towards refugees and migrants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Public opinion, as necessary a concept it is to the underpinnings of democracy, is a socially constructed representation of the public that is forged by the methods and data from which it is derived, as well as how it is understood by those tasked with evaluating and utilizing it. I examine how social media manifests as public opinion in the news and how these practices shape journalistic routines. I draw from a content analysis of news stories about the 2016 US election, as well as interviews with journalists, to shed light on evolving practices that inform the use of social media to represent public opinion. I find that despite social media users not reflecting the electorate, the press reported online sentiments and trends as a form of public opinion that services the horserace narrative and complements survey polling and vox populi quotes. These practices are woven into professional routines – journalists looked to social media to reflect public opinion, especially in the wake of media events like debates. Journalists worried about an overreliance on social media to inform coverage, especially Dataminr alerts and journalists’ own highly curated Twitter feeds. Hybrid flows of information between journalists, campaigns, and social media companies inform conceptions of public opinion. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Until 2017, Germany was an exception to the success of radical right parties in postwar Europe. We provide new evidence for the transformation of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to a radical right party drawing upon social media data. Further, we demonstrate that the AfD's electorate now matches the radical right template of other countries and that its trajectory mirrors the ideological shift of the party. Using data from the 2013 to 2017 series of German Longitudinal Elections Study (GLES) tracking polls, we employ multilevel modelling to test our argument on support for the AfD. We find the AfD's support now resembles the image of European radical right voters. Specifically, general right-wing views and negative attitudes towards immigration have become the main motivation to vote for the AfD. This, together with the increased salience of immigration and the AfD's new ideological profile, explains the party's rise. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The media tends to influence public perceptions of the criminal justice system. The media’s impact, known as the CSI Effect, is not well documented in criminal justice majors. The present study adds to a small body of literature regarding the impact of media on criminal justice students’ decisions, and seeks to identify the factors that influence students’ choices, regarding their major/career goals. Based on the results from surveys administered at an urban university in the United States, most criminal justice students reported that they were not influenced by the media, yet the vast majority believed this to be true of their fellow majors. These students chose criminal justice because they found the subject matter interesting and relevant to the real world, and they wanted to work in a field in which they could be a problem solver. Upon graduation, these students overwhelmingly reported an interest in pursuing a career in federal law enforcement. Unfortunately, corrections, a field dedicated to working with offenders, was the lowest preferred profession among criminal justice students. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective In 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reached an agreement with Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company (SFNTC) stipulating that SFNTC will remove 'natural' and 'additive-free' from Natural American Spirit (NAS) marketing to combat misperceptions that NAS is a healthier cigarette. The purpose of this study was to assess experimentally the potential effectiveness of the agreement in addressing NAS misperceptions. Methods In an online experiment, 820 current and former smokers were assigned randomly to advertising conditions with existing claims from NAS advertisements, modified claims or a no-exposure control. Advertising conditions included (1) 'original' NAS advertising text before the agreement; (2) '2017 agreement' language permissible under the FDA-SFNTC agreement (removing 'natural', 'additive-free'); (3) more restrictive ('stricter') language representing additional regulation (removing 'natural' from the brand name and the phrases 'tobacco+water', 'no chemicals'). Participants completed outcome measures assessing misinformed beliefs and intentions towards NAS. Results One-way ANOVA showed that relative to the 'original' language, the '2017 agreement' language reduced misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but not about health or constituent composition. Yet 'stricter' language significantly reduced all categories of misinformed beliefs, which in turn mediated effects on (lower) intentions to use NAS. Conclusion The 2017 agreement helps dispel some misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but does not sufficiently rectify misinformation about health or composition. Since 'stricter' language more effectively corrects misinformed beliefs, our results suggest the need for further regulations in addressing misinformation that drives intentions towards NAS. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Objective: The current study examined the relationship between minority stress, social support, and the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Australians during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Method: A sample of 1,305 Australian LGB adults completed an online survey that measured their frequency of exposure to negative and positive media messages about same-sex marriage, perceived personal support, and psychological distress during the postal survey. Results: More frequent exposure to negative media messages about same-sex marriage was associated with greater psychological distress. This association, however, was significantly weaker amongst participants who perceived greater personal support for same-sex marriage from their immediate social network. Alternatively, exposure to positive messages of public support via public and social media was not associated with psychological distress, and did not moderate the association between negative media message exposure and psychological distress. Nonetheless, more frequent exposure to public support was more strongly associated with reduced psychological distress amongst participants who perceived their immediate social network to be less supportive of same-sex marriage. Conclusions: The findings highlight how legislative processes related to the rights of stigmatised, minority populations have the potential to adversely affect their mental health. The findings also highlight the role of personal and public support as protective factors against minority stress. Within the limits of a cross-sectional study design, these findings have implications for public policy and legislative decision-making, treating clinicians of LGB clients, and LGB rights and mental health organisations. © 2019 The Australian Psychological Society

AB  - India's official embrace of the soft power concept and the popular equation of Bollywood films with India's international image are discussed here with reference to their contemporary convergence. This article seeks to make the case that the underlying claims of the soft power doctrine necessitate an empirical test at the level of grassroots reception. Further, this article also seeks to shift the emphasis from ‘impressing the West’ towards interrogating the dynamics of India's cultural diplomacy in other Asian states. With these aims in mind, this article presents two qualitative case studies from Chiang Mai, Thailand and Metro Manila in the Philippines. The responses collected indicate the inherent complexities of Inter-Asian dialogues on culture and modernity as well as the importance of the local media environment in determining perceptions of contemporary India. Ultimately, the capacity of popular culture to create a positive impression and to counter existing prejudices and misconceptions is supported in a series of reception studies. At the same time, the ‘moral superiority’ and historical legacies that are assumed to underpin India's cultural prestige in the region are challenged by the content and tone of these responses from the general public. In the contemporary setting of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), it becomes clear that the mediation of Indian culture operates within an increasingly transnational media environment and a competitive modernity that informs comparative perspectives between Asian cultures. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Although criminologists have studied public attitudes to community sanctions, and there has also been some attention to media representations of them, there has been no serious examination of the relationships between media and public understandings. This article presents an interdisciplinary analysis (drawing on sociology, media and communications and organizational studies) of the potential influence of media consumption practices on penal tastes among diverse participant groups. We aim to develop a clearer understanding of how these processes shape the public legitimacy of community sanctions. In particular, we report on original research employing innovative methodologies to explore the dynamic set of practices deployed by audiences in the process of making meaningful the media landscape on punishment and community sanctions. Our findings offer some confirmation of the primacy of the prison in the popular imagination; the media profile of community sanctions is delimited by their perceived banality, in turn leading to confusion surrounding their purpose and potential. However, this study suggests that the legitimacy problem for community sanctions may be far more complex than ‘newsworthiness’. Community sanctions, we argue, may be subject to appraisal in line with penal ‘tastes’ in which the function of moral censure is of central significance. However, we also uncover some evidence about how traditional markers of taste are disrupted by processes of media convergence (of appropriation, circulation, response) in ways which can operate to limit deliberation even amongst more liberal audience groups, and conversely open it up amongst those who are more punitive. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Much research has investigated what happens when celebrities disclose an illness (via media) to the public. While audience involvement (i.e., identification and parasocial relationships) is often the proposed mechanism linking illness disclosures with audience behavior change, survey designs have prevented researchers from understanding if audience involvement prior to the illness disclosure actually predicts post-disclosure emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Rooted in previous work on audience involvement as well as the Extended Parallel Process Model, the present study uses a national online experiment (N = 1,068) to test how pre-disclosure audience involvement may initiate post-disclosure effects for the message context of skin cancer. The data demonstrate that pre-disclosure audience involvement as well as the celebrity’s framing of the disclosure can shape emotional responses (i.e., fear and hope), and that cognitive perceptions of the illness itself also influence behavioral intentions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The Lebanese public perceives the physician-patient relationship as flawed. The objectives of this study are to assess factors associated with the public's trust in physicians in the context of the Lebanese healthcare system and to explore potential ways to enhance it. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study based on a grounded theory methodology using semi-structured interviews with members of the Lebanese public (not restricted to patients). We selected participants through convenience and maximum variation sampling approaches. The constant comparative analysis resulted in a theoretical framework that describes the factors influencing trust in physicians. Results: Participants trusted an experienced, up-to-date, graduate of a North American or Western European school, working in a reputable hospital, with a high level of diagnostic skills. The personal characteristics that improved trust were physicians who are 'non-materialistic', have a good rapport, and have sufficient encounter time with patients. Social factors that enhance trust in the physician include: being a family member, recommended by a family member, featured in mainstream media, and/or having a good reputation. Trust increased compliance, loyalty despite occasional mistakes committed, high consultation fees, and negative attitudes towards the physician's institution. Conversely, no trust led to severed therapeutic relationship and seeking second opinions. Conclusion: The level of trust of members of the Lebanese public in physicians was affected by the personal characteristics of physicians, their practice or clinical skills, their interactions with the patient, finances, in addition to a number of social factors. Moreover, the level of trust had major implications on patients' interactions with their physicians. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Since the end of 2016, “fake news” has had a clear meaning in the USA. After years of scholarship attempting to define “fake news” and where it fits among the larger schema of media hoaxing and deception, popular culture and even academic studies converged following the 2016 US presidential election to define “fake news” in drastically new ways. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In light of the recent elections in the USA, many fear “fake news” that have gradually become a powerful and sinister force, both in the news media environment as well as in the fair and free elections. The scenario draws into questions how the general public interacts with such outlets, and to what extent and in which ways individual responsibility should govern the interactions with social media. Findings: Fake news is a growing threat to democratic elections in the USA and other democracies by relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans and their behavior. Originality/value: Essentially, “fake news” is changing and even distorting how political campaigns are run, ultimately calling into question legitimacy of elections, elected officials and governments. Scholarship has increasingly confirmed social media as an enabler of “fake news,” and continues to project its potentially negative impact on democracy, furthering the already existing practices of partisan selective exposure, as well as heightening the need for individual responsibility. © 2019, Terry Lee.

AB  - The texts of social media event have feathers of massive-sparse, dynamic-heterogeneous, and obscure-vague, which increase the difficulty of event emotion computing. Aiming at the problem, we construct the dictionary supervised emotion computing model, which can be applied in hot news mining and public opinion guidance analysis based on sentiment computing in network social media. The text words and labels are used as the input of the models, and the profile distribution and emotion distribution of the texts, the word distribution of the profiles, and emotions are output by the models. In addition, the words with definite emotion are used as the constraint condition of the model to enhance the accuracy of text emotion calculation. Our proposed algorithm can express the emotion of the text by using the words and labels from labeled texts, and the emotion words value is calculated through a finite iteration of the network. We also make use of the word emotion in the basic word emotion dictionary to modify the network and then recompute the word emotion, which effectively overcomes the problem of emotion uncertainty of the traditional methods. Experiments show that the accuracy of our model is generally higher than that of ETM, MSTM, and SLTM. Therefore, our proposed method is effective and feasible. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and aim of the study: Nursing has not yet received full social recognition and in general the public opinion does not have a completely positive perception of it, which regards it as an auxiliary profession to the medical profession. This study aims to investigate the image of the nurse among year 4 and 5 high school students. Methods: Two groups of students were interviewed, one at their institution without any previous orientation (n = 102) and one at the University of Bologna during orientation day (n = 388). A validated questionnaire (Nursing Attitude Questionnaire) of 30 items was delivered. Two additional questions were added to explore the possibility of advising relatives and acquaintances to become a nurse and therefore to choose the nursing degree course. Results: All areas of the NAQ scored significantly higher in the group where students attended the orientation day, especially the ones related to the professional role, stereotypes and professional value items. Female students ≥ 21 had a more positive image of the nurse. Both groups recognized that nurses are important figures for patients and that they are intelligent people, who must have a degree in order to carry out their work duties. Differences between the groups were recorded. Students in group 1 did not accept nursing autonomy while students in group 2 understood differences between nursing and medical careers, attributing to them the same value. A positive correlation between the positive image of the nursing profession and the interest in becoming nurses or advising others to undertake the nursing course was found. In conclusion, orientation is effective in helping high school students in the choice of their university courses. Regarding nursing, strategies to improve the image of the nurse and enrollment should be combined during orientation day with current up to date communication and learning tools, such as social media and simulation laboratories. Furthermore, it appears increasingly important to extend orientation and tutoring activities to junior high school students, families and teachers. (www.actabiomedica.it). © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women in Zimbabwe yet it is preventable, early detectable and highly curable. The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices towards cervical cancer, its prevention and treatment in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods: Sequential explanatory mixed methods approach consisting of analytical cross sectional survey and a qualitative inquiry was used. Study population consisted of women with cervical cancer, health workers and other stakeholders who are involved in cancer control programmes. Patient survey data were collected using validated structured questionnaire in Surveytogo software in an android tablet. Qualitative study used key informant interviews to understand survey findings better. Data analyses for the survey involved univariate and multivariate analyses using STATA version 14. For qualitative study, themes in transcripts were coded and analyzed using Dedoose software to generate evidence for the study. Results: Participants reported different levels of knowledge of causes (23%), risk factors (71%), prevention (72%), screening (73%) and treatment (80%) of cervical cancer. Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were negatively associated with: being aged 45 or more years (OR = 0.02; p = 0.004), having no household income (OR = 0.02;p = 0.007), household income <US$600 per month (OR = 0.02; p = 0.015), middle class wealth (OR = 0.01;p = 0.032), watching TV daily (OR = 0.01;p = 0.007) and 1-6 times per week (OR = 0.02; p = 0.045). Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were also positively associated with listening to radio daily (OR = 394, CI: 11.02-1406) (p = 0.001) and 1-6 times a week (OR = 100, CI: 2.95-3364) (p = 0.010). Knowledge of prevention was only positively associated with listening to the radio daily (OR = 77, CI: 1.89-3114) (p = 0.022) and 1-6 times a week (OR = 174, CI: 2.42-1255) (p = 0.018). Major drivers of lack of knowledge for cervical cancer were: limited awareness programmes, lack of knowledge among health workers, donor prioritization of infectious diseases, infancy of cervical cancer interventions, negative attitudes towards cervical cancer and misconceptions. Conclusions: This study revealed that knowledge of causes and prevention of cervical cancer was associated with frequent radio listenership. Strengthening of health education through the packaging of messages targeting the wider society using different delivery channels is thus recommended. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - While an abundance of literature demonstrates that immigration is associated with lower rates of crime, public opinion expects the opposite. There remain many reasons for such incongruity, including crystalized political ideologies and structural barriers to assimilation. The current study examines another important dimension: media narratives among the most prominent immigration and crime news articles. Specifically, we explore how news outlets narratively describe or “frame” the link between immigration and crime and, in turn, how such frames influence the prominence of news stories. Using content analysis of over 3,800 articles from 2008 to 2012 geo-located and paired with a host of macro-level data, multi-level models reveal that (1) one-third of local stories describe immigration as crime-increasing; (2) articles that link immigration to rising rates of crime are more likely to appear on the front page of newspapers, as are stories describing immigration’s impact on the justice system or the rights of immigrants within it; and (3) articles published in places with lower rates of crime, higher median household incomes, and smaller foreign-born populations are more likely to feature on the front page. We conclude with implications for ongoing public policy debates and research on immigration and crime. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article examines how Mizrahim perceive their media representation on Israeli television. Using Karl Jaspers’ psychological theory of boundary situations, the article seeks to explain the seeming disparity between the negative depiction of Mizrahim on Israeli TV and Mizrahi consumption of these representations. Having conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals, the article found that most of the interviewees were well aware of their negative representation on Israeli TV yet used various interpretive strategies, stemming from ‘media boundary situations,’ to deal with this prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cyberbalkanization has growingly become common on the Internet and can lead to public’s opinion polarization. This study investigates a specific process of cyberbalkanization through which incivility is circulated within online communities. From a dataset of Hong Kong-based Facebook Pages collected during a social movement, a set of politically-organized communities was identified and their connectivity generated a post-sharing network. A random sample of contents shared between and within these communities was then manually classified based on the level of incivility. The targets of offence through the use of uncivil language were also coded. Contents shared within ideologically compatible communities were found to be more likely to be uncivil. The association was significantly more positive in a populistic community, of which members had unique political nature and cultural norms. The targets were usually political opponents and incivility was adopted to petition detractors from within-community discussions. We therefore suggest ‘echoslamming’ is an online phenomenon through which uncivil contents catalyse anger toward political opponents among ideologically congruent information sources and consequently reinforce the audience’s predilection. Such a mechanism can be one underlying explanation for a vicious circle of cyberbalkanization-induced polarization on political opinions. © 2019, © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2019.

AB  - The so-called attitude-behaviour-gap of ecology might have changed to a „producer-people-gap”. In summer 2017 in Germany, the intention of private house-builders to buy an exterior insulation system based on renewable materials was measured as positive, with a mean of 5.2 on a 1–7 Likert scale. But the intentions of professionals were clearly below, e.g. craftsmen, with an average of 3.6 on the same scale–although both groups, the privates and the professionals, judged that there is a clear trend towards such products. Because of these findings, an additional investigation of management by producers was conducted in autumn and winter 2017/2018, in which a very critical atmosphere towards renewable materials was found. It was analyzed that the managements` attitudes might not be a basic refusal of renewable material in general, but rather a fear of costs of research and development of new products. A concept was tested, to see if it would be possible to cause an attitude change within the professional key target groups just by applying marketing instruments. Five articles in key media of this market have been published between February and May 2018. In the following evaluation (n = 150) in May 2018 significant effects of the communication have been measured: The intention of decision-makers in craftsmen`s businesses to buy an exterior insulation system based on renewable material rose significantly (0.01 Lv.) from a mean of 3.6 in 2017 to 4.4 in 2018. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Information systems such as social media strongly influence public opinion formation. Additionally, communication on the internet is shaped by individuals and organisations with various aims. This environment has given rise to phenomena such as manipulated content, fake news, and social bots. To examine the influence of manipulated opinions, we draw on the spiral of silence theory and complex adaptive systems. We translate empirical evidence of individual behaviour into an agent-based model and show that the model results in the emergence of a consensus on the collective level. In contrast to most previous approaches, this model explicitly represents interactions as a network. The most central actor in the network determines the final consensus 60–70% of the time. We then use the model to examine the influence of manipulative actors such as social bots on public opinion formation. The results indicate that, in a highly polarised setting, depending on their network position and the overall network density, bot participation by as little as 2–4% of a communication network can be sufficient to tip over the opinion climate in two out of three cases. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which bots could shape the norms adopted by social media users. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.

AB  - Media provide the public with information related to the European Union which may alter individuals’ perceptions, ultimately resulting in changes in performance evaluations of the EU. Knowledge gains may be an important mediator in this process. We present data from a study in the context of the 2016 Bratislava summit in which the Heads of the Union’s governments discussed the outcome of the Brexit vote and the EU’s future. A panel survey assessed the relationship between exposure to media content, event-related knowledge gains, and changes in attitudes towards the European Union. Our results show that when attending to news about the summit, citizens attain event-related knowledge which negatively affects EU performance evaluations. We discuss our findings in light of the role media play in informing the European citizenry. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper examines public discourse on race, whiteness and Muslims through an in-depth exploration of an online media controversy following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. On 16 April, the day after the attacks, the liberal magazine Salon.com published David Sirota’s article, ‘Let’s Hope the Boston Marathon Bomber is a White American’. A firestorm of commentary followed, with conservatives defending the profiling of Muslims, and accusing Sirota of anti-white racism. Anchored in questions of race, racism and Muslims and marked by a sharp partisan polarisation, these discussions intensified after 18 April, when the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the perpetrators. The ensuing debate surrounding the racial identity of the Tsarnaevs displays how Muslim racialisation occurs and operates within a conservative discourse strongly committed to a colour-blind ideology. Our paper moves beyond this affirmation of literature on Muslim racialisation and sets this process within a relationally constructed and performative white racial identity. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although radio has historically been the most widespread media in Ghana and much of Africa, little is known about its news-making practices in political news. Given the rise of mediated politics in an emerging democracy like Ghana, radio's role in enabling communication between political actors and citizens has grown even more pertinent. Drawing on news media logic, described as the imperatives which guide news production, this paper investigates political news production practices through analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews of Ghanaian journalists, politicians and civil society experts. It reveals an emerging trend in political journalism where Ghanaian private radio stations are fast adopting news media logic, characterised by a commercialisation and lack of professionalism, both identified as detrimental to democracy. These practices raise concerns about the media's power in excluding certain political views which do not conform to its logic, thereby providing audiences with a limited reality of the political space. If the sustenance of democracy partly lies on the media providing citizens with accurate information that reflects the range of actors in politics, then attention needs to be paid to these production practices which present limited political content to citizens. © 2020, © 2020 iMasa.

AB  - In this paper I discuss Islamophobia as a form of racism especially intensified in the press and media. The women in my study talked about how they coped with what they saw as a backlash of Islamophobia. I show how they have come to deal with the effects of this in their everyday life. Even though most of the women in my study were born and raised in Britain, this antipathy towards Muslims has made them question their sense of belonging. This paper brings to light the experiences of prejudice and discrimination from the perspective of middle-class British-Pakistanis. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Two surveys, including an original survey and a survey containing substantial secondary data, found substantial links between party identity, selective media exposure and attitudes on immigration. Republicans were significantly more likely to segregate themselves to like-minded media and to avoid traditional objective sources like national and local newspapers, local and national broadcast television news. Border-state residency failed to moderate attitudes about immigration; differences were found between local and national media. Finally, Republican support for immigration fell between 2016 and 2018, after the election of President Trump. © 2019, © 2019 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - The importance of the portrayal of reality in the press is well recognised, especially with respect to its capacity to affect public opinion. Articles on migration found in the Italian press with respect to four periods–the 2014 European Parliament elections; the end of the Mare Nostrum operation in the Mediterranean in 2014; the EU-Turkey Statement of March 2016; and an eventless week in 2016–revealed five main narratives: solidarity, responsibility, state-centred (Westphalian), instrumental and humanitarian. Each of them had its own specificities, while all were informed by Italy’s condition as a frontline state with regard to migration–the EU’s gatekeeper–and its paradoxical state of living in a ‘permanent/potential emergency’, constantly torn by its inability to reconcile security and humanitarian needs. An understanding of justice as non-domination was the main result of the analysis carried out, while there was little reference to migrants’ human rights. © 2019, © 2019 Istituto Affari Internazionali.

AB  - This article examines how German print media have represented male migrants with Muslim backgrounds in relation to mainstream society and the stereotypes drawn on and created, including that of the migrant Muslim man as a criminal and sexual perpetrator. Media reports about ‘lecherous refugees’ have risen in the wake of wider social controversies about the ‘European refugee crisis’ and the consequences of welcoming over 1.5 million refugees from predominantly Muslim countries into Germany in recent years. Many of these reports reflect the Cologne New Year’s Eve 2016 sexual attacks by migrant men against German women. This study of German print media identifies a racialisation and ‘islamicisation’ of sexual violence and proposes the original theoretical concept of intersectional stereotyping to conceptualise the intersecting of religious, racialised and gendered patterns in media representations of male Muslim migrants. The research combines and extends the analytical frameworks of intersectionality and stereotyping to develop a new concept useful in media studies and beyond. The article provides a previously unexplored insight into racialised anti-Muslim stereotyping in German society in socio-political and historical context through the lens of print media. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Politweeting is becoming increasingly popular globally. It offers benefits to politicians and to citizens, especially during election periods. Twitter users in Africa are five times more likely to use the platform to voice their political views than those in the US and UK. Yet, few studies from African countries provide insight into such use. This paper attempts to provide insight into the use of the African National Congress (ANC) Twitter account by citizens and politicians in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. The Adaptive Structuration Theory is relevant to the study and netnography was applied to the study. Findings show that the platform was mostly used by citizens rather than the political party and its politicians. Citizens mostly engaged in political commentary amongst each other about party activities and officials. The political organisation mostly used it for image management for the party and its officials. If harnessed through planned design and implementation of digital communication strategies, social media has the potential to be used as effectively for mass communication, yet simultaneously enable interpersonal persuasion between participants, especially during times of elections. © 2019, © 2019 South African Association of Political Studies.

AB  - Cultured meat can be produced from growing animal cells in-vitro rather than as part of a living animal. This technology has the potential to address several of the major ethical, environmental, and public health concerns associated with conventional meat production. However, research has highlighted some consumer uncertainty regarding the concept. Although several studies have examined the media coverage of this new food technology, research linking different frames to differences in consumer attitudes is lacking. In an experimental study, we expose U.S. adults (n = 480) to one of three different frames on cultured meat: “societal benefits,” “high tech,” and “same meat.” We demonstrate that those who encounter cultured meat through the “high tech” frame have significantly more negative attitudes toward the concept, and are significantly less likely to consume it. Worryingly, this has been a very dominant frame in early media coverage of cultured meat. Whilst this is arguably inevitable, since its technologically advanced nature is what makes it newsworthy, we argue that this high tech framing may be causing consumers to develop more negative attitudes toward cultured meat than they otherwise might. Implications for producers and researchers are discussed. © 2019 Bryant and Dillard.

AB  - Recent work on digital political engagement has extensively shown that social media platforms enhance political participation and collective action. However, the idea that citizen voice through social media can give rise, under given conditions, to a specific digital force combining properties of social movements and public opinion has received less attention. We fill this gap by analysing the digital discussion around the Twitter hashtag #RefugeesWelcome as a case of ‘digital movement of opinion’ (DMO). When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, an extraordinary wave of empathy characterized the publics’ reactions in key European hosting countries, especially as a result of viral images portraying refugee children as the main victims. Using a triangulation of network, content and metadata analysis, we find that this DMO was driven primarily by social media elites whose tweets were then echoed by masses of isolated users. We then test the post-DMO status of the hashtag-sphere after a potentially antithetical shock such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, which polarized the network public. Overall, we argue that the concept of DMO provides a heuristically useful tool for future research on new forms of digital citizen participation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how social structures of gender, caste, and religion, within which children in India operate, inform their engagements with media technologies/narratives. We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children’s media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children’s narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children’s exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explored the potential of using sentiment analysis of tweets to predict referendum choices (Brexit). The feasibility of using StreamKM++ in the massive online analysis framework was examined over five categories, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree (to exit). A Naïve Bayes classifier was used to classify people’s opinions according to these categories. The prediction model resulted in high accuracy (97.98%), making it possible to use it in predicting opinions about public events and issues. The findings from this study may help practitioners, and policymakers understand the importance of sentiment analysis of social media in assessing public opinion and, accordingly, making certain voting predictions. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Iana Sabatovych. ©, © Iana Sabatovych.

AB  - Though the significance of involving children in environmental sustainability efforts is widely acknowledged, we still lack evidence on what they think of environmental issues and about the protection of nature. The aim of the paper is to systematically describe the reasons that children give for protecting the environment. Thirty-three children (aged 6–11 years) participated in one of the six focus groups. Method of qualitative content analysis was used for analyzing the data. Study findings showed that participants were aware of some of the environmental problems or environmentally harmful behaviour like litter and pollution. Moreover, the study participants had various views about the importance of nature protection like maintaining clean environment, protecting human life and health, or protecting animals and plants. The reasons they gave for environmental protection were related to both humans and other parts of the nature. Furthermore, the participants learned about nature protection from sources like family, school, various literature sources, computer games, television and by watching how others behaved. Implications regarding results of the study are presented further in the paper. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Considering the role played by Rashtria Sahara, an Urdu daily newspaper that took recourse to the democratic practice of questioning and challenging the hegemonic formation of the maligned image of Islam and the faith community vis-à-vis terrorism in the discursive arena, that is, the public sphere, this article tries to understand the role of the Urdu language media in shaping the public opinion and mobilising people from within the community. To this end, first, the article seeks to comprehend the present configuration of the Indian public sphere keeping in view its colonial origin. Moreover, the ‘othering’ of Muslims in postcolonial India that has colonial roots, too, has been understood through the idea of ‘interior frontiers’. Second, the role and practices of the Indian state towards Muslims have been taken into account. And, the final section analyses strategies that were put to use by the newspaper to contest the hegemonic formation, which paved the way for social movement to emerge. © 2019 South Asian University.

AB  - Background Public health strategies have focused largely on physical health. However, there is increasing recognition that raising mental health awareness and tackling stigma is crucial to reduce disease burden. National campaigns have had some success but tackling issues locally is particularly important.AimsTo assess the public's awareness and perception of the monthly BBC Cornwall mental health phone-in programmes that have run for 8.5 years in Cornwall, UK (population 530 000). Method A consultation, review and feedback process involving a multiagency forum of mental and public health professionals, people with lived experience and local National Health Service trust's media team was used to develop a brief questionnaire. This was offered to all attendees at two local pharmacies covering populations of 27 000 over a 2-week period. Results In total, 14% (95% CI 11.9-16.5) were aware of the radio show, 11% (95% CI 9.0-13.1) have listened and the majority (76%) of those who listened did so more than once. The estimated reach is 70 000 people in the local population, of whom approximately 60 000 listen regularly. The show is highly valued among respondents with modal and median scores of 4 out of 5.ConclusionsLocal radio is a successful, cost-effective and impactful way to reach a significant proportion of the population and likely to raise awareness, reduce stigma and be well received. The format has been adopted in other regions thus demonstrating easy transferability. It could form an essential part of a public health strategy to improve a population's mental well-being.

AB  - China has relaxed its family planning policy to allow all married couples to have a second child. To ensure a smooth implementation of the new policy (second-child policy), an efficient detection of public attitudes is necessary. However, traditional methods fail to meet the requirement. This paper aims to examine social media responses, and then uses of linguistic analysis methods to build computational models for automatic detection of attitudinal expressions in social media posts. In this study, a total of 17,305 Sina Weibo posts with keywords were collected and analyzed. First, a content analysis was performed on collected posts to determine whether each of them reflected positive, neutral, or negative attitudes. Second, a series of linguistic features were obtained from each post. Third, based on selected linguistic features, decision tree models were built for differentiating among posts indicating different types of attitudes (positive, neutral, and negative). Results showed that 22.30% of analyzed posts indicated negative attitudes. 62.88% of relevant posts reflected a negative desire for bearing a second child. “Cost and burden” was recognized as a major barrier to the birth of a second child (56.55%). The classification accuracy of decision tree models ranged from 71.6 to 74.4%. This paper supports the need for improving public attitudes towards the second-child policy, and confirms that the use of linguistic analysis method can add to the validity of online detection of public attitudes towards significant social events. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this work, the authors characterize Brazilian online population sentiment on different political events using data from Twitter and discuss the advantages of the usage of this social media as a data source. The results demonstrated that the Brazilian population uses Twitter to manifest their political view, expressing both positive and negative sentiments regarding political events. This kind of characterization may contribute to build a critical opinion of Brazilian people, once they would not be limited by what is being divulgated by typical media, such as television and newspapers. Additionally, the authors reinforced the applicability of social media, as Twitter, to make this kind of characterization. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

AB  - The regional head direct election in 2017 is a democratic party that will be implemented by the Jakarta community. But, the present media has its own model in the news which is broadcasted to the public. With the power to build the public opinion, media are capable of directing the votes for political purposes. Referred to Jakarta Head Election Done Jakarta in October 2016 and April 2017 at Media Indonesia.com. In the period of Seven months there are 5 (five) big issues rose in the news. Those are: issues of electability and support, campaign issues and performance, issues of blasphemy, and issues of political promises in campaigns. The research would like to examine the ideology or political interests of media.indonesia.com and okezone.com, also the works of opinion formation happened in public as well as the meanings of the news publication in the framing that is created by the media against the question of politics. This research use the qualitative approach supported by the quantitative analysis.

Van Dijk. As for the quantitative data, a descriptive analysis using SPSS for the 1541 proclamations published by both mediaindonesia.com and okezone.com. From the above description, the hidden message is that mediaindonesia.com tends to support the pair of Basuki Tjahya Purnama (Ahok) and Djarot Saeful Hidayat. It is indicated by the proportion of publication that is mostly 564 news (56.9%) from the total of 991 reportages are covering Basuki Tjahya Purnama (Ahok) and Djarot Saeful Hidayat, mediaindonesia.com tries to legitimize the high electability and support to the pair Basuki Tjahaja Purnama and Djarot Saeful Hidayat by appointing famous figures both among politicians and artists who provide full support for the couple.

AB  - With the increase in the number of mobile applications in the day to day life, it is important to keep track as to which ones are safe and which ones aren’t. One can’t judge how safe and true each application is based only on the reviews that are mentioned for each application. Hence it is a need to keep track and develop a system to make sure the apps present are genuine or not. The objective is to develop a system in detecting fraud apps before the user downloads by using sentimental analysis and data mining. Sentimental analysis is to help in determining the emotional tones behind words which are expressed in online. This method is useful in monitoring social media and helps to get a brief idea of the public’s opinion on certain issues. The user cannot always get correct or true reviews about the product on the internet. We can check for user’s sentimental comments on multiple application. The reviews may be fake or genuine. Analyzing the rating and reviews together involving both user and admins comments, we can determine whether the app is genuine or not. Using sentimental analysis and data mining, the machine is able to learn and analyze the sentiments, emotions about reviews and other texts. The manipulation of review is one of the key aspects of App ranking fraud. By using sentimental analysis and data mining, analyzing reviews and comments can help to determine the correct application for both Android and iOSplatforms. © BEIESP.

AB  - The use of ride-hailing services as a solution to current transportation problems is currently attracting much attention. Their benefits and convenience mean many people use them in their everyday lives and discuss them in the social media. As a result, ride-hailing service providers utilize social media to capture customers' opinions and to market their services. If these opinions and comments are analyzed, service providers can obtain feedback to evaluate their services in order to achieve customer satisfaction. This study combines the text mining approach, in the form of aspect-based sentiment analysis to identify topics in customer opinions and their sentiments, with scoring of ride-hailing service providers in general, and more specifically based on the topics and sentiments. The study analyzes customers' opinions on Twitter of three ride-hailing service providers. Text data were classified based on six topics derived from the topic modeling process, along with the sentiments expressed on them. Scoring of the three ride-hailing service providers was based on the number of positive and negative comments in relation to each topic, as well as overall comments. The results of the study can be used as input to evaluate and improve the service in Indonesia, thus the customer satisfaction and loyalty can be maintained and improved. © IJTech 2019.

AB  - Several studies have recently applied sentiment-based lexicons to Twitter to gauge local sentiment to understand health behaviors and outcomes for local areas. While this research has demonstrated the vast potential of this approach, lingering questions remain regarding the validity of Twitter mining and surveillance in local health research. First, how well does this approach predict health outcomes at very local scales, such as neighborhoods? Second, how robust are the findings garnered from sentiment signals when accounting for spatial effects? To evaluate these questions, we link 2,076,025 tweets from 66,219 distinct users in the city of San Diego over the period of 2014-12-06 to 2017-05-24 to the 500 Cities Project data and 2010–2014 American Community Survey data. We determine how well sentiment predicts self-rated mental health, sleep quality, and heart disease at a census tract level, controlling for neighborhood characteristics and spatial autocorrelation. We find that sentiment is related to some outcomes on its own, but these relationships are not present when controlling for other neighborhood factors. Evaluating our encoding strategy more closely, we discuss the limitations of existing measures of neighborhood sentiment, calling for more attention to how race/ethnicity and socio-economic status play into inferences drawn from such measures. © 2019 Gibbons et al.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss how social psychology might go about studying social hostility in public life that goes beyond mere disagreement on political matters. The paper addresses the case of online misogyny against women active in public life. In the context of a profound coarsening of political debate in Britain and elsewhere, women who are active in public life come regularly up against a barrage of abuse and intimidation online. The paper argues that manifestations of misogyny cross ideological lines and takes an array of forms. Misogyny is a specific class of prejudice that harms the dignity of women by calling into question women's (human) rights to participation in public life, freedom of expression, and personal safety. In order to fully understand the intricacies of online misogyny, social psychologists need to draw upon more directly on communications and media theories of mediated communication and connective action. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - According to the latest report by the World Health Organization, air pollution, one of the planet’s most dangerous environmental carcinogens, has become one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. In China this is a particularly crucial issue, with more than 100 cities and close to one billion individuals threatened by haze due to heavy air pollution in recent years. Beyond traditional channels, the rise of social media has led to greater online haze-related information sharing. Formative research suggests that Weibo is playing a larger role in the process of information seeking than traditional media. Given the severity of haze and the influential role of Weibo, a textual analysis was conducted based on Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) to provide health decision-makers and media consumers knowledge on how environmental health issues such as haze are framed in Chinese social media. Framing theory served to explain the differences across various outlets: People’s Daily, China Daily, and the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal. By analyzing 407 Weibo posts, five major frames emerged: (1) governmental concern, (2) public opinion and issue management, (3) contributing factors and effects, (4) socializing haze-related news, and (5) external haze-related news. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - With the quick penetration of Internet applications, online media have become an important carrier of public opinions. The opinions and comments expressed by young college students-one of the most active netizen groups-on the Internet have turned out to be an essential part of the online public opinions in colleges and universities. However, the existing systems generally employ simple statistical methods to analyze the effect of online public opinions on the image and reputation development of colleges and universities without taking account of other factors, such as the hotness characteristics of online public opinions and semantic information. Therefore, on the basis of Public Opinion Hotness Index and time series-based trend analysis, as well as the topics extracted using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model, this study aims to improve the analysis performance on the online public opinions in colleges and universities using short-term trend prediction results. The experience and lessons learned from a real case may provide strong data support and feasible suggestions for colleges and universities in analyzing and guiding the online public opinions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - With the popularity of crowdfunding, many small- and medium-sized ventures and startups which have insufficient funds advertise and sell their services or products in reward-based crowdfunding markets. The success of crowdfunding projects for sale purposes is therefore beneficial to the sustainable development of these growing enterprises. Based upon goal attainment theory, a research model based on a cost-benefit framework is proposed to analyze consumer purchase intention in reward-based crowdfunding markets. The research model is empirically tested with data collected from 398 participants in China. A structural equation modeling analysis reveal that perceived benefits (price concession and perceived innovation) exert a significant positive impact on perceived net goal attainment (PNGA), whereas perceived costs (transaction cost and performance risk) have a weak negative effect on PNGA. The results also indicate that satisfaction mediates between PNGA and purchase intention. Furthermore, we use an artificial neural network analysis to weigh the relative importance of the antecedents of PNGA. The results suggest that perceived innovation is more important than price concession, which is consistent with the structural equation modeling analysis. These results might deepen our understanding of how consumers trade off costs and benefits in the purchase of crowdfunding products/services. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article shows how education, which is the most important form of activity in the social medium, changes the cultural image and awareness of individuals, and shapes and transforms their political attitude toward the surrounding day-to-day realities. A comparison analysis is used to explore a civic education system that forms the national and state identity of a person as a derivative of an “imagined community.” This phenomenon will be regarded here as the result of designing social and political values and their internalization in the public consciousness. This approach makes it possible to optimize the process of education for the public sphere which is destined to form an active citizen, to create a sustainable link between an individual and the social medium and is the most important tool of political communication. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Every day, people use radiation in various ways without even thinking about it. People may not understand how gamma rays cause doublestrand breaks in DNA, thereby helping treat various cancers; X-rays travel through the human body, hit a detector, and elucidate the structure of bone inside; ultraviolet radiation sent by the sun through the atmosphere warms the Earth and brightens our planet; microwaves send vibrations through water molecules at a resonant frequency and warm up our food; and radio waves carry music and information through the atmosphere, being demodulated at a specific frequency by our car sound systems and playing our favorite songs. For something that is so integral to our daily lives, there is a large disconnect between the wider public?s perception of radiation and scientific knowledge about it, causing undue misperception and fear. In fact, by the nature of democracy and representation, politicians craft policy that aligns with public opinion and responds to public fears-policies that they think will help people and make them feel safe. © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Labor unions play a prominent role in the economy and in politics, and have long been depicted by opponents as an overly powerful, corrupt and economically harmful institution. In labor-related news in recent years, anti-union rhetoric has regularly focused on union workers themselves, frequently portraying them as overpaid, greedy and undeserving of their wealth, while also drawing a contrast between the compensation of union vs. non-union workers. This type of rhetoric is referred to here as class-based anti-union rhetoric (CAR). Despite its prevalence, it remains unknown whether CAR affects public opinion toward unions. This study uses a series of national survey experiments to demonstrate that exposure to CAR reduces the perceived similarity of targeted union workers, unions' perceived deservingness of public support and support for pro-union legislation. Moreover, CAR repeatedly nullified or reversed the otherwise positive relationship between the strength of worker identity and solidarity with union workers. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

AB  - Objective: Dog programs occurring in prison tend to generate positive public opinion and media portrayals, yet they often lack empirical validation. This is the first study to examine the key themes that drive a dog program aimed at incarcerated youth serving time in an adult prison. Design and Sample: A sample of male youth (n = 31) were provided survey questions on a rescue dog program. A grounded qualitative approach was employed with open-ended responses. Results: The following themes emerged: the symbolism of the dog its role in therapy, perceptions of positive behaviors and rehabilitation, a sense of normality, and universal support by inmates. Conclusion: This study supports the potential for utilizing rescue dogs in therapeutic interventions in which the vulnerable inmate can discuss early trauma, interpersonal dysfunction and histories of deviance. The dog symbolized the potential for incarcerated youth to engage in discussion of sensitive topics in a safe manner. Policy implications also include the function of dogs in creating a normalizing effect on the prison unit itself, one that can promote rehabilitation. There was universal support for the program which is rare in the prison milieu. Theoretically, positive outcomes occurred in an indirect manner, though more research is needed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - There have been many surveys of public responses to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), both reported in peer-reviewed journals and in the mainstream media. People anchor their representations of novel technological objects within their existing experience. What elements of such experience anchor AVs? We review academic English language survey studies from 2015 to 2017 and surveys publicised in UK National newspapers which typically reveal discomfort about the prospect of AVs. Against this background we report the results of our own survey of 11,827 drivers across 11 European countries, addressing attitudes to driving alongside AVs as well as to riding in them. We establish a composite indicator of perceptions of AVs that combines responses on using AVs and sharing the road with them, and analyse its relationship with a set of covariate measures. Respondents’ technological optimism and uptake of driving technology was associated with more positive perceptions of AVs, and measures of respondents’ enjoyment of driving, and how ‘sociable’ they were towards fellow road users, was associated with more negative perceptions. The negative association between driving ‘sociability’ and enthusiasm for AVs was attenuated by levels of general technological optimism. We discuss the difficulties in researching public responses to novel technological objects and make suggestions for improvement in future survey research on AVs. © 2019

AB  - Rationale: Individuals living in Scotland's most deprived communities experience a higher burden of morbidity and early mortality than those living in more affluent areas. Experiences of poverty-based stigma may be one psychosocial mechanism through which socioeconomic position influences health, although there is little available data on this issue from a Scottish perspective. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify which aspects of poverty stigma are particularly salient to individuals with lived experience of poverty, and may therefore contribute to health inequalities. Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with 39 individuals with experience of living on low incomes in Scotland in order to explore their experiences and perceptions of poverty stigma. Results: Five main themes were identified, reflecting aspects of poverty stigma operating at various structural, public and individual levels: media representations of poverty; negative encounters with social security systems; perceived public attitudes regarding poverty in Scotland; lowered self-esteem and internalisation of negative attitudes, and; emotional responses to stigma. Conclusion: These dimensions of stigma potentially influence public health and health inequalities in Scotland, although future research will be necessary to quantify these and estimate their relationships with health outcomes. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This study analyses the legal action taken for defamation in the case of the ‘human zoo’, an alleged defamatory portrayal of the Paiwan people, a Taiwanese indigenous group, by Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK. The analysis of this case is presented in two stages, the first of which employs a critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine the covert racist discourse regarding the Paiwan people in a four-episode NHK documentary series on the history of the modernization of Japan. Second, the study evaluates the discursive patterns of the legal documents resulting from the subsequent lawsuits. The analysis incorporates the findings of interviews with key stakeholders in the human zoo case in its investigation of the presence of insidious racial prejudice against the Paiwan people, combined with a lack of sensitivity towards indigenous peoples in general, both in the documentary and in the responses from NHK in the subsequent lawsuits. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A sizable literature finds evidence of public responsiveness to policy change, across a range of salient policy domains and countries. We have a very limited sense for what drives this aggregate-level responsiveness, however. One possibility is that individuals learn at least part of what they need to know from mass media. Work tends to emphasize failures in both media coverage and citizens, but little research explores the prevalence of relevant, accurate information in media content, or citizens’ abilities to identify and respond to that information. Using the case of defense spending in the United States, we examine both, through an automated content analysis of thirty-five years of reporting, validated by a coding exercise fielded to survey respondents. Results prompt analyses of the American National Election Study (ANES), tracing both individual-level perceptions of and preferences for defense spending change over time. These results, supplemented by aggregate analyses of the General Social Survey (GSS), illustrate how media might facilitate—but also confuse—public responsiveness. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective To identify examples of the 'corporate political activity' (CPA) of the industry producing and selling ultra-processed food and drink products (UPP) in Latin America and the Caribbean.Design Searches were conducted on the national websites and social media accounts of large industry actors. Coding was deductive and based on a framework for classifying the CPA of the food industry.Setting Fifteen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Participants Twelve members of the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA) and major trade associations and chambers of commerce in the region.Results During the current pilot study, more than 200 examples of CPA were found in Latin America and the Caribbean. The UPP industry lobbied governments during the development of national health policies. UPP companies tried to build alliances with health professionals, but also with communities where they operated and with policy makers. In addition, the UPP industry fought against regulation in court and proposed weaker alternatives to public health policies, such as self-regulation.Conclusions Food systems in low- and middle-income countries, including in Latin America and the Caribbean, are increasingly penetrated by the UPP industry. These countries are at risk of being influenced by the CPA strategies described in the present study. There is a need to further identify, monitor and evaluate the impact of these CPA strategies on public health policies and public opinion in the region, in order to develop mechanisms to effectively prevent such interference. © The Authors 2019.

AB  - With the explosion of social media, automatic analysis of sentiment and emotion from user-generated content has attracted the attention of many research areas and commercial-marketing domains targeted at studying the social behavior of web users and their public attitudes toward brands, social events, and political actions. Capturing the emotions expressed in the written language could be crucial to support the decision-making processes: the emotion resulting from a tweet or a review about an item could affect the way to advertise or to trade on the web and then to make predictions about future changes in popularity or market behavior. This paper presents an experience with the emotion-based classification of textual data from a social network by using an extended version of the fuzzy C-means algorithm called extension of fuzzy C-means. The algorithm shows interesting results due to its intrinsic fuzzy nature that reflects the human feeling expressed in the text, often composed of a mix of blurred emotions, and at the same time, the benefits of the extended version yield better classification results. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Rape myth acceptance (RMA) demonstrates association with psychopathic traits, traditional gender role norms, and negative attitudes towards women. However, these RMA correlates have rarely been studied in combination, or examined within military populations. The present study investigated RMA, psychopathic traits, attitudes towards women, and male gender role norms using a convenience sample of 85 active and veteran military personnel recruited through social media. As hypothesized, males and females with in the military did not differ in level of RMA. Results revealed significant associations between the Affective and Interpersonal facets of psychopathy and RMA. Hierarchical linear regression models indicated that traditional male norm ideology and Interpersonal psychopathic features significantly predicted RMA. Affective features to also trended in the prediction of RMA. Results suggest that Affective and Interpersonal traits of psychopathy are salient in account for RMA in a military sample. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other-oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Traditional service-learning pedagogy assumes that learning occurs when contact between relatively advantaged students and a relatively disadvantaged service population reduces prejudice. However, little is known about how students whose backgrounds are similar to the populations they serve process this learning experience. This study explores the connections between socioeconomic status and learning trajectories within service-learning. Students provided written reflections on a service-learning experience focused on food insecurity as part of course requirements. Analysis reveals that students with low socioeconomic status (SES) demonstrate different learning processes than medium- and high-SES students. Namely, low-SES students were less likely than high-SES students to hold prejudiced attitudes prior to service, and low-SES students emphasized a systemic understanding of food insecurity and poverty, while medium- and high-SES students were much more likely to emphasize an individualist understanding. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research to improve service-learning pedagogy for students of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. © American Sociological Association 2019.

AB  - A longitudinal study (N = 774) explored the short and longer term impacts of anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans (LGBT) hate crime experienced directly, indirectly, and through the media. In the short term, being a victim (direct) or personally knowing of a hate crime victim (indirect) was positively associated with vulnerability, emotional responses, and behavioral intentions after reading about a hate crime. Direct victims were also less empathic toward other victims and engaged in more victim-blaming. A structural equation model showed direct experiences (via personal vulnerability and empathy) and media experiences (via group-threat and victim-blaming) to be cross-sectionally associated with behavioral intentions. Media experiences also had lasting demobilizing impacts on actual behaviors, again serially mediated by group-threat and victim-blaming. The findings highlight the emotional and behavioral impacts of hate crimes on both direct victims and on the wider LGBT community. They also raise questions about media reporting of hate crimes and the role of victim-blaming. © 2018 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The current study explores how online media framed the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, OH. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of a large sample of online news articles published in the first 48 hours following the event. In doing so, we consider how online media outlets used headlines, narrative, quotes, and images to frame this emerging story. We find that the online news media framed the shooting of Rice in ways that largely supported the official police narrative of the event. Rice was projected as a noncompliant and threatening subject and the police as reacting out of concerns for public safety. Unlike international sources, relatively few domestic news sources linked this incident to the larger issues of race and police use of force in the United States. The dominant frame promotes a moral evaluation of the event that downplays police responsibility and promotes localized, nonsystemic solutions as opposed to wide-spread policing reform. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - On political questions, many people prefer to consult and learn from those whose political views are similar to their own, thus creating a risk of echo chambers or information cocoons. We test whether the tendency to prefer knowledge from the politically like-minded generalizes to domains that have nothing to do with politics, even when evidence indicates that politically like-minded people are less skilled in those domains than people with dissimilar political views. Participants had multiple opportunities to learn about others’ (1) political opinions and (2) ability to categorize geometric shapes. They then decided to whom to turn for advice when solving an incentivized shape categorization task. We find that participants falsely concluded that politically like-minded others were better at categorizing shapes and thus chose to hear from them. Participants were also more influenced by politically like-minded others, even when they had good reason not to be. These results replicate in two independent samples. The findings demonstrate that knowing about others’ political views interferes with the ability to learn about their competency in unrelated tasks, leading to suboptimal information-seeking decisions and errors in judgement. Our findings have implications for political polarization and social learning in the midst of political divisions. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This article presents findings from 41 in-depth interviews with political journalists, media analysts, and public opinion pollsters in the United States. These interviews document several trends in how journalists assess and cover public opinion. The article shows (1) a growing interest in and reliance on polling aggregator websites fueled by demands for precise predictions, (2) the erosion of news organizations’ abilities to assert independent gatekeeping standards around individual poll results, (3) concerns about the level of in-house expertise within newsrooms to adjudicate between surveys, and (4) changing attitudes about the importance of gatekeeping around public opinion data. These findings reflect an increasingly complex landscape of opinion data, which conventional news organizations appear ill-equipped to navigate. © The Author(s) 2017.

On the popular social medium Twitter, people post tweets about airline services and raise concerns about service delays when flights are delayed, canceled, or diverted. Drawing on the literature on legitimacy and the halo effect, we argue that a company’s CSR engagement enhances its corporate image, which in turn, influences WOM about the company on Twitter. We predict and find that airlines with better CSR engagement receive more positive word of mouth (PWOM) and less negative word of mouth (NWOM) on Twitter. We also find that service delays reduce PWOM and increase NWOM, with the additional finding that the positive relationship between service delays and NWOM is less strong for airlines with better CSR engagement. We conduct additional analyses to investigate the effects of environmental, social, and governance CSR on PWOM and NWOM. Our study has practical implications in informing companies about the benefits of CSR engagement in relation to public opinion during service delays. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This article aims to shed new light on the state of populism by looking beyond the substance of recent populist movements to examine their form. I argue that new populism, which is characterized by instantaneousness and simultaneity made possible by social media and other communications technologies, betrays a pathology of instantaneous democracy in its pursuit of unmediated politics at the expense of democratic representation and deliberation. To show how new populism poses a fundamental challenge to constitutional democracy, I first bring the unnoticed double structure of articulated politics at the heart of constitutional democracy to the fore: The structural articulation of distinct stages of decision-making in the multistage process of constitutional governance and that of formal constitutionalized powers and unformed public opinions. As the double structural articulation assumes a temporal gap, first, between each stage of formal decision-making, and, second, between opinion-formation and policy-making, I then discuss how this assumed temporal gap is being virtually obliterated amidst the wave of new populism, shaking the structure of articulated politics to its foundations. In response, I suggest that democratic learning, aided by tactics of judicial deceleration before the figuring out of a grand strategy, is critical in combating new populism. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: HIV/AIDS has emerged as a serious public health issue across the globe, and particularly in developing countries. Comprehensive knowledge and positive attitudes are cornerstones for the prevention, control and treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there are various misconceptions associated with HIV/AIDS transmission, which lead to negative attitudes towards people living with AIDS. The present study aims to explore the effects of these determinants, related to socio-demographic characteristics and autonomy, on women's overall knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS in Pakistan. Methods: Secondary data analysis was carried out using the national representative dataset of the 2012-13 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey. A series of questions related to HIV/AIDS was asked of 13,558 ever-married women aged 15-49 years to assess respondents' knowledge regarding modes of HIV/AIDS transmission and preventative measures, as well as their attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to identify associations with socio-demographic and autonomy-related variables. Furthermore, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between multiple factors and overall HIV/AIDS knowledge as well as attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Results: The results show that only 42% of Pakistani women have heard about HIV/AIDS. Amongst these women, the majority (68%) have good overall knowledge of HIV/AIDS and more than 55% have positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Furthermore, women residing in urban areas, having at least secondary-level education, with high autonomy, belonging to the richest wealth quintile and having exposure to mass media had high overall knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Conclusion: The findings of this research support the relevance of women's autonomy, education and exposure to mass media, particularly in rural areas of Pakistan, to address the lack of knowledge and eliminate various myths and stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, it reveals a need to increase focused and targeted interventions to enhance women's knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. In this regard, the media can play a proactive role to gauge wider audience in creating awareness and eradicating the myths and misconceptions regarding HIV/AIDS. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Tobacco industry denormalization (TID) seeks to expose the industry’s misconducts. Research on TID beliefs, meaning negative attitudes toward the tobacco industry (TI), may inform TID programs, but was limited to western populations. We investigated TID beliefs and their association with smoking and sociodemographic characteristics in Hong Kong adolescents. Methods: In a school-based cross-sectional survey of 14214 students (mean age 15.0 years, 51.5% boys), TID beliefs were assessed by two questions: (1) whether the TI was respectable and (2) whether the TI tried to get youth to smoke, each with four options from “definitely no” to “definitely yes.” Smoking susceptibility and behaviors were also assessed. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, perceived family affluence, highest parental education, numbers of co-residing smokers, and school-level smoking prevalence. Results: Of all students, 77.6% considered theTI not respectable and 56.6% believed that theTI tried to get youth to smoke. StrongerTID beliefs were inversely associated with smoking susceptibility and behaviors. For example, students considering the TI definitely not respectable (vs. definitely yes) were 56% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 45% to 66%), 49% (95% CI = 41% to 56%), and 53% (95% CI = 36% to 65%) less likely to be susceptible to smoking (among never-smokers) and be ever- and current smokers, respectively. Of all correlates examined, only younger age and having no co-residing smoker were associated withTID beliefs. Conclusions: Substantial proportions of Hong Kong adolescents did not holdTID beliefs, but those who did were less likely to smoke. Our results suggest thatTID programs may help reduce adolescent smoking. Implications:TheTI’s misconducts and responsibility for the tobacco epidemic were not well known by Hong Kong adolescents.TID beliefs in this population were inversely associated with smoking. These findings suggest that TID programs in local adolescents may be of value. The investigation into the correlates of TID beliefs found that socioeconomic status and school-level smoking prevalence were not associated with TID beliefs. This suggests that local TID programs targeting adolescents in general, for example, mass-media campaigns, may be more appropriate than those targeting particular schools or selected groups of adolescents. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The 20th and 21st centuries have been marked by a number of traumatic events: With the two World Wars, Korean War and, especially in the last twenty-five years, with conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa, as well as others, vast numbers of people have been displaced and have had to journey far and wide to find not only a new home but a safe haven from the atrocities of war. While discrimination against newcomers to a country, prejudice, racism, nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and authoritarian dictatorships are not new phenomena, what makes the recent reactions to the current worldwide human influxes different is the use of language manipulation, propaganda and hate speech via social media to re-stigmatize and re-traumatize the new refugees, asylumseekers, immigrants and migrants. Social media platforms give everyone the opportunity to express their views, whether positive or negative, about anyone who could be considered the other. Both right-wing and left-wing parties and governments also see the usefulness of using the manipulation of the labels given to newcomers and inciting fear of them for their own agendas. In this paper we will investigate how the use of linguistic labels and stereotyping about the other contribute to the rise of hate speech worldwide and how the presence of hate speech about the newcomers has re-traumatized many refugees who had thought they had reached a safe haven after fleeing the source of their original trauma. For the purpose of this study, we will be using data that primarily refers to Italy and Poland, as well as some other examples. © 2019 Estonian Academy Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluate the reliability and feasibility of weight-adapted ultra-low-dose pancreatic perfusion CT. Methods: A total of 100 (47 men, 53 women) patients were enrolled prospectively and were assigned to five groups (A, B, C, D, and E) with different combination of tube voltage and tube current according to their body weight. Radiation dose parameters including volume CT dose index (CTDI) and dose-length product (DLP) were recorded. Image quality was evaluated both subjectively and objectively (noise, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio). Perfusion parameters including blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability (PMB) were measured. The dose, image quality measurements, and perfusion parameters were compared between the five groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Radiation dose reached 8.7 mSv in patients under 50 kg and was 18.9 mSv in patients above 80 kg. The mean subjective image quality score was above 4.45 on a 5-point scale with good agreement between two radiologists. Groups A–D had equivalent performance on objective image quality (P > 0.05), while Group E performed even better (P < 0.05). No significant differences emerged in comparison with perfusion parameters (BF, BV, PMB) of normal pancreas parenchyma between the five groups. Conclusion: Weight-adapted ultra-low-dose pancreatic perfusion CT can effectively reduce radiation dose without prejudice to image quality, and the perfusion parameters of normal parenchyma are accurate and reliable. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The mass media plays a fundamental role in the formation of public opinion, either by defining the topics of discussion or by making an emphasis on certain issues. Directly or indirectly, people get informed by consuming news from the media. Naturally, two questions appear: What are the dynamics of the agenda and how the people become interested in their different topics? These questions cannot be answered without proper quantitative measures of agenda dynamics and public attention. In this work we study the agenda of newspapers in comparison with public interests by performing topic detection over the news. We define Media Agenda as the distribution of topic's coverage by the newspapers and Public Agenda as the distribution of public interest in the same topic space. We measure agenda diversity as a function of time using the Shannon entropy and differences between agendas using the Jensen–Shannon distance. We found that the Public Agenda is less diverse than the Media Agenda, especially when there is a very attractive topic and the audience naturally focuses only on this one. Using the same methodology we detect coverage bias in newspapers. Finally, it was possible to identify a complex agenda-setting dynamics within a given topic where the least sold newspaper triggered a public debate via a positive feedback mechanism with social networks discussions which install the issue in the Media Agenda. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The public acceptance and implementation of vaccination programs is essential to prevent infectious diseases. However, vaccine adverse events may cause public panic and eventually lead to an increasing number of populations who were hesitant or refuse to participate in these vaccination programs. In 2018, the Changsheng vaccine crisis broke out in mainland China, and 252,600 unqualified DTP vaccines were reported to be used for child vaccination. In this study, we observed media and public reactions toward the vaccine crisis. Methods: This study conducted Internet surveillance by four mainstream indicators from July 15th to August 7th, including social media (WeChat, Sina Weibo), online news and Baidu search index. We also analyzed the emotional perceptions of people in crisis through an online questionnaire survey. Results: During the crisis, huge number of articles emerged on Internet, 125,882,894 articles (including forwarding)on WeChat friends circle, 1,877,660 Sina Weibo posts, 648,265 online news and 4,986,521 Baidu search indexes. Most of these articles were negative and expressed the public's weak confidence to the China-made vaccines. Public confidence in vaccines was undermined by the actions of the manufacturer and the government. Conclusions: The DTP vaccine crisis led to panic about immunization and eroded trust in the immunization program and in the government. Restoring public confidence in Chinese-made vaccines will take a long time, and meticulous management in vaccine production, and strict government regulation will help to alleviate public anxiety about vaccine safety and ultimately restore confidence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Approval in public opinion polling is an important resource for prime ministers in contemporary Japanese politics. Though it is widely agreed that cabinet approval ratings increased in political significance after the electoral reform and the restructuring of government agencies, little attention has been paid to the fact that public opinion polling in the mass media also experienced a transformation during the same period. This article surveys the history of public opinion polling since 1945. It argues that changes in survey methodology enabled newspapers to conduct and report opinion polling quickly and frequently, which has strengthened the link between approval ratings and ongoing political processes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction. Nowadays, a professional image is an important element of the identity of individual professions. Its formation is a difficult process, dependent on many factors, including the use of new communication channels, such as social media, which in recent years have become a space for expressing social opinion, including those concerning individual professions. Aim. The analysis of the possibilities of using social media in shaping the image of nurses on the Internet. Material and methods. The study was carried out using the comparative method. The subject of the research were websites (fanpages) related to the professional environment of nurses on the social networking site Facebook.com, chosen deliberately according to the adopted criteria. Findings. During the research, differences in the strategy of administering the analyzed websites were identified, depending mainly on the subject matter and purpose of publishing the content. The topicality, visual attractiveness and cohesion were characterized by a high level. The posts appearing on individual websites were written in the language of the recipients, with different publication frequency. The websites created a long-term group of recipients and tried to influence the image of nursing in Poland in a positive way. Conclusions. Content published on social media can affect both the positive and negative image of the nurse in the public opinion. Among the factors that do not affect the image of nurses can be indicated, among others, offensive language of comments and displaying negative traits of nurses. Positive reception guarantees current knowledge in the field of nursing and emphasizing professional competences. © 2019 Piotr Pawłowski et al., published by Sciendo 2019.

AB  - Many argue that paying people for good behavior can crowd out beneficial motivations like altruism. But little is known about how financial incentives interact with harmful motivations like racial bias. Two randomized vignette studies test how financial incentives affect bias. The first experiment varies the race of a hypothetical patient in need of a kidney transplant (black or white), an incentive ($18,500 or none), and addition of a message appealing to altruism. Incentives encouraged donation but introduced a significant bias favoring white patients. The second experiment assesses willingness to donate to a patient (black or white) without an incentive and then introduces incentives varying in size ($3,000, $18,800, or $50,000) and source (charity, government, or patient’s own funds). Incentives encouraged donation but were significantly more effective in encouraging donation to white patients. Biasing effects are most pronounced for medium-sized incentives. Incentives may have an inadvertent biasing effect for altruistic behavior. © 2019 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

AB  - In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This article examines voters' reactions to news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters' perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - People use twitter as a medium to share their opinions, which in turn makes it a platform for analyzing public opinion. This kind of information in various fields can be used for further analysis. Text mining is used for classifying tweets into negative and positive statements depending on their purpose. Text messages are used to define mind set of large groups of people. From perspective of decision makers, precious information is provided by collection of text messages. In this paper, we use data collected from twitter and extract useful data from it using data mining tools. The results is represented as decision trees and this can be used to make further analysis or used to take decision for analyst. Here we evaluate or analyze the impact of tweets by using emotic icons for process. © BEIESP.

AB  - Technological developments, especially on social media, allow online news readers to channel their opinions in the form of comments and reactions. Opinions given by readers are a great source of data that can be processed for the emotions of readers. This paper intends to classify emotions by comparing two classifiers, namely Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The dataset used in this study was taken f rom Indonesian online news detik.com which has eight class emotion. This study has several experimental scenarios that is a combination of total comment and ratio. Because of the imbalance class data, this study uses the SMOTE oversampling technique. This study also shows that the use of SMOTE oversampling can improve classifier performance. The results of this study show that the accuracy achieved 55.43% for the Naive Bayes classifier and 65.95% for the Logistic Regression classifier after SMOTE. It can increase the accuracy up to 35%. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, it is the consumer journalism era in which the media consumers have effects on articles by actively suggesting their opinions, based on the technical development. Under this circumstance, this study aimed to provide a new method in which VR(Virtual Reality) consumes the media, and also to verify the possibility of becoming a new place for communication. Methods/Statistical analysis: Targeting total 40 ordinary people in Seoul, an experiment was conducted in four situations(wearing of HMD vs non-wearing*checking of chatting room vs no checking). The subjects were asked to fill out the questionnaire after reading all the article and chatting, and based on the results, the differences in the evaluation of the article between experimental group and control group were verified by using the one-way ANOVA. Findings: In the results of the experiment, the chatting with residents had effects on the evaluation of the article while the matter of wearing HMD did not show the moderating effects. In other words, in case of being exposed to opinions against the contents of the article, the news consumers would have more negative perception of the article. However, the matter of wearing HMD did not mediate the effects of other users' opinions on the attitude toward the article in VR. Improvements/Applications: The possibility of changes in the media use pattern could be suggested to media consumers. And the possibility of creating the new business models through the two-way communication of news could be suggested to the press. Also, to the policy makers and marketers, the opinions of VR could be used as a barometer for understanding the public opinion of consumers and people. © BEIESP.

AB  - Objectives This study used thematic content analysis to examine submissions to a youth mental health website, www.itsoktotalk.in, in India. Setting We considered submissions made to the It's OK to Talk web platform during the first year of its operation (April 2017-March 2018), focusing specifically on website users based in India. Participants We analysed 37 submissions by 33 authors aged 19-31 years (mean age 22 years) from seven Indian cities (New Delhi, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Haryana). Eligible submissions were English-language first-person accounts of self-identified mental health problems, submitted in any media format for online publication by authors aged 18 years or older and who were based in India. Eight study participants were additionally involved in a focus group who contributed to the coding process and preparation of the final manuscript. Results Four themes were identified: (1) living through difficulties; (2) mental health in context; (3) managing one's mental health and (4) breaking stigma and sharing hope. Overall, the participants expressed significant feelings of distress and hopelessness as a result of their mental health problems; many described the context of their difficulties as resulting from personal histories or wider societal factors; a general lack of understanding about mental health; and widespread stigma and other negative attitudes. Most participants expressed a desire to overcome mental health prejudice and discrimination. Conclusions Personal narratives offer a window into young people's self-identified priorities and challenges related to mental health problems and recovery. Such insights can inform antistigma initiatives and other public awareness activities around youth mental health. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - The Social media has emerged as the most powerful tool to form public opinion on widespread issues. Presently topic on climate change and its impact on natural resources has gained significant interest in online discourse among social media users. With this shallow view on climate change, there is a possibility that its social impacts, for instance gender differentiated impacts of climate change, may become marginalized in online discourse. Besides this, other potential reasons for limited global discourse on social impacts of climate change, inter alia, are meagre role of civil society in global environmental governance, excessive media coverage on the observable destructs and prevailing gender inequalities in the society. The purpose of this research is to examine the status quo on how communities engages in an online discourse associating gender and climate change. To this end, we use keyword-based query method to extract twitter datasets and apply community engagement model to explore parameters such as demographics, geographic coverage, popular mentions, influential authors, popular hashtags and views expressed. The findings reveal varying degree of community engagement and suggests (a) the need for extensive online awareness campaigns (b) higher participation of male alongside female, mostly youths to sensitize gender issues in climate change (c) launching of official hashtags (d) exploiting organization and media outlets (e) strategies to target online campaigns in the climate vulnerable regions. This research contributed by giving future directions on generating online community engagement policies to create awareness on the social impacts of climate change, in particular, to the gender differentiated impacts. © BEIESP.

AB  - Public attitude surveys are the prime method used to assess public attitudes to science and technology, but can also be very problematic—as evidenced in the number of different polls that come up with different findings. Toward better understanding of what drives public attitudes, it has become more relevant to find out “Why” people think what they do about science and technology than to know “What” they think. Recent research into how values drive attitudes has been very important to our increased understanding. However, in a post-truth, post-trust, post-expert world—where notions of truth, trust, and expertise are now commonly contested—we need to also better understand the social and media environments we are now living in, and how they affect attitudes to new technologies. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objectives On 1 May 2018 minimum unit pricing (MUP) of alcohol was introduced in Scotland. This study used Twitter posts to quantify sentiment expressed online during the introduction of MUP, conducted a thematic analysis of these perceptions and analysed which Twitter users were associated with which particular sentiments. Design and setting This qualitative social media analysis captured all tweets relating to MUP during the 2 weeks after the introduction of the policy. These tweets were assessed using a mixture of human and machine coding for relevance, sentiment and source. A thematic analysis was conducted. Participants 74 639 tweets were collected over 14 days. Of these 53 574 were relevant to MUP. Results Study findings demonstrate that opinion on the introduction of MUP in Scotland was somewhat divided, as far as is discernible on Twitter, with a slightly higher proportion of positive posts (35%) than negative posts (28%), with positive sentiment stronger in Scotland itself. Furthermore, 55% of positive tweets/retweets were originally made by health or alcohol policy-related individuals or organisations. Thematic analysis of tweets showed some evidence of misunderstanding around policy issues. Conclusions It is possible to appreciate the divided nature of public opinion on the introduction of MUP in Scotland using Twitter, the nature of the sentiment around it and the key actors involved. It will be possible to later study how this changes when the policy becomes more established. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze tweets concerning asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: Approximately 40,000 tweets containing asthma or COPD were analyzed. Lexical analysis ranked terms and domains of interest, compared COPD with asthma tweets, evaluated co-occurrence of terms within tweets, and assessed differences by source (personal, institutional, or retweet). The frequency of indicator terms relevant to occupational health was determined. Results: Many tweets address community pollution and effects on children, but there is much less interest in work-related factors and occupational regulatory agencies. Environment is considered much more relevant for asthma than COPD. Conclusion: Although epidemiologic studies demonstrate a major burden of occupational factors upon both diseases, significantly improved outreach is needed to overcome inadequate public interest. Social media represent a valuable resource for assessing perceptions about work-related disease and potentially discovering new associations. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - We used the corporate social responsibility (CSR) data from Hexun Finance to analyze the three channels of market investor evaluation in the process of Chinese listed companies' mergers and acquisitions (M & A). We found that: (1) because many CSR behaviors of Chinese listed companies are passive, driven by the environment, government, and regulatory authority, rather than proactive CSR for the long-term interests of the company, Chinese market investors are not concerned with the CSR performance of acquirers before the merger; (2) because passive CSR behavior cannot change the system risk and heterogeneity risk of the acquirers, CSR has no effect on the investor evaluation at the acquirer merger; (3) passive CSR can be used to evaluate public opinion, but CSR cannot change the market concerns of investors because investors only consider the systemic risks and heterogeneity rather than the social media evaluation of the company when pricing; and (4) with further study of the integration effect of CSR after M & A, we found that CSR does not reduce the M & A premium, only increases the return on asset (ROA) of the company within one year after M & A, and does not improve the company's ROA for a long time. Our conclusions help explain why Chinese financial market investors are not concerned with the CSR performance of the M & A party prior to M & A. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Topics related to ethical issues in agricultural production, particularly farm animal welfare, are increasingly featured in mainstream news media. Media representations of farm animal welfare issues are important because the media is a significant source of information, but also because the way that the issues are represented, or framed, defines these issues in particular ways, suggests causes or solutions, and provides moral evaluations. As such, analysis of media frames can reveal how issues are being made public and identify the cues that audiences are given to help them make sense of complex ethical issues. Previous research on media frames and animal welfare has tended to focus on single issues or events; however we sought to identify whether media frames extended across different farm animal welfare-related issues to investigate whether there is any commonality between issues. We analysed articles published in the mainstream press in Australia between 2014 and 2016 related to farm animal welfare, and identified two dominant frames: that governments and the farm animal production industries cannot be trusted to ensure good farm animal welfare; and that consumers can act to improve animal welfare through ethical consumption. These frames have implications for how the Australian public interpret and understand the roles and responsibilities of different actors in the food production system. This research also contributes to discussion about the role of the media in shaping public opinion about ethical issues in agriculture and how, in turn, the media landscape itself is being shaped by consumer attitudes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has developed into a complex and formidable commercial, sociocultural and political force in Australia, and given its influence, it is a relevant subject for scholars, health practitioners, health communicators, journalists, policy-makers, and consumers of healthcare products and services. This research will consider a relative newcomer to the claims-making space about CAM in the Australian health media-scape; the Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM), an activist group of medical practitioners, researchers, and scientists, founded in late 2011. Using content analysis supported by NVivo, I searched for articles specifically referring to FSM and measured the patterns and frequencies of media frames, intonation and sources that are featured in Australian mainstream news reports between December 2011 and April 2017. The negative headlining and intonation of reports predominated, along with framing CAM as part of a lucrative, undisciplined and unethical industry as well as an illegitimate healthcare approach, more broadly. The findings offer insight into how journalists respond, replicate or reconstruct the framings that are provided by an influential and elite group of medical practitioners and scientists, and readdresses issues surrounding the need for more critical health reporting in Australia. © 2019 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness

AB  - This article examines the role of user comments in evaluating the climate of public opinion. It aims to evaluate the relevance of quasi-statistical assessment of public opinion – which was tailored to traditional media – to the digital era. The article, based on 21 interviews with Israeli users of news websites, argues that comments-browsing on the Internet gives a new meaning to the notion of a quasi-statistical assessment of public opinion. The aggregation of different comments, each of which contains an implicit cue for the climate of public opinion, transforms them together into a direct cue. The effect of the merging of journalistic contents with user-generated contents side-by-side on the same website is also evaluated through the perspectives of persuasive press inference and exemplification theories. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Conventional e-government has many practical infrastructure development and implementation challenges. The recent surge of SMAC (Social media, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud) technologies re-defines the e-governance ecosystem. Cloud-based e-governance has numerous operational challenges which range from development to implementation. Moreover, the contemplation and vocalization of public opinion about any government initiative is quintessential to be cognizant of how citizens perceives and get benefitted from cloud/fog enabled governance. This research puts forward a semantic knowledge model for investigating public opinion towards adaption of fog enabled services for governance and comprehending the significance of two s-components (sentic and social) in aforesaid structure that specifically visualize fog enabled Sentic-Social Governance. The results using conventional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction are empirically compared with ontology driven TF-IDF feature extraction to find the best opinion mining model with optimal accuracy. The results depict that the implementation of ontology driven opinion mining for feature extraction in polarity classification outperforms the traditional TF-IDF method validated over baseline supervised learning algorithms. An average of 7.3% improvement in accuracy and approximately 38% reduction in features has been reported. © 2019 SCPE.

AB  - There is widespread anxiety and speculation about RF-EMF emissions by telecommunication base stations and structures, as it is perceived by some to be unsafe and a threat to public health. Scientists, medical experts, politicians, journalists, and mobile telecommunication company specialists are involved in an active debate on whether people are immune to RF or if we are gambling with our future. Interviews with 31 individuals from 7 stakeholder groups in Malaysia reveal that the residents' main concerns are that the telecommunication companies do not follow guidelines and as a result the telecommunication structures are constructed close to their homes, which they perceive as a threat to public health. Some residents also do not want these structures because of cultural reasons, while some are jealous over rental income received by the landlords. Meanwhile, the authorities entrusted with safe-guarding public health are involved in a blame game as there is no agency that is clearly in charge. The interviews also highlight that the current risk communication initiatives are more reactive rather than proactive, and that the authorities do not speak in one voice. Based on the outcome of the interviews, eleven recommendations are formulated to improve risk communication initiatives in Malaysia. The recommendations stress on repairing, building, and strengthening trust, because trust in agencies, along with credibility, determines risk communication initiatives' effectiveness. These strategies can also be effectively replicated across regions to deal with contestations over RF-EMF emissions and the impact on health. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Introduction: The stigma of epilepsy continues to negatively impact people with epilepsy (PWE) in many Arab Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia. Socioreligious, cultural, and philosophical ideas prevalent in the region may contribute to the underpinnings of stigma toward PWE, but this has not been sufficiently studied. Materials and methods: This study recruited a convenience sample of people without epilepsy from clinic waiting rooms and through social media. Participants completed a questionnaire with questions about demographics, mind–body dualism (MBD), supernatural beliefs (SB), attitudes toward epilepsy (ATE), and religiosity. Results: A total of 210 participants were recruited. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant difference in the mean total ATE scores, indicating better ATE with higher education (p < 0.001). Despite the relatively high level of education and a high proportion of participants with medical training, only slightly more than half rejected the possibility that demonic possession may be a cause of epilepsy. Attitudes toward epilepsy were correlated with MDB and SB but not with religiosity. Mind–body dualism and religiosity correlated significantly with negative attitudes toward PWE (p < 0.05). A linear regression model using ATE as the dependent variable and MDB, SB, and educational level as independent variables significantly predicted ATE (F = 15.6, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.24), although SB dropped out as a predictor of ATE in that model. Another regression used SB as the dependent variable, and MBD, religiosity, and educational level as independent variables were also significant with all three variables predicting SB (F = 64.0, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Mind–body dualism was related to the cognitive process leading to supernatural misconceptions about epilepsy and negative attitudes toward PWE in Saudi Arabia. Although misconceptions that supernatural possession was the cause of epilepsy (justifying treatment by religious healing) and was likely derived from prevalent religious beliefs of the region, religiosity was not associated with negative attitudes toward PWE. The merits and efficacy of an intervention focused on reducing the negative effects of MBD and SB on ATE warrants further investigation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Although negative news portrayals can influence attitudes and beliefs about immigrants, little is known about how different types of threat narratives influence Americans’ emotions and perceptions of Latino immigrants specifically. This study examines cognitive and emotional responses to Latino threat narratives in the news media. Method: We conducted an online experiment using a posttest-only randomized design to assess participants’ perceptions of Latino immigrants and their emotional responses to threat narratives in news media. Participants (N = 208) were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In one experimental group, participants (n = 68) read a news story about Latino immigrants as economic threats; in the other, participants (n = 70) read a news article about Latino immigrants as cultural threats. In the control group, participants (n = 70) read an article that did not implicate Latinos as threats. We used ANCOVA to test mean differences in responses to threat narratives across the experimental and control groups. Results: Participants who read the story about a Latino economic threat reported more intense negative emotions and significantly higher levels of perceived realistic threats from Latino immigrants than participants in the control group. Participants who read the article discussing a Latino cultural threat reported more intense positive emotions and significantly higher levels of perceived symbolic threats from Latino immigrants than the control group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that different types of Latino threat narratives have distinct influences on individuals’ emotions and threat perceptions of Latino immigrants. Implications for social work practice are discussed. © 2019 by the Society for Social Work and Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the importance of examining how adolescents and young adults contribute solutions to society's pressing problems, gaps in the literature leave unanswered the question of how young people become politically engaged. Research suggests that youth learn to be political by forming attachments to their communities and accessing opportunities in the settings of their everyday lives. Settings operate as mini-polities through which youth develop a sense of what it means to be a member of a collective. Meaningful opportunities to practice political skills and behaviors can be fostered in schools and communities, via social media, and through policy change. Historic events, particularly elections, can also influence political attitudes and behaviors in lasting ways. Cultural and contextual variability in experiences, access to opportunities, and reactions to historic events shape youth's political developmental pathways. Research that is developmentally and culturally informed and that uses rigorous study designs can identify more effectively what determines the formation and growth of youth political engagement. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - In an attempt to improve organ donation rates, some countries are considering moving from “opt-in” systems where citizens must express their willingness to be an organ donor, to “opt-out” systems where consent is presumed unless individuals have expressed their wishes otherwise, by, for example, joining an “opt-out” register. In Wales—a part of the United Kingdom—the devolved government recently legislated for an “opt-out” system. For the change to be effective, a public awareness campaign was critical to the policy's success. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we explored media coverage of the change to better understand the relationship between the state, policy actors, media and the public when such policy changes take place. Our findings illustrate how a state communication campaign can effectively set the media agenda within which we saw a degree of interdependency created with the state using the media to promote policy, and the media relying on the state for credible information. Yet we also found that the media is not uncritical and observed how it uses its autonomy to influence policy setting. Over the period of study, we found that a change in tone and view towards deemed consent organ donation has taken place in the media. However, while this may influence or reflect public attitudes, it is yet to be seen whether the media campaign translates into behavioural change that will result in increases in organ donations. © 2019 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Understanding how exposure and information affect public attitudes towards returning large carnivores in Europe is critical for human-carnivore coexistence, especially for developing efficient and de-escalating communication strategies. The ongoing recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Germany provides a unique opportunity to test the role of different information sources and trust on people's attitudes towards wolves. We conducted a phone survey (n = 1250) and compared country-wide attitudes towards wolves with attitudes in a specific region where wolves initially recolonized and have been present since 2000. In particular, we investigate the relationship between information sources, trust and people's attitudes while accounting for factors like knowledge, exposure and socio-cultural determinants of respondents. We found significant differences in attitudes and knowledge about wolves as well as in the use and frequency of information sources between the two population samples. Higher knowledge, information from books and films, science-based information, and higher trust in information sources related positively with positive attitudes towards wolves. Comparatively, information from press or TV news was associated with more negative attitudes. Providing science-based information to the public and building trust in information is likely to be one measure, among others, to dampen extreme attitudes and improve people's appreciation of costs and benefits of human-carnivore coexistence. Management of conflictual situations emerging from large carnivore recolonization in Europe and beyond should consider incorporating assessments of people's use of and trust in information in addition to existing tools to pave new ways for constructive human-carnivore coexistence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the last two decades, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender + elderly people in Argentina have experienced considerable transformations with respect to social policies and laws as well as in the media and public opinion. This article aims to analyze the levels of acceptance and expression of identity (“coming out”) in lesbian and gay seniors based on the political and legal changes that have occurred in Argentina but also in their relationship with others. Focus groups were conducted with 10 older gay and 10 older lesbians. The results indicate that sociocultural changes are seen as something positive although doubts arise about the in-depth and authenticity of the changes. The same-sex marriage and gender identity laws are considered as a symbol of an era of greater tolerance and diversity in which they have achieved the exercise of their rights as citizens. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Public perception of whom to blame for health care costs varies. Whether there is a mismatch between the causes of rising health care costs and the blame attributed to potential culprits has emerged as a topic of debate. We sought to compare the allocation of blame for rising health care costs in lay media articles and academic literature with actual health care spending in the United States. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional systematic analysis of published lay media and academic articles. On April 10, 2018, 200 PubMed (academic) and 200 Google News (lay media) articles were collected through searches using the terms “healthcare costs” and “health care costs.” Articles were included if they criticized high cost of health care in the US. We calculated descriptive statistics for area(s) of health care blamed for high costs, publication type, and primary author affiliation. Results: PubMed articles named 47 potential drivers of high cost and Google News articles named 225. Among PubMed articles, environment, lifestyle, and medical problems (n = 15/47; 32%) were the most commonly cited source of high cost of health care, followed by ‘no group singled out’ (n = 14/47; 30%), and drugs or devices (n = 8/47; 17%). Among Google News articles, insurers (n = 63/225; 28%) were most commonly cited as possible sources of high cost of health care, followed by ‘no group singled out’ (n = 46/225; 21%) and hospitals (n = 37/225; 17%). Conclusions: Allocation of blame for high health care costs is not always in proportion with true health care spending, and certain health care drivers are under- and overrepresented by academic and lay media publications. © 2019

AB  - Introduction: Given increasing efforts to regulate e-cigarettes, it is important to understand factors associated with support for tobacco regulatory policies. We investigate such factors found in social media and hypothesize that greater online engagement with tobacco content would be associated with less support for e-cigarette regulatory policies. Methods: We constructed social networks of Twitter users who tweet about tobacco and categorized them using a combination of social network and Twitter metrics. Twitter users were identified as representing leaders, followers or general users in online discussions of tobacco products, and invited to complete an online survey. Participants responded to questions about their engagement with tobacco-related content online, degree of support for e-cigarette regulations, exposure to tobacco marketing, e-cigarette use and other demographic information. We examined links between their reported engagement with tobacco-related content and support for e-cigarette regulatory policies using structural equation modelling. Results: The analytic sample consisted of 470 participants. The conceptualized structural equation model had a good fit (χ2 (32) = 24.85, p = 0.09, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03). Findings support our hypothesis: engagement with online tobacco content was negatively associated with support for e-cigarette policies, while controlling for e-cigarette use, tobacco marketing exposure, social media use frequency and demographic factors. Conclusions: Findings suggest that our hypothesis was supported. Twitter users engaging with tobacco-related content and harboring negative attitudes toward e-cigarette regulatory policies could be an important audience segment to reach with tailored e-cigarette policy education messages. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Research shows that both entertainment and news media coverage of Islam and Muslims generate anti-Muslim attitudes in the wider U.S. public. In this article, I explore how this media trend shaped Taqwacore punks’ struggle to define what it means to be American, Muslim, and punk rock on their own terms. Upon their first U.S. tour, Taqwacore started getting the attention of both independent and mainstream media outlets. Taqwacores initially welcomed this because it helped them expand their audience to other (potential) Taqwacores as well as to a larger non-Muslim public. Their perspective changed, however, as they started to realize that most mainstream media stories were turning their punk protest into sensationalist stories about Americanized “Muslim punks” who oppose Islamic conventions. It was around this time that Taqwacores began imagining their audience as either with them or against them, enemies or allies. This study shows how this understanding of their audience shaped an internal dispute among Taqwacores about whether or not to identify as “Muslim punk.” Findings reveal that their internal debate over the Muslim punk label is structured by a racist media frame that defines Muslims as either good or bad, with or against the United States. © The Southern Sociological Society 2018.

AB  - Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face negative consequences linked to prejudice, including homelessness and violence. One medium that perpetuates prejudice toward TGNC individuals is our choice in language. Biased language is related to prejudiced attitudes. Use of gender-inclusive language, however, promotes gender equality. Previous research has examined gender-inclusive language use regarding cisgender men and women, but little work has focused on gender-inclusive language use regarding TGNC individuals. Two studies explored the connections between attitudes toward transgender individuals and perceptions of TGNC-inclusive language. Three hierarchical linear regressions and a mini meta-analysis were conducted. Results suggest that people with negative attitudes toward transgender individuals perceive greater difficulty in using gender-inclusive language. These findings suggest that inclusive language use may be indicative of more positive attitudes. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The widespread view that the refugee crisis has sparked unprecedented levels of European Union politicisation has rarely been backed by systematic empirical evidence. We investigate this claim using a novel dataset of several thousand user comments posted below articles of German regional media outlets on Facebook. Despite considerable European Union authority in the policy area, extensive media coverage of the crisis and the rise of a populist party in Germany, our results suggest that the politicisation of Europe remains low among social media users, especially when compared to national and subnational levels of governance. When talking about Europe, users hardly refer to European Union institutions or policies. Instead, other member states and notions of the geographic or cultural space dominate the debate. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Informed by the third-person effect hypothesis, this study used a survey of 1,060 Chinese university students to analyze the impact of anti-corruption news on Chinese audiences’ attitudes and political participation. This study found that university students tended to think the influence of anti-corruption news on others was greater than on themselves. In addition, issue involvement and new media attention to such news were found to reduce the self-other perceptual gap. Furthermore, the perceived effects of such news on self were positively associated with supportive attitude toward the anti-corruption policies. Meanwhile, perceived effects on others were negatively related to respondents’ political participation. © 2018 AEJMC.

AB  - A growing literature documents racial disparities throughout the American criminal justice system. Yet, even as this evidence accumulates and garners increasing media attention, we know relatively little about the consequences of this type of information for public opinion. We incorporate insights from attribution theory to suggest that people differ in the cause they attribute to racial disparities in the justice system, and these different causal attributions profoundly affect attitudes and responses to information. Using two survey experiments, we find that attributions for the cause of racial disparities in pulled-over rates have a substantial impact on trust in police, and perhaps more importantly, alter susceptibility to persuasion and attitude change. Learning about racial disparities in pulled-over rates reduces trust in police, but only for predictable subsets of the citizenry. © 2018 University of Utah.

AB  - An examination of a Crime Stoppers initiative – a weekly page published in a major city-based tabloid newspaper – afforded a rare glimpse into this understudied global entity. It also offered a means of reflecting on the co-option of CCTV images; partnerships between police, media organisations, and diverse publics; and the harnessing of citizen labour in a culture of surveillance. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the images, accompanying texts, and rhetoric of this feature page for a two-year period. From a media criminology perspective, the portrayals underscore the abrogation of the presumption of innocence, a focus on mundane property offences, with the potential to exacerbate fear of crime and to engender more punitive public attitudes. From a conceptual frame, this article proffers the notion of surveil-labour where the repurposing of CCTV data in the context of a Crime Stoppers scheme reinforces an alliance of police, media, and the public to enhance an infrastructure of informing. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the public opinion on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) on Twitter. Using Twitter Application Program Interface (API), we collected the tweets containing the hashtags #CommonCore and #CCSS for 12 months from 2014 to 2015. A Common Core corpus was created by compiling all the collected 660,051 tweets. The results of sentiment analysis suggest Twitter users expressed overwhelmingly negative sentiment toward the CCSS in all 50 states. Five topic clusters were detected by cluster analysis of the hashtag co-occurrence network. We also found that most of the opinion leaders were those who expressed negative sentiment toward the CCSS on Twitter. This study for the first time demonstrates how text mining techniques can be applied to education policy research, laying the foundation for real-time analytics of public opinion on education policies, thereby informing policymaking and implementation. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Background: Increasing access to hormonal contraception reduces unintended pregnancies. One strategy gaining momentum is allowing patients to access hormonal contraception directly from pharmacists. Commentary on online news articles provides a naturalistic and real-time data source to assess public perceptions on timely and often controversial issues. Objective: Characterize public perceptions of pharmacist-prescribed self-administered non-emergency hormonal contraception using comments posted in response to online news articles. Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional, mixed methods analysis of public comments posted in response to articles published by major media outlets between January 1 to December 31, 2015 on pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception. Comments were then extracted and reviewed through a two-step process to identify emerging themes using a thematic analysis. Results: A total of 1060 public online comments were collected from eight articles. Of these, 757 comments (71.4%) were not related to pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception. Thematic analysis of the 303 relevant comments (28.6%) identified three overarching messages. First, a wide variety of reasons for how pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception improves healthcare and/or supports patient preferences were cited, but there was no consensus on the primary vantage. Second, individuals have varying opinions about the role of the pharmacist which creates both opportunities and challenges for pharmacist-prescribed hormonal contraception. Third, practical and logistical considerations will need to be addressed by healthcare systems, pharmacies, and payers prior to and alongside implementation. Conclusion: Commenters were generally positive and cited several benefits, such as increasing access to healthcare, reducing unintended pregnancies, and supporting individual autonomy. However, it was acknowledged that these benefits would need to be balanced with potential safety concerns and logistical issues associated with delivering clinical services in a community pharmacy setting. Study results can help understand public concerns and may be useful in addressing barriers hindering public acceptance of expanded pharmacist roles. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite a near unanimous agreement that human trafficking is a morally reprehensible practice, there is confusion around what qualifies as human trafficking in the United States. Adopting a mixed-method strategy, we examine how human trafficking is defined by the public; how contemporary (mis)understanding of human trafficking developed; and the public opinion consequence of this (mis)understanding. The definition of human trafficking has evolved over time to become nearly synonymous with slavery; however, we demonstrate that media and anti-trafficking organisations have been focussing their attention on the sexual exploitation of foreign women. We show that general public opinion reflects this skewed attention; the average citizen equates human trafficking with the smuggling of women for sexual slavery. Using a survey experiment, we find that shining light on other facets of human trafficking - the fact that human trafficking is a security problem and a domestic issue - can increase public response to the issue. © Cambridge University Press, 2018.

AB  - Background: Public health policy is inevitably associated with either a strong presence or lack of public support. We investigated factors associated with both the public support of and opposition to health taxes and the media regulation regarding advertising harmful products in Korea. Methods: We interviewed 1200 respondents that were recruited using an equal-probability sampling method in accordance with the 2016 Korean census. Our investigation examined the extent of support and opposition towards health taxes and the media regulation of advertising that targets the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods according to socioeconomic characteristics, health habits, body mass index (BMI), and exposure to the advertising of harmful products. The study was conducted using a univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Results: The majority (71.8%) of the respondents were supportive of imposing health taxes in general. Despite a high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol consumption among the respondents, they strongly supported media regulation of tobacco (72.3%), alcohol (63.7%), and eating broadcasts (51.9%) food advertising (44.0%). Those that were non-smokers, earned a high-income, were married, or had a child were likely to support at least one kind of regulation regarding alcohol and smoking related advertising. An exposure to excessive advertising of unhealthy products was associated with increase of respondents supporting the media regulation. Those who regarded the media as being influential seemed to be more supportive of health taxes or media regulation. Conclusion: Our results indicated strong public support among the respondents for health taxes and the media regulation regarding the advertising of unhealthy products. Based on our data, we are optimistic that countries whose population show a high rate of tobacco, alcohol or unhealthy food consumption may launch public policy in addressing these factors. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - As the overdose crisis in North America continues to deepen, public health leaders find themselves responding to sensational media stories, many of which carry forms and themes that mark them as urban legends. This article analyzes one set of media accounts - stories of misuse of naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote distributed to people who use drugs - through the lens of social science scholarship on urban legends. We suggest that these stories have met a public need to feel a sense of safety in uncertain times, but function to reinforce societal views of people who use drugs as undeserving of support and resources. Our field has a duty to speak out in favour of evidence-based programs that support the health of people who use drugs, but the optimal communication strategies are not always clear. Drawing attention to the functions and consequences of urban legends can help frame public health communication in a way that responds to needs without reinforcing prejudices, with application beyond naloxone to the other urban legends that continue to emerge in response to this crisis. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Finfish net-pen aquaculture in Canada is an important economic industry that supports coastal rural livelihoods. However, aquaculture development faces several types of barriers, including technological, environmental, regulatory, and social. Public perceptions linked to the aforementioned barriers have largely influenced aquaculture development in Canada, where maintaining social acceptance and public trust have been an enduring challenge. Since the media is important for spreading information and shaping public opinion, this study explored how media defines aquaculture to better understand the public discourse and implications for policy. Using qualitative and quantitative content analysis to explore the coverage of major Canadian newspapers in 2015 and 2016, we found a complex discourse expressing a range of aquaculture attributes and stakeholders. Our results indicate that media frames finfish net-pen aquaculture in a mostly negative tone, although there are considerable regional variabilities and differences across specific attributes. Risk-oriented frames focused on environmental challenges and management responses, while positive aspects surrounded scientific and technological advances and economic benefits. Complex interactions between environmental, social, economic, and management attributes further emphasizes the multi-faceted nature of the public discourse surrounding finfish aquaculture in Canada. Media relied not only on environmental groups or scientists in their reporting, but also considerably on fish farmers and government to offer expert opinions or as proponents of the industry. This supports a shift away from an ‘elitist’ role of the media, towards a more ‘deliberative’ role of balancing perspectives and democratic dialogue. These findings have implications for private and public responses and highlight the need for interdisciplinary solutions that emphasize transparency, communication, and accountability to improve public trust and guide sector development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - American newsrooms are adopting social media as an innovation for greater engagement. However, several organizational and individual factors may affect the extent to which news outlets adopt social media innovations. In particular, there is assumed to be a divide among different age groups of journalists in embracing social media. Utilizing a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, the study seeks to understand how social media culture in newsrooms affects journalists’ strategies of taking social media as an innovation, and how journalists of different age groups differ in the SEM model fit. The analyses indicated Twitter engagement mediates social media culture and journalists’ attitude toward social media. However, that was not the case with Facebook. Additionally, while younger journalists favored Twitter, older journalists embraced Facebook and middle-aged journalists adopted both Facebook and Twitter. The analyses showed the more that middle-aged journalists interacted on Twitter, the more they tended to have a positive attitude toward social media. However, the more that younger and older journalists engaged on Twitter, the more they tended to have a negative attitude toward social media. Journalists from all three age groups tended to hold a negative attitude toward social media if they engaged more on Facebook. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Planners often attempt to accommodate growth in already developed areas. Opposition to high-density (i.e., at a higher unit density than surrounding development) residential infill in developed areas is, however, a long-established force in land use politics. We hypothesize that opposition to this development, as well as 6 specific concerns with this development’s impacts, are likely associated with a variety of ideological, demographic, geographical, and political characteristics and that these associations can tell planners much about the character of this opposition. We use a web survey of verified voters in local elections (n = 772) in medium- to medium-high-density ZIP codes to find relationships between these characteristics and respondents’ feelings toward a hypothetical high-density residential infill development. Our findings expose the varied character of responses to this development: respondents of some characteristics—for example, those who strongly value their communities’ attractiveness, vitality, walkability, and bikability—are more likely to have specific concerns while remaining open to the development, indicating the possibility of constructive conversations with these groups. On the other hand, the concerns of other groups, notably those of conservatives, may result from unfamiliarity or even prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Urban Affairs Association.

This study applies a large-scale media content analysis of newspapers articles (N = 1340) published in the first two months of the accident in twelve press opinion leaders in Belgium, Italy, Norway, Russia, Slovenia and Spain. The results show that the memory on the Chernobyl nuclear accident appeared in more than in every third article reporting of the present Fukushima nuclear accident despite the fact that Fukushima carried no direct radiological hazard for the newspaper’s audience and, a frequent use of narratives is related to negative attitudes towards nuclear energy, a higher risk perception of nuclear power plants and to an active nuclear energy industry in the newspaper’s country. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Policy-makers often refer to media reports and public opinion polls when advocating immigration policies. A good example of this is provided by Hong Kong, an international financial hub that prides itself on its multiculturalism and pluralism, but whose government officials and pro-establishment legislators have been calling for tougher measures because of a plethora of negative news reports on immigrants. This study examines how print media frames the issue of asylum seekers and refugees, with the findings indicating that the majority of local Chinese news articles portray asylum seekers negatively as “fake refugees” and “criminals.” The study also examines newspapers’ framing of the causes of requests for asylum and their recommendations for dealing with the “problem”: (1) setting up detention camps, (2) enforcing stricter border control, and (3) withdrawing from the UNCAT. It argues that the negative framing provides justifications for anti-refugee policy-makers to suggest tougher policy solutions to the issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Policy implications are discussed which may affect Hong Kong’s position as a first-class global city. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Limited research exists on school social work that addresses the issues, needs and concerns facing Hong Kong’s sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. This qualitative study interrogates how heteronormativity produces gender and sexuality oppression within the secondary school system. It situates Hong Kong schooling in a heteronormative context shaped by the intersecting influences of Chinese cultures, intimate family life, Christianity and media/public attitudes. It also highlights how heteronormativity is enforced and reproduces gender and sexuality oppression in multiple ways (through peer relations, curriculum and class teacher relations and school social work practices). Understanding how heteronormativity manifests and works is urgently needed to challenge heteronormativity through Hong Kong schooling. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper integrates Indigenous research and heritage interpretation scholarship by addressing how interpretation should be underpinned by research congruent with Indigenous expectations for research ethics and methods. Program research and delivery is a profound exercise of power, for interpreters mold public opinion. In a settler-colonial or Indigenous context, critically analyzing sources for one’s interpretative programs and media is particularly imperative, as Western researchers have historically been on colonialism’s front lines. The interpretation of Indigenous themes is fraught with difficulties, but existing interpretation literature myopically focuses on program delivery and evaluation methods. More attention must be paid by interpreters to the problems of relying on Western, positivist research in Indigenous contexts. This paper considers Indigenous research methods and ethics, provides an overview of the connection between Western knowledge and colonialism, and demonstrates the problems this poses for interpreters working with Indigenous content. I offer concrete suggestions for staff to improve their engagement with Indigenous peoples. Ultimately, I argue, interpreters must become more critical of themselves and their sources to successfully address Indigeneity. © 2019, © 2019 Chance Finnegan.

AB  - Scholarship on media and politics presumes a ‘mediatization’ of politics over time, which overlooks the evolution of a mediatized public sphere that shaped people’s understandings of what actually constituted politics. This article investigates the public sphere to demonstrate how it created expectations for politicians and journalists within the process of the mediatization of politics. To understand how political behaviour changed as a result of mediatization, this article focuses on the turn of the twentieth century, when politics faced an emerging mass press. It analyses one of the most violent episodes of the ‘press wars’ between Germany and Britain before the First World War. In 1901, British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain allegedly insulted the German Army, to which German Imperial Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow reacted aggressively, resulting in a media storm across Europe and the failing of the British-German alliance talks that paved the way for Britain’s Entente Cordiale with France. Part of the reason why this situation escalated was that newspapers in Britain and Germany expressed expectations for politicians to represent the angry opinions of their publics as voiced in the press. However, many newspapers also demanded that Bülow and Chamberlain moderate public opinion by influencing and censoring the press. While Bülow and Chamberlain were ahead of their time in paying attention to press opinions, seeking publicity and managing the press, they failed to meet the contradictory expectations of catering to jingoism while appeasing a foreign public. Meanwhile, newspapers reflected on their political impact on this situation, and started expecting more press responsibility, which moderated the crisis. The case shows how media and politics were not separated spheres, but interacted within a transnational public sphere in which expectations for political and journalistic behaviour were continuously being (re)shaped. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explores the multidimensionality of engagements with international large-scale standardised assessments (ILSAs). The objective is to understand how different policy actors—government, media, and citizens—rationalise, report, and perceive China’s PISA participation. First, government archive analysis traces a decade of documents (2005–2015), and the findings show that Shanghai’s initial participation in PISA was rationalised as a policy experiment for learning Western ideas of education governance. Second, media content analysis of two major news outlets indicates that media framing of PISA participation was strategic on timing, intensity, and tone. Third, a public opinion survey yields results which show that low public knowledge of Shanghai’s PISA participation in 2012 is prevalent. Drawing on these findings, this study investigates how the ILSA movement, exemplified by PISA, engages different levels of stakeholders in China. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the Australian context, the development of a ‘situated politics of mixedness’ is complicated by the fact that there are (at least) two main categories of mixed race populations–the Indigenous and the migrant/settler. For those with mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestries, and those with mixed White and other migrant ancestries, life chances and identities differ significantly. This paper outlines some of these differences using the trope of pride and prejudice. For those of mixed migrant/settler heritage, evidence is growing that the mixed experience is predominantly one of pride. For them, misrecognition, or being asked about their racial background, is an opportunity for play, often resulting in ‘the big reveal’ of a valorised mixed identity associated with something other than a bland ‘white bread’ Australian-ness. For those of mixed Indigenous heritage however, there remains a significant level of prejudice, not (only) for being Aboriginal, but for not being visibly Aboriginal enough. Using existing studies and a number of media controversies as examples, this paper interrogates the implications of these differences for understandings of the ways in which race is recruited in the construction of legitimate identity claims. It asks particularly how ‘mixed race’ is helpful analytically to describe the identity constructions within these two very different experiences. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Massive social media data produced from microblog platforms provide a new data source for studying human dynamics at an unprecedented scale. Meanwhile, population bias in geotagged Twitter users is widely recognized. Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic biases of Twitter users is critical for making reliable inferences on the attitudes and behaviors of the population. However, the existing global models cannot capture the regional variations of the demographic and socioeconomic biases. To bridge the gap, we modeled the relationships between different demographic/socioeconomic factors and geotagged Twitter users for the whole contiguous United States, aiming to understand how the demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to the number of Twitter users at county level. To effectively identify the local Twitter users for each county of the United States, we integrate three commonly used methods and develop a query approach in a high-performance computing environment. The results demonstrate that we can not only identify how the demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to the number of Twitter users, but can also measure and map how the influence of these factors vary across counties. © 2018, © 2018 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.

AB  - Background: Video game playing is a daily activity for many youths that replaces other media forms (eg, television); it serves as an important source of knowledge and can potentially impact their attitudes and behaviors. Researchers are, thus, concerned with the impact of video gaming on youth (eg, for promoting prosocial or antisocial behavior). Studies have also begun to explore players' experience of gameplay and video game messages about violence, sexism, and racism; however, little is known about the impact of commercial video games in the sharing and shaping of knowledge, and messages about mental illness. Objective: The aim of this review was to identify how mental illness, especially psychosis, is portrayed in commercial video games. Methods: We performed keyword searches on games made available between January 2016 and June 2017 on Steam (a popular personal computer gaming platform). A total of 789 games were identified and reviewed to assess whether their game content was related to mental illness. At the end of the screening phase, a total of 100 games were retained. Results: We used a game elements framework (characters, game environment/atmosphere, goals, etc) to describe and unpack messages about mental health and illness in video games. The majority of the games we reviewed (97%, 97/100) portrayed mental illness in negative, misleading, and problematic ways (associating it with violence, fear, insanity, hopelessness, etc). Furthermore, some games portrayed mental illness as manifestations or consequences of supernatural phenomena or paranormal experiences. Mental illness was associated with mystery, the unpredictable, and as an obscure illness; its treatment was also associated with uncertainties, as game characters with mental illness had to undergo experimental treatment to get better. Unfortunately, little or no hope for recovery was present in the identified video games, where mental illness was often presented as an ongoing struggle and an endless battle with the mind and oneself. Conclusions: The game elements of the identified commercial video games included mental illness, about which many perpetuated well-known stereotypes and prejudices. We discuss the key findings in relation to current evidence on the impact of media portrayals of mental illness and stigma. Furthermore, we reflect on the ability of serious video games to promote alternative messages about mental illness and clinical practices. Future research is needed to investigate the impact that such messages have on players and to explore the role that video games can play in fostering alternative messages to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. © 2019 JMIR Mental Health

AB  - Background: There are controversial views on accepting a reproductive donation in the world. Objective: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the sociocultural beliefs and infertile couples’ attitude toward reproductive donation in Mashhad, Iran. Materials and Methods: This descriptive correlational study was conducted out on 115 infertile couples visiting Milad Infertility Center in Mashhad, Iran with using convenience sampling. The research instruments were valid and reliable sociocultural beliefs and attitude questionnaires, which were completed by the respondents on a self-report basis. Results: The mean score of attitude toward reproductive donation in infertile women and men was 58.3 ± 12.6 and 57.8 ± 12.0, and the mean score of sociocultural beliefs in infertile women and men was 67.7 ± 11.5 and 67.6 ± 12.4, respectively. There was a direct correlation between sociocultural beliefs and attitude toward reproductive donation in infertile women (p < 0.001) and men (p < 0.001), that is, women and men with a higher score of sociocultural beliefs had a higher score of attitude as well. A direct correlation was also seen between sociocultural beliefs and infertile women and men’s public attitude, their attitude towards genetic bound between parents and children, their attitude regarding the issue of confidentiality of the donation process, as well as attitude in relation to oocyte donation, embryo donation, and surrogacy (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings suggest that sociocultural beliefs that surround reproductive donation could influence infertile couple’s attitude toward accepting these therapeutic alternatives in infertile couples. It is therefore recommended to take steps to incorporate sociocultural beliefs into the routine care of infertile couples with the help of social media to give them ability for making more pragmatic decision in relation to their chosen options. © 2019, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity.

AB  - The “New Public Diplomacy” represents the latest evolution of soft power theories. In order to positively influence foreign perceptions within the framework of global public opinion, international communication deals with international stakeholders’ interactions, with the aim of determining media flows of information. Whether they are states, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, private companies, otherwise, press, publicity and/or public relations services are sought to shape international information. Facing such public diplomacy and/or propaganda practices, international communicators should avoid becoming mere instruments and instead play the analytical and critical role demanded by international society. Today, such a task involves increased complexity due to: 1) actors’ multiplicity, and 2) and the new balance of forces on the field of play. © UNISCI, 2019.

AB  - In recent years, the data growth has suddenly increased through social media like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc., because everyone has used. These unstructured data is used to handle various applications in data analytics. These applications are used for public opinion and sentiment analysis (POSA) in Twitter by various Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. In this paper, mainly discuss about Twitter sentiment analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms. We take the sample tweets from Twitter, and finding the positive, negative, and neutral words, and then will make it polarity score by using Twitter Sentiment analysis. Using this data are applying ML algorithms. This algorithm is used to show the comparison result between Random Forest (RF) algorithm and Classification algorithm to know which one is best performance. Random Forest algorithm is good when compare with Classification algorithm. Classification algorithm is best for easy understanding. Finally in this social media have low level of security in the Twitter data. © BEIESP.

AB  - Background: Twitter is an indicator of real-world performance, thus, is an appropriate arena to assess the social consideration and attitudes toward psychosis. Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a mixed-methods study of the content and key metrics of tweets referring to psychosis in comparison with tweets referring to control diseases (breast cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer, and human immunodeficiency virus). Methods: Each tweet's content was rated as nonmedical (NM: testimonies, health care products, solidarity or awareness and misuse) or medical (M: included a reference to the illness's diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, or prevention). NM tweets were classified as positive or pejorative. We assessed the appropriateness of the medical content. The number of retweets generated and the potential reach and impact of the hashtags analyzed was also investigated. Results: We analyzed a total of 15,443 tweets: 8055 classified as NM and 7287 as M. Psychosis-related tweets (PRT) had a significantly higher frequency of misuse 33.3% (212/636) vs 1.15% (853/7419; P<.001) and pejorative content 36.2% (231/636) vs 11.33% (840/7419; P<.001). The medical content of the PRT showed the highest scientific appropriateness 100% (391/391) vs 93.66% (6030/6439; P<.001) and had a higher frequency of content about disease prevention. The potential reach and impact of the tweets related to psychosis were low, but they had a high retweet-to-tweet ratio. Conclusions: We show a reduced number and a different pattern of contents in tweets about psychosis compared with control diseases. PRT showed a predominance of nonmedical content with increased frequencies of misuse and pejorative tone. However, the medical content of PRT showed high scientific appropriateness aimed toward prevention. © 2019 Miguel Angel Alvarez-Mon, María Llavero-Valero, Rodrigo Sánchez-Bayona, Victor Pereira-Sanchez, Maria Vallejo-Valdivielso, Jorge Monserrat, Guillermo Lahera, Angel Asunsolo del Barco, Melchor Alvarez-Mon.

AB  - Role of the knowledge-based resources in promoting sustainability in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is currently a topic of debate. Financial literacy has been identified as a vital knowledge resource for financial decision making, but insufficient attention has been given to how SMEs' financial literacy affects their sustainability. Drawing upon a knowledge-based perspective, peaking order theory and dual process theory, we constructed an integrated model to examine the impact of financial literacy, access to finance and financial risk attitude on SMEs' sustainability. The sample included 291 chief financial officers (CFOs) of SMEs in Sri Lanka. The output of structural equation modelling revealed direct positive effects of financial literacy, access to finance and financial risk attitude on sustainability. Financial literacy also emerged as a predictor of access to finance and financial risk attitude. Moreover, access to finance and financial risk attitude were found to be partial mediators of the relationship between financial literacy and SMEs' sustainability. Theoretical implications and practical implications for policymakers, industry practitioners and academics interested in promoting sustainability amongst SMEs are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In a location-based social network, users socialize with each other by sharing their current location in the form of "check-in," which allows users to reveal the current places they visit as part of their social interaction. Understanding this human check-in phenomenon in space and time on location based social network (LBSN) datasets, which is also called "check-in behavior," can archive the day-to-day activity patterns, usage behaviors toward social media, and presents spatiotemporal evidence of users' daily routines. It also provides a wide range of opportunities to observe (i.e., mobility, urban activities, defining city boundary, and community problems in a city). In representing human check-in behavior, these LBSN datasets do not reflect the real-world events due to certain statistical biases (i.e., gender prejudice, a low frequency in sampling, and location type prejudice). However, LBSN data is primarily considered a supplement to traditional data sources (i.e., survey, census) and can be used to observe human check-in behavior within a city. Different interpretations are used elusively for the term "check-in behavior," which makes it difficult to identify studies on human check-in behavior based on LBSN using the Weibo dataset. The primary objective of this research is to explore human check-in behavior by male and female users in Guangzhou, China toward using Chinese microblog SinaWeibo (referred to as "Weibo"), which is missing in the existing literature. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is utilized to explore the spatiotemporal distribution geographically and weighted regression (GWR) method was applied to observe the relationship between check-in and districts with a focus on gender during weekdays and weekend. Lastly, the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) analysis is used to systematically analyze the orientation, direction, spatiotemporal expansion trends and the differences in check-in distribution in Guangzhou, China. The results of this study show that LBSN is a reliable source of data to observe human check-in behavior in space and time within a specified geographic area. Furthermore, it shows that female users are more likely to use social media as compared to male users. The human check-in behavior patterns for social media network usage by gender seems to be slightly different during weekdays and weekend. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background Attention to women’s and girls’ menstrual needs is critical for global health and gender equality. The importance of this neglected experience has been elucidated by a growing body of qualitative research, which we systematically reviewed and synthesised. Methods and findings We undertook systematic searching to identify qualitative studies of women’s and girls’ experiences of menstruation in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Of 6,892 citations screened, 76 studies reported in 87 citations were included. Studies captured the experiences of over 6,000 participants from 35 countries. This included 45 studies from sub-Saharan Africa (with the greatest number of studies from Kenya [n = 7], Uganda [n = 6], and Ethiopia [n = 5]), 21 from South Asia (including India [n = 12] and Nepal [n = 5]), 8 from East Asia and the Pacific, 5 from Latin America and the Caribbean, 5 from the Middle East and North Africa, and 1 study from Europe and Central Asia. Through synthesis, we identified overarching themes and their relationships to develop a directional model of menstrual experience. This model maps distal and proximal antecedents of menstrual experience through to the impacts of this experience on health and well-being. The sociocultural context, including menstrual stigma and gender norms, influenced experiences by limiting knowledge about menstruation, limiting social support, and shaping internalised and externally enforced behavioural expectations. Resource limitations underlay inadequate physical infrastructure to support menstruation, as well as an economic environment restricting access to affordable menstrual materials. Menstrual experience included multiple themes: menstrual practices, perceptions of practices and environments, confidence, shame and distress, and containment of bleeding and odour. These components of experience were interlinked and contributed to negative impacts on women’s and girls’ lives. Impacts included harms to physical and psychological health as well as education and social engagement. Our review is limited by the available studies. Study quality was varied, with 18 studies rated as high, 35 medium, and 23 low trustworthiness. Sampling and analysis tended to be untrustworthy in lower-quality studies. Studies focused on the experiences of adolescent girls were most strongly represented, and we achieved early saturation for this group. Reflecting the focus of menstrual health research globally, there was an absence of studies focused on adult women and those from certain geographical areas. Conclusions Through synthesis of extant qualitative studies of menstrual experience, we highlight consistent challenges and developed an integrated model of menstrual experience. This model hypothesises directional pathways that could be tested by future studies and may serve as a framework for program and policy development by highlighting critical antecedents and pathways through which interventions could improve women’s and girls’ health and well-being. © 2019 Hennegan et al.

AB  - This article seeks to explore the role Russian and Ukrainian conventional media played as agenda-setters and producers of subjective framings within the context of the Crimean crisis, exploring at the same time the relationship between state and media and the impact of media representations on national public opinions. The analysis shows that agenda-setting and framing at the level of states’ policies have a fundamental role in decision-shaping and perception-building, highlighting that the manipulation of information through narrative-construction is a powerful tool at the service of politics. This study contributes to validate the idea that media can be perceived as key influencers of the public agenda as they emerge as the most relevant agents in mediatising politics, becoming hence a functional gatekeeper that might either facilitate the official discourse or instead obstruct it. © 2019, Observare.

AB  - The manipulation problem in the media has been still pressing. Processes and techniques intended for making an influence on public opinion and behaviors are in ongoing improvement, making it difficult to access an objective image of the world. Therefore, this research aims at emphasizing the importance of speech (language) means that form a basis of manipulations in mass communications. To achieve this, authors have provided the systematization of social influence processes in the media and made techniques and means of speech influence clearer. Authors provided a content analysis of texts of 2018 from the media using news resources of different countries (‘Russia Today,’ ‘RIA Novosti,’ ‘Ukrinform’ and ‘Fox News Channel’) as an example. The research subject consists of news materials of a politico-social nature on Russia’s participation in the Syrian conflict. Authors have empirically revealed a clear desire to influence readers of the media resources using covert means of the manipulative influence. In total, they have found five types of manipulative speech influence in texts of the media. There are self-presentation, semantic speech strategies, persuasive strategies, hit piece and information manipulation. A lexical toolkit of speech manipulation includes euphemisms, dysphemisms, slogan words, speech metaphorization, etc. Media texts have become more and more complicated as they contain hints, precedent phenomena, irony, as well as metamessages of informative presentation. Each media of the selected ones more or less uses means of speech manipulation in varying degrees. Applications of such methods of influence (in number) almost directly depend on a political attitude towards an object. © Media Watch.

AB  - Originally, online public engagement with science tended to be one directional—from experts to the general population via news media. Such an arrangement allowed for little to no direct interaction between the public and scientists. However, the emergence of social media has opened the door to meaningful engagement between scientists and the general public. The current study examines scientists’ perspectives on the interactions between laypeople and scientists by asking questions and sharing information on social media platforms, specifically, through Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions on Reddit’s “Science” subreddit (r/science). By analyzing the content of six different r/science AMAs and surveying scientists who participated as r/science AMA hosts, our research attempts to gain a richer understanding of direct communication between scientists and lay audiences online. We had three main questions: (1) who are the participant scientists hosting r/science AMAs, (2) what are their experiences like as hosts, and (3) what type of discussions do they have on this platform? Survey results suggested that these scientists recognize the promising interactive nature of Reddit and are interested in continuing to use this platform as a tool for public engagement. Survey respondents generally had positive experiences as AMA hosts, but further research is needed to examine negative experiences. Overall, this study has significant implications for how scientists can engage public audiences online and more effectively communicate scientific findings to the general populace. © 2019 Hara et al.

AB  - In an online Qualtrics panel survey experiment (N = 1620), we found that scientists posting self-portraits (“selfies”) to Instagram from the science lab/field were perceived as significantly warmer and more trustworthy, and no less competent, than scientists posting photos of only their work. Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images. Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less exclusively male. Our findings suggest that self-portraiture by STEM professionals on social media can mitigate negative attitudes toward scientists. © 2019 Jarreau et al.

AB  - For the last decade, undocumented or illegal immigration has been one of the most contested policy issues in the United States, with significant news attention on policies affecting the undocumented population, ranging from deportations to comprehensive immigration reform, the DREAM Act, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Despite these prominent and multifaceted policy debates, scholarship on media framing and public opinion remain more focused on the portrayal of immigrants rather than policies affecting them. In general, scholars find that policy frames are far more consequential to public opinion than equivalency frames (variations in how news media describe unauthorized immigrants, either as “illegal” or “undocumented”) or episodic frames (whether news articles are heavy on human-interest stories rather than policy facts and statistics). Also, negative frames generally have stronger effects than positive frames, and these effects sometimes vary by partisanship and family migration history. Finally, the relative infrequency of powerful frames in news stories, like a life spent in the United States, provides opportunities for advocates to move public opinion on immigration policy. These findings have important implications for future battles over immigration policy in the United States, which show no signs of abating. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - To inform the field of rehabilitation psychology about the sociocultural implications of the term disability, and explain the rationale behind the #SaytheWord movement, a social media call to embrace disability identity. Method: Review of the literature on disability terminology, the history of language use, and the relationship between attitudes toward disability and language. We reflect on the role of disability within the field of psychology and within the American Psychological Association (APA), including the underrepresentation of disabled psychologists and trainees with disabilities and the lack of mentorship opportunities available in the field. Implications: The authors argue that erasure of the word disability can have unintended and adverse consequences. We describe how erasure of disability identity in the context of current sociopolitical efforts to reduce and eliminate public services and supports for people with disabilities is especially threatening to members of the disability community. To move forward, the authors postulate that the disability movement must reconcile its own history of exclusion and adopt a disability justice framework. Conclusion: The field of psychology has a rich tradition of appreciation of cultural diversity and individual difference; yet, disability has largely been left out of these efforts. The disability movement is moving toward the status of a diverse cultural group with a social justice agenda parallel to those of other marginalized communities. The authors posit that psychology must play a stronger role in advancing the human rights of people with disabilities. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The unfinished Arab revolutions produced unsettling conditions, sectarian wars, counter-revolutionary wars, proxy wars and transitional democracies. US and Arab media responses could not find effective words to describe them and their underlying geopolitical implications. Whether to name them ‘protest’ or ‘unrest’, American mainstream media initially welcomed the events with a cautious curiosity while Arab media favoured a romanticized coverage. But as the protests spread fast and continued, a more dominant popular narrative in the US shaped by the ‘exceptionalist’ perspective about the Middle East emerged. This article explains how dominant discursive framings deployed a form of ‘nature talk’, specifically through names, phrases and locutions such as ‘Arab Spring’, ‘Jasmine revolution’, ‘Arab transition’, and horticultural words like ‘flower’, ‘rose’ and ‘blossom’ to describe the Arab uprisings. Because of an intellectually limiting media-produced racial vernacular during the period of mass protest, this dominant mainstream narrative spoke about the events either by using neo-imperial language that characterized the revolutions as an Islamist threat or by employing culturally reductionist vocabulary which infantilized protesters. The goal here is to place specific media frames and images that such linguistic constructions create and disseminate within the context of power relations, the politics of naming and knowledge production. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Britain’s war in Afghanistan – specifically its latter stages, where the UK’s role and casualties sustained in the conflict rose dramatically – coincided with the institutional emergence of Ministry of Defence-led ‘Strategic Communication’. This article examines the circumstances through which domestic strategic communication developed within the UK state and the manner in which the ‘narratives’ supporting Britain’s role in Afghanistan were altered, streamlined and ‘securitised’. I argue that securitising the Afghanistan narrative was undertaken with the intention of misdirecting an increasingly sceptical UK public from the failure of certain aspects of UK counter-insurgency strategy – specifically its counter-narcotics and stabilisation efforts – by focusing on counter-terrorism, and of avoiding difficult questions about the UK’s transnational foreign and defence policy outlook vis-à-vis the United States by asserting that Afghanistan was primarily a ‘national security’ issue. I conclude this article by arguing that the UK’s domestic strategic communication approach of emphasising ‘national security interests’ may have created the conditions for institutionalised confusion by reinforcing a narrow, self-interested narrative of Britain’s role in the world that runs counter to its ongoing, ‘transnationalised’ commitments to collective security through the United States and NATO. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The existence of propaganda is inexorably bound to the nature of communication and communications technology. Mass communication by citizens in the digital age has been heralded as a means to counter elite propaganda; however, it also provides a forum for misinformation, aggression and hostility. The extremist group Britain First has used Facebook as a way to propagate hostility towards Muslims, immigrants and social security claimants in the form of memes, leading to a backlash from sites antithetical to their message. This article provides a memetic analysis, which addresses persuasion, organisation, political echo chambers and self-correcting online narratives; arguing that propaganda can be best understood as an evolving set of techniques and mechanisms which facilitate the propagation of ideas and actions. This allows the concept to be adapted to fit a changing political and technological landscape and to encompass both propaganda and counter-propaganda in the context of horizontal communications networks. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study develops a model that contributes to our understanding of the complex relationship between economic motivations and anti-Muslim attitudes by analyzing the underexplored role of news consumption. Using a large-scale Dutch panel dataset (n = 2694), we test a structural equation model theoretically grounded in group conflict theory, in which the relationship between news consumption and anti-Muslim attitudes is mediated by perceptions and emotions about the economy. Findings offer sound empirical support for the hypothesized model: news consumption increases pessimistic economic perceptions and negative emotions about the economy, which in turn strengthens anti-Muslim attitudes. The mechanism, however, largely depends on the type of news outlet and genre: watching television seems more decisive than reading newspapers; moreover, especially exposure to soft and popular news formats plays a dominant role. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The phenomenon of scandal(ization) has become omnipresent in contemporary political media discourses – at the latest since the 2016 US presidential election. Our article addresses causes and effects of this recent prevalence of scandal narratives. By connecting concepts from social systems theory and media theory, we consider crucial practices and processes of scandal construction in the 2016 US presidential election, focusing on the much-noticed emailgate and trumptape scandals. Both examples serve to illustrate how the emergence of partial public spheres in social media may lead to a fight for sovereignty over scandal discourse, political attitudes, and the negotiation of social norms, morals, and values. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Research on de-radicalisation has been primarily concerned with the efficacy of de-radicalisation programmes and their negative consequences. However, there has been little research on how the public perceives de-radicalisation programmes and whether they are viewed as effective or desirable. It is important to understand public attitudes to de-radicalisation programmes because public opinion can affect the capacity to deliver the programmes. The following article takes a first step towards understanding these issues by examining how The Daily Mail has framed de-radicalisation in terms of whether or not the programmes are effective or desirable. We argue that an assumption of potential efficacy exists throughout the newspaper’s framing of de-radicalisation which presents the policy as desirable, despite also framing de-radicalisation as ineffective. While practitioners are reluctant to promote de-radicalisation programmes, The Daily Mail’s framing of de-radicalisation as natural, logical and desirable reflects the concept’s ideological flexibility as both a rehabilitative and normative endeavour. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In this study, we test to what extent an educational video on the intricacies of antibiotic resistance affects public attitudes towards antibiotic resistance and how such information is absorbed by the most likely targets of public health campaigns. We use a representative sample of 2037 individuals (from 2016) to test how people respond to a video educating them about antibiotic resistance. Our results show that receiving information does increase the general awareness of antibiotic resistance among our respondents. Yet, these effects are most profound for those who are the most likely targets of such information: the least knowledgeable group and those who have a more apathetic worldview. Our results are in line with suggestions made by the knowledge deficit model and show that the influence of cultural predispositions on the uptake of information about antibiotic resistance should not be ignored in future campaigns. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The impact of knowledge on public attitudes toward scientific issues remains unclear, due in part to ill-defined differences in how research designs conceptualize knowledge. Using genetically modified foods as a framework, we explore the impacts of perceived familiarity and factual knowledge, and the moderating roles of media attention and a food-specific attitudinal variable (food consciousness), in shaping these relationships. Based on the differential effects on “negative attitudes” toward genetically modified foods, we provide further evidence that the measures of knowledge are separate concepts and argue against a one-dimensional view of scientific knowledge. We discuss implications for understanding the relationship between knowledge and science attitudes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Large infrastructure schemes have become part of our landscape. Their controversial nature often requires elaborate justifications including the use of intangible benefits. One intangible benefit that has increasingly been raised in support of mega-projects is the peace dividend. Yet, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the following questions: to what extent, by whom, and in what ways is the peace dividend used as a strategic tool when it comes to justifying contested mega-projects? This article examines the use of different types of arguments in mega-project justification, with a focus on the peace dividend as a political intangible benefit. Through a comparative content analysis of coverage of the Dead Sea-Red Sea Canal project in Israeli and Jordanian news media, we illustrate how the peace dividend is employed as a framing device by both project supporters and opponents and how it is positioned in relation to other types of benefits and costs. We found that the marketing of contested mega-projects to public and political constituencies entails a variety of justifications, reflected in the various framing modes used to influence public opinion in both Israel and Jordan. The nature and intensity of these justifications are sensitive to the media environment and the degree of economic development. Our findings indicate that the peace dividend as a line of defense for the project is the most controversial of all other justification domains. © 2019

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing, often called fracking, is a drilling technique that accesses previously inaccessible oil/gas reserves. Although the process could aid U.S. energy independence, it is controversial and public opinion is divided. Guided by agenda-setting and framing, this study content analyses news coverage of fracking (N = 524) across cable networks (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC). Results show cable news lacks substance and relies on thematic framing. While all networks failed to provide factual information, issue-related topics discussed and sources used vary ideologically. Theoretical and practical implications, which include the potential for priming audiences and influencing future behaviors and judgments, are discussed. © 2019

AB  - The authors illustrate how applied theater practices were used in media literacy classes to educate students about acts of religious discrimination in their societies. These practices helped students acknowledge their role in reifying or dismantling these prejudices in and through their classroom interactions with their peers from other religions (in academic discourse, the religious other). The analysis demonstrates how students created and performed plays in interfaith teams with the objective of examining their prejudice about the other. In scripting and performing together, students developed new, affective bonds based on personal experiences of working as teammates. This change in their interpersonal relations with their classmates encouraged students to imagine new possibilities of coexisting with differences. © 2019 International Literacy Association

AB  - Background: Contents published on social media have an impact on individuals and on their decision making. Knowing the sentiment toward diabetes is fundamental to understanding the impact that such information could have on people affected with this health condition and their family members. The objective of this study is to analyze the sentiment expressed in messages on diabetes posted on Twitter. Method: Tweets including one of the terms “diabetes,” “t1d,” and/or “t2d” were extracted for one week using the Twitter standard API. Only the text message and the number of followers of the users were extracted. The sentiment analysis was performed by using SentiStrength. Results: A total of 67 421 tweets were automatically extracted, of those 3.7% specifically referred to T1D; and 6.8% specifically mentioned T2D. One or more emojis were included in 7.0% of the posts. Tweets specifically mentioning T2D and that did not include emojis were significantly more negative than the tweets that included emojis (–2.22 vs −1.48, P <.001). Tweets on T1D and that included emojis were both significantly more positive and also less negative than tweets without emojis (1.71 vs 1.49 and −1.31 vs −1.50, respectively; P <.005). The number of followers had a negative association with positive sentiment strength (r = –.023, P <.001) and a positive association with negative sentiment (r =.016, P <.001). Conclusion: The use of sentiment analysis techniques on social media could increase our knowledge of how social media impact people with diabetes and their families and could help to improve public health strategies. © 2018 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - “We the Media” networks are real time and open, and such networks lack a gatekeeper system. As netizens’ comments on emergency events are disseminated, negative public opinion topics and confrontations concerning those events also spread widely on “We the Media” networks. Gradually, this phenomenon has attracted scholarly attention, and all social circles attach importance to the phenomenon as well. In existing topic detection studies, a topic is mainly defined as an “event” from the perspective of news-media information flow, but in the “We the Media” era, there are often many different views or topics surrounding a specific public opinion event. In this paper, a study on the detection of public opinion topics in “We the Media” networks is presented, starting with the characteristics of the elements found in public opinions on “We the Media” networks; such public opinions are multidimensional, multilayered and possess multiple attributes. By categorizing the elements’ attributes using social psychology and system science categories as references, we build a multidimensional network model oriented toward the topology of public opinions on “We the Media” networks. Based on the real process by which multiple topics concerning the same event are generated and disseminated, we designed a topic detection algorithm that works on these multidimensional public opinion networks. As a case study, the “Explosion in Tianjin Port on August 12, 2015″ accident was selected to conduct empirical analyses on the algorithm's effectiveness. The theoretical and empirical research findings of this paper are summarized along the following three aspects. 1. The multidimensional network model can be used to effectively characterize the communication characteristics of multiple topics on “We the Media” networks, and it provided the modeling ideas for the present paper and for other related studies on “We the Media” public opinion networks. 2. Using the multidimensional topic detection algorithm, 70% of the public opinion topics concerning the case study event were effectively detected, which shows that the algorithm is effective at detecting topics from the information flow on “We the Media” networks. 3. By defining the psychological scores of single and paired Chinese keywords in public opinion information, the topic detection algorithm can also be used to judge the sentiment tendencies of each topic, which can facilitate a timely understanding of public opinion and reveal negative topics under discussion on “We the Media” networks. © 2018

AB  - The article studies whether and how negative campaigning is a successful strategy for attaining media attention. It combines extensive content analyses of party and news texts with public opinion surveys to study the success of individual press releases in making the news. The empirical analysis draws on 1496 party press releases and 6512 news reports in all national media outlets during the final 6 weeks of Austria’s 2013 general election campaign. We find that negative campaigning is a successful strategy to attract the attention of journalists and editors. It is particularly relevant for rank-and-file politicians, who lack the intrinsic news value of high public or party office, and for messages that focus on a rival’s best issues. These findings have broader implications for understanding party strategies and ‘negativity bias’ in the news. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Beginning in the 1960s, the United States experienced religious and partisan conflict over cultural issues such as abortion that was described as a “Culture War.” Recent, highly salient battles over religious liberty and transgender rights have led the media to characterize these issues as “new fronts in the culture war,” thereby giving reason to revisit the culture wars debate. In this article, I test whether the public is polarized on religious liberty and transgender rights, as well as whether these issues share the same underlying structure of public opinion as traditional culture wars issues. Using a dataset from the Pew Research Center, I find that a substantial subset of Americans hold polarized views on these issues, and that religion and party are important factors in explaining that polarization. The results suggest that the religious and partisan divides that fueled the original “culture wars” remain an important factor in American politics. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Prejudice against people with mental illnesses remains a significant problem in the United Kingdom and in many other countries despite sustained efforts by governments and charities. This is particularly so for people with schizophrenia, who are seen as dangerous and unpredictable. The present study investigated the effect of brief, casual, stereotypical representations on prejudice and behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia. Participants viewed Halloween costumes in an online environment under the guise of product research. In the experimental condition, they were exposed to a “Psycho Ward” Halloween outfit identical to one sold online by a leading supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. Participants in the control condition saw a neutral “pumpkin” Halloween costume. Exposure to the Psycho Ward outfit resulted in more negative behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia, mediated by increased prejudice. These findings confirm and extend earlier research that implicates adverse media stereotypes in the persistence of prejudice against people with mental illness. More research is warranted on the relative effects of different influences on community attitudes to mental illness. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The popular notion of a trade-off between social and defense spending—or guns versus butter—appears often in elite discourse, popular media, and empirical studies of budgetary politics. Yet, there are good reasons to suspect that the public’s preferences for these types of spending do not reflect that trade-off. I develop a theory that whether social and defense spending preferences are competing or complementary depends on if the respondent views the government as an important contributor to job creation. Using data from fifty-nine surveys in twenty-seven countries from 1985 to 2008, I show that favoring government-financed job creation makes a respondent much more likely to view social and defense spending as complementary. Indeed, aside from the anomalous case of the United States, preferences are consistent with guns yield butter instead of guns versus butter. This theory has important implications for the thermostatic model of policy responsiveness and theories of budgetary politics. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - With the ascendance of liberal democracy, propaganda activities have vastly increased. The main aim of propaganda has been to protect state-corporate power from the threat of public understanding and participation. Because of its societal importance for public opinion formation, the news media constitutes an obvious channel for the dissemination of propaganda. However, contemporary communication, media and journalism studies have mostly neglected to critically assess the news media’s role in producing and distributing propaganda. In fact, despite of the news media’s integration into the state-corporate nexus, the term propaganda is rarely used in academic treatises on the news media. Furthermore, only a small number of scholars have engaged in elaborating a systematic understanding of the manifold propaganda techniques that are currently applied in liberal democracies. To fill these research gaps, this article maps out various concepts of propaganda and relates them to the process and content of the news media. On the basis of theoretical and empirical studies, the article demonstrates how different forms of propaganda can manifest in news media content. Based on an integration with, as well as a development of, existing literature, the essay aims to build a tool box that can be applied and refined in future studies in order to detect propaganda in news media texts. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Between pro-retrenchment politicians and segments of the media, exaggerated claims about the generous benefits enjoyed by those on welfare are relatively common. But to what extent, and under what conditions, can they actually shape attitudes towards welfare? This study explores these questions via a survey experiment conducted in the UK, examining: (1) the extent to which the value of the claimed figure matters; (2) if the presence of anchoring information about minimum wage income has an impact; and (3) whether these effects differ based on egalitarianism and political knowledge. Results suggest that increasing the size of the claimed figure decreases support in a broadly linear fashion, with anchoring information important only when (asserted) benefit levels are modestly above the minimum wage income. Egalitarianism, in turn, primarily matters when especially low figures are placed alongside information about minimum wage, while low-knowledge respondents were more susceptible to anchoring effects than high-knowledge ones. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Academic research on White Australia Policy and the Colombo Plan has spanned across the history of Asian migration, policy-making initiatives and Australia–India relations. But the role of popular transnational media images and stories that informs the sociocultural understanding of these relations has been under evaluated. In this article, using newspaper reports and notes of the tours, I highlight the building of popular perceptions under the Colombo Plan (1950–1957). By focusing on Indian journalists and editors, E. P. W. da Costa, J. N. Sahni, Frank Moraes, and Durga Das, this article contributes to the historiography of Australian–Indian relations. As these culture exchanges created a dialogue between the two countries that still influences the public opinion. The article concludes that journalists from both India and Australia sought to play a key role in image-making process and wanted a fresh start in relationship––politically, economically, sociologically and technologically. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany) had an ambivalent relationship with homosexuality. Under the principles of socialism, everyone was welcome to contribute to the greater good. The situation for queer people, here lesbians and gay men, was different: one of illegality and invisibility. A difficulty in analyzing these experiences is the theory and methodology necessary to find them and draw them together in a historical narrative. This essay offers a mode of analysis in which theories of affect illustrate long-term trends in East German conceptualizations of same-sex sexuality. By discussing a 1950 court ruling and a 1989 film, the essay demonstrates the persistence of homophobic prejudice and fear of homosexual seduction of young people and the links to historical and legal developments. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Surrogacy is beginning to generate public debate, and the way the media approach it may have negative effects on social attitudes toward gay parenting. The news media play a key role in informing society, especially about topics such as surrogacy, of which most audiences have no direct experience. The aim of our research is to explore opinion formation of surrogacy and gay parenting by analyzing the audience interpretation of a TV news story in Spain. To do this we conducted four focus groups that were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis based on the discourse produced by the participants. The results show that the framing strategies used in the news story contribute to advocating an attitude of repudiation toward surrogacy, with an adverse sentiment also extending to homosexual couples who wish to become parents. This leads us to discuss the role of media in shaping public opinion and the resulting potential consequences in the case of surrogacy and gay parenting. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Users frequently use search systems on the Web as well as online social media to learn about ongoing events and public opinion on personalities. Prior studies have shown that the top-ranked results returned by these search engines can shape user opinion about the topic (e.g., event or person) being searched. In case of polarizing topics like politics, where multiple competing perspectives exist, the political bias in the top search results can play a significant role in shaping public opinion towards (or away from) certain perspectives. Given the considerable impact that search bias can have on the user, we propose a generalizable search bias quantification framework that not only measures the political bias in ranked list output by the search system but also decouples the bias introduced by the different sources—input data and ranking system. We apply our framework to study the political bias in searches related to 2016 US Presidential primaries in Twitter social media search and find that both input data and ranking system matter in determining the final search output bias seen by the users. And finally, we use the framework to compare the relative bias for two popular search systems—Twitter social media search and Google web search—for queries related to politicians and political events. We end by discussing some potential solutions to signal the bias in the search results to make the users more aware of them. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Due in part to declining vaccination rates, in 2018 over 20 states reported at least one case of measles, and over 40,000 cases were confirmed in Europe. Anti-vaccine posts on social media may be facilitating anti-vaccination behaviour. This study aimed to systematically characterize (1) individuals known to publicly post anti-vaccination content on Facebook, (2) the information they convey, and (3) the spread of this content. Methods: Our data set consisted of 197 individuals who posted anti-vaccination comments in response to a message promoting vaccination. We systematically analysed publicly-available content using quantitative coding, descriptive analysis, social network analysis, and an in-depth qualitative assessment. The final codebook consisted of 26 codes; Cohen's κ ranged 0.71–1.0 after double-coding. Results: The majority (89%) of individuals identified as female. Among 136 individuals who divulged their location, 36 states and 8 other countries were represented. In a 2-mode network of individuals and topics, modularity analysis revealed 4 distinct sub-groups labelled as “trust,” “alternatives,” “safety,” and “conspiracy.” For example, a comment representative of “conspiracy” is that poliovirus does not exist and that pesticides caused clinical symptoms of polio. An example from the “alternatives” sub-group is that eating yogurt cures human papillomavirus. Deeper qualitative analysis of all 197 individuals’ profiles found that these individuals also tended to post material against other health-related practices such as water fluoridation and circumcision. Conclusions: Social media outlets may facilitate anti-vaccination connections and organization by facilitating the diffusion of centuries old arguments and techniques. Arguments against vaccination are diverse but remain consistent within sub-groups of individuals. It would be valuable for health professionals to leverage social networks to deliver more effective, targeted messages to different constituencies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Arguably, no issue evokes so much emotion amongst South Africans, post-1994, like the land and agrarian question. After going through various stages of ‘failed’ implementations of the land reform programme, the government decided to consider the path of land expropriation, with a Bill to that effect already passing the motion in Parliament. The Bill, which seeks to provide for the expropriation of property for a public purpose or in the public interest, was recently passed by the South African Parliament, with attendant discordant discourses amongst the populace. Given the vociferous nature of the South African media and its potential to influence public perception of sensitive social issues, this article undertakes a content analysis of media reportage of the land expropriation Bill with a bid to ascertain how it has impacted on public opinion and understanding of the Bill, and land reform in general. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Over the last decade, Europe’s immigration regulations have raised concerns regarding human rights and divided the public opinion on transnational movement, particularly with the ever-growing number of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean Sea. While the direct voices of migrants themselves are still often absent or marginalised in the debate, numerous European authors have mobilised in favour of a change in policies, portraying migrants’ and refugees’ stories in their works. This article addresses these complex cultural representations, acknowledging them as essential, albeit ambiguous, acts of solidarity. Drawing on the postcolonial notion of agency, and on the reflections on the representation of suffering subjects in humanitarian narratives, I will consider the cases of the Italian long poem Solo andata (One way only) by De Luca and the French novel Eldorado by Gaudé. While the authors’ choice to recreate the migrant’s perspective through fiction can be read as a strategy to re-humanise the protagonists of these journeys, I argue that such borrowing of the migrant’s story from a non-autobiographical, external viewpoint simultaneously risks further disempowering and silencing them, raising a number of ethical questions on authorship and advocacy whose implications, in literature as in other contemporary media, still remain to be urgently addressed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The changes brought about by the Digital Age have not triggered significant increases in political participation or meaningful reductions in longstanding social power asymmetries, which are now increasingly negotiated in policy contexts that involve mass media (surveillance, big data, net neutrality). At the same time, new technology and communication patterns have opened fissures in public opinion about the limits of free expression while also creating new legal risks for citizen-communicators. This article suggests that universities need to recalibrate their curricula to meet the exigencies of this moment, which should include an increased emphasis on media law and policy courses and initiatives. The article outlines a rationale for action, and some strategies, based on the need to: (1) expand citizens’ expressive agency by equipping them with the knowledge to shield themselves from overt restraints and subtle forms of coercion; (2) deepen citizens’ civics knowledge, enhance their political efficacy and enable their political participation; (3) facilitate citizens’ engagement in reemerging debates about the meaning and scope of the First Amendment; and (4) spur citizen involvement in confronting pressing constitutional and media policy issues whose resolution will ultimately shape the broader balance of social power. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Social media can be used not only for evaluating migration flows almost in real time and the degree of integration in the destination countries but also for the understanding of public opinion sentiment about immigration. Experiences based on scraping social media are reviewed, and the use of geo-located data and advertising platforms turns out to be the most promising opportunities supplied by these sources. The current challenge is to measure the sentiment of Italian-speaking twitterers toward migration. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - With the rise in nationalism and anti-immigration sentiments in Europe, debate has arisen in several national media when minority ethnic athletes opt to play for the national team of their country of origin. This article aims to examine how minority ethnic athletes who opt to play for the national team in their country of destination express and are ascribed national belonging. To do so, the article draws on Nira Yuval-Davis’ distinction between belonging and the politics of belonging as well as perspectives from transnational migration studies. The article is based on a single case study of Danish newspapers’ representations of the Danish women’s football player of Afghan origin, Nadia Nadim. In the build-up to, duration and aftermath of the UEFA Women’s Euro in 2017, Nadim was ascribed Danish identity, while her popularity as a player rose. However, the article points out how athletes who become exemplary others along ethnic and national lines are deprived of their transnational belonging and of their potentially critical voice. Further, the article discusses how ideas of national unity in sport are enacted in the media through apparently innocent descriptions of patriotism and national archetypes seeking to reconcile current divisions in European societies. © 2019 The British Society of Sports History.

AB  - African-American Muslims are well-known for their prison reform ministries and initiatives aimed at assisting disenfranchised men and women in inner city communities. In media discourse, the redemption narratives of young African-American Muslim men in these environments have often been stimulated by African-American Muslim leaders who function as highly influential fatherly figures that usually stress an importance of fatherhood in ameliorating juvenile delinquency and hopelessness. While fatherhood is a cherished institution among Muslim families, this analysis focuses on depictions of father-son relationships among African-American Muslim men in film and television. This study examines relationships between Muslim sons and non-Muslim fathers, Muslim fathers and non-Muslim sons, and fathers and sons who both embrace Islam throughout these visual narratives. In exploring these relationships, the article examines the impact of African-American Muslim fathers on their sons’ faith and spiritual development, negotiation of masculinity, management of racism, confrontation of Islamophobia, and maintenance of discipline, social mobility, and life skills. © 2019, © 2019 University of Birmingham.

AB  - Though Central Asia is often studied through the prism of its relationships with external powers, research on local public perceptions of these different actors has largely been overlooked. The literature on Kazakhstanis’ perceptions of their neighbours, for instance, is scarce, and mostly focused on analysis of official discourse on Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy, with little exploration of how this is received, appropriated or refuted by the population. On the basis of Gallup data spanning the last decade, and several other surveys, we test most of the main hypotheses usually advanced to explain attitudes to the US and Russia–age, ethnicity and access to information–and draw five main conclusions: (1) Kazakhstanis are not defined by an exclusive pro-US/pro-Russian dichotomy; (2) they nevertheless largely choose Russia over the US if forced to pick; (3) age does not have a significant effect on foreign policy attitudes; (4) ethnicity does affect some of the attitudes under consideration, but its effects are not large enough to produce markedly different opinions among ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Russians in aggregate; and (5) consumption of media from Russia and access to non-governmental and Western sources of information do not seem to have significant effects on the attitudes under consideration. © 2019, © 2019 Southseries Inc.

AB  - Earlier studies on ideological congruence mostly rely on public opinion surveys to measure voter ideology, while politicians' ideology is measured by instruments such as roll call votes, expert surveys, and legislative texts. One crucial problem with such approaches is that the tools used to measure the elites' ideology are not identical to those used to measure the voters' ideology. The rapid growth of social media use offers a unique opportunity to directly examine the ideological overlap of elites and the electorate on a common platform using a common technique. This study examines over four million Twitter posts by legislative candidates from four major Turkish parties and their supporters between 2012 and 2016. After applying machine-learning algorithms to clean non-political content from the data, we employ Wordfish text scaling technique to extract the policy positions and compare the party positions to those of other parties and to those of their supporters. © 2019, © 2019 McDougall Trust, London.

AB  - Empirical studies rarely examine the reasons why some South Africans choose to vote at elections and others not. In South Africa’s early democratic elections scholars assumed that voting was an expression of group loyalties or strong party loyalties. However, the decline in turnout in recent elections appears to contradict these socio-psychological explanations. Using 2014 post-election public opinion data, the paper addresses this research lacuna in the South African literature by testing several theories of voter participation. It finds that the influence of one’s social networks and, to a lesser extent, psychological engagement with politics are central to voter turnout. Trade unions and churches, and political parties, despite their obvious efforts to mobilise voters, make little impact on the decision to vote. Media exposure is a weak mobiliser but perceptions of media bias are important, suggesting that people filter out or select among media sources to suit their partisan proclivities, and this exercise in itself encourages turnout. © 2019, © 2019 South African Association of Political Studies.

AB  - Billions of hours of YouTube content are viewed every day. Much of this content is aimed at entertainment, some of it is educational, and a considerable quantity is meant to influence or reinforce public opinion on a variety of matters, including health. Most of the content on YouTube is not created by professionals, public institutions or the traditional media, and instead is authored by private individual content creators. Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating health information, it is important for researchers and public health practitioners to understand the nature of health information as it is shared on YouTube. The primary objective of this research is to describe expressions of vaccine hesitancy content on YouTube, and specifically, compare the expression of pro- and anti-immunization sentiments. We do this by not only analyzing a systematic sample of influenza and measles immunization videos in terms of viewer analytics, but also by choice of language. We find that pro- and anti-immunization videos are common, but that videos with anti-immunization sentiment tend to be more ‘liked’. We also find that a small number of words can be effectively used to identify anti-immunization content, an observation that could be useful for identifying trends in anti-immunization sentiment on social media. Our results suggest that public health experts may need to increase the profile of their content on YouTube, and that there may be some useful strategies for improving the public's disposition towards pro-immunization messaging. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines how the issue of game regulation has been discussed and influenced public perception by exploring ideologically differing media outlets’ distinct uses of frames by analyzing news contents (N = 1,217) and public opinion survey of the national sample of Korean gamers (N = 1,362), who play games currently. The analyses include the influence of media on attitudes toward game regulation, perception of games, and frame adoption, based on the results of news content analysis. The study found that (a) mainstream media was ambivalent about game issues and tended to define gaming and gamers in sensationalistic ways; (b) while the dynamics of media effects on public attitudes toward game regulation are complex, exposure to game-related news content significantly impacted public attitudes; mass media that highlight the negative aspects of games have strong impacts on public perception toward games, which may ultimately affect attitudes toward game regulation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Multicultural competence is a cornerstone of modern day counseling psychology. The new multicultural and social justice competencies highlight the integration of social justice and multicultural frameworks. These competencies include community engagement through social justice advocacy. Social media may be one way to advocate for social justice for underserved or marginalized communities. Social media networks impact in the Arab Spring and the 2016 United States (U.S.) Presidential election suggests that people may utilize social media to inform and act on their social or political views. Throughout this article, we will explore the benefits of social media for raising critical consciousness, as defined by Freire, and examine how counseling psychologists can utilize social media to engage in social justice advocacy in diverse communities. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Much of the research on African-Americans’ HPV vaccine acceptance has largely focused on racial/ethnic differences related to cognitive, socio-economical, and structural factors that contribute to differences in HPV vaccine acceptance and completion. A growing body of literature suggest that cultural factors, such as mistrust of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the healthcare system, religion, and social norms related to appropriate sexual behaviors, also plays a prominent role in their HPV vaccine acceptance. However, these studies were limited in their use of theoretical approaches necessary to conceptualize and operationalize culture. Objective: To explore the influence of culture on African-American mothers’ and daughters’ HPV vaccine acceptance using the PEN-3, a culturally-centered conceptual framework. Methods: Grounded theory techniques were used to explore cultural factors that influenced the acceptance of the HPV vaccine among African-American mothers (n = 28) and their daughters (n = 34). Results: Positive attitudes towards vaccination stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine has cancer prevention benefits and that vaccinations in general protected against infectious diseases. Negative attitudes stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine was too new, not effective, daughters were too young, and that vaccines were not a one-size-fits-all intervention. Majority of mothers and daughters indicated that their religious doctrine did not impede their HPV vaccination decisions. For a few mothers, religious beliefs could not be separated from their HPV vaccination decisions and ultimately deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. HCP recommendations were valued however mothers were often dissatisfied with the detail of information communicated. Support networks provided both positive and negative types of social support to mothers and daughters. The media highlighted the cancer prevention benefits of the HPV vaccine and unintentionally communicated negative information of the HPV vaccine, which deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Study findings can inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that advances the evidence on cervical cancer prevention. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article examines how the media represents women and men who have left their home countries to join ISIS. It will look at the dual phenomenon of ‘Jihadi Brides’ and ‘Foreign Fighters’, both terms coined by the media, and seek to uncover gender discrimination inherent therein. Beyond gender stereotypes, it will also examine Islamophobic and Orientalist tropes that add an additional layer of othering to Muslim women. The theoretical framework used in this study will be Framing Theory, frameworks which look at women in violent organizations, Systemic Functional Linguistics and Critical Discourse Analysis. The thesis will use Corpus Linguistics, as a methodology to achieve its results, using the publicly available News on the Web (NOW) corpus as a database. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - The distribution and consumption of transgender time-lapse videos on YouTube have increased over the last few decades, providing trans communities with a valuable resource for self-making. On YouTube, vloggers can present images and videos of their bodies as they document their gender transitions through several practices that rely on temporality and time-space compression. As a genre, time-lapse videos comprise creative worldmaking practices where users document their gender transformations using hundreds to thousands of still photos or video segments which show their social, somatic, and biochemical changes. Although scholars have discussed different worldmaking and community organising practices that take place as trans vloggers display their gendered subjectivities online, there is sparse scholarship studying the recurrent patterns of behaviour on the comment space below these videos. In this article, I draw on critical discourse analytic studies of new media and stance-taking as I review and analyse discriminatory strategies – principally misgendering and ungendering – that YouTubers used to denigrate the self-identified gender of a given vlogger. Stance-taking enables us to identify and track reoccurring attitudes steeped in cisgenderism. At the same time, capturing how vloggers and trans allies respond to (intentional or unintentional) text-based forms of prejudice, can create teachable moments for YouTube spectators. While misgendering stances aim to pressure their targets into certain kinds of gender and sex embodiments, insurrectionary stance-acts co-opt and call out the language of discrimination, lending legitimacy and authority to trans vloggers to create, enact, and live their own genders. © Matthew Bruce Ingram.

AB  - This article explores Kenyan citizens' right to know details about sensitive security-related information in the context of a new era of social media warfare. It considers the public communications response to Al Shabaab's January 2016 attack on Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) personnel in El Adde, Somalia, and then to a similar attack in Kulbiyow a year later. Drawing on Twitter posts, an official account of Kenya's military activities in Somalia, and-unusually for the study of social media-on 'offline' methods of qualitative data collection, it asks why the KDF did not provide real-time updates about the El Adde attack, but did provide information about the assault on Kulbiyow? Three plausible explanations for the KDF's differing response are considered. First, at the time of El Adde, the KDF was inexperienced in terms of social media communication. Second, El Adde taught the KDF that in order not to lose the all-important public opinion, it had to match its enemy and also disseminate credible information. Finally, the strengthening voice of Kenyan citizens and the potential for further reputational damage pushed the KDF from a 'need-to-know' frame of mind in terms of its sharing of information, to more of a 'right-to-know' mentality. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: This study analyzed the health technology trends and sentiments of users using Twitter data in an attempt to examine the public’s opinions and identify their needs. Methods: Twitter data related to health technology, from January 2010 to October 2016, were collected. An ontology related to health technology was developed. Frequently occurring keywords were analyzed and visualized with the word cloud technique. The keywords were then reclassified and analyzed using the developed ontology and sentiment dictionary. Python and the R program were used for crawling, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. Results: In the developed ontology, the keywords are divided into ‘health technology’ and ‘health in-formation’. Under health technology, there are are six subcategories, namely, health technology, wearable technology, biotechnology, mobile health, medical technology, and telemedicine. Under health information, there are four subcategories, namely, health information, privacy, clinical informatics, and consumer health informatics. The number of tweets about health technology has consistently increased since 2010; the number of posts in 2014 was double that in 2010, which was about 150 thousand posts. Posts about mHealth accounted for the majority, and the dominant words were ‘care’, ‘new’, ‘mental’, and ‘fit-ness’. Sentiment analysis by subcategory showed that most of the posts in nearly all subcategories had a positive tone with a positive score. Conclusions: Interests in mHealth have risen recently, and consequently, posts about mHealth were the most frequent. Examining social media users’ responses to new health technology can be a useful method to understand the trends in rapidly evolving fields. © 2019 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.

AB  - A political landscape of any country has always been complex in nature, this complexity can be attributed to several factors such as number of parties, policies and most importantly mixed public sentiment. The rise of social media has given people all around the world to converse and debate with a very large audience, the sheer amount of exposure a tweet or a post received is unprecedented. Recent development in the field of deep learning has led to its usage in several different verticals. Techniques like LSTM allow for performing a sentiment analysis of the posts. This can be used to predict the overall sentiment of the masses in relation to a political party or an individual. Several studies have shown how to approximately predict public opinion, such as in political elections, by analyzing user activities in blogging platforms and on-line social networks. Machine learning has a dramatic growth in recent years and it has been applied in every technology from self-driving cars to e health sectors. We proposed a machine learning models to predict the chances of the winning the upcoming election based on the user or supporter opinions on the social media platform. In Social media the supporter or user express their opinion or feedback post for their favorite’s party or opposite party. We have to collect the text posts regarding the election and political campaigns, then we have created the machine learning models to predict the results. © BEIESP.

AB  - Despite concerns about the effects of pro-Russian disinformation on Western public opinion, evidence of its reach remains scarce. We hypothesize that conservative individuals will be more likely than liberals to be potentially exposed to pro-Russian disinformation in digital networks. We evaluate the hypothesis using a large data set of U.S.based Twitter users, testing how ideology is associated with disinformation about the 2014 crash of the MH17 aircraft over eastern Ukraine. We find that potential exposure to disinformation is concentrated among the most conservative individuals. Moving from the most liberal to the most conservative individuals in the sample is associated with a change in the conditional probability of potential exposure to disinformation from 6.5% to 45.2%. We corroborate the finding using a second, validated data set on individual party registration. The results indicate that the reach of online, pro-Russian disinformation into U.S. audiences is distinctly ideologically asymmetric. © The Author(s) (2019).

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes toward men who have sexually offended (MSO) between the general public and professionals and paraprofessionals in forensic settings. Background: Existing research shows a number of different factors that appear to be important in the development, maintenance, and deterioration of attitudes toward MSO. The exploration of such factors requires further exploration. Method: A convenience sample was used for the cross-sectional study. Five hundred fifty-three participants were recruited from the general public and forensic hospitals, both private and National Health Service. An online version of the Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders scale (Hogue, 1993) was distributed via email and social media. Results: Gender was not found to have any impact on the attitudes individuals held toward MSO. The general public was found to have significantly more negative attitudes when compared with those exposed to MSO at work (professional and paraprofessional staff). Duration of employment did not make attitudes any more or less positive. Conclusion: The clinical and societal implications of the research are important for MSO to reduce risk within forensic establishments and be supported to reintegrate successfully into the community. Without the support from both staff and the general public at each stage of rehabilitation, desistance is less likely to be maintained. Research continues to provide varying results regarding the factors that influence the nature of attitudes toward MSO. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Introduction: Public health education strives to transform and empower students to engage in policy and practice improvement. However, little is known of the nature of such change among students, especially when studying Aboriginal health and wellbeing, which may involve disrupting long held assumptions and prejudices. This article reports findings regarding the feasibility, specificity and sensitivity of the Growth and Empowerment Measure (GEM) in the evaluation of two innovative Australian 13-week postgraduate public health electives focused on Aboriginal health and wellbeing. The GEM's 14-item Emotional Empowerment Scale (EES14) and its subscales Inner Peace and Self-Capacity, and 12 Scenarios (S12) and its subscales Healing and Growth and Connection and Purpose were used to examine transformative experiences. A new short form of the S12, the Core6, was also trialled as a briefer measure of functional empowerment. Methods: Pre-course GEM responses and demographic information were collected from consenting students during the mandatory, face-to-face workshops of the Aboriginal public health Perspectives course and the Aboriginal empowerment and wellbeing Lifespan course. The two-day Perspectives course workshop introduced a group scenario-building activity towards ending health inequality. Lifespan students experienced a 3-day immersion based on Stage 1 of the Aboriginal Family Well Being empowerment program. Insights from both workshops were further integrated through structured online discussions and written assessments. At the end of semester, a post-course GEM was mailed to students for completion and return. Students could also provide feedback through evaluation surveys and semistructured focus groups. Effect sizes were assessed using paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and multiple ANOVA. Cronbach's alpha confirmed internal consistency. Results: Baseline GEM data was provided for 147 out of a total of 194 workshop experiences from participating students. Twenty students attended workshops for both Perspectives and Lifespan. Fifty-five matched pairs (representing 52 individual participants) were obtained from 170 students who completed one or both courses. Statistically significant positive change of small to medium effect size was detected in all GEM scales, subscales and some individual items. Lifespan yielded larger effects than Perspectives, most markedly on two subscales: Inner Peace, and Connection and Purpose. Participating students reported significant growth in the Scenario item 'knowing and being who I am' following Perspectives and Lifespan. Those completing Perspectives also reported a significant increase in 'gaining voice and being heard', consistent with its action-oriented scenario-building assessment. In contrast, the psychosocial development approach embedded in Lifespan stimulated strong development in spirituality, responding constructively to judgement, appreciating empowerment in their communities and skills to make changes in their lives. Feedback indicated that students valued these personal and professional growth experiences. Conclusion: The GEM was sensitive and specific in measuring components of empowering change among participants. Challenges included low post-course response rates that limited extrapolation to overall course impact, and attention needed to starting point when comparing the increment of change. The GEM is a promising tool for studying postgraduate courses designed to stimulate transformative learning, wellbeing and cultural competence through empowerment, and relevant in the education of health professionals in the fields of Aboriginal and rural health. © 2019, ARHEN - Australian Rural Health Education Network Ltd.

AB  - Background: Incidents of violence against medical staff have increased in intensity, showing the deteriorating relationship between doctors and patients in China over the past few years. In addition, professional–patient relations have been significantly affected in the Internet era in China, which has attracted great attention from many scholars. This study aims to analyze the research status of professional–patient relations in the Internet era in China and further reveal its research pattern and trends. Methods: This study collected journal articles published during the past 21 years from the Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform. Then, bibliometric analysis was carried out, including publication growth, core author and collaborative degree, highly cited papers, journal distribution, and institution distribution analyses. We also analyzed the subject heading–source literature matrix and co-occurrence matrix of keywords through hierarchical cluster, social network, and strategic diagram analyses. Results: The number of articles has continually risen since 1998, which follows the growth law of literature. Furthermore, the distribution of these studies obeys Bradford’s law of scattering, and mainly concentrates on the fields of medicine and health technology. The distribution of high-frequency keywords follows Zipf’s law. Conclusions: We identified eight focal research directions, namely: website building (especially for professional–patient interaction), telemedicine, professional–patient communication and network public opinion, professional–patient contradiction and health education, new media, follow-up interaction platform, healthcare reform and computer network, and medical ethics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Social media has been used as data resource in a growing number of health-related research. The objectives of this study were to identify content volume and sentiment polarity of social media records relevant to healthcare services in China. A list of the key words of healthcare services were used to extract data from WeChat and Qzone, between June 2017 and September 2017. The data were put into a corpus, where content analyses were performed using Tencent natural language processing (NLP). The final corpus contained approximately 29 million records. Records on patient safety were the most frequently mentioned topic (approximately 8.73 million, 30.1% of the corpus), with the contents on humanistic care having received the least social media references (0.43 Million, 1.5%). Sentiment analyses showed 36.1%, 16.4%, and 47.4% of positive, neutral, and negative emotions, respectively. The doctor-patient relationship category had the highest proportion of negative contents (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Neutral disposition was found to be the highest (30.4%) in the contents on appointment-booking services. This study added evidence to the magnitude and direction of public perceptions on healthcare services in China’s hospital and pointed to the possibility of monitoring healthcare service improvement, using readily available data in social media. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Social media play an important role in plastic surgery, yet there are limited studies in the literature to guide plastic surgeons' social networking practices. To address this deficiency and provide further insight, the authors set out to investigate the public's attitude toward plastic surgery using Twitter, a popular social media platform. The authors examined a large body of messages (tweets) related to plastic surgery using novel techniques of natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Methods: The authors collected over 1 million tweets with the keywords “plastic,” “cosmetic,” “aesthetic,” and “reconstruction” surgery spanning from 2012 to 2016 from the Twitter Gardenhose feed. Using hedonometrics, the authors extracted the average happiness/positivity (havg) of tweets and created word-shift graphs to determine the most influential words. Results: The positivity scores for keywords “plastic,” “cosmetic,” “aesthetic,” and “reconstruction” surgery were 5.72, 6.00, 6.16, and 6.09, respectively. In relation to “plastic,” keywords “cosmetic” and “aesthetic” were more positive because they lacked antagonistic words, such as “fake,” “ugly,” “bad,” “fails,” or “wrong.” The keyword “reconstruction,” however, was more positively associated than the term “plastic” because of an increase in positive words, such as “honor,” “amazing,” “successful,” and “respect.” Conclusions: Tweets containing the term “plastic” surgery trended toward negativity, and may be explained by the increase in unfavorable, associative words. Conversely, related terms such as “aesthetic,” “cosmetic,” and “reconstruction” were more favorably regarded because of the lack of antagonistic words and the presence of supportive words. The authors' results are informative and may serve to guide plastic surgeons' social media practices. © 2019 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons

AB  - Population growth (PG) is one of the drivers of the environmental crisis and underlies almost every environmental problem. Despite its causative role in environmental challenges, it has gained little attention from popular media, public and government agenda, or even from environmental organizations. There is a gap between the gravity of the problem and its relative absence from the public discourse that stems, inter alia, from the fact that the very discussion of the subject raises many sensitive, complex and ethical questions. The education system is a key player in filling this gap, and teachers have an opportunity to facilitate the discussion in this important issue. While educators mostly agree to include controversial environmental topics in school curricula, calls for addressing PG remain rare. This study explores teachers' perspectives of PG as a problem and their attitudes towards including it in their teaching, focusing on environmental and non-environmental teachers. While perceiving PG as an environmental problem and supporting its inclusion in schools was significantly higher among the environmental-teachers, similar concerns were reported by all the teachers concerning engaging students in discourse around this controversial issue. This consensus indicates the limited impact of knowledgeability on teachers' intentions to address PG in class. Teachers' challenges reflect the dominant Israeli sociocultural norms, religious values and the national pronatalist ideologies. The findings demonstrate how the absence of PG from the public discourse and from school curricula influences teachers' motivation to address it in class. This study highlights the necessity to encourage teachers to address PG in their teaching, even in this reality, by providing them with appropriate tools that will enable them to successfully engage students in this controversial issue. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Dockless bike sharing is an emerging paradigm. Like many other technologies, it brings advantages and disadvantages to communities. Further investigation into public opinion will shed light on the impact of this technology on communities and provide input to city authorities for transportation planning. Transportation planning processes can be enhanced by engaging the community through social media technologies. Social media like Twitter, Facebook, and other microblogging media have been used for planning, but have not been extensively evaluated for that purpose. This study examined approximately 32,000 posts on Twitter to assess public opinion on dockless bike-sharing systems. Using a mix of text mining and statistical techniques, we examined relevant posts to determine the sentiment polarity of tweets, the underlying topics in the tweets, and the extent of engagement and impact on the decision-making process. Results given by two different sentiment algorithms show that there is more positive than negative polarity across the algorithms. Also, the findings show that the underlying topics in tweets include electric scooters, private e-hailing companies, and blockage of sidewalks, among others. The results indicate that the dockless shared mobility models are potentially useful in generating participation, but faced substantial technical, analytical, and communication barriers to influencing decision-making. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.

AB  - Epidemics of infectious disease can be traced back to the early days of mankind. Only in the last two centuries vaccination has become a viable strategy to prevent such epidemics. In addition to the clinical efficacy of this strategy, the behavior and public attitudes affect the success of vaccines. This paper describes modeling the efficacy of vaccination considering the cost and benefit of vaccination to individual players. The model is based on the public goods game and is presented as a spatial game on a lattice. Using this model, individuals can contribute to the public health by paying the cost of vaccination or choose to be protected by the public who is vaccinated rather than pay the cost and share the risk of vaccination. Thus, in this model individuals can choose to stay susceptible, can become infected, or choose to vaccinate once in each episode. This paper presents the behavioral changes of the population and the cost to the society as a function of the cost of vaccines, cost of being infected, and the 'fear factor' created by the public media. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Background Media can influence public and policy-makers' perceptions of causes of, and solutions to, public health issues through selective presentation and framing. Childhood obesity is a health issue with both individual-level and societal-level drivers and solutions, but public opinion and mass media representations of obesity have typically focused on individual-level framings, at the cost of acknowledgement of a need for regulatory action. Objective and setting To understand the salience and framing of childhood obesity across 19 years of UK national newspaper content. Design and outcome measures Quantitative content analysis of 757 articles about childhood obesity obtained from six daily and five Sunday newspapers. Articles were coded manually for definitions, drivers and potential solutions. Data were analysed statistically, including analysis of time trends and variations by political alignment of source. Results The frequency of articles grew from a low of two in 1996 to a peak of 82 in 2008, before declining to 40 in 2010. Individual-level drivers (59.8%) and solutions (36.5%) were mentioned more frequently than societal-level drivers (28.3%) and solutions (28.3%) across the sample, but societal solutions were mentioned more frequently during the final 8 years, coinciding with a marked decline in yearly frequency of articles. Conclusions Increased focus on societal solutions aligns with public health goals, but coincided with a reduction in the issue's salience in the media. Those advocating public policy solutions to childhood obesity may benefit from seeking to raise the issue's media profile while continuing to promote structural conceptualisations of childhood obesity. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - The birth of Louise Brown, the world's first 'test-Tube baby', has come to signify the moment at which technologically assisted human reproduction became a re ality. This was a highly mediated and visible reality, as this article explores through the example of a British television documentary about Louise Brown broadcast when she was just six weeks old, 'To Mrs Brown.. A Daughter' (Thames Television, 1978). In the article, I discuss the programme alongside data from an interview with its producer, Peter Williams. Williams sought to convince the public that IVF was morally acceptable and to cultivate sympathy for the infertile through this film. I will consider how he went about this by focusing on the programme's visual presentation of Louise Brown, Peter Williams' aims in making the film and his sympathetic relationship with the 'pioneers' of IVF, gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe and physiologist Robert Edwards. I will conclude with a discussion ofÂ the political implications of this film andÂ how it contributed to the normalisation of IVF at a pivotal moment in its history. © The Author 2019.

AB  - This paper seeks to explore the reasons for the low impact of nosocomial infection in the mainstream media and the responsibilities of physicians and journalists in terms of this situation. To this end, a small group of 13 experts met for round-table discussions, including physicians with expertise in nosocomial infection, medical lawsuits and ethics, as well as journalists from major mainstream Spanish media outlets. The various participants were asked a series of questions prior to the meeting, which were answered in writing by one of the speakers and discussed during the meeting by the whole group, the aim being to obtain consensual conclusions for each of them. The document was subsequently reviewed, edited and forwarded to all co-authors for their agreement. The opinions expressed are the personal opinions of the participants and not necessarily those of the institutions in which they work or with which they collaborate. © The Author 2019.

AB  - Democratic publics have always struggled to constrain their elected leaders’ foreign policy actions. By its nature, foreign policy creates information asymmetries that disadvantage citizens in favor of leaders. But has this disadvantage deepened with the advent of the Internet and the resulting fundamental changes in the media and politics? We argue that it has. The current information and political environments erode constraint by inclining constituents to reflexively and durably back “their” leaders and disapprove of opposition. These changes make it harder for citizens to infor-mationally “catch up” with and constrain leaders because views that contradict citizens’ beliefs are less likely to break through when media are fragmented and siloed. These changes have important implications for theories concerning the democratic peace, audience costs, rally effects, and diversionary war. They may also contribute to instability in foreign policy by contributing to sudden and destabilizing changes in public opinion that undercut commitments abroad. © 2019 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - An epidemic is a typical public health emergency that refers to the occurrence and rapid spread of disease. A good epidemic transmission model plays a crucial role in preventing an epidemic. The epidemic transmission model is largely similar to the model of sentiment analysis and transmission on social media. Therefore, this paper intend to use the method of deep learning to explore the key issues of theme and sentiment analysis from the perspective of public opinion analysis. In order to fully extract the features automatically, we combine the following methods: multi-channel inputs, multi-granularity convolution kernels, direct connection with high-speed channels, and this paper proposes the multi-channel and multi-kernel (MCMK) model. Furthermore, we leverage generative adversarial nets to combine several single tasks, called Joint-MCMK model, which achieves information sharing and improves the training speed and model accuracy. To verify the validity of our proposed models, this paper experimented with the short text topic classification dataset TREC [1] and the sentiment analysis dataset IMDB [2]. Results achieved 98.6% and 92.6% respectively, which are superior to the highest existing industry benchmark (96.1% and 92.58%). In addition, this paper compared the training spread differences between the joint-MCMK model and MCMK model, which shows that the joint-MCMK model has better performance at training speed. Finally, the control variable method was used to analyze the multiple effects of the different factors. The optimal value of some relevant parameters in our models were verified by several experiments. © 2019

AB  - Sri Lanka is a biodiversity hotspot with high human density that contributes to increasing human-monkey conflict (HMC). In 50 years of primate studies there, the development of HMC has been documented, and many workshops and interventions organized to ameliorate HMC. These activities prompted the present survey. In the extensive lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka, the affected nonhuman primates are the toque macaque, gray and purple-faced langurs and slender loris. We surveyed and evaluated the attitudes of rural residents towards these four species in an effort to contribute to an ethnoprimatological approach to conservation, i.e., promote a coexistence and sharing of habitat between humans and monkeys. We selected 13 villages near Polonnaruwa, located centrally in the dry zone. The four nonhuman primate species differ in their behavioral ecologies, and this influenced how frequently they were thought of as pests. Most HMC was with the macaque and gray langur, less with the purple-faced langur and least with the loris. The underlying sentiment among stakeholders towards monkeys was generally either neutral or positive. Nonetheless, the majority (80%) of people desired a translocation of the troublesome monkeys from their properties to protected areas, which is impractical. Few (< 1%) openly wanted monkeys destroyed. While a traditional reverence for monkeys provides a solid basis for science and media-based education, it also contributes to the feeding of monkeys and consequent unnatural population growth, and enhanced HMC. Public understanding of the underlying causes of HMC was poor, hindering effective solutions. A combination of a feeding ban, possibly contraceptive intervention at localized HMC trouble spots, and extensive education may be the only benign alternatives to the destruction of wild primates by a powerful minority. Coexistence through strengthening and expansion of exclusive suitable protected habitats for all wildlife is a priority. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper empirically explores the link between mass media coverage of migration and immigration worries. Using detailed data on media coverage in Germany, we show that the amount of media reports regarding migration issues is positively associated with concerns about immigration among the German population. This association is strongest when immigrants are the protagonists of media reports. The established relationship is robust to the inclusion of time-variant individual control variables and individual fixed-effects. We address endogeneity concerns by employing media spillovers from the neighboring country of Switzerland, which occur due to referendum decisions on immigration, as an instrumental variable. The IV estimates suggest that media coverage has a causal impact on immigration worries. The effect of media coverage persists even when worries concerning unemployment, crime or the level of xenophobia are accounted for. Exploring subgroups of respondents reveals that the link between coverage and immigration worries is particularly relevant for women and respondents who are not active in the workforce. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growth of partisan news sources has raised concerns that people will increasingly select attitude-consistent information, which might lead to increasing political polarization. Thus far, there is limited research on the long-term mutual influences between selective exposure and political attitudes. To remedy this, this study investigates the reciprocal influences between selective exposure and political attitudes over several years, using a three-wave panel survey conducted in Sweden during 2014–2016. More specifically, we analyse how ideological selective exposure to both traditional and online news media influences citizens’ ideological leaning. Findings suggest that (1) people seek-out ideologically consistent print news and online news and (2) such attitude-consistent news exposure reinforces citizens’ ideological leaning over time. In practice, however, such reinforcement effects are hampered by (3) relatively low overall ideological selective exposure and a (4) significant degree of cross-cutting news exposure online. These findings are discussed in light of selective exposure theory and the reinforcing spirals model. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A lightning victory by combined Austro-German forces in October 1917 threatened to knock Italy out of the war. This was the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo, often called ‘Caporetto’. General Luigi Cadorna, the chief of general staff, branded army units as cowards and blamed them for the disaster. His accusation met with dismay at home and sympathy mixed with disdain abroad. Investigation quickly gave the lie to Cadorna, yet the stain persisted. In Britain, the prime minister and the head of the armed forces disagreed about the causes of Caporetto, as did also the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the future politician Hugh Dalton. Analysis of the dissemination, reception and legacy of Cadorna’s message in Italy and Britain reveals something about military-political relations, class attitudes, media systems and national prejudice. ©2019 The Historical Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The borders of Europe are erected and guarded through cultural practices as much as through border control and security technologies. Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Similar to the rest of Europe, multicultural programming in Finland has become risky for public broadcasting. Programs aimed at encouraging social inclusion may not attract sufficiently large audiences and may be attacked by ever louder anti-immigration voices. This article focuses on what seems to be an exception in this respect: Ali and Husu. Hosted by immigrants from Iran and Somalia – a stand-up comedian and a politician – this popular talk show aired on Finnish public radio between 2013 and 2016. Through interviews with the producers and the analysis of a selection of episodes, we examine Ali and Husu’s daring and unapologetic ethnic/racial humor as well as its combination of funny and serious talk. Our findings underscore specific ways in which multicultural programming can use humor strategically to engage relatively large and diverse audiences in discussions meant to humanize immigrants and challenge social prejudices, while minimizing right-wing criticism and unintended readings. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Conflicts over natural resource use and management often arise where groups have different goals or priorities. The media can play an important dual role in these conflicts; article content might offer insights about public opinion, whilst media may shape debates and how issues are perceived by the public and decision-makers. Wildlife farming is a contentious conservation tool attracting the attention of worldwide media, and associated conflicts among different interest groups may undermine its applicability. We investigated the media's portrayal of the Cayman Turtle Farm (CTF), a facility in the Cayman Islands which breeds green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) for human consumption, to investigate how the media presents information about wildlife farming (i.e. framing), consider its potential roles influencing conflicts and explore how it can be used for conservation conflict management. Content analysis was used to compare framing, article valence, and stakeholder representation in 634 newspaper articles from the international and local media. These media stories were framed in terms of: tourism, conflict, conservation, culture/community, management, and utilisation. International articles most often described CTF as a tourism facility. However, during a media campaign by an international animal welfare group, CTF was also often depicted as a source of controversy. Trade in turtle products was mostly debated in older articles. Local media mainly had a financial focus. Conflict framing was associated with a negative article valence, and conflict framed articles were significantly more likely to contain no conservation information. Mentions of environmental interest groups were significantly associated with negative articles, whereas academics were significantly more likely to be mentioned in positive articles. Conservationists must consider stakeholder objectives from the outset of interventions and be aware of the multiple roles the media might play. Media analysis and effectively harnessing the potential of media outlets should be considered as tools for managing conservation conflicts. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Newspapers are influential sources of information and opinion on mental health, but careless reporting may reinforce stigma. This review examined portrayals of mental disorder in Saudi Arabian newspapers. A cross-sectional sample (N = 200) of relevant articles was obtained from four of the most popular newspapers. These were categorised for descriptive and thematic analysis, using an established framework. The theme of highest frequency was advocacy, actions, and concerns; such articles were likely to have a positive impact by raising public awareness. Similarly, numerous reports with the theme of treatment and recovery informed readers of developments in mental health care, potentially breaking down barriers to seeking help. The theme of blame was found in a quarter of the articles; in addition to discussing environmental and genetic factors, there were several commentaries or reports on spiritual possession, which could perpetuate stigmatising ideas. While portrayals of mental disorder in Saudi newspapers show similarities to media coverage in other countries, distinct cultural perspectives were evident, including the prevailing notion of the ‘evil eye’. The authors recommend collaboration of mental health experts, patients and family carers to devise guidelines for more accurate reporting of mental disorder by Saudi media. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Crash-landings are a recurrent theme in Ghanaian witchcraft discourse. In the society’s witchcraft lore, these are inadvertently aborted flights of maleficent witches en route to secret nocturnal witches’ assemblies or to carry out diabolical deeds. While those accused of being witches who have crash-landed invariably face severe mistreatment, no study has systematically explored this purported phenomenon. In this article, I describe the results of an analysis of 10 cases of alleged crash-landings of witches that were reported in the Ghanaian media over a 12-year period. In addition to identifying the common characteristics associated with the alleged crash-landings, I provide a summary description of each case. The results show that the alleged witches were overwhelmingly female, elderly, and poor, and suffered from grave psychopathological conditions. Policy implications of the findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study employed digital footprints to explore why people engage in genetically modified (GM) food rumormongering on Chinese social media, Sina Weibo at both the group level and individual level. 9070 posts about GM food were obtained from 1 million users. Social network analysis was used to analyze the effect of peer influence on GM food rumormongering at the group level, and we did not find any effect that users would depend on their friendship network on social media to spread GM food rumors. To determine the effect of social media extravert, reputation and attitude on scientific rumormongering at the individual level, we used logistic regression. Results revealed that people who hold negative attitudes towards GM food and who are social media extraverts are more likely to spread rumors, while social reputation did not influence the spread of rumors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a growing trend among online news outlets to include Twitter posts as an equivalent to the traditional “vox pop” or “man-on-the-street” interview. Media effects research has documented the ability of vox pops to influence consumer perceptions of news issues within the traditional media environment, but there is limited research on the possible effects that including social media exemplars as vox pops within editorially curated articles might have on issue perceptions. Drawing on the exemplification effects literature to inform the experimental design, we conduct two studies on two topics of either low or high national salience and find strong evidence that vox pop tweets can influence perceptions of public opinion and, indirectly, readers’ own opinions on an issue. Results are discussed in light of implications for journalistic practice, media effects research and the wider democratic process. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The use of social media has risen exponentially in Asia in the past decade, but there have been few comparative studies examining social media news engagement in the region. We use online survey data to examine the relationships among political social networks, internal political efficacy, and social media news engagement in six countries (Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore). Findings across the samples showed that individuals in political social networks comprising cross-cutting and like-minded political views engage in social media news more, and internal political efficacy accentuated the relationships between cross-cutting/like-minded political social networks and engagement. Implications for the findings are discussed in relation to current debates on the potential for social media news engagement to engender a more deliberative democracy; or lead to greater ideological segregation and echo chambers in social media spaces. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - A common feature among populist parties and movements is their negative perspective on the media’s role in society. This paper analyzes whether citizens with a populist worldview also hold negative attitudes toward the media. From a theoretical point of view, the paper shows that both the anti-elite, anti-outgroup and people centrism dimension of populism contradicts the normative expectations toward the media. For instance, the assumption of a homogeneous people and the exclusion of a societal outgroup is incompatible with a pluralistic media coverage. The results of a representative survey in Germany predominantly confirmed a relation between a populist worldview and negative media attitudes. However, the three populism dimensions influenced the evaluations not in a consistent way. A systematic relation could only be found for antielite populism, which is negatively associated with all analyzed media evaluations such as media trust or satisfaction with the media’s performance. This indicates that in a populist worldview, the media are perceived as part of a detached elite that neglects the citizens’ interests. However, the results confirm the assumption of a natural ally between populism and tabloid or commercial media. Individuals with people centrist and anti-outgroup attitudes have higher trust in these media outlets. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - After several significant nuclear accidents, public attitudes toward nuclear energy technologies and facilities are considered to be one of the essential factors in the national energy and electricity policy-making process of several nations that employ nuclear energy as their key energy resource. However, it is difficult to explore and capture such an attitude, because the majority of prior studies analyzed public attitudes with a limited number of respondents and fragmentary opinion polls. In order to supplement this point, this study suggests a big data analyzing method with K-LIWC (Korean-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), sentiment and query analysis methods, and investigates public attitudes, positive and negative emotional statements about nuclear energy with the collected data sets of well-known social media and network services in Korea over time. Results show that several events and accidents related to nuclear energy have consistent or temporary effects on the attitude and ratios of the statements, depending on the kind of events and accidents. The presented methodology and the use of big data in relation to the energy industry is suggested as it can be helpful in addressing and exploring public attitudes. Based on the results, implications, limitations, and future research areas are presented. © 2018

AB  - This study focuses on the public opinion on the naturalization policy for Syrians in Turkey. It analyses news media coverage in the religious, far-right newspaper (Yeni Akit), a centre-right newspaper (Hürriyet), a social democrat newspaper (Cumhuriyet), and a socialist-left news portal (Solportal). The research question is: What are the metaphors, arguments, and omissions produced by media of different ideologies about the possible citizenship of Syrians in Turkey? The results show that metaphors and arguments differ according to ideological stance, suggesting that the current political polarization in Turkey affects the public's acceptance of Syrians and challenges Turkey's established migration policy. Each ideological stance accepts Syrians on a selective basis, implying that universal naturalization of Syrians is not welcome; instead, there seems to be consensus favouring naturalization according to socio-economic criteria. These results indicate a need for a change in migration policy, especially concerning disadvantaged Syrians. © 2018 The Author. International Migration © 2018 IOM

AB  - Background: Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has witnessed an upsurge in enrollment since its inception in 2003, with over 40% of the Ghanaian population actively enrolled in the scheme. While the scheme strives to achieve universal health coverage, this quest is derailed by negative perceptions of the quality of services rendered to NHIS subscribers. This paper presents an analysis on perceptions of service quality provided to subscribers of Ghana's NHIS with emphasis on rural and urban scheme policy holders, using a nationally representative data. Methods: The study used data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Ordered logistic regressions were estimated to identify the correlates of perceived quality of care of services rendered by the NHIS. Also, chi-square statistics were performed to test for significant differences in the proportions of subscribers in the two subsamples (rural and urban). Results: Rural subscribers of the NHIS were found to identify more with better perception of quality of services provided by the NHIS than urban subscribers. Results from the chi-square statistics further indicated that rural subscribers are significantly different from urban subscribers in terms of the selected socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. In the full sample; age, out-of-pocket payment for healthcare and region of residence proved significant in explaining perceived quality of services rendered by the NHIS. Age, out-of-pocket payment for healthcare, region of residence, wealth status, and access to media were found to be significant predictors of perceived quality of services provided to both rural and urban subscribers of the NHIS. The significance of these variables varied among men and women in rural and urban areas. Conclusion: Different factors affect the perception of quality of services provided to rural and urban subscribers of Ghana's NHIS. Health financing policies geared toward improving the NHIS-related services in rural and urban areas should be varied. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Subjective response to noise is probably the most important goal in environmental acoustics. Traditional surveys have the drawback of high cost deriving from its development and execution, the limited number of participants, and the duration of the surveying campaign. The main drawbacks of online surveys are the low participation, or the self-produced bias that concerns about the topic can raise. In both cases, the process of designing questionnaires, implementing the survey, and analysing the results can be long, expensive and ineffective to monitor changes in the short-term. With the creation of Online Social Networks (OSN), people have changed the manner they communicate and use technology. Nowadays, people can provide information regarding their likes, opinion and discomfort about any topic, including noise, in just a few minutes with their smartphone. These Internet opinions can be analysed automatically using machine learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to get insights that can help in the early detection of noise problems, or in the prior assessment of action plans. This information can be significant helpful in addressing noise management by local authorities and stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel methodology, based on machine learning, allowing for the gathering and processing of OSN text data, enabling the generation of a system able to exploit the data to detect noise complaints and to classify them by source. This methodology has been piloted in a case study using Twitter, and the main results are presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that contribute to stigmas held by mental health practitioners about people with mental health issues. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was adopted to collect data from one focus group discussion comprised of six healthcare practitioners representing different aspects of health provision. Data were analysed using Nvivi.10 thematic content analysis, and major themes were identified. Participants also complete a demographic data sheet. This study was conducted in February 2018 at the medical city in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Findings: The focus group discussed the stigmas they held about people with mental health issues and the factors they perceived as heightening their prejudices. Factors identified included professional experiences, the media and community. Practitioners working in mental healthcare are vulnerable to developing stigmas about people with mental health problems. This research has begun to explore the factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Research limitations/implications: The participants were drawn from several different mental healthcare providers, so attitudes expressed cannot be generalised. Practical implications: Practitioners healthcare providers of all types including clinical practitioners, administrators and programme planners have a duty to confront the stigma of mental health among the community and healthcare providers, by expanding the volume of academic literature being authored, improving continuing professional education and enhancing employment opportunities in that sector. Originality/value: The outcomes of this study were mainly applicable to the professional mental health team, educator of healthcare practitioners, clinical practitioners, community mental healthcare services and research related to this topic, especially for improved ethical and professional values for healthcare providers and enlightenment of society as a whole. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This may be because minorities and women less often have friends who are police officers or know a police officer by name who they can call upon for assistance. The extent and nature of the association between the police and the public is one way to measure police-public social distance - the subjective perception of closeness or lack thereof the public feels with their police. Given the low public opinions of police among minority populations and negative media coverage resulting from police use of force incidents, low social distance may be one way police agencies can attract more women and minority applicants. This assertion was tested by surveying a sample of 533 university students in the fall of 2015. As a whole, respondents were more likely to report wanting to be a police officer when they had a police officer in the family or as a friend - with one exception. While having a family member or friend who is a police officer were not significantly related to women's desire to seek a career in policing, knowing a police officer by name reached significance. Men, especially non-Hispanic white men, also were more likely to report wanting to be a police officer. Proactive and targeted recruitment strategies that decrease social distance between the police and the public can help attract qualified women and minority candidates, thus contributing to the diversity of police agencies. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This thought experiment uses agent-based modeling (computational simulation) to demonstrate how colorism might operate within a local policing context. Colorism is the allocation of privilege and disadvantage based on skin color, with a prejudice for lighter skin. Colorism might help to explain some of the racial disparities in the US’ criminal justice system. I use simulated scenarios to explore the plausibility of this notion in the form of two questions: (1) How might colorism function within an organization, and (2) What might occur when managers apply the typical dilemmatic responses to detected colorism? The simulated world consists of three citizen-groups (lights, mediums, and darks), five policy responses to detected colorism, and two policing behaviors (fair and biased). Using NetLogo, one hundred simulations were conducted for each policy response and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison of means. When the tenets of colorism were applied to a simulated organizational setting, only some of the tenets held true. For instance, those in the middle of the skin color spectrum experienced higher rates of incarceration when aggressive steps were taken to counter colorism, which ran counter to the expectations of the thought experiment. The study identified an opportunity to expand the description of colorism to help describe the plight of those in the middle of the skin color spectrum. The major contributions from this work include a conceptual model that describes the relationship between the distinct levels of colorism, and it progresses the notion of interactive colorism. The study also explored conditional statements that can be converted into hypotheses for future experiments. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Public opinion surveys and polls have a long history as tools for the reportage of public sentiment. Born in the “straw polls” of nineteenth century politics, their use expanded in the last century to include a range of commercial and social subjects. In recent decades, these have included issues of medico-legal uncertainty including, in a partial list, abortion, fetal tissue research, and the propriety of medical termination. Because public opinion surveys are assumed to be “scientific,” and thus unbiased, there has been little discussion of either their suitability in areas of complex, medico-legal uncertainty or the ethics of their use in these areas. This paper reviews their general history and then their use in the debate over medical termination, often called “medical aid in dying.” In this review, two problems are highlighted. First, there is the ambiguous nature of polls and the manner of their construction. Second, there is the manner in which they are deployed as simple and definitive statements in areas of complex medico-legal debate. The result calls for caution in their use by ethicists and a clear duty by both academics and journalists to understand the limits of the medium in areas of medico-legal debate and discussion. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - HIV and sexuality stigma impede HIV prevention and care efforts. HealthMpowerment.org (HMP) is an interactive mobile phone- and web-based HIV prevention and care intervention for young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM; ages 18–30) in the United States. HMP included three forums where participants could share their experiences. In this study, we explored whether engaging in stigma-related discussions was associated with changes in YBMSM’s stigma-related scores throughout the trial. YBMSM (ages 18–30; N = 238) participating in HMP completed surveys at baseline, and 3 and 6 month follow-ups that included a series of scales focused on HIV and sexuality (internalized homophobia; sexual prejudice) stigma. Sixty-two participants contributed to the forums (1497 posts). We coded instances where YBMSM’s conversations were stigma related (915 posts, 61.1%), including discussions of anticipated (74/915, 8.1%), experienced (125/915, 13.7%), internalized (410/915, 44.8%), and/or challenged (639/915, 69.8%) stigma regarding sexuality and HIV. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined whether changes in YBMSM’s stigma scores were associated with stigma-related discussions within the forum. We controlled for age, HIV status, income, and educational attainment in these multivariable models. YBMSM who discussed experiencing HIV stigma in the forums reported decreases in perceived HIV stigma over time (b = − 0.37, p ≤ 0.05). YBMSM whose forum posts indicated anticipated HIV stigma reported increases in HIV stigma over time (b = 0.46, p ≤ 0.01). Participants who challenged sexuality-related stigma in forums had lower internalized homophobia (b = − 0.68, p ≤ 0.01) at baseline. YBMSM whose discussions focused on experiencing sexuality-related stigma reported increases in internalized homophobia (b = 0.39, p ≤ 0.01) and sexual prejudice (b = 0.87, p ≤ 0.05) over time. Developing strategies to combat stigma remains a key priority. HMP created an online space where YBMSM could discuss HIV and sexuality stigma. Although a limited number of HMP participants authored the majority of these forum discussions, the discussions were associated with changes in the sample’s stigma scores over time. Online interventions (e.g., social media, apps) should consider the inclusion of forums to address stigma and test the efficacy of forums to improve YBMSM’s HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between media frames and public perceptions of global poverty. Building on a frame analysis, the paper reconstructs prevailing poverty narratives in British news articles and non-governmental organizations' (NGO's) advertisements between 2011 and 2013. Following this, these narratives are compared with the narratives that emerge from public opinion studies. The findings suggest that there is a strong connection between media frames and public knowledge and perceptions of global poverty. Both the media and the public define poverty in developing countries' terms of destitute victims, lack of development and bad governance. Both suggest that the causes of poverty are internal to developing countries and imply that there has been little progress in reducing global poverty. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how the 2015 Tianjin Port explosion – which resulted in more than 100 deaths – changed local residents’ acceptance, perceived benefit and risk and trust related to hazardous goods warehouses and chemical plants (HGWCPs) and how it influenced local residents’ decisions about accepting HGWCPs through the lens of the trust heuristic. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted eight months after the disaster. Respondents were classified into two groups: involved (with direct experience of the explosion) and uninvolved (without direct experience). Their trust in those responsible for HGWCPs, and perceived benefit, perceived risk and acceptance associated with HGWCPs were surveyed. Findings: The disaster reduced public acceptance of HGWCPs and trust and increased perceived risk. Trust retained an indirect effect on acceptance through perceived benefit in both groups and a direct effect on acceptance in the involved group. Trust partly accounted for the reduction in acceptance of HGWCPs. Practical implications: Results remind the local government of the medium-term psychological consequences of the Tianjin Port explosion (e.g. increased perceived risk and reduced trust) and suggest the importance of building trust in mitigating risk perceptions of relevant technological hazards. Originality/value: It represents a valuable addition to the literature on the medium-term psychological consequences of technological disasters and on the public’s decision making about hazardous technologies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article examines how Marvel Comics’ Ms Marvel, in her newest iteration as a Pakistani Muslim young woman, challenges the conventions of race and American citizenship in the post-9/11 United States. I place Ms Marvel in conversation with the webcomic Qahera the Superhero, which was created by an Egyptian artist, in order to demonstrate the ways in which both texts have an ability to reach readers on a global scale and powerfully reimagine visual representations of Muslim women and female superheroes. My investigation includes an analysis of the comics and the epitexts that surround these works, such as author and editor interviews and various forms of public response in order to demonstrate how these media engage with a specific racial, ethnic, and (inter)national community in a meaningful way; one which complicates the definition of ‘fans,’ ‘comic book readers,’ and ‘heroes.’ When juxtaposed Ms Marvel and Qahera emerge as artifacts of visual, digital culture whose significance is particularly salient when read in our current political era, as a means of uncovering and combating racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper used netnography and thematic analysis of the comments made in online news articles to understand better the public response to the closure of the only KFC restaurant in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, in 2015. While the popular media often cover fast-food restaurant closures, past academic research has not examined the public response to these closures. To begin to fill this gap, we examined the comments sections of five online news articles from the Canadian news outlet, CBC.ca, and reactions shared on Facebook. 239 commenters made 308 publicly available online comments addressing the closure. Key themes in commenter perceptions included pro-closure reactions, which were based on the perceived public health benefits of reduced fast-food consumption, and anti-closure reactions to such factors as the loss of a local landmark and a source of positive memories. The unfavorable reactions appeared to pose a significant barrier to public acceptance of the KFC closure. This paper argues that it is important to examine public perceptions of fast-food closures to understand better what these restaurants mean to individuals and communities. This information, in turn, can be used to promote healthier restaurant-eating in ways that will complement efforts to encourage healthier food choices. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Using a cross-sectional, correlational design, the present study examined the moderating roles of perceived social support and community connectedness in the relationship between minority stress and viewing frequency of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)–inclusive television shows among LGB adults. Participants identified predominately as White and female, and the largest group identified as bisexual. Participants completed self-report measures of minority stressors, social support, LGB community connectedness, and viewing frequency. A multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the relationships among these variables. Findings revealed that perceived social support moderated the effect of prejudice events on viewing frequency, such that LGB viewers who reported high levels of prejudice events and low perceived social support endorsed the highest levels of viewing frequency. These findings provide further insight into the ways in which LGB individuals consume media content and may be informative for clinicians in understanding coping strategies for minority stress among LGB clients. © 2019, © 2019 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

AB  - With the developing acceptance of gay equality in the west, it is assumed that we live in a post-shame era, with ‘the world we have won’. However, this is a chimeric cliché of neoliberalism (rather like the idea that we are all postfeminist now). The ‘proud’ homosexual of the west is discursively constructed against the ‘shamed’ homosexual of the east, a typecasting resonant with postcolonial clichés of the primal, religious, and homophobic savagery of the global south in contrast with the civilising, liberal evolution of the secular global north. Shame displacement is of course a dynamic of shame itself. The perceived failure in achieving the ‘proud iconic gay’ of media cultures in the global North results in a traumatic double bind of being ashamed of being ashamed. This article will reconsider the cultural politics and temporality of shame for primarily white gay identities after the ‘War on Terror’. As Islamophobia has exponentially increased, some western gays translocate their unacknowledged shame onto a misconceived ‘brown threat’ in a complex, aggressive, and racist shame loop [Lewis, H.B., 1971. Shame and guilt in neurosis. New York: International Universities Press; Scheff, T.J., and Retzinger, S.M., 1991. Emotions and violence: shame and rage in destructive conflict.

AB  - Understanding public perceptions about environmental health hazards, exposures, and health impacts can help environmental public health practitioners to target and prioritize community activities, policy needs, and communication strategies. The online cross-sectional 2013 summer wave of the ConsumerStyles survey sampled U.S. adults and used questions from the Centers for Disease Control’s Environmental Public Health Tracking Program to measure public awareness of governmental efforts to track environmental exposures and links to health impacts, as well as perceptions of environmental health issues. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions examined the associations between demographic characteristics and level of awareness of government environmental public health efforts or level of concern about health risks associated with environmental pollutants. Responses were received from 4033 participants, yielding a response rate of 66.0%. More than half of respondents (57.8%) noted concerns about health risks from environmental pollutants. More than one-third (40.0%) of respondents reported awareness of government efforts. Nearly 40% of respondents felt that none of the health impacts listed in the survey were related to environmental issues. Multiple logistic regression models showed that non-Hispanic blacks, other races, females, people with a college or higher education, and people living in the Midwest or South regions were more likely than their counterparts to be concerned about how the environment affects their health. Future work should focus on improving risk communication, filling the information gap on environmental health issues, and understanding how perceptions change over time. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - “Citizen journalism” is a term used to refer to ordinary individuals who act as journalists during some part of the process of creating content for mainstream journalism coverage. In China, besides ordinary citizen journalists, some professional journalists have been regarded as citizen journalists if they write stories online that would otherwise not be publishable in traditional media. Unfortunately, since the real name registration system was launched on the Internet in 2012, the activities of both professionals and average citizens in China are frequently limited. So, is citizen journalism a role that can only be practiced in very limited ways in China? This article adopts a broader definition of citizen journalism, in which, through the use of social media to discuss and comment on news and social issues, ordinary citizens in China act as collective citizen journalists, which insulates them against individually targeted criticism for their opinions. We applied agenda-setting theory to explain citizen journalist contributions to the content of traditional media and the policymaking process in China. Using several forms of Chinese media and rank-order cross-lagged correlations, we found that online public opinions in social media influenced the agenda of traditional commercially oriented media, but not the agenda of traditional government-sponsored media. The policy agenda was partially influenced by the online public. The online public acted collectively to influence and contribute to the content of the traditional media and policies the government considers, thus changing the nature of journalism and public sphere. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In October 2014 the author arrived at work to find one of his company's big-rig trucks aflame in the parking lot, obviously a victim of arson. This was an extreme manifestation of a corrosive problem: Traeger's culture had become poisonous, characterized by lack of trust, negative attitudes, and a stubborn refusal to collaborate. Very early in his tenure, employees would ignore Andrus when he asked for data, or simply refuse to work together on a project. Once, when he was visiting headquarters, the CFO said he couldn't find any time in his schedule to meet with the new CEO. Although the majority owner had no operating role, he talked daily to people at all levels of the company and was aggressive and abusive. People were afraid of him, but they acted as if he were in charge. After the truck fire, Andrus resolved to start from scratch. He bought out the majority owner, moved the headquarters from Oregon to Utah, carefully winnowed the employees, worked to create a physical environment that feels true to the brand, and built a community of fans and influencers on social media. The company's strategy, marketing, and product line were all overhauled. In just five years, sales grew from $70 million to nearly $400 million. © 2019, Harvard Business School Publishing.

AB  - Social media, Facebook in particular, is increasingly serving as an alternative platform for discussing politics in Ethiopia. Unfortunately, it has also become a public sphere in which not only political views are shared but also discourses that ridicule women’s increasing role in Ethiopian politics are constructed and disseminated through. By analysing a sample of Facebook texts which tease the wave of women’s appointment to political power in Ethiopia, this paper argues that the discursive meanings of the texts are indicatives of a patriarchal society’s deep-rooted resistance towards women’s engagement in the public sphere as well as its strong desire to maintain the status quo. The theoretical foundation of the analytic framework to be employed in analysing the Facebook messages is the post-structuralist and postmodern approach to discourse, particularly the Habermasian view of the complex relationship between texts, their contexts of productions and interpretations and the broader life world. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - The web and internet-based life have led the entrance to news data, a lot less demanding and agreeable. Mass-media affects the life of the general public and as it frequently occurs. There are few individuals that exploit these privileges. This prompts the creation of the news articles that are not totally evident or indeed, even totally false. People intentionally spread these counterfeit articles with the help of web-based social networking sites. The fundamental objective of fake news sites is to influence the popular belief on specific issues. The main goal of fake news websites is to affect public opinion on certain matters. Our aim is to find a reliable and accurate model that classifies a given news article as either fake or true. © BEIESP.

AB  - The media plays a significant role in our lives and constitutes a very powerful socialising agent with the potential to influence public opinion and policymakers regarding social issues, such as child maltreatment. The present study was designed to explore how child maltreatment is portrayed in the media and to examine public perception regarding this phenomenon, as expressed by reader comments. Articles about child maltreatment published on the five official news websites in Israel were assessed using descriptive and qualitative analysis. It was found that most of the coverage of child maltreatment could be characterised as episodic. The majority of news articles failed to provide information regarding the potential risk/causal factors and often missed opportunities to discuss solutions to maltreatment. Of the stakeholders presented in the articles, only rarely could the voices of child victims or their families be heard, whereas the presence of legal professionals was frequent. A high frequency of reader comments referred to rage and despair. The results demonstrate the need to develop various practices in order to narrow the gaps between findings and statistics about child maltreatment and the way in which the phenomenon is currently portrayed in the media, as such portrayals exert an impact on both public perceptions and policymakers' attitudes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ‘Explore[s] how child maltreatment is portrayed in the media and examine[s] public perception… as expressed by reader comments’. Key Practitioner Messages: The media is a significant tool with the potential to influence public opinion and policymakers regarding social issues. The study indicates that media coverage of child maltreatment often fails to present it as an extensive social problem and does not discuss possible solutions and prevention strategies for this phenomenon. Practitioners within the field of child maltreatment should be provided with training in working with the media. Joint collaboration between practitioners, the media and researchers is needed in order to narrow the gap between the worrisome figures regarding this phenomenon and its non-proportional representation in the media. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a dynamic forecasting framework, named DMDP (dynamic multi-source default probability prediction), to predict the default probability of a company. The default probability is a very important factor to assess the credit risk of listed companies on a stock market. Aiming at aiding financial institutions in decision making, our DMDP framework not only analyzes financial data to capture the historical performance of a company, but also utilizes long short-term memory model to dynamically incorporate daily news from social media to take the perceptions of market participants and public opinions into consideration. The study of this paper makes two key contributions. First, we make use of unstructured news crawled from social media to alleviate the impact of financial fraud issue made on default probability prediction. Second, we propose a neural network method to integrate both structured financial factors and unstructured social media data with appropriate time alignment for default probability prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DMDP in predicting default probability for the listed companies in mainland China, compared with various baselines. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - With the intensive use of social media for communication among people, the outspread of information on these platforms has increased the demand to perform mining of user insights on various topics to gain knowledge. This mining of user reviews to know the positive and negative opinion of people towards a topic, product, brand is Sentiment Analysis. A subject of special interest Sentiment Analysis finds application in various fields viz. Brand Monitoring, Voice of Employee, Social media monitoring. In this paper mining of tweets from Social Media site Twitter is done to analyze the public opinion on “Kerala Floods 2018 “.Twitter generates 500 million messages called ‘tweets’ per day. Processing these gargantuan tweets is time consuming; this paper aims in processing these tweets into set of features by using Sentiment Lexicons and then applying a filtering method to extract those features which are of high value and discarding all the low value features. Emoticons, slang, hash tags plays a vital role in conversation among people to express their opinions. The extracted features which are huge in number are reduced using the feature selection method Information Gain (IG). The selected high value features through IG are applied to Bayes classifier for classification of opinions. It is apparent from the results that analyzing sentiments using emoticons, slang and hash tag features as one among the features is better than using conventional n-gram features. This manuscript uses Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure and Time for processing to analyze the performance of high value words using IG. © BEIESP.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the discursive practices of foreign policy experts. While policy decisions involving war and peace keep people alarmed all over the globe, most of these decisions are shaped by policy experts who work on influencing public opinion through the media (Manheim, 2011). This study adopts a critical discursive stance and uses argumentation analysis to examine the ideological backdrop to the discourse of thirty opinion articles authored by American foreign policy experts in print media. Drawing on the Pragma-dialectical method of augmentation analysis (van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004), and more particularly on its notion of strategic maneuvering, the analysis examines the confrontational strategies used by this group of experts and attempts to determine the rhetorical goals pursued by these strategic maneuvers. © 2019 Samira Allani, published by Sciendo 2019.

AB  - In recent years, palm oil has become one of the most discussed food ingredients, with health and sustainability issues raising in relation to its use. The aim of this study is to explore Italian consumers’ perception of the presence of palm oil in food products to assess if and how the recent media campaign has influenced public opinion. An online questionnaire was drafted, with 239 valid responses analysed. The results show that the respondents, well aware of the media debate regarding palm oil, perceive that a demonization campaign against the ingredient is in progress, leading public opinion towards an unfavourable attitude about it. The most relevant purchase motivations for a product without palm oil are linked to the environmental scope of sustainability, followed by those related to health concerns. Moreover, the use of the semantic differential methodology in the analysis has allowed for the exploration of the attitudes towards products with and without palm oil, highlighting how a product not containing palm oil is mainly perceived as trendy, expensive and healthy. The results of motivation and semantic differential analysis are polarised according to a split in the sample between subjects who give and do not give importance to the absence of palm oil in food products. © 2019, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

AB  - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited intimate partner violence (IPV) as a serious, yet preventable public health problem that affects millions of Americans in our country daily. Given the enormous prevalence of IPV combined with the operating assumption that media can impact public opinion and policy, it is important to uncover how topics such as IPV are portrayed in the media, as these portrayals provide potentially significant influence on the public’s opinion of IPV and related policies that directly impact victims, survivors, and perpetrators. The purpose of this study seeks to uncover the portrayal of IPV at the community level as reported by the media—notably, a local newspaper in a county located in the southeastern United States. The media analysis revealed several pertinent thematic categories that describe the frequency and content of IPV reporting in the Greensboro News & Record. Beginning in 2015, it appears that the county’s plans for opening the Guilford County Family Justice Center sparked increased media attention in the county, which perhaps contributed to subsequent years of frequent coverage of community resources, support services, funding sources, and public awareness events related to domestic violence in the local community. While a direct explanation cannot be provided for the total cause of the significant decrease in IPV-related homicides as revealed in this study, the media analysis suggests that Guilford County is making significant strides against IPV. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The flow of information reaching us via the online media platforms is optimized not by the information content or relevance but by popularity and proximity to the target. This is typically performed in order to maximise platform usage. As a side effect, this introduces an algorithmic bias that is believed to enhance fragmentation and polarization of the societal debate. To study this phenomenon, we modify the well-known continuous opinion dynamics model of bounded confidence in order to account for the algorithmic bias and investigate its consequences. In the simplest version of the original model the pairs of discussion participants are chosen at random and their opinions get closer to each other if they are within a fixed tolerance level. We modify the selection rule of the discussion partners: there is an enhanced probability to choose individuals whose opinions are already close to each other, thus mimicking the behavior of online media which suggest interaction with similar peers. As a result we observe: a) an increased tendency towards opinion fragmentation, which emerges also in conditions where the original model would predict consensus, b) increased polarisation of opinions and c) a dramatic slowing down of the speed at which the convergence at the asymptotic state is reached, which makes the system highly unstable. Fragmentation and polarization are augmented by a fragmented initial population. © 2019 Sîrbu et al.

AB  - Background: Social campaigns focusing on health are commonly used within an attempt to change behavior. To date, there has not been a targeted analysis of societies’ general perception about social campaigns. The aim of this study is to assess citizens’ opinions on the effectiveness of health-related social campaigns. Methods: The data set used in the analysis was obtained from Poland’s nationwide “Social Diagnosis” study. The determinants of public opinion were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression. The independent variables included socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, social participation, and the use of digital media. Results: The logistic regression model was developed using 23,593 cases. Opinions about the effectiveness of campaigns depended on all the predictors included in the socio-demographic cluster, smoking, self-declared excessive alcohol consumption, physical activity, the use of mobile phones, and watching TV. A significant impact was found in all but one variable related to social participation. Conclusions: The analysis revealed that opinions about social campaigns present in the media “landscape” are influenced by many factors. Interestingly, persons exhibiting unhealthy behaviors are more resistant to health-related campaigns and surprisingly the need to make use of healthcare resources is not accompanied by an acceptance of the interventions. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, has framed the mid-1970s immigration of Lebanese affected by civil war as Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's “mistake”. His remarks sparked controversy in the parliament and the media. The issue became a contest of frames between the Murdoch media, which supported the Minister's “mistake” frame and argued his right to “tell the truth”, and the Fairfax media, which viewed the Minister as being “racist” for “scapegoating” the Lebanese community. Along with archival documents, this article examines the context and coverage of the Minister's remarks, noting that the frames presented in the media “indexed” those adopted amongst political elites, while failing to re-examine the historical record. This case study demonstrates the power of framing and the media's tendency to accept rather than challenge frames used by those in the political contest, with the result that errors in the representation of history were never corrected. This article draws on framing theory and indexing theory and concludes that the “mistake” frame for the Lebanese feeds into narratives that serve to “other” Muslim and Arab groups, fanning fears and mobilising a discourse of Islamophobia around the exclusion of “undesirable” immigrants on the basis of “cultural fit”. © 2019 The University of Queensland and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Rationale: Childhood vaccination is a safe and effective way of reducing infectious diseases. Yet, public confidence in vaccination is waning, driven in part by the ‘manufacture of doubt’ by anti-vaccination activists and websites. However, there is little research examining the psychological underpinnings of anti-vaccination rhetoric among parents. Objectives: Here, we examined the structure and moral roots of anti-vaccination attitudes amongst Australian parents active on social media parenting sites. Methods: Participants (N = 296) completed questionnaires assessing their vaccination attitudes, behavioural intentions, and moral preferences. Results: Using Latent Profile Analysis, we identified three profiles (i.e., groups), interpretable as vaccine “accepters” “fence sitters” and “rejecters” each characterised by a distinct pattern of vaccination attitudes and moral preferences. Accepters exhibited positive vaccination attitudes and strong intentions to vaccinate; rejecters exhibited the opposite pattern of responses; whilst fence sitters exhibited an intermediate pattern of responses. Compared to accepters, rejecters and fence sitters exhibited a heightened moral preference for liberty (belief in the rights of the individual) and harm (concern about the wellbeing of others). Compared to acceptors and fence sitters, rejecters exhibited a heightened moral preference for purity (an abhorrence for impurity of body), and a diminished moral preference for authority (deference to those in positions of power). Conclusion: Given the sensitivity of fence sitters and rejecters to liberty-related moral concerns, our research cautions against the use of adversarial approaches—e.g., No Jab, No Pay legislation—that promote vaccination uptake by restricting parental freedoms, as they may backfire amongst parents ambivalent toward vaccination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy is a chronic condition and has significant negative consequences to quality of life. Misconceptions regarding epilepsy among communities with lower rates of education have led to false beliefs and ideas. This study aimed to evaluate the awareness, knowledge, and attitudes about epilepsy in Saudi population at Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a previously validated 14-item questionnaire. The data were collected online via WhatsApp application. The Saudi adult population (18 years and older) within Qassim region was sampled for the present study. Results: A total of 403 respondents completed the survey and the majority (68.8%) were less than 30 years old. Nearly all participants (97.0%) had heard of epilepsy or convulsive seizures; 43.5% knew a person with the disease; and 48.4% had seen a person having a seizure. Participants cited brain disorders (68.1%) as the most common cause of epilepsy, followed by mental disorders (61.9%) then hereditary diseases (48.8%). Only 5.6% would protest against their children associating with a person who occasionally experiences seizures, and a similarly small percentage (7.9%) would do so if their son or daughter decided to marry such a person. Conclusion: The public's general attitudes and awareness of epilepsy were quite good; however, knowledge regarding this medical condition is still inadequate. Thus, more campaigns are needed in order to increase societal awareness on epilepsy, obtaining help from governmental agencies, health institutions, mass media, and other health-related organizations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Subjective Traumatic Outlook (STO) deals with changes in individuals’ perception, following a traumatic event and the difficulties of integrating pre-trauma past memories, inner traumatic memories, and current daily life. Although this short scale has excellent psychometric properties its cut-off scores for potential clinical use have yet to be established. In addition, due to the discrepancy between the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the meaurement of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the present study aimed at revalidating the STO and establishing cut-off scores for potential clinical use, based on both approaches to measure PTSD and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD). Three hundred forty-three adults who were recruited through social media apps filled in self-report online questionnaires dealing with subjective perception of psychological trauma, PTSD and CPTSD. Results revalidate the STO as a screening tool for PTSD and CPTSD. We recommend a STO cut-off score of 13 and above when using the ICD-11 PTSD proposed algorithm along the PCL-5 cutoff score and a STO cut-off score of 15 when using the ICD-11 CPTSD proposed algorithm. In light of the present findings, the integration of DSM and ICD approaches is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article explores technologically integrated relationship practices among college students. Analyzing interviews of 52 participants at two very different US colleges, I explore how they construct, establish, and maintain technologically mediated social networks. This research focuses specifically on the practice of “doing homework,” in which participants conduct social media investigations of potential friends and use that data to determine if a relationship continues. Findings suggest the establishment of offline relationships includes the use of social media profiles to collect social and political attitude data on potential friends. Participants report the use of such data as essential to their decision-making processes about friendship, resulting in a potential increase in social and political homogeneity within offline social networks. These findings contribute to our ongoing understanding of the role of informational echo chambers within a technologically integrated social environment. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Decades of research on public opinion about crime reveal varying, yet relatively punitive attitudes that are often riddled with misconceptions. Sparked by the increased media and legislative attention devoted to sex offenders beginning in the 1990s, researchers began to more closely examine public opinion about sexual offenses. Findings suggest the public adheres to several misconceptions about sexual offenses and supports harsh sanctions for offenders. However, further research is warranted to more closely examine the relationships among these variables. Thus, the goal of the present study was to survey Pennsylvania residents to examine the degree to which misconceptions about sexual offenses inform punitiveness. The results supported the hypotheses in that a high level of support for misconceptions and punitiveness was identified, and adherence to misconceptions was the strongest predictor of punitiveness. These findings demonstrate a clear need for educational and awareness efforts to dispel public misconceptions about sexual offending and victimization. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - New ubiquitous information and communication technologies, in particular recording-enabled smart devices and social media programs, are giving rise to a profound new power for ordinary people to monitor and track each other on a global scale. Along with this growing capacity to monitor one another is a new capacity to explicitly and publicly judge one another—to rate, rank, comment on, shame and humiliate each other through the net. Drawing upon warnings from Kierkegaard and Mill on the power of public opinion to produce conformity, I argue a new apparatus of surveillance and control is being generated that threatens individual freedom through a coercion of the will by an anonymous and interconnected crowd. I conclude that we must urgently assess how to protect individuals from a social tyranny of the public enabled by these new technologies while effective measures can still be taken to mitigate their dangers. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Managers of startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) tend to view subsidiaries as the preferred export mode. Yet this type of organization is associated with a high failure rate. Our in-depth interviews with more than 40 managers show that their bias in favor of foreign sales subsidiaries is rooted in unsubstantiated beliefs about control and the superiority of subsidiaries over other export modes. This article details the faulty reasoning that supports these prejudices and proposes a simple method for selecting more profitable and less risky international entry strategies. © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

AB  - Previous research has evaluated public risk perception and response to a natural hazards in various settings; however, most of these studies were conducted either with a single scenario or after a natural disaster struck. To better understand the dynamic relationships among affect, risk perception, and behavioral intentions related to natural disasters, the current study implements a simulation scenario with escalating weather intensity, and includes a natural experiment allowing comparison of public response before and after a severe tornado event with extensive coverage by the national media. The current study also manipulated the display of warning information, and investigated whether the warning system display format influences public response. Results indicate that (1) affect, risk perception, and behavioral intention escalated as weather conditions deteriorated, (2) responses at previous stages predicted responses at subsequent stages of storm progression, and (3) negative affect predicted risk perception. Moreover, risk perception and behavioral intention were heightened after exposure to the media coverage of an actual tornado disaster. However, the display format manipulation did not influence behavioral responses. The current study provides insight regarding public perception of predisaster warnings and the influence of exposure to media coverage of an actual disaster event. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Public attitudes toward immigrants in the UK, especially prejudice against them, form a strong theme in retrospective media postmortems emphasizing the uniqueness of Brexit, yet similarly hostile public opinion on immigrants forms a recurrent theme in populist politics in many European Union nations. Indeed, if UK residents are not uniquely hostile, then the UK's exit from the EU may be only the first symptom of proliferating conflicts over immigration that will plague EU nations in future years. A well-established symptom (or consequence) of prejudice—aversion to outgroups as a neighbors—shows that prejudice against immigrants, other races, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Gypsies are all relatively low in the UK. This is as expected from the general decline of prejudice and social distance with socioeconomic development, demonstrated here in broad perspective across many countries. Indeed, UK residents are about as prejudiced against each of these ethno-religious outgroups as are their peers in other advanced EU and English-speaking nations, and much less prejudiced than their peers in less prosperous countries. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the view that a single latent ethno-religious prejudice generates all these specific prejudices, so it is not specific experiences with any one of these groups, nor their specific attributes, that are the wellspring of this deep-seated underlying prejudice. Replication using other measures of prejudice and another cross-national dataset confirms these findings. Data are from the pooled World and European Values Surveys (over 450,000 individuals, 300 surveys, and 100 nations for this analysis) and from the well-known European Quality of Life surveys. Analysis is by descriptive, multilevel (random intercept, fixed effects), and structural equation methods. © Copyright © 2019 Evans and Kelley.

AB  - The livestock sector is a major driver of climate change, accounting for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Population growth and rising prosperity are expected to see global consumption of meat rise by 76% by mid-century, a rate which is associated with significant social and environmental costs. There is therefore a compelling case for public measures to promote dietary shifts towards a more sustainable model, but little action has been taken at the international or national level. This article reports on an international study, with research conducted across the UK, US, China and Brazil, which examines the role the media might play in driving social change in this area. The study focused specifically on the negotiation of new information around meat consumption and climate change and its impacts on existing attitudes and behaviours. Findings indicate that perceptions and beliefs on climate change are culturally specific – tending to reflect national political and social priorities - but are contextualised within individually constructed media environments. Key determining factors include assessments of trust and credibility in regard to scientists and other experts, perceptions of the role of government and questions of individual versus collective responsibility. These shape the parameters within which arguments about the impact of meat consumption upon climate change are received, and these responses interact with cultural and structural barriers and opportunities to shape the likelihood of behaviour change. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have affected not only large parts of coniferous forests in the Northern Hemisphere, but also — largely absent from global attention — native pine forests of Central America. As such outbreaks frequently spark management debates among residents, land managers, forest owners and the public, the social acceptance of bark beetle control measures has become crucial for modern land management. However, the sociological and psychological determinants of the preference for specific bark beetle control measures outside protected areas remain unclear. To determine the acceptability of bark beetle control measures in El Salvador, we assessed how demographic variables, attitude towards the bark beetle, education, and self-reported knowledge affected the preference for different bark beetle control measures in a survey of government employees and local forest owners using a quantitative questionnaire survey. Cumulative link mixed models revealed that the general preference for control measures increased with increasing self-reported knowledge about the bark beetle but decreased with increasing level of respondent education and an increasing positive attitude towards the bark beetle. Respondents generally preferred beetle control measures on small areas than on large areas. Preferences for control measures did not differ between government employees and forest owners, with controlled burning and chemical control significantly less accepted than stand thinning or salvage logging. We discuss the most preferred control measures considering recent scientific evidence of their efficacy and conclude that the current bark beetle outbreak should be controlled through logging of pines weakened by fire in the short-term and by stand thinning in the medium-term to prevent further outbreaks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Customers’ demands have become more dynamic and complicated owing to the functional diversity and lifecycle reduction of products which pushes enterprises to identify the real-time needs of distinct customers in a superior way. Meanwhile, social media turned as an emerging channel where customers often spontaneously can express their perceptions and thoughts about products promptly. This paper examines the customer satisfaction identification and improvement problem based on social media mining. First, we proposed the public opinion sensitivity index (POSI) to uncover target customers from extensive short-textual reviews. Subsequently, we presented a customer segmentation approach based on the sentiment analysis and the variable-scale clustering (VSC). The approach is able to get several customer clusters with the same satisfaction level where customers belonging to each cluster have similar interests. Finally, customer-centered marketing strategies and customer difference marketing campaigns are planned under the shadow of customer segmentation results. The experiments illustrate that our proposed method can support marketing decision marketing in practice that enriches the intention of the current customer relationship management. © 2019, Strojarski Facultet.

AB  - Despite major progress in global vaccination coverage, immunization rates are falling, resulting in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This study analyses content and source of the most popular tweets related to a recent case in Spain where an unvaccinated child contracted and later died from diphtheria. Understanding the characteristics of these tweets in the context of vaccination could inform efforts by health promotion professionals to increase their reach and impact. We extracted tweets containing keywords related to the diphtheria case (from 1 May to 15 July 2015). We explored the prevalence of terms relating to policy and misinformation and manually coded the 194 most popular tweets (retweeted 100 or more times) with regard to source, topic, tone and sentiment. A total of 722 974 tweets were collected. Prevalence of terms relating to policy and misinformation increased at the onset of the case and after the death of the child. Popular tweets (194) were either pro-vaccination (58%) or neutral, with none classified as anti-vaccination. Popular topics included criticism towards anti-vaccination groups (35%) and effectiveness of immunization (22%). Popular tweets were informative (47%) or opinions (53%), which mainly expressed frustration (24%) or humour/sarcasm (23%). Popular Twitter accounts were newspaper and TV channels (15%), as well as individual journalists and authors of popular science (13.4%). Healthcare organizations could collaborate with popular journalists or news outlets and employ authors of popular science to disseminate health information on social media, while addressing public concerns and misinformation in accessible ways. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In recent years, social media has provided novel ways to gather information in significant quantities directly from users. Analyzing sentiment hidden in these data has proven useful for recommender systems, marketing, and monitoring public opinion. This paper demonstrates that using Chinese characters’ unique tone as the input features improve accuracy in Chinese sentiment analysis. In terms of data augmentation, we construct a synonym replacement thesaurus for text classification. We propose a model that combines Char Convolutional Neural Networks (CharCNN) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we call CharCNN-SVM, to obtain the emotional tendencies of users’ reviews. Through experiments, results demonstrate that our method outperforms several traditional methods, such as Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, support vector machine and bag-of-words, in terms of Chinese sentiment analysis accuracy. We also note some useful phenomena and provide relevant explanations. © 2019, ICIC International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Distracted driving is a growing global epidemic, with adolescent drivers reporting frequent engagement in distracted driving behaviors. Public health initiatives and legislative efforts designed to decrease the prevalence of these unwanted driving behaviors have demonstrated small, but significant reductions in crash risk. Non-compliance is a known problem among drivers of all ages, but may be especially problematic for novice, adolescent drivers. Using a construct from the Health Belief Model, the relations between demographic factors, perceived threat to safety, and peer influences were investigated with adolescents' support for three types of distracted driving legislation regarding: (a) reading or sending text messages/emails while driving; (b) hand-held cell phone use while driving; and (c) using non-driving-related-in-vehicle (NDIV) technology while driving. Investigating adolescents' perceptions provides an opportunity to understand distracted driving enforcement and legislation. Methods: Three hundred and seventy-nine adolescents aged 15–19 (M = 16.12, SD = 0.56) were recruited from public high schools. Demographics, perceptions, and support regarding distracted driving were assessed using self-report surveys. Statistical analyses included bivariate correlations and adjusted odds ratios to investigate influences of adolescent support for distracted driving legislation. Results: Female adolescents were at 2 times greater odds of supporting a law against texting/emailing while driving compared to male adolescents. Greater perceived threat to safety was associated with all three types of distracted driving legislation (aOR = 1.10, 1.33). Minimal association was found with peer influences. Conclusions: Perceived threat to safety and gender were associated with legislative support in adolescents. Practical application: Interventions and public health campaigns that incorporate elements related to perceived threat may be more successful with female adolescent drivers than male adolescents. Future experimental research will help to determine what factors affect adolescents' perspectives on distracted driving to promote compliance with related legislation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and National Safety Council

AB  - This article examines political transportation—the construction of mental models that represent a political world and result in the absorption and positioning of oneself within the constructed world. Specifically, we propose that when citizens become immersed in the political narrative crafted by a politician, they become more likely to see the political world as personally relevant and, subsequently, become more committed to supporting that candidate. Further, the degree of political immersion should depend upon which media platform a campaign message is delivered through. These expectations were tested using an experiment where partisans were exposed to a campaign message delivered in the form of a television ad, a political e-mail, or a series of tweets. Results demonstrate that Twitter was the least likely to lead to political immersion. Further, results provide support for our theoretical model, where there is an indirect effect of campaign messages on political attitudes and behavior through immersion and perceived personal relevance. Taken together, this study demonstrates the utility of applying the concept of narrative transportation to politics. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - One reason why people avoid using social media to express their opinions is to avert social sanctions as proposed by the spiral of silence theory. We here elaborate on individual-level sensitivity to social rejection in relation to voicing political opinions on social media sites. Given the uncertainty about sharing political views in social media, and the fact that social acceptance, or rejection, can be easily communicated through, for instance, likes, or a lack of likes, we argue that rejection sensitive individuals are less likely to share political information in social media. Combining an analysis of unique survey data on psychological characteristics and online political activity with focus group interviews with Swedish youth supports our argument, showing that rejection sensitive individuals are less inclined to engage politically in social media. The results extend on previous research by establishing the role of rejection sensitivity in political engagement in social media. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Fake or manipulated images propagated through the Web and social media have the capacity to deceive, emotionally distress, and influence public opinions and actions. Yet few studies have examined how individuals evaluate the authenticity of images that accompany online stories. This article details a 6-batch large-scale online experiment using Amazon Mechanical Turk that probes how people evaluate image credibility across online platforms. In each batch, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 28 news-source mockups featuring a forged image, and they evaluated the credibility of the images based on several features. We found that participants’ Internet skills, photo-editing experience, and social media use were significant predictors of image credibility evaluation, while most social and heuristic cues of online credibility (e.g. source trustworthiness, bandwagon, intermediary trustworthiness) had no significant impact. Viewers’ attitude toward a depicted issue also positively influenced their credibility evaluation. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals’ responses. This study examines whether individuals’ perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline. We conclude with suggestions for further research on the role of disciplinary attribution on public perceptions of science. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Since the late 1990s public opinion about cannabis legalization has become drastically more liberal, and some states have begun to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Why have attitudes changed so much? Prior research has considered a few of the reasons for this change, but this is the first comprehensive and empirically-based study to consider the wide range of potential causes for how and why this happened. We use data from the General Social Survey, National Study of Drug Use and Health, and word searches from the New York Times. We find that attitudes largely liberalized via intracohort changes. Most Americans developed more liberal views, regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, education, religious or political affiliation, or religious engagement. Changes in cannabis use have had minimal effects on attitudes, and legalization of cannabis has not prompted attitude change in neighboring states. As to root causes, evidence suggests that a decrease in religious affiliation, a decline in punitiveness, and a shift in media framing all contributed to changing attitudes. © 2018

AB  - Due to the importance of public support in fostering positive outcomes for biodiversity, Aichi Biodiversity Target 1 aims to increase public awareness of the value of biodiversity and actions that help to conserve it. However, indicators for this critical target have historically relied on public-opinion surveys that are time-consuming, geographically restricted, and expensive. Here, we present an alternative approach based on tracking the use of biodiversity-related keywords in 31 different languages in online newspapers, social media, and internet searches to monitor Aichi Target 1 in real-time, at a global scale, and at relatively low cost. By implementing the indicator, we show global patterns associated with spatio-temporal variability in public engagement with biodiversity topics, such as a clear drop in conversations around weekends and biodiversity-related topic congruence across culturally similar countries. Highly divergent scores across platforms for each country highlight the importance of sourcing information from multiple data streams. The data behind this global indicator is visualized and publicly available at BiodiversityEngagementIndicator.com and can be used by countries party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to report on their progress towards meeting Aichi Target 1 to the Secretariat. Continued and expanded monitoring using this indicator will provide further insights for better targeting of public awareness campaigns. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The growing availability of genomic information to the public may spur discussion about genetics and genomics on social media. Sites, including Twitter, provide a unique space for the public to access and discuss health information. The objective of this study was to better understand how social media users are sharing information about genetics and genomics in health and healthcare and what information is most commonly discussed among Twitter users. Methods: We obtained tweets with specific genetics- and genomics-related keywords from Crimson Hexagon. We used Boolean logic to collect tweets containing chosen keywords within the timeframe of October 1, 2016, to October 1, 2017. Features of the software were used to identify salient themes in conversation, conduct an emergent content analysis, and gather key demographic information. Results: We obtained 347,196 tweets from our search. There was a monthly average volume of 28,432 tweets. The five categories of tweets included: genetic disorders/disease (45.3%), health (15.6%), genomics (8%), and genetic testing (7.3%). Top influencers in the conversation included news outlets and universities. Conclusions: This content analysis provides insight about the types of conversation related to genomics and health. Conversations about genomics are occurring on Twitter, and they frequently emphasize rare genetic diseases and genetic disorders. These discussions tend to be driven by key influencers who primarily include news media outlets. Further understanding of the discussions related to genomics and health in social media may offer insight about topics of importance to the public. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance and the rise of ‘super bugs’ has become a major threat to public health worldwide, with authorities warning of an ‘apocalyptic future’ unless addressed as a matter of urgency. Mass circulation media has traditionally taken an active role in informing the public of important public health issues and the measures needed to address these. The key objective of the larger project informing this article was to describe Australian media representations of the AMR crisis and its role in informing the public about the AMR crisis. Methods: Undertaken as an unobtrusive qualitative research enquiry, existing data from Australian media, the websites of select partisan groups and government health departments as well as discipline literature were sourced and analysed using content analysis strategies. Results: Overall, media coverage was well informed, accurate, balanced, responsive to the issues at stake, and highlighted the seriousness of the issue without being alarmist. Intriguingly, reports relied heavily on the use of content and conceptual metaphors to frame their narratives. Conclusion: The media reports analysed in the context of this study were substantive and well informed. Just what impact they have had on the public in terms of improving its knowledge of the AMR issue or motivating behaviour change to mitigate the AMR crisis was unable to be ascertained. The strategic use of the media to galvanise an effective public response to the AMR crises thus requires further investigation. © 2018 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control

AB  - Wildlife managers and researchers have suspected that urine-based lure products collected from captive cervids could be potential media contributing to the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer (Odocoileus spp.). Although personnel in multiple wildlife agencies have taken the precautionary approach to prohibit the sales or use of urine-based lure products, it is not well understood whether hunters will accept and willingly cooperate with these policies. To address this gap in the literature, we examine hunters’ attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a hypothetical policy proposing to ban urine-based products and how risk beliefs, trait psychological reactance, and hunting experience affect these responses. In May 2017, we recruited 739 members of an online advocacy group of deer hunters to complete a web-based survey with experimental elements. Overall, participants held positive attitudes toward the proposed policy to ban these products and high intentions to cooperate. Participants also characterized CWD as an increasing risk that was associated with dread, well known to science, and observable. These risk beliefs were positively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions to comply with the policy. In contrast, trait psychological reactance and prior experience using urine-based scents were negatively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions. Findings indicate that wildlife management agency personnel communicating with the public may find better acceptance of controversial CWD policies by first establishing a shared understanding of its risks through thorough risk communication. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018

AB  - When users express their stances towards a topic in social media, they might elaborate their viewpoints or reasoning. Oftentimes, viewpoints expressed by different users exhibit a hierarchical structure. Therefore, detecting this kind of hierarchical viewpoints offers a better insight to understand the public opinion. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery from tweets. Driven by the motivation that a viewpoint expressed in a tweet can be regarded as a path from the root to a leaf of a hierarchical viewpoint tree, the assignment of the relevant viewpoint topics is assumed to follow two nested Chinese restaurant processes. Moreover, opinions in text are often expressed in un-semantically decomposable multi-terms or phrases, such as ‘economic recession’. Hence, a hierarchical Pitman–Yor process is employed as a prior for modelling the generation of phrases with arbitrary length. Experimental results on two Twitter corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian model for hierarchical viewpoint discovery. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing has provided a persistent, polarizing, and highly politicized source of controversy internationally and in numerous national contexts for just under a decade. This research uses hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) operations in New Zealand as a vignette through which to understand the underlying causes of controversy and the appropriateness of attempts to address them. A multi-method approach using interviews (n = 25), diagrammatic analysis, and newsprint media was applied to evidence two major findings. First, previous attempts to explain fracking controversy based on social constructivist theory lack a multi-scalar approach to the assessment of factors that influence risk perceptions. It is found that risk perception surrounding fracking in New Zealand reflects intra-scalar interactions between factors originating at the international, national, regional, and local scale. Second, there is a concerning absence of critique pertaining to the concept of “social license to operate” (SLO), which has been advocated both internationally and nationally as an appropriate form of stakeholder engagement. This article contributes to the SLO outcomes literature by establishing a need to consider multi-scalar influences on risk perception when explaining diverse SLO outcomes in communities where fracking operations are prospective or already taking place. © 2018 The Authors Risk Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Risk Analysis.

AB  - As a result of the rise of online communication and political divisions based on symbols, rather than structure (decrease in the importance of class-based voting), citizens are increasingly linked to news outlets that articulate and reinforce their views. The process is facilitated by the spontaneous processes of bottom–up communication that excludes, in an iterative process, people who express views that are inconsistent with the prevailing opinion. The emergence of “information verticals” is a significant influence on attitudes to some issues covered in political debate. These effects operate with regard to so-called easy issues, that is, those rooted in emotions and in the symbolic sphere. Our article is an empirical test of our hypotheses about the effects of media framing of “hard” and “easy” issues. We apply a survey experiment method to verify whether contact with news coverage has an effect on attitudes, taking into account the political orientation and cognitive skills of citizens. Our empirical analyses confirm that a hostile media framing of migration changes respondents’ attitudes no matter their level of cognitive engagement. The data come from Poland. © 2018 Sage Publications.

AB  - Objectives: Investigating public perceptions of community pharmacists (CP) in public health and their use of social media (SM) and mobile health applications (MH apps) in that regard. Methods: Two surveys were created. One sought public perceptions of SM and the other of MH apps for health advice. Both included a section on perceptions of the role of CPs in public health. A convenience sampling strategy, based on proximity, was used.The study population was the public (n = 8 500 000) living in Greater London. The general public were recruited face-to-face in public spaces. A minimum sample (95% confidence interval/5% margin of error) of 385 was needed. Ethical approval was obtained from the university ethics committee. Responses were analysed in SPSS. Key findings: About 820/1800 (45.6%) completed one/both surveys. Respondents seek health advice primarily from GPs, followed by digital mediums and then CPs. Under 35s use digital mediums more frequently (P = 0.039). Those who had used SM (41.7%) or MH apps (61.8%) for health information did not confirm its accuracy with a healthcare professional (HCP). Of those that did (MH apps = 39.2%; SM = 58.3%), the HCP disagreed with the information on MH apps and SM on 19.6% and 36.7% of occasions, respectively. Nevertheless, 64.5% stated that if a SM page was maintained by an HCP they would use it. Conclusions: The public are using digital mediums for health advice instead of speaking to an HCP. If CPs want to have an impact on public health they must start imbedding digital mediums into their services. © 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society

AB  - We begin this article with a close look at some contemporary pictures of sexual life in the Muslim world that have been painted in certain sections of the Western media, asking how and why these pictures matter. Across a range of mainstream print media from the New York Times to the Daily Mail, and across reported events from several countries, can be found pictures of ‘sexual misery’. These ‘frame’ Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable. Crucially, this is not the whole story. We then consider how these negative representations are being challenged and how they can be challenged further. In doing so, we will not simply set pictures of sexual misery against their binary opposites, namely pictures abounding in the promise of sexual happiness. Instead, we search for a more complex picture, one that unsettles stereotypes about the sexual lives of Muslims without simply idealising its subjects. This takes us to the journalism, life writing and creative non-fiction of Shelina Zahra Janmohamed and the fiction of Ayisha Malik and Amjeed Kabil. We read this long-form work critically, attending to manifest advances in depictions of the relationships of Muslim-identified individuals over the last decade or so, while also remaining alert to lacunae and limitations in the individual representations. More broadly, we hope to signal our intention to avoid both Islamophobia and Islamophilia in scrutinising literary texts. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession’s negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We analyze the relationship of retail investor sentiment and the German stock market by introducing four distinct investor pessimism indices (IPIs) based on selected aggregate Google search queries. We assess the predictive power of weekly changes in sentiment captured by the IPIs for contemporaneous and future DAX returns, volatility and trading volume. The indices are found to have individually varying, but overall remarkably high explanatory power. An increase in retail investor pessimism is accompanied by decreasing contemporaneous market returns and an increase in volatility and trading volume. Future returns tend to increase while future volatility and trading volume decrease. The outcome is in line with the conjecture of correction effects. Overall, the results are well in line with modern investor sentiment theory. © 2017 German Economic Association (Verein für Socialpolitik)

AB  - Water scarcity has prompted an increasing number of cities to look for non-conventional sources of clean water. One of these sources is reused water, or highly treated reclaimed or recycled wastewater, a worthy addition to the portfolio of water-resource alternatives that increasing cities are considering in view of demographic and environmental changes. In this paper, we analyse communications from the media, policymakers and utility managers on the technology used to produce reused water for potable purposes. The focus of our analysis is technology as a means for producing safe and reliable water supply in the long-term. Three places were selected because of their differing experiences with social acceptance: Singapore, Orange County (California, United States), and Queensland (Australia). We found distinct differences in the communications used in the three places, which we believe have strongly influenced public opinion on the provision of clean water through potable water reuse. In communicating technological innovations to the public, it is essential to also discuss the broader framework affecting reliable water supplies. In this light, planning, legal and regulatory frameworks, institutional coordination, financial sustainability, and operational aspects should also be communicated. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the publicity around the implementation of the Zora robot in elderly-care services in Lahti, Finland. The aim is to discover opinions concerning the use of robots in elderly care as well as the arguments and justifications behind those opinions. Zora is a humanoid robot intended to promote mobility and rehabilitation. The Lahti pilot was the first Zora pilot in Finland in public elderly-care services. It received much publicity, both regionally and nationally. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on an empirical case study on the implementation of the Zora robot in elderly-care services. The data consist of interviews with personnel who operated Zora and comments from the general public about the “Zora” robot. Two data sources were used: 107 comments were collected from online and print media, and the personnel (n=39) who worked with Zora were interviewed. The data were analysed by means of interpretative content analysis. Findings: The results show that public opinion is mainly negative, but that the commentators apparently have little information about the robot and its tasks. The personnel had more positive views; they saw it as a recreational tool, not as a replacement for their own roles. Originality/value: There is clearly a need for more information, for a better informed discussion on how robots can be used in elderly care and how to involve the general public in this discussion in a constructive way. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: There are numerous campaigns targeting mental health stigma. However, evaluating how effective these are in changing perceptions is complex. Social media may be used to assess stigma levels and highlight new trends. This study uses a social media platform, Twitter, to investigate stigmatising and trivialising attitudes across a range of mental and physical health conditions. Methods: Tweets (i.e. messages) associated with five mental and five physical health conditions were collected in ten 72-h windows over a 50-day period using automated software. A random selection of tweets per condition was considered for the analyses. Tweets were categorised according to their topic and presence of stigmatising and trivialising attitudes. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on all stigmatising and trivialising tweets. Results: A total of 1,059,258 tweets were collected, and from this sample 1300 tweets per condition were randomly selected for analysis. Overall, mental health conditions were found to be more stigmatised (12.9%) and trivialised (14.3%) compared to physical conditions (8.1 and 6.8%, respectively). Amongst mental health conditions the most stigmatised condition was schizophrenia (41%) while the most trivialised was obsessive compulsive disorder (33%). Conclusions: Our findings show that mental health stigma is common on social media. Trivialisation is also common, suggesting that while society may be more open to discussing mental health problems, care should be taken to ensure this is done appropriately. This study further demonstrates the potential for social media to be used to measure the general public’s attitudes towards mental health conditions. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Health communication strategies to decrease teen pregnancies include the employment of entertainment-education (E-E), which involves embedding health messages in an entertainment media vehicle that is relatable and attractive to the intended audience. MTV’s 16 and Pregnant is an example of such an effort as an E-E documentary-style reality show that aimed to reduce the U.S. teen pregnancy rate. A pretest–posttest experiment was conducted with 147 adolescent girls (ages 14–18) to investigate the effectiveness of 16 and Pregnant on beliefs, attitudes, and intentions to avoid teen pregnancy. Among participants who reported the lowest levels of identification, parasocial relationship, and homophily, viewing 16 and Pregnant resulted in more negative attitudes toward teen pregnancy. Among participants who reported the highest level of homophily, viewing 16 and Pregnant resulted in more positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy. Levels of pregnancy risk and health literacy were examined but were not significant moderators. Results are discussed in light of E-E theory and research. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: This study was aimed at determining whether the pre-tertiary education system and ethnicity have any association with the attitudes of medical undergraduates towards communication skills. It also sought to determine if attitudes should have any relationship with communication skills assessment outcomes. Methods: A cross-section survey design was performed with 323 participants from two cohorts of medical undergraduates, i.e., first-year (n = 153) and second-year students (n = 170) who completed the Communication Skills Attitude Scale. Participants comprised of the main ethnic groups in Malaysia, i.e., Malays, Chinese and Indians, from different language medium pre-tertiary education backgrounds. Attitude measurements were compared with OSCE outcomes. Results: There was a significant difference in Negative Attitude Scale between pre-tertiary education system with attitudes towards communication skills (F (3, 319) = 7.79, p = .001), but no significant difference with Positive Attitude Scale (F (3, 319) = 0.43, p = .649). There was no significant difference between ethnicity and attitudes towards communication skills with PAS (F (2, 320) = 0.66, p = .519) and NAS (F (2, 320) = 1.24, p = .291). Students from Chinese medium education system had stronger negative attitudes with a mean score of 14.7 (n = 56, SD = 3.6) for primary school levels and 15.9 (n = 17, SD = 3.0) for secondary school levels, compared with others. There was no significant prediction of student's attitudes towards assessments outcomes. Conclusions: Preliminary findings from the small data pool suggest indicative relationships requiring further studies with more participants and proportionate pre-tertiary education system backgrounds.

AB  - It has been a widely held notion that firms can benefit from using preferential treatment in their customer relationship management strategies. For example, many firms provide select customers (i.e., recipients) with exclusive promotional offers that they purposefully do not extend to other customers (i.e., non-recipients). However, today’s empowered consumers are more socially aware than ever of such divisive practices (via social media, deal websites, etc.), and firms must now better account for the negative backlash from non-recipients that may ensue. In this research, we conceptually define exclusive promotions and outline how they differ from other more heavily-studied customer prioritization tools. We then take a divergent approach from the majority of the extant literature by focusing primarily on how and why non-recipients (rather than recipients) respond to exclusive promotions. Study 1a findings reveal that non-recipients have negative attitudes toward exclusive promotions, as well as negative attitudes and lower patronage intentions toward the firm using them. Perceived social exclusion was shown to underlie these unfavorable responses. In Study 1b, we rule out an alternative equity-based explanation of our findings by assessing loyalty to the firm as a potential moderator. We then extend our investigation to a field setting in Studies 2 and 3. There we replicate our Study 1a results, and assess consumers’ actual purchasing behavior in response to a real exclusive offer for enhanced generalizability. Lastly, in Studies 4 and 5 we empirically test two strategies that firms can potentially use to mitigate the negative effects of exclusive promotions documented here. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.

AB  - Sustainable urban forests require tree acceptance and support. Two groups of respondents, professionals (working in urban green areas) and individuals (with no professional connection with trees) revealed their attitudes towards trees by assessing statements in a survey questionnaire. Similar general attitude from professionals and nonprofessionals towards the examined benefits and harms related to urban trees was observed. Tree benefits were perceived as much more important than the annoyance they might cause. However, 6% of nonprofessionals found only negative aspects in trees, proving to be arboriphobes. No arboriphobes and no "Tree sceptics" were among the professionals. Around 40% of the respondents in the two groups found the number of trees in the surrounding areas too low. The nuisance caused by trees was seen as more disturbing by younger and lower-educated professionals. Women tended to assess trees as more attractive and as having a stronger influence on socioeconomic contributions than men. Men dominated the "Tree indifferent" group. The attractiveness of trees and their impact on socioeconomic contributions were related to the place of residence and the level of education among the nonprofessionals. The level of education of the nonprofessionals was also connected to being clustered into one of the four abovementioned groups of respondents. A majority of medium and big city dwellers as well as a minority of villagers were in the "Tree liking" cluster. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Despite their low pay and clerical status, the women who staffed the National Broadcasting Company’s (NBC) Information Department played an integral role in shaping the national network’s program and public relations policies. As the network’s first line of contact with its audience, Information Department workers influenced public opinion by shaping the networks’ responses to individual audience members’ written complaints. They also processed and molded the information NBC executives used to sell programming to advertisers. Still, as women, they were routinely devalued and their labor dismissed as simultaneously rote, irrelevant, and hyperemotional. This paper brings together internal documents from across NBC’s corporate structure to recover the careers of Anita Barnard and Kathryn Cole, two women who managed the Information Department through the 1940s and 1950s. During this period, the network underwent enormous transitions, including the shift from radio to television and renewed threats of federal regulation. The Information Department’s status waxed and waned along with NBC’s need to appease its audience and recruit and retain sponsors. Barnard and Cole’s status rose when audience information was at a premium, but it fell as soon as network dominance over television was established and financial returns assured. © 2019, © 2019 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - Cast against the backdrop of the U.S.–China “trade war” during the Trump Administration, Wanda Group’s billionaire chairman Wan Jianlin’s aggressive investments in the U.S. entertainment industry have become even more contemporaneous. This study first analyses the U.S. media coverage of Wanda’s investments in Hollywood using the grounded theory approach. The content analysis identified three major embedded themes: business, attitudes and actions of U.S. society, and China’s soft power strategy. The concurrence of the business and China’s soft power strategy reinforces the argument of previous studies that business and soft power are inherently connected. This study further argues that these two themes reflect the two major driving forces underlying the collaboration between China and Hollywood. This study also shows the predominant negativity in the attitudes and actions of U.S. society theme. This negativity reveals the public opinion environment in which the sharp power theory and Trump Administration’s new China–U.S. relations policies were developed, which would have significant impacts on the future collaboration between China and Hollywood. © 2019, © 2019 Media Management and Transformation Centre.

AB  - In an attempt to demonstrate how historical changes in public opinion concerning women in politics might be reflected in the media, this article offers an examination of Golda Meir’s 1969 election campaign coverage in the Israeli press compared to Tzipi Livni’s in 2009. Through a gender-focused content analysis of 878 news items, we show how, despite the scholarly argument regarding a ‘gender-blind’ socio-historical attitude towards Meir, the Israeli media discourse did in fact strongly emphasise gender-oriented elements while covering her 1969 candidacy. However, the historical comparison also shows that, with the passage of time, the Israeli press was significantly affected by political personalisation trends, as well as by a growing influence of more conservative voices, and as a result became far more gender-centred and stereotypical in Livni’s case. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Music has been thought of as an art form that expresses ideas and sentiments of the artist. This article examines the relationship between political and non-political rap and Black feminist attitudes. This study includes data from original experiments conducted at Benedict College a historically Black college in Columbia, SC, where Black males and females were exposed to various genres of music and their support of Black feminist attitudes were measured. Blacks exposed to political rap display increased support of Black feminist attitudes compared to those exposed to non-political rap and the control group, subjects who were not exposed to any form of music. Our research finds that those exposed to non-political rap have less affinity for Black feminist attitudes than those in any other group. This research is important to political science because it furthers our knowledge about public opinion and political attitudes. Specifically, this article demonstrates that non-traditional media forms also have an impact on political attitudes. Specifically, exposure to political rap has a significantly positive impact on the agreement with Black feminist attitudes when compared to exposure to non-political rap. Therefore, not all subgenres of rap music are consistently harmful to Black feminist attitudes and attitudes toward women. © 2018 Caucus for a New Political Science.

AB  - RÉSUMÉ: Michel Houellebecq n’est pas seulement un romancier; c’est aussi un personnage. Ce redoublement accompagne un double jeu qui définit sa posture: il suggère le second degré, mais il rappelle qu’il faut l’entendre au premier. En même temps qu’il ambitionne de rendre compte du monde, il revendique son refus de lui rendre des comptes politiquement et devant la justice. On partira de ce double jeu pour penser ensemble l’œuvre et le personnage, la littérature et l’idéologie. On s’attachera donc aux deux enjeux qui ont constitué les deux « scandales » principaux de cette carrière littéraire: le sexe et l’islam. On montrera d’abord comment le large succès de cette œuvre, en France et dans le monde, tient à sa capacité à résonner avec l’actualité, jusqu’à donner le sentiment de la préfigurer. On s’interrogera ensuite sur les tensions qui travaillent cette évolution. En effet, comment concilier la critique initiale du libéralisme sexuel hérité de mai 68 avec la charge contre l’islam qui est prise depuis le 11 septembre 2001 dans la rhétorique mondialisée du « conflit (sexuel) des civilisations » ? C’est dans l’affirmation de la masculinité blanche, dont Michel Houellebecq est le héros paradoxal, que se résout cette contradiction. © 2018, © 2018 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.
Michel Houellebecq is not only a novelist he is also a character in his own work as well as on the cinema screen and in media. This doubling is accompanied by a double-bluff that defines his literary persona: he is equally dramatically over-the-top and seeking to be taken seriously; his work suggests irony, but he underlines that he should be understood at face value. At the same tame as aiming to make sense of the world, he refuses to be held accountable to it. This article starts from this idea of the double-bluff so as not to be fooled by it: it will consider the work and the character together, but also the literature and the ideology it engages. We will focus particularly on the two major scandals of Houellebecq’s literary career: firstly the sex in Extension du domaine de la lutte and Les Particles élémentaires, then Islam in Plateforme and Soumission. This essay will consider how the success of these novels in France and around the world can be attributed to the way in which they resonate with contemporary news events, almost going as far as anticipating them–such as the return of debates around sexual identity in the French public sphere at the end of the 1990s to the rise of identitarian politics as a result of Islamophobia since the 2000s. It then considers the tensions responsible for this evolution in Houellebecq’s work, speculating how to reconcile the initial critique of post 1968 liberalism with the apparent anti-Islamic turn since 11 September 2001 in the global rhetoric of ‘the clash of civilisations. The affirmation of white male identity, of which Houellebecq is the paradoxical hero resolves this contradiction post ‘Charlie’. © 2018, © 2018, © 2018 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.

AB  - Covert advertising such as embedded paid content (EPC) is flourishing on Israeli TV, but in most cases regulators’ prohibiting rules are not enforced. Though the regulators’ role is to safeguard the public’s right to know, the public’s attitudes and ethical perceptions of EPC on TV is not being addressed. The current survey is an initial attempt to discover TV viewers’ attitudes towards EPC. While respondents’ attitudes towards product placement were indifferent, their attitudes towards EPC were generally negative. Results indicate that after being informed regarding paid TV content, respondents considered EPC to be culturally acceptable in Israeli (relativism), but morally unethical (moral equity). They also considered EPC a violation of the unwritten contract with media creators regarding the authenticity of media content (contractualism). Findings suggest that the Israeli public should be better informed regarding EPC and should be taken into consideration when dealing with its use, regulation and enforcement. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The popular reality television show The Biggest Loser Australia (TBL) is a significant source of media content about physical activity. This study examined audience responses to and interpretations of physical activity in TBL. A qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. A sample of 46 viewers of TBL was recruited, stratified by gender, age group, area of residence, and body mass index. Interview data were thematically analyzed to identify how viewers evaluated TBL. Respondents were most positive about TBL as public health education, premised on personal responsibility, the need for extreme action, and the possibilities of human agency (individually and collectively). Conversely, they were critical about whether the portrayal of physical activity could guide and inspire them personally. They expressed feelings of disgust and fear in response to the exercise challenges, questioned the practicality of the behavior change process in light of their own experience, and were skeptical about the purpose of the program itself. TBL’s representation of physical activity may be limited in its capacity to encourage physical activity. Despite the wide viewership of this program, encouraging physical requires innovation in the development of practical, persuasive and evidence based media messages about physical activity. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Since the failed 2004 Annan Plan referendum, a special relationship between the Turkish Cypriot community and the EU institutions has been established. Increased unofficial contacts have paved the way for a reinforced role of sub-state actors, including Turkish Cypriot media. The role of the Turkish Cypriot media in shaping public opinion towards the EU has been largely correlated with the course of the Cyprus negotiations. Weak institutionalisation has negatively affected the influence of the local media on advancing the sui generis relationship between the Turkish Cypriot community and the European Union, as well as Europeanisation in the northern part of Cyprus. This article applies the theoretical framework of horizontal and vertical Europeanisation to explore the impact of local media on the relations between the European Union and the Turkish Cypriot community. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In 1964, a small industrial town on the outskirts of Birmingham gained a reputation worldwide as Britain’s most racist town. The Conservative Party’s candidate, Peter Griffiths, bucked national trends in the General Election by winning a seat in Smethwick with a large majority, following a fiercely anti-immigrant campaign. Smethwick’s immigrant population was no larger than that of neighbouring towns, posing the question why such intense anti-immigrant feeling emerged at a local level? This article addresses the impact of local and regional media on public perceptions of immigrants in Smethwick during and immediately after the 1964 General Election, arguing that the local newspaper, the Smethwick Telephone, and ATV Today, ITV’s regional news programme for the Midlands, fuelled hostility and helped legitimise Griffiths’ campaign. By investigating the media’s influence at a local level, we can gain a greater understanding of the development of racial prejudice in British communities and the complex history of twentieth century media. This article further develops the work of Wendy Webster, Sarita Malik and Gavin Schaffer, who examine the framing of immigration by a range of national media forms but overlook the vital role of local and regional reporting in this process. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Assessing the impact of events on the evolution of online public discourse is challenging due to the lack of data prior to the event and appropriate methodologies for capturing the progression of tenor of public discourse, both in terms of their tone and topic. In this article, we introduce a geovisual analytics framework, CarSenToGram, which integrates topic modeling and sentiment analysis with cartograms to identify the changing dynamics of public discourse on a particular topic across space and time. The main novelty of CarSenToGram is coupling comprehensible spatiotemporal overviews of the overall distribution, topical and sentiment patterns with increasing levels of information supported by zoom and filter, and details-on-demand interactions. To demonstrate the utility of CarSenToGram, in this article, we analyze tweets related to immigration the month before and after the 27 January 2017 travel ban in order to reveal insights into one of the defining moments of President Trump’s first year in office. Not only do we find that the travel ban influenced online public discourse and sentiment on immigration, but it also highlighted important partisan divisions within the US. © 2018, © 2018 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.

AB  - Since spring 2017, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China has witnessed the emergence of an unprecedented re-education campaign. According to media and informant reports, untold thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims have been and are being detained in clandestine political re-education facilities, with major implications for society, local economies and ethnic relations. Considering that the Chinese state is currently denying the very existence of these facilities, this paper investigates publicly available evidence from official sources, including government websites, media reports and other Chinese internet sources. First, it briefly charts the history and present context of political re-education. Second, it looks at the recent evolution of re-education in Xinjiang in the context of ‘de-extremification’ work. Finally, it evaluates detailed empirical evidence pertaining to the present re-education drive. With Xinjiang as the ‘core hub’ of the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing appears determined to pursue a definitive solution to the Uyghur question. © 2018, © 2018 Southseries Inc.

AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers’ social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively. © 2018, © 2018 National Communication Association.

AB  - This article explores the construction of extremism in media discourse, the factors driving specific constructions and the implications of these constructions for counterterrorism policy. We contend that extremism has predominantly and increasingly been framed as a security issue. This article explores the implications of this practice through the framework of securitisation. We measure the average intensity of security framing in 38,616 articles found in three major US newspapers, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, between 20 January 1993 and 19 January 2017 comprising the Clinton, Bush and Obama presidencies, and look at factors influencing the shift in intensity over time. Through our analysis, we show that it is possible to return to a pre-9/11 discourse but that the confluence of real-world events and the strategic choices of political actors have so far prevented this from fully occurring. We then explore the effect of securitisation on public perceptions of the threat from terrorism, finding that increases in the intensity of security framing artificially increases the public’s worry about becoming a victim of terrorism. We conclude by discussing implications for the communication of counterterrorism policy and the requirements for an after, after 9/11 approach. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Chinese government officials and some Canadian foreign policy experts have challenged the content and tone of Canadian media's coverage of China. Canadian media coverage is thought to negatively bias public opinion and thereby constrain foreign policy choices available to policymakers. Scholars of Canada–Japan relations worry that decreasing media attention could have longer term effects on bilateral ties. Through an analysis of over 30,000 articles appearing in three major Canadian news publications over a 15-year time span (2000–2015), we identify how news about these countries is framed to the Canadian public and how these frames change over time. Our central finding is that the Canadian media experienced a “twenty-first century discovery of China” in 2004–2005. The volume of coverage of Chinese economic news spiked, while coverage of political rights declined, portraying China as a leader in the global economy and therefore a viable economic partner. Yet we find that media coverage is only loosely tied to public opinion. Counterintuitively, Canadian attitudes toward China have become more negative with increased positive news coverage, while declining coverage of Japan is correlated with increasingly positive views of the country. © 2018, © 2018 NPSIA.

AB  - The general elections of 2015 in Spain were elections of change. Two new parties for which voters had no previous historical reference points burst onto the parliamentary scene. Two (partially) opposed theories vie to offer an explanation as to how voters build their aggregate electoral expectations. In this paper, we investigate which mechanism has the greatest influence on the formation of expectations: published opinion or social interactions. Likewise, we also study if there is an ideological bias in the voters’ perception of the future results of the electoral battle. Based on analysis of microdata from a survey (sample size = 14,262) conducted in Spain on the occasion of the general elections of 2015, we provide evidence: firstly, that the published surveys are the main source used by voters to configure their aggregate expectations; and secondly, that the interpretation and projection that voters make about reality is not neutral, but strongly influenced by their own beliefs and preferences. © 2017, © 2017 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - Social networking sites are popular tools to engage citizens in political campaigns, social movements, and civic life. However, are the effects of social media on civic and political participation revolutionary? How do these effects differ across political contexts? Using 133 cross-sectional studies with 631 estimated coefficients, I examine the relationship between social media use and engagement in civic and political life. The effects of social media use on participation are larger for political expression and smaller for informational uses, but the magnitude of these effects depends on political context. The effects of informational uses of social media on participation are smaller in countries like the United States, with a free and independent press. If there is a social media revolution, it relates to the expression of political views on social networking sites, where the average effect size is comparable to the effects of education on participation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Social media offers a new channel to connect political elites with potential supporters. However, the flow of information between the two groups is constrained by a deliberate decision to actively listen only to some politicians based on the messages that users potentially favour. Previous research has posited that, if ideological proximity is an explanatory factor of the decision to follow certain political elites in social media, it should be possible to recover the political preferences of users from following behaviour. Using a unique database with survey data about the demographic characteristics and political attitudes of 5580 Twitter users, I show that, although ideology indeed explains following behaviour on Twitter, interest in politics induces a pattern of selection that limits what we can know about the ideological distribution in the population. My results provide direct validation of a previously hypothesised behaviour in the literature and have implications for the use of a proximity model to infer the state of public opinion using Twitter data. © 2017, © 2017 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - Purpose — Reputational crisis negatively affects brands and companies. This chapter, based on a single case study, aims to explore how prejudicial corporate statements directed toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals have affected the Italian multinational Barilla S.p.A., as well as how the company responded both internally and to the market in order to attempt to overcome the highly damaging consequences. Design/Methodology — This chapter uses a single case-study methodology, which constitutes “a research strategy that focuses on understanding the dynamics present within single settings to create theoretical constructs, propositions and/or midrange theory from empirical evidence” (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 534). The case-study design was chosen as it has been demonstrated to provide a methodological tool for both theory generation and theory testing (Gibbert et al., 2008). Findings — Conclusions from the chapter indicate that negative, incendiary, and oftentimes comments citing either religious or stereotypical-based ideology negatively impact both the consumers and its associated publics in terms of product branding or reputation image. Research Limitations — The study’s limitations, which rely primarily on a single case study and secondary research data, may motivate further investigative avenues, particularly as similarly referenced events continue to unfold almost daily, such as the study’s referenced incident with Philippine boxer Manny Pacquiao, as well as action taken by social media giants (Apple and Facebook) against the controversial media figure Alex Jones. Practical and Social Implications — This chapter also looks at family succession roadblocks and navigating social media gaffes. These contemporary issues highlight challenges, strategies, sales and market share dynamics for the company, and suggestions for navigating the road ahead. The research concludes with possible linkages and insights for both ongoing management issues and potential areas for future research. Other findings indicate that rapid responses, particularly those citing concrete corporate policy changes or tangible actions, help to reverse and mitigate reputational damage, and contemporary approaches utilizing social media appear to buttress these efforts. Originality/Value — This case study of Barilla as well as other firms mentioned, such as Chick-fil-A and Nike (which have experienced parallel situational crises), indicates that in only the last five years of contemporary international business practice, MNEs are continually and at times unexpectedly challenged by the lack of sensitivity demonstrated by their owners and spokespeople who utter comments which may be seen by the public as potentially harmful to the LGBT community. This study hopes to illuminate this challenge while offering tangible solutions to turning around future, similar situational crises. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Though the contemporary media environment is filled with many different sources disseminating communications about science - including journalists, politicians and opinion leaders, and researchers - few studies have examined how messages about science communicated by different sources directly influence audience opinion about scientific research itself. This experiment (N = 170) used stimuli articles that reflected different presentation sources (3: political/public relations/researcher) and types of science research (2: "hard"/"soft") to examine effects on people's attitudes toward the featured research project's (a) utility and (b) worthiness of federal grant funding, while controlling for individual differences in political attitudes and interest in science. Overall, political-source messages suppressed ratings of the project's worthiness of funding and utility, and while messages from the researcher source produced greater utility ratings compared to the public relations source for soft science projects, this pattern was reversed for hard science research. Additionally, different sources influenced people's comprehension of articles they read. We interpret these results within the larger landscape of science communication and conclude with brief practical recommendations for those engaging in science communication. © Tong, Vultee, Kolhoff, Elam and Aniss.

AB  - In order to reach wide masses of people, instruments such as radio, newspapers, books, television, internet are the most widely known and used mass media. Mass communication and thus mass media are needed to maintain a partnership by maintaining social existence and to maintain this presence and partnership. It is known that these tools, which carry out various functions such as informing, raising public opinion, educating, entertaining, affect the people's lifestyles, tastes, preferences and habits about consumption, and the sensitivity and behaviour of young people. The aim of our study is to reach the conclusions about the role of violence in visual media on high school youth. The focus of our research is to determine the degree to which students studying in high school schools in Nicosia, especially our population, are affected by the violent images in visual media. In our research titled. The Effect of Violence in Visual Media on High School Students Med, the effects and effects of real-life images on the effects of violent images in visual media were discussed. It is generally accepted that television, which is the most influential of visual media tools, takes up more space in our lives and becomes more effective day by day. Because of this effectiveness, the fact that violence is included in daily life in television programs causes children and young people to experience psychological problems in general. It is possible for the TV audience to impose behavioural patterns, and what is right and what is wrong, can lead to undesirable behaviours in society. The increasing violence in the world and in our country has become a serious threat to our educational institutions, especially in recent years. The aim of this research is to determine the extent of the impact of visual media on the increasing violence in high schools in order to contribute to such a subject which is of utmost importance to every part of it. The research consisted of 11,350 students studying in 19 different high school institutions in Nicosia district. Considering the school types, 250 students in 7 schools were taken as the study population. A total of 120 students were randomly selected from these schools. In the evaluation of the data, statistical (frequency) and percentage (%) values and chi-square statistical technique were used. According to the results of the research, family, peer group, school, television, internet etc. can be mentioned. Of these, especially TV programs are focused on the internet. In order to prevent the negative effects of violence in the youth on the youth, all segments of the society, especially families, have great duties. © 2019 Cyprus International University.

AB  - In 2016, Waleed Aly, a prominent Muslim Australian academic and media personality, made an argument using the Twitter hashtag “Send Forgiveness Viral” that asked for empathy in the face of Islamophobia. While initially appealing, deeper consideration of his use of and appeal to his audience to use Rogerian strategies to combat racism presents problems. Can Rogerian argumentation strategies be utilized to combat racism? Using Aly’s #SendForgivenessViral argument as a case study, this article evaluates Rogerian argumentation and empathic response in therapeutic situations compared to arguments about discrimination, particularly those taking place through social media. While scholarly writing by Lassner (1990) and Ede (1984) is dated, they provide pertinent and influential ideas to consider. More recent scholarship used to evaluate #SendForgivenessViral includes arguments on race, rhetoric, and Twitter revolutions by Brock (2012), D’Cruz (2017), Gerbaudo (2012), Margolin (2017), and Roose (2016). Other sources will be drawn from contemporary social media responses to Aly’s segment. This article concludes that Aly’s use of Rogerian argumentation is flawed because it places the onus of combatting racism onto victims. Furthermore, Rogerian argumentation models have underlying problems with power relations. © 2018 American Forensic Association.

AB  - Analysis of narrative can help identify the expectations actors hold about each other in international relations. This article triangulates a mix of elite interviews, media content analysis and an original Q-sort public opinion methodology to map the presence of narratives about EU relations among young Israelis and Palestinians. Our aim is not to explain the effects of EU public diplomacy in these countries. Instead we aim to identify the narrative “terrain” or conditions that the EU communicates to and with and, drawing on feminist and everyday narrative studies, to examine the role of affect and identity to explain why some narratives are more “sticky” than others in those societies. We find, first, a broad recognition that the EU’s capacity to act in international relations is necessary but limited in the face of greater challenges in the international system, and indeed, within the EU itself. We find, second, little evidence that young people radically reshape the narratives they encounter in their public spheres, but nevertheless some important divisions emerge that pose problems for how EU policymakers can communicate consistently without dismaying some citizens in third countries. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The accuracy and relevance of United States print news media has been called into question at increasing rates in the post-truth era. Conservatives, in particular, have long expressed concerns that mass and digital media censor conservative as well as Christian viewpoints while promoting a progressive and, more recently, pro-Muslim, platform. They have increasingly turned to alternative-right and alternative right-wing sources for news and discussion within what they deem to be unfiltered and unbiased networks. This article employs a mixed method approach of content and discourse analysis of sources from 1 January to 15 May of 2019 pertaining to discourse concerning the relationship between Christianity and Islam within and in response to articles in three such sources: Breitbart, The Federalist, and FrontPage Magazine. The role of these three websites is considered in the radicalization of those who aim to defend a monolithic form of Christianity rather than a particular Christian denomination or belief. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The Safeguarding Archaeological Assets of Turkey (SARAT) project is aimed at increasing knowledge, capacity, and awareness for the better protection and appreciation of Turkey’s archaeological assets. Within the scope of SARAT, a nationwide public opinion poll for mapping the relationship between archaeology and society in Turkey was designed and conducted. The fieldwork was carried out on 12–13 May 2018 across 103 districts of 29 Turkish provinces. Structured questionnaires were administered to 3,601 individuals above the age of 18 by employing face-to-face interview methodology. The results shed light on various aspects of the relationships between a community as diverse, dynamic, and populated as Turkey’s, and archaeology and archaeological assets located in this country. They have also been put into use as guidelines for designing various activities of the project that seek to increase public appreciation and awareness of archaeological assets. These activities include workshops with journalists on informed and accurate archaeological reporting, an online certificate programme for safeguarding and rescuing archaeological assets, workshops on Archaeology in Local Contexts as well as social media campaigns. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the digital era, Instagram is used by celebrities to participate in political contestation. Starting from incumbent celebrities to new celebrities who are running for politics, they use Instagram as a campaign media in the 2019 election. The presence of Instagram is a new alternative to revolutionizing political campaigns. Their popularity as a celebrity and celebgram made it easier for them to be able to built their image themselves and be able to win votes in their constituents. This study aims to see the use of Instagram by Indonesian celebrity politicians in influencing public attitudes and views that not only are they popular but they can also carry out their duties as people's representatives. By using the method of text analysis on instagram feeds celebrity women politicians who focus on various elements, including framing political ideologies through personal life displayed in the form of struggles the women politicians is facing in applying political values and ideology of political parties. The result of this study illustrates that the presence of Instagram media has inspired celebrity politicians to use isntagram as a "two-way" campaign media between politicians and voters. The campaign revolution was driven by intense voter behavior in using Instagram, as well as being more aware and reactive to political issues. On isntagram, women celebrity politicians put themselves as "political celebrities" by displaying that they are the main political players in various posts. This analysis highlights the effects and implications of the online political campaign revolution in Indonesia. In general, it offers an indispensable display on image-based e-politicking and contributes to academic literature on social media, permanent campaigns, as well as celebrities and politics in Indonesia. © 2019.

AB  - This study draws on Robert E. Park's writings regarding the impact of cinema on acculturation and James Baldwin's extensive reflections on the role of entertainment media in promoting the racial divide in the United States. Public opinion studies following the Trayvon Martin case and others reveal a racial divide regarding decisions to not charge or acquit officers. Research has shown that most members of the general public have no personal knowledge of both the criminal justice system and other races. Therefore, opinions are largely dependent on knowledge garnered through the media. Cultivation theory postulates that long-term exposure to specific media messages can result in subjects adopting specific opinions. Before a cultivation effect can be determined, the messages conveyed must be identified. This exploratory first step cultivation theory analysis examines municipal police officer use of force scenes in the first 40 years of the core cop film genre leading up to the killing of Trayvon Martin. A total population of 112 films was systematically identified, and all 468 police use of force scenes contained within the genre served as the units of analysis. Each scene was examined to determine depiction patterns and messages conveyed based on the race of officer. Findings revealed that White officers were overwhelmingly represented in use of force scenes, while minority officer scenes were isolated to specific years and films. Findings also demonstrated a dependence on a White officer's presence when minority officers used force on Whites. The historical origins and role of such depictions in cultivating current public perceptions of use of force are discussed. © 2019 Criminology, Criminal Justice, Law & Society and The Western Society of Criminology.

AB  - Contemporary far-right politicians increasingly diffuse messages through social networks. This article argues that online communication may prove effective for political engagement because it can cre-ate emotional reactions against certain groups, in a process that I call "emotional antagonism. " An exam-ple of emotional antagonism is online Islamophobia, which considers Islam as supposedly incompatible with democratic values and tends to conflate Muslims with migrants. Through qualitative observations and textual analyses of tweets, this article explores the following questions: How do certain online exchanges emotionally frame Muslims as the social "others" in relation to European culture? Why and how does the Internet facilitate the spread of emotional antagonism? What type of political propaganda and participa-tion is connected to affective online Islamophobia? The article analyses two case studies: 1) Islamophobic tweets sent in the aftermath of the British referendum in 2016, with the hashtag #Brexit; 2) Anti-Muslim tweets that contain the hashtag #chiudiamoiporti (close the ports), launched by Italian Vice Prime Minister Matteo Salvini in 2018 to support anti-migration measures. The article shows that exploring emotional an-tagonism can add complexity to the current understanding of Islamophobic conflicts, of social media plat-forms' characteristics, and of political participation based on online communication. © 2019-University of Salento.

AB  - The current Moon Jai-in administration in South Korea is facing serious challenges as a result of a scandal involving the manipulation of news online. Staff in Moon's camp are suspected of manipulating public opinion by creating millions of fake news comments online, contributing to Moon being elected president. This South Korean political scandal raises a number of theoretical issues with regard to new platform technologies and media manipulation. First, the incident exposes the technological limits of blocking manipulation of the news, partly because of the nature of social media and partly because of the nature of contemporary technology. Contemporary social media is often monopolistic in nature; with the majority of people are using the same platforms, and hence it is likely that they will be subject to forms of media manipulation. Second, the Korean case of news manipulation demonstrates a unique cultural aspect of Korean society. News comments and readers ' replies have become a major channel of alternative news in Korea. This phenomenon is often designated as "replyjournalism, " since people are interested in reading the news replies of ordinary readers equally to reading news reports themselves. News replies are considered indicators of public opinion and are seen as affecting trias politica in Korean society. Third, the Korean incident of news manipulation implicates a new form of populism in the 21st century and the nature of democratic participation. This article aims to explicate key issues in media manipulation by including wider technological, cultural, and political aspects in the South Korean news media context. © 2019 World Association for Triple helix and Future strategy studies.

AB  - All in the Family’s Archie Bunker was a mouthpiece for 1970s white working-class men. Theirs was an anxious decade. Peddling stereotypes, “othering” those unlike them, enabled this group to assert their threatened authority. Analyzed as popular media texts, the show’s many intersections with bigotry and anti-Semitism reveal unique insights into 1970s American life, especially the Jewish American experience. During the series’ decade-long run, Bunker gradually confronted and softened his prejudices. However, this was not the case among all “Archies,” a reality still visible in current times. Surveying the show’s racialist meditations against the backdrop of “tiki torchers” and Trumpism reminds viewers about the fraught nature of American identity, explaining why some Jews may elect to pass. © 2020 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, MI 48201-1309.

AB  - The impact of the new and social media on the audiences has obliged traditional television to adapt to a new culture of TV consumption. With the intention to generate new audiences, accustomed to social network infobesity mainly oriented in fake than real news, spectacle and consumption culture rather than information that affect the public opinion, TV genres are changing their flexible boundaries from infotainment talk show to trash show. But what are these new TV formats emerging in Albanian television? How are they created and under which influences? How are they organized and what kind of topics do they propose to the audiences? Are the interviews preprogrammed or are they spontaneous? What is the typology of their guests? Do they interact with the audiences in the studio? Are the questions of their followers in the social media included in the interview? The above listed questions and other issues are analyzed in this paper. The subject of this study is focused on two of the highest audience rated TV talk shows, “Xing me Ermalin” and “Zonë e lirë”, aired on the national television, Klan. The methodology of this paper is based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data and programs generated by the TV, social media monitoring process and interviews with anchorman, guests and media experts. © 2019, Croatian Anthropological Society.

AB  - This paper deals with the influence of social media on the creation of news in Croatian national television news programmes. It examines how posts published in social media influence news on public and commercial televisions, primarily concerning the creation of relevant political messages in national television central news programmes (HTV, RTL, Nova TV). At the same time, the paper attempts to determine which social media news are used the most, and which televisions lead in conveying the same. The research was based on several assumptions, presented through three hypotheses. The first is that commercial televisions use social media as a source of information to a greater extent than the public television. The second is that most posts from the social media that are presented in public and commercial television news refer to political messages. The third is that journalists usually do not check the authenticity of posts and messages in social media by consulting additional sources. Taking into consideration uniqueness of television as a visual medium, this paper was trying to test in which manner presenting posts from social media impacts the changes within television as a medium. By using two empirical research methods (quantitative method based on surveys and content analysis) and by comprising a representative sample (of both the respondents and characteristic content segments). The results obtained basically refuted both the first and the third hypotheses, while the second one was supported in full. The results – along with the confirmation of the importance of social media as a source of information – displayed the structure of using the shared information, especially the information with political content, crucial to forming public opinion. At the same time, they also showed the direction of change of the television medium in the media convergence environment. © 2019, Croatian Anthropological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Respected scholar, expert, public opinion maker, oracle, under-cover politician, charlatan, cartoon character - all roles "out there" waiting for scholars sharing knowledge with a wider public. Scholars of religion trying to carve out more room in the public arena for a nonreligious, scientific approach to religion always risk digging their graves as (respected) scholars. What's worse, they also risk digging the grave for a valuable and respectable, as well as publicly valued and respected academic, scientific study of religion. The scholar popularizing scientifically based knowledge, not least via the mass media (daily newspapers or public television), may "become" political and controversial to such a degree that s/he becomes a problem for the scientific study of religion, the community of scholars of religion, and the university with which s/he is affiliated. The otherwise valuable engagement threatens the reputation of science as being something valuable, "pure" and "neutral," elevated above the dirty business of politics and power. In spite of the risks, the engaged scholar, it is, however, also argued, actually can help to strengthen the position, inside and outside the academy, of scientifically based knowledge and of the critical, analytical, scientific study of religion. © 2019 Tim Jensen.

AB  - One of the long-term goals of autonomous mobility is to achieve mobility for non-drivers or those with difficult access to mobility: for seniors, women, children or other groups of people who are not able to drive a car. However, previous surveys revealed that respondents in these subpopulations were rather reluctant to use connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). This discrepancy brings a paradox in the context of autonomous mobility because one of the main benefits of autonomous mobility is its use by groups that currently reject it the most. One of the reasons for this refusal may lie in the amount of available information on CAVs. Thus, this study focuses on the general attitude, the level of awareness and the preferred ways of new information obtaining on CAVs. Firstly, focus groups revealed preferred media channels for obtaining new information on CAVs. Consequently, a survey was conducted on perceptions and attitudes related to CAVs among the general population in the Czech Republic. Overall, 59 professional inquirers personally interviewed 1116 persons older than 15 years via computer (CAPI). Respondents were selected through the multistage probabilistic sampling procedure, based on the list of address points in the Czech Republic. In the sample, there were 573 (51%) women, the average age was 51 years (SD = 17 years). The results show that, on average, women declared more neutral and negatives attitude towards CAV in comparison to men regardless of age. Furthermore, men declared higher CAV awareness than women in all age groups. As for the preferred information channels, young men mostly chose internet or a "trial as a driver on the circuit". On the other hand, seniors declared the lowest willingness to receive new information about CAVs. However, if they wish to receive information on CAVs, they prefer TV or a "Trial during a social event at my neighbourhood". Results of this study are thus consistent with findings of previous studies as they all identify the importance of gender and age when it comes to the attitude on CAVs. © 2018 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

AB  - The article is devoted to the linguistic situation in the Republic of Tatarstan reflected in mass media. Adoption of the Law "On languages of the peoples of the Republic of Tatarstan" in 1992 facilitated the developed of a legal basis for implementing the language policy aimed at parity progress of the state languages. Given the importance of preserving the native language in Tatarstan, the conditions for maintenance and versatile development of the Tatar language are being created. It is well known that mass media, including the regional ones, have been acquiring the role of a public opinion moderator, thus becoming a rich source of empirical material for monitoring various ethno-political processes. It can be relevant to consider the regional mass media of the Republic of Tatarstan in order to find out the attitudes towards the language policy implemented at both regional (Republic) and federal levels. In general, the analysis of the Republic informational space shows that the language policy of the Republic of Tatarstan government, the issues of preservation and development of the Tatar language are still topical. Despite the 25th anniversary of adoption of the Law "On state languages of the Republic of Tatarstan", the coexistence, functioning and development of the two state languages in the Republic is still not represented in mass media as equal; the Russian language continues to prevail in all aspects of "statehood". © 2019, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz.

AB  - The article discusses the ways of media personality nominations. It has been established that the typical linguistic forms of personality representation in newspaper texts are the proper name (anthroponym) and its contextual equivalents, which are secondary nominations. The modifications of proper name, lexeme identifiers and periphrases can act as the contextual equivalents of official anthroponyms. The latter can be either evaluative or evaluative neutral. Evaluation periphrases create a publication character image, form the public perception of a media personality necessary for a message sender. Periphrases neutral in terms of evaluation, help the reader to identify the media personality in terms of professional activity, social status, age, the place of residence and other parameters. A special group of contextual equivalents of the name are the periphrases that have become case-law and / or are correlated with the case-law situation, which is actively discussed in the media. The systematization of periphrases by the degree of correlation with a particular referent made it possible to distinguish the following types of them: a) the periphrases correlated with the referent in context exclusively; b) the periphrases assigned to the referent in a limited time period; c) the periphrases assigned to the referent regardless of time and context; d) stable periphrases of a metaphorical nature that do not have a clear assignment to the referent and appear in the text as evaluative elements. The study allows us to argue that contextual equivalents are the means of text coherence provision, avoiding repetition, additional information provision about the media personality, the creation of certain image him and a powerful means of public opinion development. © 2019, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz.

AB  - Fiction is often credited with shaping public attitudes to science, but little science communication research has studied fans' deep engagement with a science-themed fiction text. This study used a survey to investigate the impacts of television series Doctor Who (1963-89; 2005-present) on its viewers' attitudes to science, including their education and career choices and ideas about science ethics and the science-society relationship. The program's reported impacts ranged from causing participants to fact-check Doctor Who's science to inspiring them to pursue a science career, or, more commonly, prompting viewers to think broadly and deeply about science's social position in diverse ways. © The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse what kind of information related to e-learning is circulating in social media and in particular in Twitter from the perspective of someone who searches on Twitter. This paper is an attempt to discover in what extend is Twitter being used as a tool for e-learning and consequently collaboration. This paper analyses approximately 156,000 tweets regarding online education in order to evaluate the type of information circulating in this kind of discourse. In this way, it could be used from educators who are thinking of including Twitter as a tool for an online course. The tweets were gathered in spring 2018 using R programming language. For analysing and visualising the patterns encoded in tweets, we rely on the effectiveness of topic modelling using LDA. The dataset is composed by tweets extracted from Twitter API on e-learning related queries. The results indicate the prevalence of one-way promotional material over bidirectional discussions among users. This implies a necessity for quality control of educational information on social media and a need to motivate the educational community to participate to a larger extent in related discussions.

AB  - Objective: to examine the arguments contained in the news published in the electronic media about the use of crochet octopuses in Brazilian neonatal intensive care units. Method: exploratory and retrospective documentary study, with a qualitative approach, which used 21 electronic news from 2017 to 2018 as data source. Results: improved vital signs and respiratory rate, stable heart rate, greater oxygenation were the main benefits for patients, premature babies. The most frequent arguments were authority, hard evidence and consensus. Conclusion: the news highlighted the benefits of the use of crochet octopus by newborns admitted to the neonatal unit, especially before the technical inform from the Ministry of Health, when they were more numerous. However, there are no scientific studies that prove the instrument's effectiveness. The arguments identified in the study reveal convincing strategies that were used to form public opinion regarding the use of crochet octopus in premature infant. © 2019, Centro de Estudos da Faculdade de Enfermagem da UERJ.

AB  - As the continuous development of mobile social networks, the structure of the mobile social network increasingly becomes complex. It not only speeds up information transmission between people but also expands the scope of information exchange, which has become an essential and important social media in people's social life. How to effectively identify and classify these online communities has important practical significance for the study of social networks. Correctly detecting the community structure of mobile social networks can not only improve the accuracy of friend recommendation, link prediction, service user positioning, product marketing, and other aspects but also provide an important basis for the monitoring of online public opinion. But the traditional social network cluster method based on the trust degree mainly calculates the user trust by analyzing the interactive feedback information between users. This method cannot effectively solve the 'cold start' problem in the trust calculation process, that is, for the new network node, the trust value of this node cannot be accurately measured due to the lack of interaction with other nodes. Focusing on this problem, we propose a Gaussian pigeon-oriented graph clustering algorithm for social networks' cluster in this paper. A graph model is first built. Then, an efficient K-medoid algorithm is utilized to search the user center in all groups. The Gaussian pigeon algorithm is used to search the similarity between each user and the central user. Users that meet the similarity threshold are divided into the same user group. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method has better cluster effect than other state-of-the-art social networks' clustering approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The issues of social media spreading hoax news are increasingly worrisome in the diverse society life in Indonesia. It is obvious that various conflicts have been triggered by hoax news filled with prejudice, hatred and negative information. Besides, the prevalence of hoaxes has increased simultaneously with political democracy in Indonesia. For the reason of freedom of communication as being the right of the people, messages are often interpreted unilaterally to serve a given interest. This research aims to obtain an overview of the hoax which threatens diversity as well as the effective strategy and communication pattern to counter it. To gain a holistic view of hoaxes on social media, this research employed a qualitative research method. This research found that hoaxes dominate the social media information traffic and threaten national diversity, which is perceived differently by social media users and society. Another finding is that there is a need for a strategy and communication pattern to counter hoaxes which threaten the nation unity. © 2019.

AB  - The article answers how growing intensity of China-V4 relations in the period of 2010-2017 impacted the media discourse of China in Central Europe. While diplomatically speaking China and the Visegrad countries reached perhaps the most positive and intensive relations ever, the top-down impact on people's perceptions is less clear. Media play an important role as an intermediary between the politics and public opinion and their role in EU-China and China-Central Europe relations has been previously discussed. The paper summarizes empirical findings of large-scale research of media reporting related to China in Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic from 2010 till mid-2017 in which more than seven thousand media outputs were consulted. It is found that the political relations led to quantitative increase of media coverage of China, yet the qualitative impact is ambivalent, thus questioning the success of Chinese soft power attempts. The discourse on China in the Czech Republic and Hungary is in no small extent politicized, polarized, and media often inform about China based on domestic political considerations, while in Slovakia there is little interest in China overall and media largely follows official narratives and international discourse. © 2019, Centre for Social Sciences Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The Technology nowadays has a fundamental role when it comes to the changes made by humanity, which they have experimented throughout its history. The technology which covers both communication and information allows emotions, attitudes and values to be shown. These are implied due to them being generated in the network, developing forms of participation and the interaction between those who have a share common interest such as ideas, information, knowledge and entertainment. This research article provides a quick summary of the theoretical analysis of the “Martha” and “Diana” cases which occurred in Ecuador. The methodology applied was a mixed type with a sequential explanatory design (Dexplis). The analyzed material was collected, through the use of a software called Pandora Network Traffic Analyzer and by having a semi-structured interview which applied to two journalists and two University teachers in the social communication. The publications which are made by the social media and the data which is obtained by the key informants of the study, were verified by checking how the public opinion is influenced by the way in which the information is handled and exposed. The human actions migrate back to the network, where a confrontation between opponents and supporters is reflected. Furthermore, Network communication encourages citizens to discuss the controversial issues that bring down the real events, exalting solidarity and hatred of foreign immigrants residing Ecuador. © 2019 Samuel et.al..

AB  - This study expands uses and gratifications research into the area of political Instagram use. A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers’ motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram. © 2019, SAGE Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The future of any country in the contemporary era lies in its ability to harness the knowledge potential. The fruits of knowledge society have transformed the terrain of social and political scenario of countries around the world. Democracy as a form of government, to be successful, requires a critically-engaged and politically literate population. Democracy, therefore, requires not only political literacy but also media and digital literacies given the influence of media in our lives. If democracy is viewed as a relationship between knowledge and power, there needs to be a strong distinction between the ideas, the truth of power and the power of truth. The term, 'Post-truth', signifies that objective facts have become less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal beliefs. The political processes in various democracies seem to have become more managerial and technologically fixated. There has been significant erosion in the ideas of transparency of information and political leadership has become nothing but a propaganda exercise. The paper analyses how the information technology revolution and the surge of new media has impacted the political processes in democracies, and presents the phenomenon of post-truth as a threat to the modern democratic systems. © 2019 Journal of Dharma: Dharmaram Journal of Religions and Philosophies (DVK, Bangalore).

AB  - Social media platforms, thanks to their inherent nature of quick and far-reaching dissemination of information, have gradually supplanted the conventional media and become the new loci of political communication. These platforms not only ease and expedite communication among crowds, but also provide researchers huge and easily accessible information. This huge information pool, if it is processed with a systematic analysis, can be a fruitful data source for researchers. Systematic analysis of data from social media, however, poses various challenges for political analysis. Significant advances in automated textual analysis have tried to address such challenges of social media data. This paper introduces one such novel technique to assist researchers doing textual analysis on Twitter. More specifically, we develop a clustering methodology based on Longest Common Subsequence Similarity Metric, which automatically groups tweets with similar content. To illustrate the usefulness of this technique, we present some of our findings from a project we conducted on Turkish sentiments on Twitter towards Syrian refugees. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - While much of the scholarship on populist political communication focuses on its content and a verbal style, less is known about the nonverbal cues accompanying populist messages. This paper aims in filling that gap by providing findings of the study on characteristics of nonverbal communication of two Polish presidential candidates: Bronisław Komorowski and Andrzej Duda, traced during two debates broadcast on television before the second round of the presidential elections in 2015. The results revealed that both candidates employed nonverbal cues such as appearance, eye contact, facial expressions, or gestures that emphasized their references towards the people or negative attitudes towards elites expressed in their verbal messages. The study also proved that the methods used previously in research on nonverbal content on television (observational protocols and analysis of facial expressions) may be successfully employed in studies on nonverbal components of the populist style of communication. © 2019 Polish Communication Association.

AB  - This article examines migration-themed tweets issued by Polish MPs on the social media platform Twitter by presenting patterns in the narrative on migration as well as identifying determinants affecting politicians’ discourse. The study fills a gap in the literature on the way political leaders discuss migration on social media. The empirical investigation proves that Polish parliamentarians frame their migration tweets around three dominant topics: threat, humanitarian and/or financial aid, and opportunities. The discussion on migration is shaped by several factors: the complexity of the issue, mainly in the area of adopted legislative procedures and mechanisms for their implementation (the political factor), the public response (the social factor), and the public perception of mi-grants which, in turn, is influenced by existing prejudices and stereotypes (the psychological factor). The complexity of the above-mentioned factors results in direct implications, i.e. the emergence of difficulties affecting the decision-making process of a politician as well as the occurrence of specific reactions of the public to the discussion of the migration topic. In addition, they lead to indirect implications, i.e. the emergence of factors – challenges, threats, opportunities, and risks – that on one hand affect the politician’s rhetoric on migration, and on the other hand contribute to shaping public opinion as well as reinforcing or weakening social fears, anxieties, prejudice, and stereotypes. © 2019, Masaryk University Press.

AB  - The study is aimed at exploring storytelling approach as a medium for the transformative teaching and learning of interfaith dialogue among undergraduate students. Due to their upbringing and environment, the students do not have the oppurtunity to know other religions and culture better. This is especially true for those who lived only among their own ethnic. Therefore, this research is aimed at promoting interfaith dialogue as well as fostering peace and harmony between students of the Department of ‘Aqidah and Islamic Thought, Academy of Islamic Studies, University of Malaya; Department of Theology and Philosophy, National University of Malaysia and Centre for Religion and Society of Malaysia Theological Seminary. Through group conversation, fieldwork and workshop with the students, this study demonstrates that peace education through storytelling can be utilized as a tool of narrative truth-telling, aimed at restoring inter-personal relationships, healing traumatic experiences and promoting social coexistence (ta’ayush). This approach enables to foster interfaith dialogue among the students thus, contributes to the development of a culture of peace. The storytelling approach with a member from ‘the other’ group can be interpreted as a desire to proclaim the ‘unheard’ voices and feelings to be shared with ‘the other’. It connects with the practice of active listening to overcome prejudice, leading towards the transformative learning process. Peace storytelling may therefore, be seen as an understanding ‘the others’. This study also recommends the significance on creating environments to foster inter-religious dialogue, expanding formats of interfaith dialogue and increasing religious study through education and training. © 2019, University of Malaya.

AB  - In this article, we aim to analyse the research discourse in the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) as regards Russian soft power, which is considered as hard power, and to compare the theses that dominate this discourse with the actual interactions between Russia and the three states in media, education, and culture. Each Baltic country has built a system of political and legal restrictions to diminish the effect of Russian soft power, which is considered in terms of hard power, i.e. as a threat to national security. The current forms of Russian soft power are becoming less productive in the region and their use in the negative political context of bilateral relations has the opposite effect for Russia - the country loses in reputation and image. The main factor at play is the information content of the Russian-language media space. At odds with the historical and political views of a significant part of the Baltic States' ruling class, it is becoming the target of counteraction. At the same time, Russian high and mass culture and, partly, educational services are in demand from both Baltic Russian speakers and ethnic Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. Our analysis shows that the views of Baltic researchers that Russian soft power is politics-driven and foreign to the region are exaggerated and biased. In its turn, Russian soft power in the Baltics retains the potential to aid the country's foreign policy, being a complement to the latter rather than its direct tool. © Vorotnikov V. V., Ivanova N.

AB  - With the growing availability of internet and opinion rich resources such as social networks and personal blogs, the task of mining public opinion and exploring facts has become more popular than ever before during the last decade. The latest trend has deeply transformed the way the governments interact with their citizens and offer them various services through continuous public engagement. The proposed framework SCANCPECLENS is an initiative to support performance assessment framework for e-government in Pakistan. The research takes into account the opinion of masses on one of the most crucial and widely discussed development projects, China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), considered as a game changer due to its promise of bringing economic prosperity to the region. The proposed framework suggests to use machine learning algorithms to automatically discover the public sentiment from microblogs on the matter nationally as well as internationally. We also present an automated way to create sentiment lexicon of positive, negative and neutral words on the subject. To the best of our knowledge, this theme has not been explored for opinion mining before and helps one in effectively assessing public satisfaction over government's policies in the CPEC region. The research is an initiative to discover new avenues of future research and direction for the government, policy making institutions and other stake holders and demonstrates the power of text mining as an effective tool to extract business value from vast amount of social media data. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates whether online news that are shared on Facebook set the agenda for its readers. In response to the importance of social networking sites as sources of information, news media organizations have set up Facebook channels in which they publish news stories or links to articles. This allows for a wider news reach as well as audience participation. When audience members read and subsequently comment on news articles on Facebook, it becomes possible to identify public opinions and sentiments on the issues being covered. To investigate whether user comments mirror the issues and sentiments presented in the news articles, the agenda-setting approach was applied. Content analysis was used to analyse audience comments on over 450 news articles from 4 major newspapers written during the Rantau by-election in Malaysia (April, 2019). The findings showed that while the newspapers and the readers do share some issue salience, the relationship does not typify a traditional agenda-setting dynamic. The news readers are not just the ones receiving the news and issues. Rather, they are also commenters who are influencing how others receive news and issues hence disrupting the conventional public opinion model. Copyright © IIUM Press.

AB  - The research highlights how media, cinema, political discourse or literature portrays Muslims and Islam in a negative light by dwelling on the crimes of only a few Muslims, which in turn creates a stereotype for the Muslims via comparative qualitative research methods. As a result, Orientalism and Islamophobia are rooted in the development of the American empire. In conclusion, the principal subject of discrimination in America today is the Muslims; therefore, it concludes that Islamophobia is the newest and ongoing form of racism in America. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - The media and the different social actors have played an important role in shaping public opinion about energy poverty and injustice in Spain. A mixed-design study analysed the composition of stakeholder groups, their degree of involvement and participation, their substantial contributions to the reduction of inequality, and their communication strategies. Both content analysis and qualitative analysis were used by adopting a well-founded approach to 478 news items from the digital press, published between 2012 and 2017. The study concluded that energy poverty has been addressed from the welfare and conjunctural perspective and that this has led the media advocate energy justice and collective empowerment in order to achieve energy citizenship. © 2019 Centro de Investigaciones Sociologicas.

AB  - The Activity Report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania for 2017 declares that Lithuania's foreign policy is effective and claims that public opinion is the most important criteria for measuring its effectiveness. The article analyses Lithuania's foreign public policy cycle, with the focus on its formation and evaluation peculiarities. It argues that the cycle of Lithuanian foreign public policy is stagnating since its evaluation stage lacks efficiency and misses critical evaluations. The lack of strategic documents does not allow defining core foreign policy goals and in this matter to evaluate their achievement. The ambiguous goals in lower level documents prevent critical evaluation because of political interests. Lithuanian foreign policy is the outcome of close cooperation between President's Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs which limits criticism between institutions. The Seimas provides greater criticism only when initiative is showed by the opposition. Foreign policy remains the sphere of responsibility of the political elite which has broad consensus and has differences in their views on a tactical level. Media and experts, for the most part, avoid critical evaluations of foreign policy as they want to remain in the dominating discourse and keep close contacts with state institutions. The current evaluation environment and tools are not sufficient to make changes at the agenda-setting stage of foreign policy. © 2019 Mykolas Riomeris University. All rights reserved.

AB  - In September 2015, following the ratification of Istanbul Convention by Portugal, addressing someone with unwanted verbal “sexual proposals” became a criminal offence. This however, barely meets the requirements of the treaty and is far from what was first discussed about sexual harassment both in the Portuguese Parliament and more broadly in the media. When the criminalization of “piropo”—the Portuguese colloquial word for “catcalling”—was first proposed, it sparked heated opposition in online discussions, revealing strong prejudices against women and anti-feminist sentiments. Aiming to contribute to the understudied area of street harassment, this article maps the ways in which its legal developments were framed and counter-framed between August 2013 and September 2018, corresponding to the period before, during and after its adoption. Methodologically, we worked through the combination of quantitative and interpretative methods in order to understand gender politics in public policy making, through the study of news media texts and readers’ comments posted on Facebook. We argue that whereas feminist interpretations found their way into media texts, reader’s discussions expressed the popular misogyny that shaped the law reform. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The mass media play a decisive role in shaping of public opinion, including the environmental issues. This problem is relevant not only due to its extreme aggravation in the system of “nature-society”, the need to improve the effectiveness of the state environmental policy, including the information support, but also due to the unprecedented changes in media space. The transition from traditional to new media in the 1990s, the further global spread of the Internet, and the digitization of communication messages have led to fundamental changes in media sphere. The Internet has connected many users-individuals, organizations, media into a single, open communication network, creating the unlimited number of connections, reducing the distance between network participants, eliminating spatial restrictions. The new level of communications has been formed. It has changed not only the access of consumers to information, but also the interaction with it. Mass media became a powerful tool for the purposeful formation of social orders, mainly through the building of necessary public relations, including the ecological issues. They influence a number of processes, from formal environmental policy to informal views of the public on the current state of environment (1-4). In this regard, the study of coverage of environmental problems and the measures of government, aimed for their solving, in mass media is an important task in scientific, practical and political sense. The article presents the research results of the role of regional media in covering the environmental issues, in determining the effectiveness of information support of the government environmental protection policy. © 2019, Dorma Journals.

AB  - The present academic literature hosts volumes of information on Muslim anti-Semitism, while Jewish anti-Islamism is hardly mentioned. With the aim of filling this scholarly gap, the article deals with contemporary Jewish anti-Islamism, principally focusing on Zionism's role in such anti-Islamism, by delving into the existing literature, news media, and online sources. Since the very birth of Zionism, Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and, finally, Islam itself have primarily been seen as "obstacles" to Zionist goals. The "chosenness, " "promised lands, " and "messianism" doctrines at the core of Zionism have led to the antagonization of the aforementioned. There appears to be a blatant overlap between anti-Islamism and Jewish voices in the media, the entertainment sector, popular bookshops, foundations, academia, think-tanks and the virtual world. Finally, pro-Israel influences in the West have catalyzed negativity about Islam and Muslims and propagated wars through lobbying activities. Jewish anti-Islamism is real and needs further scholarly investigation. © Bursa Ilahiyat Foundation.

AB  - The representation of sex work in the media has received little to no attention in the field of linguistics and discourse analysis. Given that news discourse can have a huge impact on public opinions, ideologies and norms, and the setting of political agendas and policies (van Dijk 1989), the study adopts a Corpus-Assisted Critical Discourse Analysis (CACDA) approach (Baker, Gabrielatos, KhosraviNik, Krzyżanowski, McEnery & Wodak 2008), seeking to explore whether journalists reproduce or challenge negative stereotypes vis-à-vis sex work. Examining 82 articles published in three Greek newspapers (Kathimerini, TA NEA, Efimerida ton Syntakton) in 2017, this paper considers the lexico-grammatical choices that are typically involved in the representation of sex work and sex workers in the Press. Drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistics, the Discourse Historical Approach and corpus linguistics, the analysis links the textual findings (micro-level context) with the discourse practice context (meso-context) as well as the social context in which sex work occurs (macro-context). Findings illustrate that although sex work in Greece has been legalised for about two decades, traces of abolitionist discourses can be found in the Press, building barriers in the emancipatory efforts of sex workers who stand up for having equal civil and labour rights as their fellow citizens. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Social Network Sites (SNSs) play key role to raise individuals’ awareness in terms of political issues around the world. Young generation particularly university students utilize social networks for political activism and discussion. The present study investigates the effect of social network on political knowledge and attitude of Iranian university students. Mixed- method design was employed to collect quantitative data through a questionnaire followed by an emailed interview with Iranian media experts. The sample size in the study consisted of 382 Iranian students and 12 media experts. The findings of the current study showed that there is generally a direct and positive relation between the level of use of social networks and political knowledge, and attitude. Moreover, the results revealed that using social network sites have a significant positive effect on student’s level of political knowledge and political knowledge mediates the positive effect of social network use by Iranian university students on their political behavior. The results of interview corroborate that easy access to modern information sources has increased political knowledge of the students. The results also implied the necessity of deploying an intelligent filtering rather than indiscriminate blocking of the social network websites. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

AB  - Increasing migration is a vital concern for a globalizing sociocultural environment in today's world. The UK and developed European countries have become an attractive destination for asylum seekers (labelled as "migrants") in the past decade. The rapid rise in the number of asylum seekers, which was labelled "migration crisis" (Ruz, 2015), made this topic an integral part of scientific discussion on sociocultural environment. There are different factors underlying the perception of migrants by local population. The given study is devoted to the review of the usage of different linguistic means and its strategies by mass media whilst the escalation of refugee crisis in Great Britain as compared to Russia. We implement situational approach to the non-fiction factual texts, in particular, texts representing a concrete (actual) situation. Today due to the development of neural network technology we can easily define thematic structure of the text, specify the central lexis, the near peripheral lexis and the far peripheral lexis and reveal implicit information. The data of British National Corpus and Russian National Corpus is analyzed using text mining software-TextAnalyst 2.01. The relationships and patterns among key words and their associations are cluster-analyzed and contextual interpretation of semantic core is provided. Associative structures enable us to define the lexical experience of its speakers (White & Abrams, 2004) while the analysis of associative network helps to study public opinion on different social issues (File, Keczer, Vancso et al., 2018). The data for the text mine is gathered from the website Ruscorpora.ru (data set 1) and British National Corpus (data set 2). The thematic network depicts the structure of the text and the most pertinent information in the data. The semantic network constructs a list of topics and their semantic weights. It is a tree structure of the concepts of the text and identifies the relationships in the text. Just like in data set 1 public attitudes in data set 2 towards refugees and migrants are complex. Representation of migrants and hence public opinion are complicated by predisposition to favor those using legal means to enter a country with national culture, traditional customs, laws and ability to speak the language of the host country being the key factor in integrating migrants. © 2019, RALs.

AB  - This paper seeks to look at economic and socio-political issues discussed by online participants in online news forums leading to the 2014 South African general elections. A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse viewers' comments about economic and socio-political issues discussed by online participants during the 2014 South African general elections posted online. A corpus of all commentary appended to 2014 South African general election news reports published online by Media24, Times Media Group, Mail and Guardian, Independent Newspapers, Caxton CTP, and TNA Media were selected. The study employed a purposive sampling technique and 1000 comments were extracted. The sample began four weeks before the election and ended two weeks after the event. NVIVO 11 was utilized to code these readers' comments into their respective categories. The findings revealed that participants have different perspectives on different economic and socio-political matters such as slate politics, and cadre deployment, economic meltdown. © Kamla-Raj 2019.

AB  - Music is intimately implicated in racialising discourses. This is particularly pronounced in the case of so-called black music, i.e. the types of music that are commonly associated with African-American identity, most notably jazz and various forms of popular music. Genres of popular music are furthermore constructed continuously on the basis of a notion of their "black roots." The idea of the "black roots" of jazz and popular music is an essential ingredient of Paul Gilroy's (1993) analysis of a specific authenticity of blackness. To stress the history and consequences of the pre-twentieth century slave trade and institutionalised racism, Gilroy has coined the concept "Black Atlantic" that builds on the idea of a distinct double consciousness inherent in blackness as simultaneously a fundamental constituent and the ultimate other of the West. In the article, I aim at rethinking the notion of the Black Atlantic in relation to North-Eastern Europe. By way of marine analogy I ask, and building on the notions of the Black Pacific and the Black Mediterranean, how to formulate an analytical design "the Black Baltic Sea." In addition to addressing the impact of global racialising tendencies in music, this entails considering the cultural dynamics at issue in relation to the dynamics of postsocialism in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and Northern European indigeneity. On the basis of such a consideration, I argue that the styles of "black music" have been appropriated and adopted throughout the BSR, albeit in clearly different national manifestations which for their part imply variegated intersections between postcolonial and postsocialist processes. These intersections become manifest in the discourses over "new Europeanness" in music and the construction of national musical traditions, particularly when juxtaposed with the prevailing Islamophobia as regards treatments of Muslim music in mainstream media. © 2019 Antti-Ville Kärjä, published by De Gruyter Open.

AB  - Food and agricultural policy research is often challenged with the issue of commercializing the application of transgenic technology in food production. There is a need for an enhanced understanding of how risk and benefit information influence the general attitudes of farmers towards genetically modified (GM) technology. This paper contributes to existing literature by studying the various adoption factors that influence Ghanaian farmers' attitudes toward GM crop technology by using risk perception as a mediating tool. An empirical choice of methodology which is structural equation analysis was incorporated in this study. We report that, after conducting a survey among 325 respondents, Ghanaian farmers' negative attitudes toward GM technology is as a result of the influence of risk perception on the attributes of the innovative technology (relative advantage, trialability, mass media, and interpersonal relations). We employ a conceptual framework that incorporates Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) and Risk analysis to assess the relationships between the attributes and attitudes towards GM technology. It was revealed in the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis that, risk perception exerts a significant influence on the effects of the attributes of GM technology adoption thus reflecting a negative attitude towards the adoption of the related technology. We further discussed the implications for emphasizing the need for a positive attitude toward the acceptance and adoption of GM technology in Ghana. © 2019 the Author(s).

AB  - Online users are more willing to express their opinions and emotions on social platforms in online public opinion events, through combing texts and images rather than texts alone. Facing the change of emotional expressions, it is extremely vital to recognize the sentiments of online users in online public opinion events in an appropriate way. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) model to recognize online users' sentiments in online public opinion events by analyzing the sentiments of texts and attached images together. Also, we compare two fusion strategies, feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion, to combine the affective information from texts and images. In feature-level fusion, fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTMs) are employed to extract visual and textual features respectively. Then the features are concatenated and fed to a DNNs system to complete classification. In decision-level fusion, a rule is employed to fuse the output from unimodality, generating final predicted labels. Experimental results showed that the proposed DNNs multimodal model achieved better performance than unimodal sentiment recognition model. In fusion strategy, the feature-level fusion performed better in our experiments. Author(s) retain copyright, but ASIS&T receives an exclusive publication license

AB  - The drift of opinion evaluation object can reflect the evolution of online public opinion from a fine-grained level. By representing and calculating the distribution of opinion evaluation objects, we propose a method to detect its drift. A dataset of posts published by opinion leaders in social-events discussion is collected from a microblog application in China. The preliminary result on the dataset shows that when subject discussion changes, opinion leaders will focus on the identity characteristic of one person in most cases. By using our proposed method, the drift of opinion evaluation object can be clearly uncovered. Furthermore, by combining with opinion sentiment tendency drift, our research can enrich the perspective of public opinion evolution analysis and better the monitoring of public opinion crisis.

AB  - This qualitative case study utilized critical media literacy to guide the analysis of the depiction of racially and ethnically diverse college students in contemporary popular films. Participants in this study were racially and ethnically diverse undergraduate students enrolled at a private, predominantly White institution in the United States. Three primary themes emerged from this study. First, students of color were more apt to recognize stereotypical portrayals of people of color in the films, whereas White students' responses were more attuned with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI). Second, media-centered discussions provided an outlet for students of color to share their personal experiences with racism, stereotyping, and prejudice. In doing so, students of color seek to build the cultural competence of peers who may hold CBRI beliefs. Finally, this study presents a need for critical media literacy. Regardless of race and/or ethnicity, the undergraduates who participated in our study communicated an importance of examining media messages, such as stereotypes of people of color, from a critical perspective. For college and university administrators, such as chief diversity officers, this study is significant in presenting a means for engaging students, faculty, and other stakeholders in dialogue about racial issues in the hopes of fostering a more welcoming campus racial climate for students of color. © 2019 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.

AB  - This study investigates the cross-media repertoires of news consumption of young adults in today's fragmented multi-media environment, and examines the interactions between those repertoires and the consumers' civic engagement and political participation. By using a Q-sort method, the respondents were asked to sort a number of elicitation cards on a relational scalar grid, which allowed for subsequent statistical factor analysis of these qualitative data and the generation of a sub-typology of media consumption repertoires as well as the discursive practices of the respondents. We also used a questionnaire which included questions about news consumption, political participation, and civic engagement. The findings revealed that most young adults used repertoires of digital and new media news consumption. The interviewees were highly conscious of their choices of news sources, and some young adults explicitly stated that they preferred to consume news from sources which reflected their own political views. In this study we were able to map news media repertoires of young adults in Israel and found that young adults do participate, and are largely involved, in activism and protests. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - With the rapid development of social network, public opinion monitoring based on social networks is becoming more and more important. Many platforms have achieved some success in public opinion monitoring. However, these platforms cannot perform well in scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel social-network-oriented public opinion monitoring platform based on ElasticSearch (SNES). Firstly, SNES integrates the module of distributed crawler cluster, which provides real-time social media data access. Secondly, SNES integrates ElasticSearch which can store and retrieve massive unstructured data in near real time. Finally, we design subscription module based on Apache Kafka to connect the modules of the platform together in the form of message push and consumption, improving message throughput and the ability of dynamic horizontal scaling. A great number of empirical experiments prove that the platform can adapt well to the social network with highly real-time data and has good performance in public opinion monitoring. © 2019 Tech Science Press.

AB  - Background and Objective. Breast cancer is a major cause of mortality among women if not treated in early stages. Recognizing molecular markers from DCE-MRI directly to distinguish the four molecular subtypes without invasive biopsy is helpful for guiding treatment plans for breast cancer, which provides a fast way to consequential treatment plan decision in early time and best opportunity for patients. Methods. This study presents an approach of molecular subtypes recognition from breast cancer image phenotypes by radiomics. An improved region growth algorithm with dynamic threshold without user interaction is proposed for cancer lesion segmentation, which gives the precise border of lesion other than area with background. The lesions are extracted automatically based on radiologists' annotation which guarantees the lesion is segmented correctly. Various features are extracted on lesions data including texture, morphology, dynamic kinetics, and statistics features carried out on a large patient cohort, which are used to validate the relationship between image phenotypes and the molecular subtypes. A new algorithm of multimodel-based recursive feature elimination is applied on the radiomics data generated by the feature extraction process. This method obtains the feature subset with stable performance for different classification models, and the gradient boosting decision tree model gets the best results of both classification performance and imbalance performance on molecular subtypes. Result. From the experimental results, 69 optimal features from 143 original features are found by the multimodel-based recursive feature elimination algorithms and the gradient boosting decision tree classifier obtains a good performance with accuracy 0.87, precise 0.88, recall 0.87, and F1-score 0.87. The dataset with 637 patients in this paper has serious imbalance problem on different molecular subtypes, and the the robust features that are generated by multimodel-based recursive feature eliminiation algorithm make the gradient boosting decision tree classifier have good behaviors. The recognition precision for the four molecular subtypes of luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and basal-like are 0.91, 0.89, 0.83, and 0.87, respectively. Conclusions. The improved lesion segmentation method gives more precise lesion edge, which not only saves the time of automatic extraction of lesion region of interest without threshold setting for each case, but also prevents the segmentation error by manual and prejudice from different radiologists. The feature selection algorithm of multimodel-based recursive feature elimination has the ability to find robust and optimal features that distinguish the four molecular subtypes from image phenotypes. The gradient boosting decision tree classifier rather plays a main role in recognition than other models used in this paper. © 2019 Wei Li et al.

AB  - Benjamin Percy's novel Red Moon (2013) navigates the problem of the 'monster' in the context of post-9/11 representations of Islamist terrorism. Structured around a series of terrorist atrocities carried out by lycan extremists, Percy's novel employs the werewolf as a figure of monstrous otherness in order to deconstruct the very processes of othering by which the monster is produced culturally and politically. Focusing on the distorted ethical justifications of the terrorists and on the roles of political opportunism and media manipulation in shaping US responses, the narrative allows both lycan terrorists and their political antagonists to emerge as more clown than monster. This article draws upon Hannah Arendt's account of the banality of evil, and its development by more recent privation theorists, to situate Red Moon within contemporary popular and theoretical discourses of evil and to read the novel as an interrogation of the processes by which our modern political 'monsters' are created. © 2019 Simon Marsden.

AB  - Since the argumentative turn in EU studies, research has shown that civil society activists can challenge frames promoted by EU institutions and incumbent groups, and influence public opinion in the EU. However, most studies of civil society mobilisation on EU issues have focused on the vertical framing of issues from Brussels to national capitals, rarely analysing mobilisation beyond Brussels. This article builds upon ongoing research on Spanish civil society activism on the TTIP (Bouza & Oleart, 2018) and framing EU issues on Twitter (Bouza & Tuñón, 2018), contributing to the study of the role of national activists in the horizontal translation of EU-wide mobilisation to national publics. We argue that national actors play an influential role in the discursive struggle to define ‘Europe’ and the EU in the (national) public spheres (Díez Medrano, 2003). Building on our previous analysis of national activism on TTIP in Spain, we analyse whether activists have engaged in a process of frame bridging (Snow et al., 1986), in order to expand the mobilisation against TTIP towards new issues and constituencies relating to the broader trade strategy of the EU. The present research addresses the role of the Spanish anti-TTIP social movement in the emergence, circulation and bridging of critical frames on the TTIP negotiations in the Spanish Twitter sphere. The article combines quantitative and qualitative methods –network analysis and framing analysis– in order to analyse the role of the @NoAlTTIP network in the building and diffusion of frames challenging the EU institutions discourse on trade in the Spanish context. © 2019 Communication & Society.

AB  - The US reality television show The Bachelorette is one of the most successful productions in its genre. It only recently featured its first African American lead, a long-expected departure from the show’s dominantly white cast. By analysing how the show discusses race, this article sheds light on how reality television sensationalizes racism. Racism in reality television is not, as the production wants to make viewers believe, the result of individual cases of prejudice, but a problem of those responsible in the control room and, arguably, of those tuning in. © Canadian Review of American Studies

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the information management using intelligence media management (IMM) digital media analysts in managing the reputation of the Indonesian National Police. The research method used in this research is a case study method. The case study method can be used to comprehensively explain an organization, and the program developed by the Indonesian National Police Institution. Data collection was obtained through in-depth interviews with informants who met the research criteria and participatory observation. Research supports data obtained through the study of literature from previous studies, documents, and relevant books. The results revealed that Media management is needed by the Indonesian National Police as a fact-finding function to obtain a picture of public opinion towards the Indonesian National Police institution. The data is processed and analyzed and then compiled into the Indonesian National Police strategic plan. The form of media management integration in the public relations strategy is manifested in collaboration with mainstream media, social media optimization, suppressing negative news, the use of the IMM application, Police Success Dissemination, rapid response to negative sentiments and managing trending topics. The strategy is able to reverse the public perception of the performance of the Indonesian National Police, where the Indonesian National Police Institution is on a positive trend, the image of the Indonesian National Police continues to increase every year. © 2019 Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - This paper describes a research-based art project that seeks to identify several strategies used to delay industry regulation and manipulate public opinion during the 1980s and compare them to the strategies used by online advertising platforms such as Google and Facebook which are facing regulation today. This paper will show how these strategies have been woven into the story of a game called What remains, a darkly humorous, authentic Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game aiming to create an experience of fighting misinformation, showing the player ways to push back and regain agency by joining forces with others and actively questioning the nature of different news media. Throughout the nineteen eighties, several strategies were tried and tested to manipulate public opinion in order to avoid regulation that was threatening industries such as oil and tobacco. Three strategies will be discussed with examples from the 1980s as well as from today’s Tech Industry, which is facing potential regulation after the 2016 US elections and the Brexit referendum made it clear that there was a massive lack of accountability on the part of online advertising platforms. The November 2017 congressional hearings of Facebook, Twitter and Google, as well as the hearings of Marc Zuckerberg in the US and the EU in early 2018 are the main sources of information analyzed. This paper describes an art project that shows some of the most successful pre-internet disinformation campaigns and highlights how the online advertisement industry is utilizing them to stave off regulations threatening their business model, even if their business model is threatening democracy. © FUOC, 2019.

AB  - The last two decades have seen the development of a body of literature in evolutionary psychology that seeks to attribute negative attitudes to ethnic and racial minorities and other outgroups to an evolved behavioral immune system (BIS). It hypothesizes that disgust sensitivity, which evolved as protection against pathogen threats, also triggers reactions to cues that are not viscerally disgusting, such as people with unfamiliar features, and thus can explain prejudice toward members of these groups. Such an explanation seems to limit the influence of education, public policy, and rhetoric on those attitudes. Our conceptual analysis shows that this is not the case. Existing hypotheses about why the BIS would be triggered even in the absence of visceral disgust elicitors suggest that general unfamiliarity or atypicality act as cues for this hypersensitive threat detection system. This implies that the impact of the BIS must depend on the cultural and societal context in which people learn not only what is disgusting but also what is typical. The social context of personal interaction with mass media representation of and political debate about immigrants consequently needs to be considered as a decisive factor for any effect of the BIS on attitudes and behavior toward ethnic and racial outgroups. The BIS is therefore not a separate or even superordinate explanation of prejudice, compared to those coming from the social sciences. We conclude that it can offer valuable insights into processes of stigmatization and prejudice, once the role of social learning in the developmental unfolding and activation of psychological mechanisms is taken seriously. © 2019 Kusche and Barker.

AB  - Growing nectar- and pollen-rich flowering plant varieties in domestic gardens and other greenspace is an important pro-environmental behaviour that supports pollinating insects. Wildlife gardening is popular in the UK; however, public attitudes and behaviour relating to planting for pollinators are currently not well understood. We investigated these through questionnaires and interviews with customers in five garden centres in Sussex, southeast England, a relevant and useful consumer group representing horticulturally-engaged members of the public. Garden centre customers had strongly positive attitudes and were motivated to plant for bees and other pollinators: most (77%) grew pollinator-friendly varieties, while 64% would be more likely to buy a plant with a pollinator-friendly logo. Personal motivation to support pollinators was linked to a recent increase in personal and public awareness of their declines through (often negativistic) information from mass media sources. Practical implications of these findings in relation to the horticultural retail industry are discussed. Copyright 2019 Wignall et al.

AB  - This study examines how employees’ messages about a corporate crisis affect external publics’ attitudes and behaviors toward an organization. Specifically, the study investigates whether the valence (positive vs. negative) and communication channels (face-to-face vs. social media) of employees’ messages interact with each other. The results of an online experiment indicate that negative messages concerning an organizational crisis significantly affect publics’ perception of message credibility, behavioral forgiveness, and message retransmission intentions when the messages were delivered during face-to-face communication, while negative messages on social media do not significantly affect publics’ attitudes and behaviors. Positive messages had almost equal impacts on the outcomes, regardless of the communication channels through which the message was shared. Theoretical and practical implications for corporate and business communication are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

This paper analysis the frame of Chinese and Japanese reports about NIMBY. Results shows that the media frame are influenced by the concept of public: the two countries’ reports about NIMBY have their own characteristics, the number and form of public and private frames are different. In the end, from the theory of public, the difference of the two country had been explained, and the importance for how media should report environmental risk affairs had been discussed. That is the media should hold the idea of new public when doing the NIMBY or relevant environmental risk news report, which should balance the relationship between government, people and the public. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.

AB  - Violating one of the criteria of a good argumentative discourse leads to fallacious conclusions that consequently violate the truth of any proposition. The current study aims at proving the fallacies of Islamophobia that are known as the fear and hatred of Islam and Muslims and reflected on a number of headlines in UK press. As long as press and media are considered the only and the most reliable source of information for people round the world, some of UK press media have a fundamental role in presenting a negative image of Islam and Muslims to the world. Language recently appears to be like weapons in the hand of journalists in order to attack Islam and Muslims starting a war of words towards them. The researchers follow Damer T.E. (2009) as their model to analyze the data by diagnosing the lexical signals that prove fallacy in these headlines. It is found that journalist have no good premises to convince people and prove their linguistic war to Islam and Muslims as being a source of danger and terrorism. They violate the criteria of their argumentative discourse by using false evidence which leads to false conclusion. Finally, it is recommended that the religion of Islam holds a message of love and peace that what is linguistically proved throughout the present study. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - In this paper, we examine healthcare organizations’ responses to high profile cases of doctor–parent disagreement. We argue that, once a conflict crosses a certain threshold of public interest, the stakes of the disagreement change in important ways. They are no longer only the stakes of the child’s interests or who has decision-making authority, but also the stakes of public trust in healthcare practitioners and organizations and the wide scale spread of medical misinformation. These higher stakes call for robust organization-level responses. There are responsible and thoughtful ways for healthcare organizations to directly engage with these cases. Hospitals should seek an alliance with the parents around the goal of public discussion and utilize web-based platforms to provide the public with information about medical conditions, experimental treatments, and how clinical ethics deliberation in hospitals works. We outline five important lessons for healthcare organizations to keep in mind when responding to such cases. Approached with care, these cases could become “teachable moments” for both healthcare organizations and society. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - TransJakarta is one of the methods to reduce congestion in Jakarta. However, the number of TransJakarta users compared to number of private vehicle users is very small, only 24% of the total population in Jakarta. The purpose of this research is to know public opinions about TransJakarta whether positive or negative by doing sentiment analysis about TransJakarta based on the opinion of Twitter, as Twitter is one of media to express its many users to express their opinions about an individual or an instance. Data is retrieved from Twitter using the R-Studio application by utilizing the "TwitteR" library, then pre-processing and stored in a database. Next step is labelling the data using Sengon Lexicon and will be trained and tested using the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. There are three CNN architectural models to be tested, namely VGG, ResNet, and GoogleNet. The designed VGG consists of 16 layers, ResNet 34 layers, and GoogleNet 22 layers. After the data are trained and tested, the results will be evaluated using Confusion Matrix to get the best F-Score. The results showed that among the three architectural models that were tested, the Resnet 34 layers architecture model gave the best F-Score of 98.11%, better compared to VGG which had the highest F-Score value of 96.74% and GoogleNet of 96.80%. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

AB  - The Aam Admi Party (AAP; Party of the Common Man) was founded as the political outcome of an anti-corruption movement in India that lasted for 18 months between 2010-2012. The anti-corruption movement, better known as the India Against Corruption Movement (IAC), demanded the passage of the Janlokpal Act, an Ombudsman body. The movement mobilized public opinion against corruption and the need for the passage of a law to address its rising incidence. The claim to eradicate corruption captured the imagination of the middle class, and threw up several questions of representation. The movement prompted public and media debates over who represented civil society, who could claim to represent the ‘people’, and asked whether parliamentary democracy was a more authentic representative of the people’s wishes vis-à-vis a people’s democracy where people expressed their opinion through direct action. This article traces various ideas of political representation within the IAC that preceded the formation of the AAP to reveal the emergence of populist representative democracy in India. It reveals the dynamic relationship forged by the movement with the media, which created a political field that challenged liberal democratic principles and legitimized popular public perception and opinion over laws and institutions. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - Objectives: To examine public’s knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward bipolar disorder (BP) in Saudi Arabia (SA). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 2016 in Riyadh, SA. The survey included sociodemographic characteristics and BP awareness scale. Results: Of 416 participants, 49.5%had prior knowledge of BP, mainly from internet and social media, and 57% considered it to be common in SA. About half believed BP is caused by a neurophysiological or neurochemical imbalance and that it can be treated with psychiatric medications. Supernatural causes, weak faith, and weakness of character were considered causes of BP by 55%, 48%, and 40% of participants, respectively. Recreational activities and head bandaging by traditional therapists were considered viable treatment options by 55%and 41%of participants, respectively. Students and healthcare professionals scored significantly higher on awareness scale. Regarding attitude, a majority believed that persons with BP can work effectively (86%), have to pull themselves together to get over it (47%), and consider it a shame to mention that someone in a family is affected by BP (32%). Regarding relationships, 22%were not willing to maintain a friendship and 39.3% were not willing to marry someone with BP. Conclusions: This study revealed suboptimal public awareness towards BP in SA. It identified several misconceptions and negative attitudes toward patients with BP. Further studies are needed to investigate potential public interventions to improve literacy of BP. © 2019 Alosaimi et al.

AB  - Since prehistoric times, cetaceans have been important food sources, but they also have been seen as monsters of the sea, a perception that did not change much during the past centuries. Due to a better understanding of their biology in recent years, the public perception towards cetaceans has been evolving. Various studies have been developed aiming to evaluate the attitude and perception of humans towards cetaceans, but these have been local and focused on specific target groups. Our study aimed to evaluate the attitude of the public towards cetaceans on a wide scale by using an international online questionnaire distributed exclusively on social media. An attitudinal scale proposed by Kellert (1985) on a Likert scale matrix was used with nine statements referring to dolphins and nine referring to whales. Even though specific constraints occur from such types of research (e.g., mostly highly educated and young respondents from developed countries), 5,222 responses were collected from 107 countries in total. While Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were well represented, the number of answers from Africa and Asia were limited. Our results revealed a shift in the public attitude towards cetaceans, with the majority of people exhibiting a positive attitude following the global trend of a rising appreciation for wild-life. Whaling nations and ex-whaling nations that have continued that practice until recently exhibited a more negative attitude towards cetaceans, revealing the importance of culture, heritage, and memory in shaping attitudes. Finally, we discuss our findings under the light of the culture and history of different countries. © 2019 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

AB  - The massive availability of online reviews and postings in social media offers invaluable feedback for businesses to make better informed decisions in steering their marketing strategies towards users' interests and preferences. Sentiment analysis is, therefore, essential for determining the public's opinion towards a particular topic, product or service. Traditionally, sentiment analysis is performed on a single data source, for instance, online product reviews or Tweets. However, the need to develop a more precise, and more comprehensive result has steered the move towards performing sentiment analysis on multiple data sources. The use of multiple data sources for a particular domain of interest can increase the amount of datasets needed for training a sentiment classifier. Till now, the problem of insufficient datasets for training the classifier is only addressed by multi-domain sentiment analysis. Aiming to equip researchers with a thorough understanding on both multi-source and multi-domain sentiment analysis, this paper aims to identify the underlying challenges of multi-source and multi-domain sentiment analysis, and discuss the solutions applied by the researchers concerned. This paper also offers an insightful discussion of the findings derived from past studies, and based on these, propose some useful suggestions for the future direction of this research area. Findings derived from our review would be beneficial towards guiding researchers towards the future progress and advancement of multi-source and multi-domain sentiment analysis. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Climate change is widely discussed with frequent conversations and discussions on the twitter handle #climatechange. Tweets are related to awareness of climate change among general public and active engagement of public in mitigating the climate change risk. The study focused on how relevant the discussions are related to climate change and its impact and type of engagement of public on twitter. Tweets are analysed using sentiment analysis that highlighted various sentiments related to climate change, frequency analysis on key word meta data and finally topic modelling using Laten Dirichlet Allocation used to identify the abstract topics and their relation to climate change topic. The study concludes that the awareness and engagement related to climate change are relevant, but still need further active engagement and increased awareness. © 2019, World Research Association.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarettes are increasing in popularity, and they are easily accessible in a variety of locations. Despite increasing its popularity, little is known about its overall health effects. Physicians have rated the most trustful source of information about it and play also a role in disseminating information about it. Thus, this study identified the difference in knowledge and beliefs about electronic cigarettes between health care providers and the general population in Egypt. Methods: A cross-sectional study using the self-administered questionnaire in the Arabic language was conducted between December 2018 and March 2019 in the Chest Department in Ain Shams University Hospital in Egypt. Study population (n=610) was divided into health care providers (n=260) and general population (n=350). Result: A total of 593 respondents participated in this study and returned filled questionnaire with total response rate=97.2%, only 8.8% of all participates were smokers, none of the study population reported using electronic cigarettes, despite that, 79.3% of the participants have heard of electronic cigarettes, media advertisements were the main source of getting to know it and there was a statistically significant difference between both groups regarding most beliefs and attitudes toward electronic cigarettes. Conclusion: There was high awareness about electronic cigarettes in Egypt and more negative attitude about it among health care providers than the general population, but still educational programs and guidelines for health care providers are needed to raise more the awareness which will aid in counseling general population appropriately. © 2019 Dwedar et al.

AB  - Purpose of the study: This study seeks to explore the influence of culture on audiences' responses to online negative campaigns during Indonesia's 2014 and 2019 presidential elections. It shows that voter behavior is not determined entirely by media messages, as voters' decisions are strongly informed by their cultural and family backgrounds. Methodology: Negative campaign messages conveyed through online mass-media coverage were used as the main object of this study. These messages were analyzed categorically, with a focus on their themes, values, and ideologies. Data inference was made contextually, with a specific focus on cultural context. Main Findings: Mass media audiences' reception of negative campaigns is not homogenous, but influenced by political ideologies, social statuses, cultures, past experiences, and family characteristics. As such, negative campaigns do not influence the perceptions of mass media audiences, but rather reinforces audiences' existing political preferences. This is because Indonesian audiences are not individual (as common among new media audiences), but rather collective. They are divided into specific groups based on their political ideologies and the socio-cultural values that they learn from their families. Applications of this study: The findings can be applied to evaluate the media's effectiveness in constructing public knowledge and shaping public decisions. Novelty/Originality of this study: Although it has long been argued that the media can shape public opinions and decisions, this study shows that it plays a significant role in reinforcing existing political preferences. Audiences use the media to justify values that, owing to their specific family backgrounds and social environments, they have already embraced. © Shaikh et al.

AB  - Newspapers are key information sources and may influence both public opinion and policy. Previous studies have analysed the portrayal of ecosystem disservices in newspapers, but none have assessed the relative coverage between disservices and services, or how it might have changed over time. We report on the relative frequency and depiction of ecosystem services and disservices in South African, English newspapers over a 15-year period. We used a SABINET search complemented by key-informant interviews with environmental journalists. For each article we recorded if it covered ecosystem services or disservices, the type of service or disservice, and article tone and length. Overall, 2,201 articles were found, of which 25% were on services and 75% on disservices. The number of articles per year declined over the 15-year period for services, but not disservices. The most common services were energy and craft materials, food production, recreation and culture, and disservices were human health, heat waves and floods. Articles on ecosystem services were 25–40% longer than those on disservices. Article lengths on both declined over the 15 years. The greater reporting of ecosystem disservices over services is likely to influence public opinion and environmental decision-making accordingly. EDITED BY Kurt Jax. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, we investigate how Twitter allows individuals in Hungary and Poland to experience different political views. To comprehend citizens’ exposure to political information, “who’s following who?” graphs of 455,912 users in Hungary (851,557 connections) and 1,803,837 users in Poland (10,124,501 connections) are examined. Our conceptual point of departure is that Twitter follower networks tell us whether individuals prefer to be members of a group that receives one-sided political messages, or whether they tend to form politically heterogeneous clusters that cut across ideological lines. Methodologically, such connections are best studied by means of computer-aided quantitative research complemented by the sociocentric approach of network analysis. Our data date from September 2018. The findings for Poland do not support the hypothesis of clusters emerging along partisan lines. Likewise, the Hungarian case reveals sharp group divisions on Twitter, the nodes however are diverse and overlapping in terms of political leaning. The data suggest that exposure and segregation in follower networks are not necessarily based on partisanship. © 2019, SAGE Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seventy-five percent of children aged 12–23 months in Malawi have received all eight basic vaccinations—still leaving many children at risk. The Malawi Expanded Program on Immunization comprehensive Multi-Year Plan 2016–2020 reveals several challenges impeding immunization and disease surveillance efforts, such as the fact that non-governmental health organizations (NGHOs) and communities are minimally included in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of these activities. This article examines the extent to which NGHOs are promoting the use of social mobilization (SM) and community mobilizers (CMs) for sharing health information related to the eradication of polio, the importance of routine immunization, and the control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Data collection involved document analysis and interviews with 11 organizations in Malawi whose work contributes to the eradication of polio and control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data, whereas descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. Non-governmental health organizations use a variety of approaches for SM, including mass media campaigns (radio and printed booklets), local skits and dramas, and home visits. Most NGHOs use training workshops and opinion leaders to impart knowledge and skills to CMs on immunization to eradicate polio and to control measles and neonatal tetanus. Major challenges faced by the NGHOs include negative attitudes toward campaigns and demotivation of CMs due to lack of financial incentives. The article concludes with a discussion of approaches to strengthen SM and the role of CMs by NGHOs. Copyright © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene

AB  - Globally, there is a conspicuous paradigm shift in political communication as a result of the emergence of social media. In contemporary political communication, highly sophisticated soft ware and hardware are used to manipulate texts and visuals in a manner that best conveys the feelings of the users. This reality has greatly modified representational political communication which has challenged the thinking of contemporary scholars as they jostle to describe and explain such visual communication techniques. The prevalence of this scenario among Nigerian social media users is the motivation for, and the problem of this study. Consequently, this study examined the nature of political pictures and illustrations common on social media and examines the implications of such visual representations on political mobilization and participation. It is hoped that this study will significantly expand literature on social media -political communication nexus. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - With the development of information and communication technology today, it makes the community both individually and society in the realm of industry carry out communication activities using media which is often referred to as digital media. Digital media commonly used today is digital media that is generally owned by Indonesian netizens, namely social media. By only having internet access all netizens can become social media users. Using internet access is not only used by Indonesian people in person, but Indonesian people to interact in an industry / company often interact with the use of internet media, considering that the development of the Digital Industry Revolution has entered the Industrial Revolution 4.0. "Both practitioners and academics agree that the social revolution occurring through digital channels will have a profound impact on hoe people interact with each other and how companies manage their relationships in the changing communications landscape (Greenberg, 2010;Kletzmann et al.,2011;Dennis et al.,2009)" (Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, Vol. 30). The government is committed to increasing Indonesia's competitiveness position from 41st to 39th in the world from 138 countries listed in the 2016-2017 Global Competitiveness Report. To achieve this goal, one of the solutions being pushed by the Ministry of Industry is to spur domestic industries to continue to innovate in the face of the implementation of Industry 4.0. Because of that case, human interaction in the industry will not be separated from a communication process, it's just that at this time different is a tool / media in carrying out the communication process, which originally used conventional communication media to switch to convergence (digital) communication media. Currently PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk as a subject of this research, conducts monitoring and analysis of public opinion one of them by using Social Media Monitoring. Based on the results of pre-research by interview some informants, they said that PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk conducts Social Media Monitoring with the aim to find out how much positive / negative sentiment to Telkom's Social Media brand as a whole building to Corporate Image and also for the others needed such as building Product Image and Product Marketing. PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk analyzes public opinion with the use of social media because there is an element of transfer of communication patterns from conventional media to digital media, but apart from that, PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk continues to analyze conventional public opinion, including via e-mail, the voice of the reader, also through the call center 147 service and also through the application "apps my indihome". In addition, PT Telkom Indonesia often analyzes public opinion with the support of various other events, namely the "Public Hearing" and also "Focus Group Discussion" carried out by each division of the platform holder where in this research is the Corporate Communication Division, Customer Division Care and also the Marketing Promo Division. The research method used in this study is a case study where there is a pecualiarity in this study, namely PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk is an industry that is very concerned about public opinion on its customers so that handling feedback becomes a very important and main thing by doing social media monitoring with help by the agency or carred out by related unit employees. © 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - The international political situation and the Nazi plans for Central Europe culminated in the late 1930s. The organisation of the collaboration with pro-Nazi and separatist Slovak representati ves accelerated after the "Anschluss" of Austria in March 1938. From then on, Slovak territory was only separated from Nazi Germany by the Danube River. The proximity of the two major centres - Vienna and Bratislava - enabled the Nazis to affect the political development of Slovak autonomy and influence public opinion to favour the break-up of Czechoslovakia through the use of various propaganda tools. Modern technology further shortened the distance between places that were already physically close to each other. The main aim of this paper is to focus on Slovak radio broadcasts from the Reich's Vienna radio station. It was established at the time of the Sudetenland crisis on 15th September 1938 and was organised by L'udovít Mutňanský and Rudolf Vávra, members of the Foreign Hlinka Guard (FHG). Studying the period of Slovak auto nomy is crucial for gaining an understanding of the original purpose for this broadcast - an at tempt to influence public opinion in favour of the dissolution process. Taking into consideration the radicalisation of the broadcast pertaining to the racial perception of the Jewish community, contrary to the ideology of the Hlinka's Slovak People's Party (HSL'S) at that time, special atten tion is paid to the role of anti-Semitism in the Slovak program. © 2019.

AB  - On 7 April, 2017 a terrorist attack occurred, in central Stockholm. A hijacked lorry was intentionally driven into crowds along a pedestrian street. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore how media framed this terrorist attack. The data collection approach was inductive and explorative mainly involving searching electronic media databases. The qualitative analysis of 1294 articles resulted in four overarching themes describing how the terrorist attack was framed in the media. These frames are as follows: the incident, framed as confirmed, unconfirmed and denied information; the perception of leadership and authorities as trustworthy; the site perceived as a place of sorrow; and crisis management framed as the initial and sequential framing of the professionals, the heroes and the villains. The primary conclusion is that true as well as fake news affects crisis management and public opinion, which may create challenges for the entire society within the crisis management area.

AB  - This report aims to explore the diverse cultural and societal beliefs and taboos in Saudi Arabia. It is aim to develop comprehensive and strong understanding with different cultural and religious taboos as it is vital for understanding the relationship between people, religion and language in Saudi Arabia Culture. This report indicated that Saudi Arabians consider religious and cultural backgrounds as a source of executing taboo behaviour and expressions. This research indicates that contemplation of function of linguistic taboos should be considered as of utmost importance for identifying the social implications of linguistic taboo. Through this research study, linguistic taboos, social taboos and religious taboos are identified that restrict the social progress of Saudi Arabia. To integrate Saudi Arabia with progressive globalized world, this research study suggested that it is important for explain these taboos for minimalizing prejudices. It is identified in this research that religions are one of the critical aspects in Saudi cultural and religion activities. Therefore, this research study successfully describes different taboos that stem from different cultural opinions. In addition to this, this research study also emphasizes on changing point of view of people that all restrictions are derived from religious faith and teachings. This research study advances the existing knowledge base through identifying Saudi media and Saudi government as responsible for striving and promoting cultural values and beliefs, educating people and modifying their culture beliefs. In addition, as a country, Saudi Arabia must educate people about sexually transmitted diseases and sexual problems because of this global problem rather than being censored because they do not recognize it. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - Public opinion researchers often find changing attitudes about pressing public health issues to be a difficult task and even when attitudes do change, behaviors often do not. However, salient real-world events have the ability to bring public health crises to the fore in unique ways. To assess the impact of localized public health events on individuals’ self-reported behavior, this paper examines Floridians’ intentions to take preventative measures against the Zika virus before and after the first locally transmit- ted case of Zika emerged in Florida. We find that local and national media coverage of Zika increased significantly following its first transmission in the U.S. Critically, we also find that Floridians surveyed after this increase in media coverage were more likely to pay attention to Zika-related news, and self-report intentions to take protective action against the virus. These results suggest that behavioral intentions can shift as health threats become more proximate. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The usage of social media in public relations practice has become increasingly common because the Internet offers public relations practitioners unrivalled opportunities to gather information, solve many problems quickly and efficiently, monitor public opinions, and engage in direct dialogue with key publics regarding numerous issues. Whether positive or negative, many factors affect public relations practitioners depending on the political, social, economic ecosystems. This paper intends to show the antecedent factors that influence on the practice of the online PR concept among PR practitioners. A review of the literature suggests that scant research has studied the challenges and factors that PR practitioners face in using social media concerning the sources of rules and regulations like academic, cultural, financial, and legal sources. © 2019 Jour of Adv Research in Dynamical and Control Systems.

AB  - This paper investigates Egyptian digital forms of satirical graphics mostly published on Social Media by cartoonists and amateurs after the Arab Spring. These include webcomics memes, and Graphic Interchange Format (GIF). The paper will focus on two Facebook pages as a case study: Asa7be Sarcasm Society and Islam Gawish's Elwarka/The Paper. With this aim in mind, I will show how these forms of political satire incorporate, cinema, theatre, religion, western elements and pan-Arabism to express a political view in a creative manner to appeal to a more diverse and broad audience. The first part of the paper provides a brief discussion of Arabic/Egyptian satire with specific reference to political cartoons and Egyptian youth activism on social media (specifically Facebook). It will also introduce the concept of satirical graphics and some of its concrete applications. The second part describes the methodology and provides an analysis of the case study. © 2019, © 2019 Australian and New Zealand Communication Association.

AB  - The Gazette van Detroit was one of many immigrant newspapers started up in the United States shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, it kept the Belgian community of Detroit, wider Michigan and Southwestern Ontario (Canada) abreast of the developments in their former homeland, while also reporting on the hostilities elsewhere in Europe from a typically Belgian, and particularly Flemish perspective. It published to that end a variety of pieces under the scrutiny of the Belgian and later also the American government: (1) pieces submitted byregular contributors; (2) letters of Belgian soldiers; (3) articles gleaned from other news sources; and (4) pieces reproducing official information provided by the exiled Belgian government in Le Havre (France). Caught like most other media outlets in a powerful tide of national solidarity, much of this wartime reporting can be considered as propaganda, since it aimed to standardize public opinion by mobilizing the animosity of an entire community against a thoroughly evil enemy engaged in the victimization of an intrinsically good, heroic and unflinching opponent: the Belgian civilian population and army. To achieve this effect, the Gazette employed rhetorical strategies, such as over-lexicalisation, stereotyping and the kinship metaphor. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Nineteen of Disney's animated feature films were randomly selected to be viewed and coded using the Moral Media Messages (MMM) scale. The scale includes ten moral messages: six positive messages and four negative messages. Paired observers were used for coding and reliability was confirmed. Based on previous research regarding prosocial and negative behaviors, it was hypothesized that Disney characters before 1990 would have a higher negative moral count than characters in after 1990 Disney films. Furthermore, the researchers proposed other hypotheses including differences among more negative and positive morals according to gender and SES. An additional hypothesis included that characters who are considered the protagonist would show more positive morals, whereas the antagonist would show more negative morals. The following results were obtained in the study: negative messages deception/ego and dissing/prejudice scores were significantly higher in films after 1990 than before. Upon examining genders, males were significantly higher in "threatening" messages than females. However, females were found to be significantly higher in "forgiving" messages than males. The following messages were found significant when looking at the character's SES: perspective taking, nurture/affection, "kindness," deception/ego, and dissing/prejudice. When examining the roles as a function of the ten messages, the following were found significant: perspective taking, "apology," "forgiveness," nurture/affection, "kindness," "anger," deception/ego, dissing/prejudice, and "threats." Future research will address some of the limitations mentioned in the discussion. © 2019 Common Ground, Kaitlyn Iseminger, Björn Bergström, Robert Benefield, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Recently, increased media attention has been given to tensions between law enforcement officers and the communities they police. An individuals’ opinions of law enforcement agencies may be formed from various areas, including their exposure to various forms of media. Here, we are interested in the types of media students are exposed to (particularly social media, television news, crime-related television shows). Through interviews with undergraduate students, we seek to understand how both an individual’s demographic characteristics and their media consumption contribute to how perceptions are formed on issues related to violence perpetrated by law enforcement, as well as against law enforcement. Future studies can build on the initial findings and be conducted on a broader range of community members. © The Author(s) 2019

AB  - As the largest social media in China, the Sina-Microblog plays an important role in public opinion dissemination. Despite intensive efforts in understanding the information propagation dynamics, the use of a simple outbreak model to generate summative indices that can be used to characterize the time series of a single Weibo event has not been attempted. This work fills this gap, and illustrates the potential of using a simple outbreak model in conjunction with the historical data about the cumulative forwarding users for nearcasting the propagation trend. © 2019 the Author(s).

AB  - This article surveys the critical history of scholarship on Philippa Chaucer, the wife of the famous English poet. Beginning with the late Victorian work of Frederick Furnivall and ending with contemporary biographies of Geoffrey Chaucer, this article argues that male critics have constructed their depictions of Philippa Chaucer with little reference to historical fact. Instead, male critics have formed an intellectual community with one another (and with the medieval poet) by the act of denigrating Philippa, with an appeal to a supposedly universal knowledge about disagreeable women and their effect on men of genius. From harpy to harlot to cold careerist, Philippa Chaucer's life and relationship with her husband have proved flexible media for male critics to manipulate. The biographical evaluations published over the last century therefore have much to reveal about the intellectual priorities and gender prejudices of her husband's critics. © 2019 Penn State University Press.

AB  - Newspaper editorials are acknowledged as having a significant role to play in shaping public opinion on social and political issues. In studies of their persuasive power, the language of these texts is always the focus to some extent. Across a spectrum of methodological approaches, relatively few studies take a dynamic perspective to consider the interaction of linguistic choices in the construction of rhetorical strategies in the flow of meaning in texts. This study draws on Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) theory in its analysis and interpretation of the dynamic construction of recurring rhetorical strategies in a set of 11 editorials culled from The Australian, a politically conservative broadsheet newspaper in Australia. We explore how choices in interpersonal and ideational meaning collaborate and interact dynamically in these data to consistently disaffiliate a putative readership with one of the two major political parties. We identify in particular the critical interaction of realis and irrealis meanings in the configuration of this strategy. The analyses provide a complementary means to explore the discourse of persuasion within the field of news media. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.

This research analyzes the best results of three generic searches on homeopathy, collected in four waves in five countries: Spain, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Specifically, the fluctuation of the corpus ranking is studied, and a sample of the ten best-positioned pages in each country is taken to analyze their content (the authorship of the website, the stance of the effectiveness of homeopathy, the presence of controversy and the type of content). The results show that the ranking is stable; that the stance of homeopathy is linked to the state of public opinion in the country; and that the majority of websites that appear better-positioned are from media. © 2019 El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - The article analyses the discursive appeal to solidarity in the mass media during the unfolding of Europe’s migration crisis. Solidarity was claimed by numerous actors in the public discourse to legitimise political decisions and mobilise public opinion. While it seems that the call for solidarity was shared by many actors, media studies show the ‘partisan journalism’ of media outlets. Thus, the political orientation of media outlets influences their coverage of public debates. Hence, to what extent do different quality newspapers cover the same solidarity claims in times of crisis? In order to answer this question, the crisis coverage of two German and two Irish newspapers with centre-left and centre-right political orientations is examined via the discourse network methodology. Germany is selected due to high political parallelism and a strong affectedness by the crisis, while Ireland is selected because of low political parallelism and a weak affectedness by the migration crisis. The findings demonstrate that partisan journalism persists during Europe’s migration crisis. Especially German party actors are present in both countries, underpinning the central position of Germany. Regarding the appeal to solidarity, political solidarity claims prevail in all four newspapers, indicating the political-institutional asymmetry in the Common European Asylum System. The study contributes to the strategic framing of concepts in public debates and demonstrates that the left-right distinction of media outlets is hardly affected by the migration crisis. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - The mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March 2014 was a test of the bilateral relations between Malaysia and China. Two thirds of passengers on the flight were Chinese citizens. Immediately after the tragedy, many in China accused Malaysia of being incompetent, dubious and even deceitful due to its authorities’ missteps and contradictory press statements. Meanwhile, some Malaysians saw China’s reactions as unfriendly and hypocritical. Through the professional selection and presentation of news items, the media communicates a host of salience cues that the public can use to organise and determine the importance of these issues, and this subsequently forms the initial stage of public opinion. In light of the events surrounding the missing flight MH370, the critical importance of studying media representations across Malaysia and China has become all the more essential to understand the role of media in bilateral relations. Based on a comparative content analysis, this paper investigated the framing of the MH370 incident as well as Malaysia–China bilateral relations by mainstream Malay-, English-and Chinese-language newspapers in Malaysia as well as by mainstream Chinese-language newspapers in China. The findings indicate that the newspapers carried an unequal weighting on the MH370 incident as well as the Malaysia-China bilateral relations. By employing different news sources, the newspapers also allowed different parties to act as opinion leaders to define or interpret the MH370 incident as well as the Malaysia-China bilateral relations. The two salient frames found in this study were “search and rescue operation” as well as “friendship, ties and understanding”. The coverage of the newspapers was also dominated by positive valence towards the Malaysia-China bilateral relations. Implications of the findings to the understanding of the framing and bilateral relations were also discussed. © SEARCH Journal 2019.

AB  - The article reveals some of the problems that arose between military censors and the media during the First World War. The article is written on the basis of the military censorship materials of the Supreme Commander headquarters of the Russian army, the censorship department of the Minsk military district and the materials of the periodical press. The authors conclude that the conflict was predetermined both by the imperfection of the censorship legislation, which provided an opportunity for the censors to evaluate the publications of newspapers and magazines at their own discretion, and by the censorship omissions of the media, which printed inaccurate news and placed information that the enemy could use. The result was ineffective military censorship and the failure of the press to fulfill its important mission: to contribute to the formation of public opinion in the rear in the interests of the state. © 2019 Transilvanian Association for the Literarure and Culture of Romanian People (ASTRA).

AB  - The main goal of this study is to identify housewives' attitudes towards locally-made products in comparison with imported produce. Furthermore, it aims to detect the degree of their satisfaction with each product regarding its quality, advertising tools (the media) and targeted groups (Jordanian housewives) with a more focus on their attitudes towards home-made products, namely baby's diapers. This study focused on collecting primary and secondary data through a structured questionnaire which was handed out to a sample consisting of 519 respondents and distributed all throughout Amman. The questionnaire included (4) items: the first item tackled the demographic factors of the Jordanian housewives, the second and the third items included different types of questions to explore housewives' attitudes towards home-made baby's diapers. The fourth item included specific statistical techniques that were used to achieve the research objectives and to examine related hypothesis such as the descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation frequencies and percentages), multiple regression, t-test for Paired Samples, and Two-Way ANOVA) test. The following results were concluded: 1) The attitudes of the Jordanian housewives showed negative attitudes towards home-made baby's diapers in comparison with the imported produce. 2) Every independent variable regarding the quality, advertising tools, (the media), and the targeted groups affected the three components of the attitudes including the cognitive, effective, and perceptive components. 3) The correlation between the quality, the advertising tools, the targeted groups and the Jordanian housewives' attitudes towards locally-made baby's diapers do differ according to the difference in demographic variables. 4) The relationship between all independent variables (quality, the advertising tools, and the targeted groups) and Jordanian housewives' attitudes towards locallymade baby's diapers do differ with the difference of the demographic variables. The study focused on four main parts including: the theoretical framework of the study, consumers' attitudes, and data analysis and finally the results and recommendations. © 2019 Allied Academies.

Proposing that digital citizenship is not another dimension or axis of citizenship, but a practice through which civic activities in the various dimensions of citizenship are conducted, this article critically considers how the concept of digital citizenship can furnish further insight into the quality of online civic participation that results in claims to and acts of citizenship. Through interdisciplinary scholarship, drawing from critical media and cultural theory, and media psychology, and deriving new empirical data from qualitative digital ethnography and quantitative focus group and survey studies, it presents original case studies with young people in Southeast Asia, including young Muslim women’s groups in Indonesia and youth public opinion on LGBTs in Singapore. It argues that Southeast Asian youth digital citizenship foregrounds civic participation as emergent acts that not only serve to make society a better place, but also enacts alternative publics that characterise new modes of civic-making in more conservative, collectivistic Southeast Asian societies. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - Several prominent theories predict that argument strength plays an important role in message processing and effects. Traditional strategies to measure perceived argument strength have limitations in responsivity to emerging arguments in public discourse. This article examines the utility of a survey-embedded wiki platform (wiki survey) to identify strong and weak arguments in dynamic information environments. Participants completed two wiki surveys, embedded within a larger survey of U.S. adults (N = 1,506), asking them to choose between randomly selected pairs of arguments related to marijuana legalization or to add new arguments to the item pools. The method identified 32 novel, user-generated arguments, over and above an original set of 26 arguments identified by study authors through a review of the literature and a content analysis of news media coverage on the topic. The wiki survey also produced variation in perceived strength of arguments among relevant demographic and social groups. © 2019 (JeffNiederdeppe, Daniel A. Gundersen, Andy S. L. Tan, Emma E.

AB  - This study examines how news coverage of terrorist threats affects emotions that then shape support for antiterrorism policies, presidential approval, and attitudes toward Muslims. Using a national sample, news stories were experimentally manipulated to emphasize terrorist threats (high/low) and depictions of U.S. military strength (high/low). Results show that group-based anger-when people thought about themselves as Americans-mediated the relationships between threat coverage and antiterrorism policies, whereas group-based fear did not. On the other hand, group-based fear mediated the relationship between threat coverage and negative attitudes toward Muslims, whereas group-based anger did not. When people thought about themselves as individuals, neither anger nor fear mediated these relationships. © 2019 (Seth Bradshaw and Kate Kenski).

AB  - Using a data set of 2,968 articles collected from 22 different newspapers in Turkey, this article maps media responses to the ongoing Gulf Crisis. In doing so, we deploy a pioneering methodology derived from natural language processing and correspondence analysis to test whether categorical variables such as political affiliation, ownership, and ideological outlook had any impact on how a news publication covered the Gulf Crisis. In the results and interpretation sections, we attempt to connect our findings to broader discussions on agenda setting, framing, and building consent. Based on our analysis, we propose the following conclusions: (a) Political affiliation, ownership structure, and the ideological outlook all had unique effects on how a publication covered the Gulf Crisis, (b) the progovernment press embarked on a campaign to sway public opinion about the government's decision to side with Qatar. The dimensions of this campaign strongly resembled an executive act of consent manufacturing, and (c) corporate-owned news organizations were the driving force shaping both the public agenda and the dominant framing of the Gulf Crisis in the Turkish mediascape. © 2019 Ivo Ozan Furman, Erkan Saka, Savaş Yildirim, and Semahat Ece Elbeyi.

AB  - Content analysis identified three dominant themes used by the news media to cover epidemics: the scientific, the pandemic, and the social. This study uses a randomized experimental design to test the effects of common news coverage patterns of epidemics on perceptions of efficacy, certainty, and trust in the CDC, and subsequently on intentions to comply with and support for the CDC during public health crises. The experiment also compares the effects of real-world coverage to that of hypothetical coverage that more closely follows the CDC’s recommendations for crisis communication. The results of the experiment (n = 321) demonstrate that exposure to articles from different themes affects perceptions of certainty and self-efficacy, that in turn affect intentions to comply with the CDC. Although organizational-efficacy and trust in the CDC are both correlated with intentions to support, and trust is also correlated with intentions to comply, exposure to different conditions did not affect these perceptions and there was no indirect effect from exposure to intentions. The results reveal the potential effects of real-world coverage on perceptions and intentions, and demonstrate the advantage of the hypothetical coverage that follows the CDC’s crisis communication guidelines. Implications for public health organizations and communicators are discussed. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The personality of a political candidate, above and beyond governments and parties, is understood increasingly more as a brand image. The new political influencers are making a clean sweep of social networks and it is the media that reproduce an information model that, far from being grounded in transparency and quality, promotes a post-truth discourse, halfway between provocation and spectacle. This initial hypothesis focuses on Donald Trump’s profile, first as a presidential candidate and later on as US President. In parallel, Twitter users have swiftly succumbed to the leader’s appeal. Thus, this paper studies the impact of Trump’s tweets on the US reference press during the first 100 days of his presidency. More specifically, it analyses the correspondences between the tweets posted on his personal Twitter account (@realDonaldTrump, with more than 45 million followers) and the front page news in USA Today, The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Regarding public response, digital prosumer metrics (“likes,” retweets and comments) have been quantified in order to verify the degree of influence exerted by Trump on public opinion. The method employed here includes a quantitative and qualitative content analysis based on three categories: the politician’s tweets, front page news and online user metrics. The results confirm Trump’s empowerment on Twitter as both a main source of news and a political influencer as regards the media and the citizenry. © 2019 Communication & Society.

AB  - Communication and the media stand out among the means think tanks employ to shape public opinion, influence political cultures and spread ideologies. More specifically, both traditional and new media stand out as resources for the advocacy performed by right-leaning think tanks. While the use of traditional media has been well studied, little research has focused on think tanks’ online message content. This article focuses on the social media communication of one of the main think tanks in Spain: FAES. The YouTube videos of this research institution are content analysed in light of (1) free-market ideology and (2) the specific philosophical tenets of two American think tanks: The conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute. Results indicate that free-market ideology is communicated throughout FAES’s videos. However, neither Heritage-type conservatism nor Catotype libertarianism are conveyed. Our study shows that an economic right-wing discourse is finding a new outlet on social media, and sheds light on how FAES’s use of the web relates to the political context. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Most of us now have instant access mobile phones with integrated cameras so we are able to record an unplanned video at any time and place within a matter of seconds. Modern technology has provided us with the ability to create spontaneous videos. Spontaneous videos are a new way of portraying our society and communicating events and, by means of the internet and web 2.0 applications, they have the potential to reach every corner of the globe, form an integral part of mass media news reports, and influence public opinion. This study establishes the basis for identifying and understanding the spontaneous video, analysing its application in video activism and citizen journalism, and investigating its impact on the digital press. To this end, we have analysed spontaneous videos created and shared online by IES Lluís Vives students in Valencia on the 15th of February, 2012. Students held a protest on this date against education cuts carried out by the Valencian Community government in Spain. The resulting spontaneous videos had a great impact on the media and were reported by Spanish digital newspapers including El País, El Mundo, La Razón, ABC and Público. © 2019 Communication & Society.

AB  - This research examined how news content influences attitudes towards Syrian refugees in Turkey. The study aimed to understand if the way Syrian refugees are attributed in media - that is, media salience about Syrian refugees that comprise their image - would cause an attitude change in the public. More specifically, we intend to determine whether being exposed to positive news coverage about Syrian refugees would cause an attitude change in the public from negative to positive. For the purpose of the study, we have conducted a quasi-experimental research and used a pretest-posttest design to investigate the second-level agenda-setting effects. Two experiments (a pilot and a main experiment) were conducted during the Spring term of 2017 in Turkey. The participants were selected from a large private university in Turkey for the experiments. The t-test results suggest that positive media emphasis on the images of Syrian refugees had a positive impact on public opinion and caused an overall attitude change in the public. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

AB  - In language planning for minority languages, policy often aims to positively influence attitudes towards the language by increasing its salience in key areas of public life such as broadcasting and signage. This is true for Gaelic in Scotland, where recent national initiatives have included the establishing of a Gaelic language television channel in 2008, and the launch, in the same year, of a bilingual brand identity for ScotRail (Rèile na h-Alba), resulting in Gaelic-English signage at railway stations across Scotland. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effects of such an increase in national visibility of Gaelic on public attitudes towards the language. The present paper explores this using a national survey of public attitudes conducted in Scotland in 2012. Exposure to Gaelic broadcasting was found to be positively associated with attitudes towards the status of the Gaelic language (as a language spoken in Scotland, and as an important element of cultural heritage), and with attitudes towards the greater use of Gaelic (in public services and in the future). However, exposure to Gaelic signage was often negatively associated with such broader attitudes to the language and culture. The implications of the results for Gaelic language planning, and for future academic studies of language attitudes in Scotland, are explored. © Edinburgh University Press.

AB  - With the recent growth in social media dominance over the internet, many people have turned to these media to share their personal views, express their opinions and interact socially. This paper examines the social media content of Indian Chief Executive Officers who are the founders or co-founders of the top 25 Indian startups. The active involvement of Chief Executive Officers in social media influences the business effectiveness, performance and market legitimacy of the business. Social media has now become a crucial strategic tool from creating a buzz among businesses to engaging public in a new direction of thoughts. The paper has taken into consideration about 165,987 tweets from the top startups and their cofounders. The tools used for tweets extraction and analysis are Anaconda Navigator and TIBCO Spotfire. The tweets seem to cover various aspects of emotions ranging from business sector to personal feelings, political views and societal concerns. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Media censorship is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. We conduct a field experiment in China to measure the effects of providing citizens with access to an uncensored internet. We track subjects' media consumption, beliefs regarding the media, economic beliefs, political attitudes, and behaviors over 18 months. We find four main results: (i) free access alone does not induce subjects to acquire politically sensitive information; (ii) temporary encouragement leads to a persistent increase in acquisition, indicating that demand is not permanently low; (iii) acquisition brings broad, substantial, and persistent changes to knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and intended behaviors; and (iv) social transmission of information is statistically significant but small in magnitude. We calibrate a simple model to show that the combination of low demand for uncensored information and the moderate social transmission means China's censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens receiving access to an uncensored internet. © 2019 American Economic Association.

AB  - After the publication in 1999 of a reconstruction of the Northern Hemisphere temperature popularly known as “the hockey-stick,” climate scientists and Internet bloggers engaged in a heated and often stalemated public debate on the validity of paleoclimate reconstructions and on their implications for the wider question of anthropogenic climate change. The Internet emerged as an important medium for channeling the direct participation of the public almost at the same level as the professional climate scientist. It also allowed dissemination of largely unfiltered information. I argue that, although paleoclimate research did benefit in some technical aspects, the public debate around the hockey-stick focused on issues that were not scientifically central, like the existence of the Medieval Warm Period or the characterization of 1998 as the warmest year of the millennium. In contrast, much more relevant points, such as constraining the value of climate sensitivity using reconstructions of past climate, remained restricted within purely academic circles. The public resonance of the hockey-stick debate was also clearly framed by the politicization of climate science and the impacts of the series of IPCC reports, in particular the Third Assessment Report, published in 2001. This resonance was amplified by the expanding use of the Internet. The Internet represented a new bidirectional channel through which the public and academia could interact to achieve a transparent, democratic, and participative evaluation of science. I argue that, although we could have hoped for a positive outcome of the hockey-stick controversy, this opportunity for a new constructive public engagement in scientific debates was missed.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigated knowledge and users' preferences of contemporary marketing strategies used in academic libraries. It is a user study innovation characterized by granting users' with the information appropriate for better library usage and their feedback to analyze how what is presented to them makes an impact towards their attainment of academic goals. Methodology: This study carried out in University of Calabar Library adopted survey research design on a population of 1804 registered users. A simple random sampling technique was adopted in selecting 600 undergraduate and postgraduate registered users. Accordingly, 600 copies of questionnaire were distributed in the reader services units, which comprised Social Sciences, Medical, Africana, Humanities, Law, Reference as well as Science and Technology/Annex Divisions of the library. Questionnaire was distributed with a condition that only registered users who use the library often (at least thrice a week) were eligible to respond. Only 428 usable copies were returned and these were analyzed for the study. Findings: Study revealed users' knowledge of marketing strategies in the following sequence Digital media marketing 423(98.83%), Awareness services marketing 377(88.08%) and Conducive environment marketing 224(52.34%). The result of preferences showed Digital media marketing as most preferred with 421(98.36%), Awareness services marketing had 398 (92.99%) respondents and Conducive environment marketing 204(47.66%). On the challenges, two respondents (5 & 34) frankly indicated their lack of understanding for the term conducive environment. This has a great implication for the result altogether but other respondents revealed their challenges with regards to inappropriate time fixed for library use of e-library, epileptic power supply, low bandwidth, that causes the network to show while pages were unable to open and staff negative attitude. Suggestions were given to encourage the publications of local news and magazines, which would help to intimate users of issues relating to library use among others. Originality: This article offer valuable insight on the users' knowledge and preferences of contemporary marketing strategies in academic libraries. This indicate that, it is only when users' are given what they desire, that they could be said to be satisfied. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - This study examines how household composition and news media consumption and trust are related to attitudes towards two minority groups—immigrants and refugees—in a representative sample of the adult population (n = 6000) in Belgium, Sweden, France, and the Netherlands. We find that Swedes hold the most positive attitudes towards both groups, while the French are found to be most negative. The Belgians and Dutch hold moderate attitudes. There is also evidence that attitudes on refugees are more negative than attitudes on immigrants in Sweden and France, but not in Belgium and the Netherlands. Using structural equation modeling, we find that household composition is not directly related to attitudes, but indirect effects through socio-economic status and media consumption indicate that singles hold more negative attitudes than couples. Public television consumption, popular online news consumption, and trust in media are positively related to attitudes, whereas commercial television consumption is negatively associated with them. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The Brexit referendum to leave the EU and Trump’s success in the US general election in 2016 sparked new waves of discussion on nativism, nationalism, and the far right. Within these analyses, however, very little attention has been devoted towards exploring the transnational ideological circulation of Islamophobia and anti-establishment sentiment, especially amongst diaspora and migrant networks. This article thus explores the role of the Indian diaspora as mediators in populist radical right discourse in the West. During the Brexit referendum and Trump’s election and presidency, a number of Indian diaspora voices took to Twitter to express pro-Brexit and pro-Trump views. This article presents a year-long qualitative study of these users. It highlights how these diasporic Indians interact and engage on Twitter in order to signal belonging on multiple levels: as individuals, as an imaginary collective non-Muslim diaspora, and as members of (populist radical right) Twitter society. By analysing these users’ social media performativity, we obtain insight into how social media spaces may help construct ethnic and (trans)national identities according to boundaries of inclusion/exclusion. This article demonstrates how some Indian diaspora individuals are embedded into exclusivist national political agendas of the populist radical right in Western societies. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Along with the significant growth of social media, individuals and companies are increasingly receiving public opinions which direct their decisions. Opinion mining, which is considered as a sub-field of natural language processing, information retrieval, and text mining, is the process of understanding the users’ views from their comment, which have been represented as unstructured texts. Emergence of online social media has led to the production of a huge amount of user comments on websites, and thus, has raised opinion mining as a very useful and challenging problem. In this paper, an efficient preprocessing method for opinion mining is presented and will be used for analyzing users’ comments on Twitter social network. For this purpose, different text preprocessing techniques have been used on the dataset to achieve an acceptable standard text. Word2vec method which is a fast and accurate method have been also exploited to convert the words’ arrays to numerical vectors. Machine learning methods, with supervised learning approach, have been applied on the obtained data after this fast and accurate preprocessing phase. Python and RapidMiner have been used to implement different opinion mining methods and the results of these implementations have been compared and evaluated. The experimental results show that the combined use of the preprocessing method of this paper and support vector machine and artificial neural network have the highest accuracy compared to other methods. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The sensitizing concepts of Symbolic Interactionism are particularly useful to analyse and solve social problems. To understand the phenomenon of bullying we can consider it through the lens of concepts such as: definition of the situation, frame, moral panic, deviant career and so on. 'Bullismo' is, in Italian, a new word, but school aggressiveness is nothing new: behaviours which are now put into the frame of bullying were, in the past, tolerated or accepted; we can find testimonies of these attitudes in memories, autobiographies and novels. Mass media shows bullying as something new and terribly dangerous, driving public opinion towards a reaction of moral panic that amplifies it. To block deviant careers we must look at the phenomenon through rationality and not through exasperated emotions. We need better knowledge of the different definitions of the situation of the interacting parts, in order to neutralize the negative self-image of the offender and appeal, through both role-taking and behaving as looking-glasses, to the positive aspects of his/her self. © 2019 QuiEdit.

AB  - This study focuses on media images of islamophobia as portrayed by Cable News Network (CNN) and its implications for international relations. The study employed qualitative methodology. Data was collected using key informant interviews, while documentary search was done using CNN current affairs videos. The study findings indicated that the media has the power to influence human perceptions towards stereotyping Islam as a terrorist organisation and conflating the Islamic religion and the Muslim culture with terrorism. The study also found out that islamophobia really has a relationship with how Muslims are represented in the media. The study recommends that media houses should have media ethics, laws and policies which force journalists to be more accountable and objective when reporting issues of religion, race and culture as a way of eliminating offensive communication and religious intolerance.

AB  - To characterise public interest in gun control in the USA using internet search queries, we undertook a cross-sectional study of the relative popularity Google Trends searchers for 'Gun Control', 'Second Amendment', 'National Rifle Association' and 'Mass Shooting' from May 2015 to December 2018. 740 weeks of data were queried. Graphed data revealed nine major inflection points. Seven of the nine (78%) major inflection points were associated with mass shootings, while two of the nine (22%) were related to political events by either the president of the USA or a presidential candidate. Our exploration of Google Trends shows the frequency of national searches related to gun control peaks with mass shootings over a 1-2-week period and then stabilises to nominal relative popularity thereafter suggesting a need to engage the public on gun control during 'trough' periods in order to sustain national interest and dialogue. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - There has been widespread coverage of cosmetic procedures, particularly facial fillers, as minimally invasive options for facial rejuvenation. The authors' objective was to characterize news media's coverage of facial fillers and its role in shaping public perception of these products over the past decade. Public view plays a significant role in policymaking, assisting patient communication, and addressing preconceived notions. Google News was searched for online news coverage related to facial fillers from 2008 to 2017. News articles from various sources were reviewed and analyzed with multiple objectives including complications listed, advantages, disadvantages, physician specialties, overall theme of the articles as positive, negative, or neutral and other parametrics. A chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Of 426 articles meeting inclusion criteria, international news (20.4%), tabloids (18.8%), online health sites (18.3%), and national news (16.9%) were represented. Of articles containing adequate information, coverage was 44.7% positive, 29.9% neutral, and 26.1% negative with no significant change from 2008 to 2017. In addition, 46.0% of papers discussed complications including vascular injury and blindness associated with fillers, with significant increase by 2017 (p < 0.05). Facial fillers media coverage was overall positive, with broad coverage at both national and international levels. Complications were discussed often, and although vascular injury and vision damage are rare complications of fillers, they were frequently cited, potentially leading the public to believe they occur frequently. There were also significant concerns in the news media about greater regulation of products used as facial fillers, and practitioners administrating them. Altogether, these findings provide a comprehensive overview of patient perception and expectations of an increasingly popular and expanding cosmetic procedure. © 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This research paper is an account and analysis of English media reporting on wildlife conservation and protected areas (PAs) in Maharashtra, India, between 1994 and 2015. It is based on 269 articles that first appeared in the media and were then edited for publication in the 'Protected Area Update'. The analysis attempts to draw out significant themes that the media deems important in matters of wildlife conservation. Themes that emerge prominently are related to issues of land, displacement of people, development projects, and tourism. We also discovered that some PAs like the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve receive disproportionately large media space, while a third of the PAs were not reported on at all. This does not imply that these areas were not reported in the larger media that the newsletter draws upon, but points to the skewed coverage and (limited) importance these PAs get. We argue that media content analysis is a useful tool because the media is the first interface for the general public on issues of wildlife conservation and plays an important role in shaping public opinion. To our knowledge, this is the first such state-wide study of media reporting of wildlife conservation issues; it provides important insights into the wildlife conservation discourse in the country as well as the concerns, priorities, and challenges of the media. © Narayan & Sekhsaria 2019.

AB  - Social media offers scholars new and innovative ways of understanding public opinion, including citizens’ prospective votes in elections and referenda. We classify social media users’ preferences over the two U.S. presidential candidates in the 2016 election using Twitter data and explore the topics of conversation among proClinton and proTrump supporters. We take advantage of hashtags that signaled users’ vote preferences to train our machine learning model which employs a novel classifier—a Topic-Based Naive Bayes model—that we demonstrate improves on existing classifiers. Our findings demonstrate that we are able to classify users with a high degree of accuracy and precision. We further explore the similarities and divergences among what proClinton and proTrump users discussed on Twitter. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is a knowledge discovery technique developed from data mining; its purpose is to reveal people’s opinions on specific topics. This is an appropriate technique to apply to unstructured data sources, such as social media, that cover information on a variety of topics (such as politics and public administration). In this context, the objective of this study was to identify whether sentiment analysis can reflect public opinion and, thus, contribute to practices of social management. Therefore, the sentiment analysis technique was applied to reveal citizens’ opinions, which were expressed on Twitter and concerned some of the main social programs in force during Brazil’s Rousseff government. The study consisted of a comparison between the results of the sentiment analysis and the concepts and applications involving four strategies of social media used by governments from the point of view of social management. The results revealed that the sentiment analysis technique could contribute to social management practices in the context of the network strategy. © 2019, Fundacao Getulio Vargas.

AB  - Sentiment Analysis (SA) of social media contents has become one of the growing areas of research in data mining. SA provides the ability of text mining the public opinions of a subjective manner in real time. This paper proposes a SA model of Arabic Jordanian dialect tweets. Tweets are annotated on three different classes; positive, negative, and neutral. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) are used as supervised machine learning classification tools. Preprocessing of such tweets for SA is done via; cleaning noisy tweets, normalization, tokenization, namely, Entity Recognition, removing stop words, and stemming. The results of the experiments conducted on this model showed encouraging outcomes when Arabic light stemmer/segment is applied on Arabic Jordanian dialect tweets. Also, the results showed that SVM has better performance than NB on such tweets' classifications. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.

AB  - In today's world, social media is playing an indispensable role on the learning behavior of university students to achieve sustainable education. The impact of social media on sustainable education is becoming an essential and impelling factor. The world has become a global village and technology use has made it a smaller world through social media and how it is changing instruction. This original study is amongst the few to perform a focalized investigation on revealing the relationship between positive and negative characteristics of social media and the learning attitude of university students for sustainable education. However, this study aims to examine the constructive and adverse factors that impact on students' minds and how these helped students to share positive and negative aspects with others. It is increasingly noticeable that social networking sites and their applications present enormous benefits for as well as risks to university students and their implications on students' psychological adjustment or learning behaviors are not well understood. This study adapted the cluster sampling method, and respondents participated from five selected regions. Researchers distributed 1013 questionnaires among the targeted sample of university students with an age range of 16 to 35 years, and they collected 831 complete/valid responses. This study applied the social gratification theory to examine students' behavior practicing socialmedia usage. This study specifically identified 18 adversarial and constructive factors of social media from the previous literature. The findings revealed that the usage of social media in Pakistan has a negative influence on a student's behavior as compared to positive aspects. Results may not be generalized to the entire student community as findings are specific to the specific respondents only. This study presents a relationship between antithetical and creative characteristics of socialmedia and exhibits avenues for future studies by facilitating a better understanding of web-based social network use. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Using the Belief Action Outcome (BAO) framework as a theoretical basis, this study investigates the mechanisms that link organizational beliefs about environmental sustainability with Green information system (IS) actions that are undertaken and, hence, the organizational benefits accruing from these actions. Survey data were collected from 156 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results support the notion that Green IS endeavors lead to increased organizational benefits. External pressures from stakeholders and employees' attitudes to environmental sustainability affect the organizational attitude to Green IS. The attitude to Green IS is further translated into the organization's strategy and corresponding Green IS actions, resulting in organizational benefits. This study's main contribution lies in establishing a link between personal attitudes, institutional mechanisms, internal environmental/sustainability initiatives, and performance implications. Green IS adoption was empirically validated considering the SME context. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Social influence has a positive impact on the purchase intention for eco-friendly products along with other subjective and objective aspects related to environmental attitude, product attitude, and subjective and objective knowledge. Also, exposure to media has been proven to have a significant positive affect on environmental attitude, with effect on the purchase intention. Several recent studies have shown the importance of consumers' influence in online social networks, underlying the role played by the online environments over consumers' attitude. As a result, the current research tries to analyze the influence exerted on consumers' decision to purchase eco-friendly products by their activity in online social environments. Using a questionnaire, filled-in by 409 respondents, a series of variables have been extracted with regard to the eco-friendly products. An agent-based model has been created, fed with the values of the variables extracted from the questionnaire, and used for simulations. As a result, it has been observed that an increase in online media exposure can have a high positive impact on the eco-friendly product adoption. Depending on the type of product-soft or durable good-different times for the eco-friendly product adoption have been determined relatively to the considered variables. Last, the possible limitations of using an agent-based modeling approach are discussed, along with possible extensions and improvements. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Social media can be used to assess public opinions and emotions during different stages of a crisis. Guided by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model, this study examined a systematic sample of 2,881 tweets from a corpus of over one million tweets posted during the initial, maintenance, and resolution stages of the 2015 California measles outbreak. It found that the public showed the greatest interest (as measured by the number of tweets and retweets) in the initial stage of the crisis, but their interest drastically declined afterward. The expression of humor/sarcasm was significantly more frequent in the initial stage than in the maintenance or resolutions stage, while the expression of reassurance increased significantly from the initial, maintenance, and resolution stage. The emotion of alarm/concern was most frequently expressed during the initial stage. For message types, the public were more likely to tweet about their personal opinions and less likely to tweet about resources during the initial stage. These findings allow public health professionals to better design messages in response to the public’s concerns and emotions during public health crises. © 2019, © 2019 Central States Communication Association.

AB  - Background: It has been reported that the majority of individuals with mental illnesses (MIs) do not seek help. Few studies have focused on correlates of a positive attitude toward professional help-seeking for MI. This study aimed to determine levels of knowledge, perception, and attitudes toward MI, determine attitudes toward mental health help-seeking, and identify sociodemographic predictors of correct knowledge and favorable attitudes among the Saudi public. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 650 Saudi adults aged >18 years who attended the Saudi Jenadriyah annual cultural and heritage festival during February 2016. The previously validated Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire was used. Attitude to professional help-seeking was also assessed, using a tool retrieved from the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview part II. Multiple regression analyses were applied, and statistical significance considered at P<0.05. Results: The majority of the Saudi public reported lack of knowledge about the nature of MI (87.5%, percentage mean score [PMS] 45.02±19.98), negative perception (59%, PMS 59.76±9.16), negative attitudes to MI (66.5%, PMS 65.86±7.77), and negative attitudes to professional help-seeking (54.5%, PMS 62.45±8.54). Marital status was a predictor of knowledge (t=–3.12, P=0.002), attitudes to MI (t=2.93, P=0.003), and attitudes to help-seeking (t=2.20, P=0.03). Attitudes to help-seeking were also predicted by sex (t=–2.72, P=0.007), employment (t=3.05, P=0.002), and monthly income (t=2.79, P=0.005). Perceptions toward the mentally ill were not predicted by these socioeconomic characteristics (P>0.05). Conclusion: The Saudi public reported lack of knowledge of MI and stigmatizing attitudes toward people with MI in relation to treatment, work, marriage, and recovery and toward professional help-seeking. Sociodemographic characteristics predicted correct knowledge and favorable attitudes, while Saudi culture was the likely factor behind negative judgments about mentally ill persons. Efforts to challenge this negative publicity and stigma through antistigma campaigns and public education through schools and media are recommended. © 2019 Abolfotouh et al.

AB  - Focusing on electrical circuits as the topic for a STEM project, this research aims to develop virtual reality media for student learning. Using virtual reality media to perform STEM electrical circuit activities, data was collected and analyzed. The virtual reality media was then evaluated by five experts who used the Index of Item-Objective Congruence (IOC) to assess its effectiveness, where the IOC for each criteria was 0.8 or higher. Moreover, after evaluating it with the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI), the arithmetic mean of its effectiveness on the diffusion of innovation was 4.32, with a 0.48 standard deviation. This demonstrates that the use of virtual reality media was a beneficial innovation at a high level. Afterwards, the developed virtual reality media was evaluated by a sample of 30 subjects in the areas of VR features, usability, learning experience, and VR measurement outcomes. The findings show that its arithmetic mean was 4.67 with a 0.47 standard deviation, meaning the developed virtual reality media was an effective for electrical circuit learning at the highest level. Furthermore, after evaluating its effectiveness in the area of information technology acceptance, it was found that, for these criteria, the arithmetic mean was 4.64 with a standard deviation of 0.48. This indicates that the subjects generally accepted the use of virtual reality media for use in learning STEM activities at the highest level. It can be said that the development of the virtual reality media for learning STEM activities with a focus on electrical circuits enhances the learning process of the learners who confirmed such statements at the highest level, with an increase in subject understanding of the learning activity and self-satisfaction, while at the same time reducing the prejudice learners have towards the study of electrical circuit installation. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - Social Media has become a platform for the users to express their opinion on the new emerging trends. It has been estimated that 80% of the data in today's world is unstructured and not been organized in a per-determined order. For the user It has become very hard to group the data because of time consumption and analyzing. Users from different parts of the world share their opinions based upon the emerging trends in social media. Such data are classified and categorization into polarities like positive, negative and neutral process using sentiment analysis and processed for the data accuracy. A model can be built by locating user’s Geo location to know the connectivity and location of the users who are interested in top trending events happening in and around the world. © BEIESP.

AB  - BACKGROUND Public awareness of colorectal cancer (CRC) and uptake of CRC screening remain challenges. The viewpoints of the target population (asymptomatic individuals older than 50) regarding CRC screening information sources and the reasons for and against participation in CRC screening are not well known in the Czech Republic. This study aimed to acquire independent opinions from the target population independently on the health system. AIM To investigate the viewpoints of the target population regarding the source of information for and barriers and facilitators of CRC screening. METHODS A survey among relatives (aged 50 and older) of university students was conducted. Participants answered a questionnaire about sources of awareness regarding CRC screening, reasons for and against participation, and suggestions for improvements in CRC screening. The effect of certain variables on participation in CRC screening was analyzed. RESULTS Of 498 participants, 478 (96%) respondents had some information about CRC screening and 375 (75.3%) had participated in a CRC screening test. General practitioners (GPs) (n = 319, 64.1%) and traditional media (n = 166, 33.3%) were the most common information sources regarding CRC screening. A lack of interest or time and a fear of colonoscopy or positive results were reported as reasons for non-participation. Individuals aged > 60 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.42-3.71), P = 0.001], females (aOR = 1.95, 95%CI (1.26-3.01) P = 0.003), and relatives of CRC patients (aOR = 4.17, 95%CI (1.82-9.58) P = 0.001) were more likely to participate in screening. Information regarding screening provided by physicians - GPs: (aOR = 8.11, 95%CI (4.90-13.41), P < 0.001) and other specialists (aOR = 4.19, 95%CI (1.87-9.38), P = 0.001) increased participation in screening. Respondents suggested that providing better explanations regarding screening procedures and equipment for stool capturing could improve CRC screening uptake. CONCLUSION GPs and other specialists play crucial roles in the successful uptake of CRC screening. Reduction of the fear of colonoscopy and simple equipment for stool sampling might assist in improving the uptake of CRC screening. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - Nowadays, societies are in constant evolution, adapting to changes and constantly learning due to the progress of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Internet, considered as the “public super highway” of information through which millions of terabytes travel every day, contains information of many different sources from Facebook comments to diplomatic cables having delicate information. In the international relations and in diplomacy, the ICT have gained an important space, providing a new paradigm through the new computer tools which link the knowledge society with the diplomats work, establishing a significant space for public opinion which is very important for our communities in the present. This paper aims to analyze the digital diplomacy and the new civil society (also known as e-society) for proving the importance of ICT in the scenario of digital diplomacy. © BEIESP.

AB  - Winston Churchill once said, ‘it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war.’ However, negotiations are particularly difficult when they are enmeshed in public opinion precommitments. The sharpest crisis between China and Vietnam in the last 30 years concerned the placement of a Chinese oil rig into contested waters in 2014. This study analyses the Chinese and Vietnamese propaganda efforts surrounding the crisis as examples of the instrumental use of propaganda in managing domestic public opinion on diplomatic crises. The article argues that despite very different approaches to public diplomacy during the crisis, both states were primarily concerned with avoiding escalation and ending the confrontation. The authors show how propaganda function as a pacifying device in dealing with rising domestic nationalism when executing a moderate foreign policy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - From predicting medical conditions to administering health behavior interventions, artificial intelligence technologies are being developed to enhance patient care and outcomes. However, as Mélanie Terrasse and coauthors caution in an article in this issue of the Hastings Center Report, an overreliance on virtual technologies may depersonalize medical interactions and erode therapeutic relationships. The increasing expectation that patients will be actively engaged in their own care, regardless of the patients’ desire, technological literacy, and economic means, may also violate patients’ autonomy and exacerbate access. Moreover, since AI design is both a technical and social process, algorithms may mirror human biases, calling into question the vision of AI technologies surpassing human judgment and avoiding prejudices in decision-making. The best answer to these problems is to develop AI health technologies as part of a culture of health care quality improvement, responding to existing needs while being proactive about potential technical and ethical problems that can arise from the technologies’ design and implementation. © 2019 The Hastings Center

AB  - In today's information age, the development of hot events is timely and rapid under the influence of the powerful Internet. Online social media, such as Weibo in China, has played an important role in the process of spreading public opinions and events. Sentiment analysis of social network texts can effectively reflect the development and changes of public opinions. At the same time, prediction and judgment of public opinion development can also play a key role in assisting decision-making and effective management. Therefore, sentiment analysis for hot events in online social media texts and judgment of public opinion development have become popular topics in recent years. At present, research on textual sentiment analysis is mainly aimed at a single text, and there is little-integrated analysis of multi-user and multi-document in unit time for time series. Moreover, most of the existing methods are focused on the information mined from the text itself, while the feature of identity differences and time sequence of different users and texts on social platforms are rarely studied. Hence, this paper works on the public opinion texts about some specific events on social network platforms and combines the textual information with sentiment time series to achieve multi-document sentiment prediction. Considering the related features of different social user identities and time series, we propose and implement an effective time+user dual attention mechanism model to analyze and predict the textual information of public opinion. The effectiveness of the proposed model is then verified through experiments on real data from a popular Chinese microblog platform called Sina Weibo. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Social media is growing as a communication medium where people can express their feelings online and opinions on a variety of topics in ways they rarely do in person. Detecting sentiments in texts have gained a considerable amount of attention in the last few years. Thus, the terms sentiment analysis have taken their own path to become essential elements of computational linguistics and text analytics. These terms are designed to detect peoples’ opinions that consist of subjective expressions across a variety of products or political decisions. In recent years, in India, opinions are expressed using multi-lingual words. This has become a new challenge in the area of sentiment analysis. Machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, have proven success in this task; however, there is room to advance to higher-accuracy networks. In this paper, a novel sentiment analysis system is developed which uses Legion Kernel Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In this investigation U. S. English, Hindi dialects and datasets like twitter sentiment corpus, transliteration pairs, English word-frequency list, Hindi word-frequency list and various public opinion datasets are used. The proposed network can achieve the highest known accuracy of 92.25%. Thus the proposed network’s success can be extended to other fields also. © BEIESP.

AB  - To test a possible boundary condition for the risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model, this study experimentally manipulates risk perception related to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in a nationally representative sample. Multiple-group structural equation modeling results indicate that psychological distance was negatively related to systematic processing in the high-risk condition. In the low-risk condition, psychological distance was positively related to heuristic processing; negative attitude toward media coverage dampened people's need for information, which subsequently influenced information processing. Risk perception elicited more fear, which led to greater information insufficiency and more heuristic processing in the low-risk condition. In contrast, sadness was consistently related to information processing in both conditions. Model fit statistics also show that the RISP model provides a better fit to data when risk perception is elevated. Further, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of discrete emotions in motivating information processing. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Twitter, has fast emerged as one of the most powerful social media sites which can sway opinions. Sentiment or opinion analysis has of late emerged one of the most researched and talked about subject in Natural Language Processing (NLP), thanks mainly to sites like Twitter. In the past, sentiment analysis models using Twitter data have been built to predict sales performance, rank products and merchants, public opinion polls, predict election results, political standpoints, predict box-office revenues for movies and even predict the stock market. This study proposes a general frame in R programming language to act as a gateway for the analysis of the tweets that portray emotions in a short and concentrated format. The target tweets include brief emotion descriptions and words that are not used with a proper format or grammatical structure. Majority of the work constituted in Turkish includes the data scope and the aim of preparing a data-set. There is no concrete and usable work done on Turkish Tweet sentiment analysis as a software client/web application. This study is a starting point on building up the next steps. The aim is to compare five different common machine learning methods (support vector machines, random forests, boosting, maximum entropy, and artificial neural networks) to classify Twitters sentiments. © IAEME Publication

AB  - In order to better understand the efficacy of efforts to educate the public about the risks of hurricane storm surge, links on the local National Weather Service (NWS) website and various media outlets were used to recruit 575 Charleston-area residents to complete two anonymous internet-based surveys. Most participants knew that storm surge was the primary risk from a hurricane in low-lying areas, particularly younger, new residents with less prior experience with hurricanes. One in five participants indicated that the NWS always or usually overstates the dangers of hurricanes, although most participants actually overestimated the accuracy of NWS track forecasts. Many users of a hurricane storm-tide visualization model anticipated more storm surge than they would actually receive in various hurricane scenarios. After model usage, there was a noted increase in user understanding of the importance of landfall location on the amount of storm surge, particularly among women and older participants. Comparing surveys completed before and after model usage, there was no change in the number of users that claimed they would evacuate for a hurricane scenario that produced a small storm tide, but there was a substantial increase in the number that claimed they would evacuate for a hurricane scenario that produced a large storm tide, particularly among younger and new residents. A quarter of users stated they would have reconsidered living in their current home if they had investigated the model prior to their move. Thus, significant evidence exists to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of model in improving risk awareness among users. © 2019 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Background :Lack of social awareness is a major barrier to the development of palliative care. Mass media influences public opinion, and frequently deal with palliative care contributing to its image and public understanding. Aim: To analyse how palliative care is portrayed in Spanish newspapers, as well as the contribution made by the press to its social representation. Design: Based on criteria of scope and editorial plurality, four print newspapers were selected. Using the newspaper archive MyNews (www.mynews.es), articles published between 2009 and 2014 containing the words “palliative care” or “palliative medicine” were identified. Sociological discourse analysis was performed on the identified texts on two levels: a) contextual analysis, focusing on the message as a statement; b) interpretative analysis, considering the discourse as a social product. Results: We examined 262 articles. Politician and healthcare professionals were the main representatives transmitting messages on palliative care. The discourses identified were character-ised by: strong ideological and moral content focusing on social debate, strong ties linking palliative care and death and, to a lesser degree, as a healthcare service. The messages transmitted by representatives with direct experience in palliative care (professionals, patients and families) contributed the most to building a positive image of this healthcare practice. Overall, media reflect different interests in framing public understanding about palliative care. Conclusion :The knowledge generated about how palliative care is reflected in the printed media may help to understand better one of the main barriers to its development not only in Spain, but also in other contexts. © 2019 Carrasco et al.

AB  - Research in information processing suggests that the journalistic practice of embedding right-wing populist Twitter posts in news may stimulate political polarization. To test this notion, we conducted an online experiment (N = 379). We investigated how highlighted right-wing populist statements affected individuals from different ideological stances and whether potential effects were determined by Twitter-specific characteristics (Twitter frame, profile picture). We exposed participants to two articles, each including a statement by a politician of the Austrian Freedom Party. In the first group, the statements were not highlighted (control group). In the second and third group, the statements appeared as conventional block quotes either without (G2) or with (G3) a picture of the politician. In the fourth and fifth group, the statements were highlighted as Twitter posts, again either without (G4) or with (G5) a picture of the politician. Results revealed that all highlighting conditions increased statement recognition among left-wing individuals. However, the full Twitter post condition exerted the strongest effect. Higher recognition then decreased left-wing individuals’ anti-immigrant attitudes and sympathy toward the right-wing populist candidate. Thus, embedding right-wing populists’ Twitter posts may induce disconfirmation bias among left-wing voters and trigger a process in which they strengthen their initial attitudes. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Studies have shown that despite the freedom of content creation and democratic participation, the digital space has also provided platforms for negative discourse with far-reaching implications for national unity and democracy. However, scant scholarly attention has been given to the prevalence and nature of online negative discourse in a pluralistic and politically complex society like Nigeria. Therefore, anchored on the Social Identity Theory (SIT), this study examined forms of intergroup discrimination as a negative discourse in the user-generated content (UGC) of online platforms of select Nigerian news media. Textual analysis of the UGC shows that as users react to news stories about national issues, they also create contents that reflect group identities and intergroup prejudices characterising Nigeria as a country with fragile unity. This phenomenon is a new socio-cultural order that poses serious threats to the peaceful co-existence and future of Nigeria—a nation grappling with sundry political, ethno-religious and security challenges. © 2019, Media Watch.

AB  - The paper looks at the phenomenon of fake news in the modern media. Attempts have been made to provide the theoretical background of the phenomenon of fabricating information and clarify the signs of false messages. The empirical review deals with the trends in spreading fake news in the media landscape. We rank fake news topics by popularity; examine the issues of changing public trust in various news media as a source of information; structure the sources of misinformation and identify the major motives behind them; and discuss positive and negative outcomes of posting fake news. The study shows that propaganda is effective if society receives customized information that triggers the expected emotional response of the target audience. For these purposes, the article establishes the fundamental mechanisms for using fake news. The research presents the criteria for identifying fake news and develops its classification according to the degree of falsity. The generalization conducted makes it possible to conceptualize the phenomenon of fake news. The research results aim to resolve the problem of recognizing and controlling fake news in the mass media. © 2019, Media Watch. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article examines the socio-demographic characteristics of Russian print media readership along with a content analysis of press publications with a view of understanding the role of media in shaping public opinion from the perspective of theory and practice of strategic communication. A timely example of a resonant social process is considered in retrospect, showing the insufficient effectiveness of strategic government communications in Russia and the problems of information interaction in society. Several hypotheses were defined on the ways to improve the effectiveness of government strategic communications. Based on the research results, the authors suggest ways to optimize this practice, aimed at achieving more holistic and desired results in terms of stability and sustainability of socioeconomic processes. The study determined that the use of complex tools and oneway communication methods through print media is not enough for effective "implementation" of the state's position on the solution of the problem situation. © 2019, Media Watch.

AB  - Social media provides a useful platform for informal discussions about healthcare. Acceptability is key to the uptake of diagnostic devices and this can be difficult to gauge from questionnaires and qualitative studies. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Facebook could be used to gauge public perception towards uptake of a new diagnostic test for Barrett's esophagus called the Cytosponge. We retrospectively reviewed Facebook comments relating to a video on the Cytosponge. We categorized comments into: (1) Positive, (2) Negative, (3) Unknown and (4) Questions. Recurring themes that arose were compared to a qualitative study on the Cytosponge. The video received 22.5 million views and 2837 comments within four months. Of these, 525 comments were positive, 215 were unknown, 179 were negative, 71 were questions, and 1847 were 'Tagged' comments. Among positive comments, recurrent themes were that it was innovative, could lead to early cancer-detection, and more favorable than endoscopy. Among negative comments, a recurring theme was concern about the risk of gagging and vomiting. Among 'questions', a recurring theme was related to the risk of Cytosponge detachment. We compared our analysis to a published qualitative study and found similar themes arose across both studies. Facebook provides a rich source of qualitative data, which could be used to augment studies to gauge public perception towards a new diagnostic test. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Relationship health impacts many facets of both physical and mental well-being, including depression, heart health, and even children’s health. For a variety of reasons, distressed couples often delay entering therapy despite its value in supporting wellness and preventing distress. One early intervention program, the marriage checkup (MC), aims to keep healthy couples healthy with a brief supportive checkup. The MC is based on motivational interviewing principles, and research on MC shows the program has a positive impact on relationship satisfaction, prevents decline, and improves health on other variables such as intimacy. However, past research on MCs has only focused on heterosexual couples. As such, this study explores the research question, “What is the impact of a relationship wellness checkup on lesbian couples’ relationship satisfaction?” Using a single-subject design, specifically concurrent multiple-baseline, multiple-probe design, this study extends MC research to an underrepresented population. After conducting checkups over 10 weeks with three lesbian couples, findings show the intervention had a medium effect on satisfaction (nonoverlap of all pairs =.66). These results indicate a relationship checkup can increase satisfaction for lesbian couples. The findings also suggest checkups with lesbian couples can have a comparable impact to their use with heterosexual couples. This study concludes by advocating that the checkup may help lesbian couples stay healthy, providing support for this marginalized group of couples in a time of prejudice. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study aimed to gain insight into the interplay between citizens’ reactions on Twitter and governmental communications as well as their effects on self-reliant behaviour and trust. Two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, participants first received other citizens’ reactions followed by the government's communications about how to act. Participants received supporting, opposing, mixed, or no reactions from other citizens. In Study 2, participants first received the government's communications with either certain or uncertain crisis information, followed by the different citizens’ reactions. The results showed that citizens’ reactions via Twitter are not necessarily detrimental to the effectiveness of governmental communications regarding self-reliant behaviour. In addition, our findings suggest being careful with providing uncertain governmental communications during a crisis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Partisan media—typically characterized by incivility—has become a defining element of the American political communication environment. While scholars have explored the consequences of partisan media for political attitudes and behaviors, little work has looked at how variations in incivility moderate partisan media’s effects. Using a population-based survey experiment, we show that incivility affectively depolarizes partisans when it comes from an in-party source (e.g., MSNBC for Democrats, Fox News for Republicans). Incivility on out-party sources affectively polarizes the audience, however, and we show that the respondent’s degree of conflict aversion conditions these effects. Our results raise intriguing normative questions about the trade-offs between polarization and incivility and highlight how scholars must account for both levels of incivility and partisan slant when studying the effects of partisan media. © 2018 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - The current study employs an online survey of viewers of pornography featuring transgender performers (N = 250) to investigate the relationship between pornography consumption and attitudes toward transgender people. Results demonstrated a statistically significant but substantively weak association between greater pornography viewing and more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Additionally, results demonstrated that viewers’ experience of shame about their sexual attractions to transgender people did not moderate the relationship between porn viewing and attitudes. However, analysis revealed an unhypothesized direct influence of sexual shame on attitudes toward transgender people such that higher levels of shame were associated with greater prejudice. Results are discussed in the context of sexual scripting and the revived porn debates. Further longitudinal research focusing on how the feelings viewers have about the pornography they view impacts erotic media’s effects is encouraged. © 2018, © 2018 Eastern Communication Association.

These acts of science communication are often evaluated in terms of their ability to inform (i.e., introduce accurate and accessible information) and engage (i.e., capture interest and maintain attention). We focus on a third basis by which science communication might be judged, influence. Science communicators exert influence when they shape public opinions in ways that affect their judgments and decisions, alter social and political discourse and debate, and guide social policy. We describe how the influence of any given science communication should be evaluated independent of its ability to inform or engage. We give particular attention in our analysis to the often unintended influences that well-meaning science communicators can have. We begin by considering ways that communications from climate scientists might reduce support for climate regulation and communications from health scientists might undermine public health. We then develop two “case studies,” drawn from social psychology. These show how popular media descriptions of the science of racial bias and disadvantage might in some cases exacerbate racial discrimination and reduce concern for the disadvantaged. We close with an agenda for a more vigorous science of science communication; one that engages in two complementary pursuits. Critical studies identify the dominant and consequential effects that popular science communicators are having on public perceptions. Strategic studies advance and empirically test communication strategies that scientists can pursue to reduce—rather than exacerbate—social problems. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Background: Safe consumption sites are spaces where people can legally use pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision and are currently in operation in Canada, Australia and Western Europe. These sites are effective in reducing opioid overdose mortality and other harms associated with opioid use, such as HIV infection, and increasing drug treatment entry. Various U.S. communities are considering establishing safe consumption sites, however, only 29% of U.S. adults support their legalization. This purpose of this study is to assess what types of arguments resonate with the public in support of and opposition to legalizing safe consumption sites to combat the opioid epidemic. Methods: A public opinion survey of U.S. adults in July-August 2017 (N = 1004) used a probability-based sample of respondents from a large, nationally representative online panel. The survey examined the public's perception of the strength of common arguments offered in support of and opposition to legalizing safe consumption sites. Arguments were identified through a detailed scan of news media coverage, public reports, and advocacy materials. Results: The national sample of U.S. adults rated all arguments opposing legalization of safe consumption sites as stronger than any of the arguments supporting legalization. The most highly rated opposing arguments were that public funds were better spent on addiction treatment, and that sites were allowing illegal activity and encouraging people to use drugs. The highest rated arguments supporting legalization were that safe consumption sites were a better alternative than arresting people for using drugs, they would reduce HIV and hepatitis C by encouraging safe injection practices, and that they would lower emergency department admission and hospitalization costs. Conclusion: Legalization of this evidence-based harm reduction approach in U.S. communities will be difficult to advance without public education to confront persistent myths that safe consumption sites encourage drug use and do not facilitate treatment access. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the influence of media source, suspect's alleged criminal activity, and the rater's socio-demographic attributes on public ratings of video incidents of police use of force (PUF). Methods: A national online sample of 581 adults viewed and evaluated four different PUF videos in a 3 × 3 experimental design.Study participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions involving differences in (1) media sources and (2) suspect's alleged criminal activity.The dependent variables included ratings of the credibility of the video's media source (i.e., trust in the source and accuracy of its video account) and the officer's conduct (i.e., excessive force, justifiable force).The independent and moderating variables included the experimental conditions, personal salience of PUF incidents, the rater's use of different media sources, and other socio-demographic attributes. Results: Three major results were found in this study: (1) video accounts of PUF are rated as more trustworthy when the video is attributed to “national TV news” source than “social media” outlets, (2) ratings of excessive force are more likely in PUF incidents when they involve a more dangerous offender (i.e., an alleged murder vs. shoplifter), and (3) the impact of the individual's socio-demographic characteristics on these public perceptions are strongly moderated by the personal salience of PUF incidents to the rater and their pattern of daily usage of conventional and social media. Conclusions: The visual content in short, video clips of PUF incidents strongly influences public attitudes about the officer's conduct as excessive and unjustifiable.However, by the timely release of the video images and framing them within their wider context, police departments may better demonstrate transparency and help overcome various cognitive biases that may underlie adverse public reactions to PUF incidents. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The field of biological psychiatry is controversial, with both academics and members of the public questioning the validity and the responsible use of psychiatric technological interventions. The field of neuroethics provides insight into these controversies by examining key themes that characterize specific topics, attitudes, and reasoning tools that people use to evaluate interventions in the brain and mind. This study offers new empirical neuroethical insights into how the public responds to the use and development of psychiatric technological interventions by comparing how the public evaluates pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions, in the context of online comments on news media articles about these topics. We analyzed 1142 comments from 108 articles dealing with psychopharmacological and psychiatric neurosurgery interventions on websites of major circulation USA newspapers and magazines published between 2005 and 2015. Personal anecdote, medical professional issues, medicalization, social issues, disadvantages, scientific issues and cautionary realism were among the main themes raised by commenters. The insights derived from the comments can contribute to improving communication between professionals and the public as well as to incorporating the public's views in policy decisions about psychiatric interventions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bivalve aquaculture is an expanding industry and there is a strong need for the identification of ecologically and socially feasible levels of aquaculture production in order to promote sustainable growth. In this context, the concept of carrying capacity serves to determine acceptable limits for aquaculture expansion. This study compares three case studies from different parts of the world where bivalve aquaculture represents an important socio-economic activity. Through a media analysis, public perception of aquaculture is analyzed and critical aspects shaping the process of societal discussion in the different settings are discussed. Public perception of aquaculture-related activities was mainly positive for all three case studies, and local socio-economic characteristics were found to likely to drive the process of social carrying capacity estimation. This work aims to provide a basis for the advancement of the definition of sustainable practices required for an Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture. Understanding local socio-economic settings and public perceptions on aquaculture is assumed an important first step towards accessing the social dimension of carrying capacity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the political arena, grassroots movements often emerge that express remorse or push for a collective apology in response to ingroup wrongdoing. Often this comes independently of (or as a counterforce to) official responses by the political leadership. Research has not yet clarified the effect of such public expressions of remorse on intergroup forgiveness, nor has it explicated their role in a collective apology. We propose that grassroots gestures of remorse by collectives of the offender group may enhance intergroup forgiveness among victim group members because they exert a particularly powerful influence on perceptions of prototypical group sentiment. Four experiments (Ns = 434, 204, 600, 278) varied information about the provision of a leader apology and the grassroots public response to an intergroup transgression. Results show that grassroots responses can enhance victim group perceptions of offender group remorse, as well as subsequent feelings of forgiveness toward the offender group. In contrast, leader apologies generally failed to increase perceived remorse or promote intergroup forgiveness. Patterns were largely consistent across varying forms of grassroots responses (i.e., sorry demonstrations, letter-writing, social media buzz, public opinion polls), diverse transgression contexts (i.e., racial violence, carnage during combat, symbolic insult, ethnic conflict), and among different national groups. Results illustrate the potential power of grassroots remorse for promoting intergroup forgiveness. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto contained a pledge to ‘end the punitive sanctions regime’ in the British welfare state. Whilst the specific implications of this pledge were not elaborated, such a policy would nevertheless constitute a profound break with a welfare consensus spanning over twenty years. The depth of the suggested changes on welfare are also evident in the scale of reform proposed to disability benefits, as well as plans—confirmed in August 2018 by the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell—to pilot universal basic income. Collectively, these policies would seemingly be deeply at odds with public opinion on the benefits system, which over the course of the last two decades has significantly hardened. Yet despite the seemingly radical and controversial nature of the policy, it received very little media or public attention during the election campaign. This article explores Labour’s ‘quiet revolution’ on welfare, examining whether Labour’s new welfare approach is indeed a bold attempt to reshape public opinion on welfare or, alternatively, a mostly pragmatic reaction to changing social attitudes. The argument presented is that whilst there are persuasive explanations that Labour is responding to a change in the public mood, there is also evidence of a more ambitious goal at stake: the aim of reshaping, not simply responding to, public opinion on the welfare state. © The Author and The Political Quarterly Publishing Co.

AB  - Objectives: To scope current service provision across England for management of otitis media with effusion and hearing loss in children with Down syndrome; to explore professional decision-making about managing otitis media with effusion and hearing loss; and to explore patient and public views on the direction of future research. Design: Mixed methods including a service evaluation of NHS clinical practice through a structured telephone survey; a qualitative study of professional decision-making with in-depth interviews collected and analysed using grounded theory methods; patient/public involvement consultations. Participants: Twenty-one audiology services in England took part in the evaluation; 10 professionals participated in the qualitative study; 21 family members, 10 adults with Down syndrome and representatives from two charities contributed to the consultations. Results: There was variation across services in the frequency of routine hearing surveillance, approaches to managing conductive hearing loss in infancy and provision of hearing aids and grommets. There was variation in how professionals describe their decision-making, reflecting individual treatment preferences, differing approaches to professional remit and institutional factors. The consultations identified that research should focus on improving practical support for managing the condition and supporting decision-making about interventions. Conclusions: There is system-level variation in the provision of services and individual-level variation in how professionals make clinical decisions. As a consequence, there is inequity of access to hearing health care for children with Down syndrome. Future research should focus on developing core outcomes for research and care, and on improving decision support for families. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - This study seeks to investigate the impact of an exposure to a university's social media on publics’ perceptions during a crisis. Data from this study showed that participants (N = 269) expressed more favourable evaluations towards the university and their perceived severity was mitigated after viewing its official statement on university's Facebook posts. The results of this empirical research offer a meaningful suggestion to crisis communication scholars and practitioners interested in assessing the impact of universities’ statements in social media by providing ways to understand the importance of the organizational usage of social media during a crisis, why that is important, and why practitioners should make effective social media communication tactics a priority during a crisis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The primary purpose of these studies was to investigate associations between religiosity, political ideology, and attitudes toward immigrants using a mediation path-analytic approach. Respondents in two nationally representative samples of Americans (Studies 1 and 2) completed single items assessing general religiosity, political ideology, and immigrant prejudice. University students (Studies 3 and 4) completed measures of religious fundamentalism (RF), political ideology, and perceived realistic and symbolic threats posed by immigrants. Across the four studies, there were small to medium positive relationships between measures of religiosity and prejudice toward immigrants and consistent evidence that religiosity influences immigrant prejudice through political ideology (i.e., significant indirect relationships). None of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included zero for total or indirect effects of religiosity on immigrant prejudice. However, when liberal political ideology was included as the mediator, the relationship between religiosity and immigrant prejudice weakened to statistical and practical nonsignificance. These four studies reveal the role political ideology plays in associations between measures of religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - The present research aims to verify the presence of linguistic biases in crime news reports (Study 1) and their role (Study 2) in activating a crime stereotype toward racial/ethnic minorities. In a first content analysis study, the natural occurrence of a set of linguistic biases was analyzed in Italian news articles that described comparable crimes committed by an in- or an outgroup aggressor. Results indicated that when the crime was committed by an outgroup (vs. ingroup) member, more aggravating and less attenuating adjectives were used. Moreover, the nationality of the perpetrator was not only mentioned more frequently, it also appeared in most cases as a noun. In Study 2, participants read a fictitious news article that either described an in- or outgroup criminal act with neutral or biased language. Their implicit associations between in- and outgroup members and weapons (vs. tools) were measured immediately afterward in the weapon paradigm. Results confirmed that a biased (vs. neutral) language use increased participants' crime-related associations with the outgroup in general only when an outgroup criminal was staged. The role of media portrayals in determining the cognitive representations of racial/ethnic minorities is discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - We investigated the negation of media stereotypes. Negation refers to an internal attempt to negate stereotypic content ("No! This is not true!"). The process of negation is important because a critical assessment of stereotypic content can be beneficial for stereotype and prejudice reduction. This fact is a crucial reason why readers' disagreement regarding simplified stereotypic depictions is of central interest for mass communication research and media literacy campaigns. Importantly, factors that can increase negation are of special interest. Although the ability and motivation to process stereotypic content can be theoretically identified as potential influencing factors, media-stereotype research has not yet tested the influence of these factors on negation. In Experiment 1 (N = 347), we manipulated the motivation to negate by presenting awareness material. We informed some of the participants that the news media often do not represent the world as it is, but sometimes do so in a stereotypic way. Analyses revealed that participants who received the awareness material before reading negated to a higher extent. In Experiment 2 (N = 223), we investigated the impact of ability by manipulating the time participants had to negate stereotypic content. The ability to negate was assumed to be higher the more time the participants had to process stereotypic information. As hypothesized, negation was higher when there was more time available. Interestingly, the increase in effect size was dampened the more time was available, which indicated a curvilinear relationship. Implications for media-literacy campaigns are discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Given the focus of the media on female candidate appearance in the 2008 presidential election, this research investigates the effects on voter evaluations of calling attention to female candidate attractiveness. The current research hypothesizes that pointing out candidate attractiveness likely has a negative effect on subsequent evaluations and reports of vote likelihood, particularly for female candidates. Role congruity theory, which argues that evidence of prejudice against female leaders is the result of a discrepancy between people’s stereotypes of women and their stereotypes of leaders, provides an explanation for these findings. This study establishes the negative influence of calling attention to a candidate’s attractiveness. In particular, a female candidate described as attractive are evaluated more negatively than a male candidate described as attractive and compared to male and female candidates, who are not described as attractive. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study was conducted to conceptualise advertising value and consumer attitudes towards advertisements. The research was developed to reveal the effect of the source of advertisements on credibility perception through the theoretical framework of Ducoffe's (1995) advertising value model. The research objective is to identify source derogation in terms of credibility to create advertising value and a positive attitude towards advertisements launched through the Facebook social network. In this regard, the study used three distinct sources to generate and introduce product promotional messages: an associative reference group, an aspirational reference group and marketers themselves. This research revealed significant differences in developing advertisement value and forming a favourable attitude towards advertisements when the product-related message was developed by these three distinct groups, who have different source derogations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to alleviate the situation that bad money drives out good in the produce market within the context of incomplete information, as well as bridge the gap between demand and product surplus, establishing and improving the safety certification system for farm produce is an urgent need. This paper discusses factors that affect consumers’ purchase of pork with safety certificates in the setting of incomplete information. Data from 844 consumers in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, along with a structural equation model, are adopted to study consumers’ purchase intention of certified safe pork form. According to our studies, major factors refer to degree of understanding, degree of concern, recognition ability, government publicity, pork’s origin information, consumers’ educational levels, income levels, and consumers’ evaluation of government supervision. Accordingly, suggestions are provided as follows. Above all, enhancing education and training of food safety is conducive to lead consumers’ behaviors in a correct way. Next, news media and social public opinions can play a stronger role in guidance and supervision. Thirdly, an upgraded legal system should be accompanied by better policy implementation. Finally, strengthening the origin certification system and promoting a sense of brand are of significance. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Sexism and Misogyny Through the Pseudoscientific Discourse: Media Context of Treatment of »The Wrong Sex«: The article analyses some concrete examples of a particular type of sexist discourse in Slovene traditional media and public space, extending beyond its dominant and anticipated thematisations related to advertising or deep-rooted stereotypes about sexual roles or discrimination. Analysis of some publications by dr. Boštjan M. Zupančič and his media appearances show that the described type of discourse is often hidden behind the pseudoscientific and pseudopsychoanalytic legitimacy, relying heavily on the findings of Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung and some other psychology classics. In my description pseudosocientific sexism is a complex corpus of misogynic and sexist beliefs, words and actions, treating a person, usually a feminine, scornfully and discriminatory by referring to suspicious and groundless scientific findings, at the same time denying her mental and cognitive ability, otherwise attributed exclusively to men. It is usually also rejecting equal role of women in society or their equality in profession. Such a type of sexism under the guise of scientifically sophisticated findings, especially when combined with support of media, dangerously legitimises everything that is commonly rejectable within the broad concept of sexism, i.e. widespread gender discrimination and inequality, based on a number of prejudices. © 2018, © 2018, © 2018 EURICOM.

AB  - Background: In 2014, Denmark experienced a rapid decline in vaccination uptake for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine after a successful introduction of the vaccine in 2009. Before the decline, the uptake of the first HPV vaccine was around 90% for girls born in the period 1998 to 2000, while it dropped to 54% for girls born in 2003. The decline followed negative public attention from 2013 coinciding with increasing suspected adverse-event reporting to the Danish Medicines Agency. The aim of this study is to describe the HPV-vaccination uptake, to quantify relevant HPV-related media coverage, and analyse the relation between media coverage and HPV-vaccination acceptance in Denmark in year 2009-2016. Methods: Three types of data were used for the analysis: Immunisation data from 243,415 girls, media coverage (8524 news items) and Google search activity. We used changes in the correlation between media coverage and vaccination uptake to identify a changing point in their relationship. The relationship before and after the changing point was analysed determined on the interactions between vaccination uptake, media and search activity, with search activity as a proxy for public attention. Results: We identified July 2013 as a changing point in the relationship between media coverage and vaccination uptake. We found no significant relationship between media coverage and vaccination uptake in the first part of the time series (June 2009 to June 2013), whereas from July 2013 and onwards there was a negative Pearson's correlation of - 0.52. The changing point coincides with both an increase in Google searches for "HPV side effects" and media coverage with negative content. Conclusions: Following a successful launch of the HPV-vaccination programme, concerns about vaccine safety shifted the public opinion and the coverage by the media. The noticeable shift in correlation between vaccination uptake and media coverage before and after July 2013 could indicate that increased media coverage influenced the decline in vaccination uptake. Media monitoring may represent an important tool in future monitoring and assessment of confidence in vaccination programmes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This review presents a comprehensive picture of research studies about marijuana-related content in news, social media, and advertisements. Studies that examined the extent of people’s exposure to the messages and its effects were also included. A total of 27 peer-reviewed journal articles and one thesis were located, of which 16 analyzed the content, four contained information about people’s exposure to the messages, and ten examined the effects. Over time, news coverage shifted from negative to slightly positive toward marijuana use. Social media and advertisements were overwhelmingly favorable toward marijuana use and legalization by claiming social, romantic, and health benefits of marijuana use while completely downplaying risks. A majority of social media accounts were also run by advocacy groups and industry interests, rather than individuals who were simply sharing opinions or experiences. Furthermore, absence of health authorities among the highly popular social media accounts about marijuana was notable. The news, social media, and advertising messages about marijuana were widely used by the members of public, which in turn generated some demonstrable effects on the audience’s marijuana-related perceptions and behaviors. The public and policymakers need to become aware of this information environment for potential marijuana users and take more proactive measures to protect vulnerable populations. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a major global health concern. Although it is prevalent in Kenya, scant literature on factors contributing to CSA vulnerability exists. Using qualitative data from 28 focus groups and ethnographic field notes, we explored and assessed community perceptions of factors contributing to CSA vulnerability in Homa Bay County, Western Kenya. Findings suggest that people living in these communities perceived CSA as being influenced by multiple factors: developmental stage, peer pressure, huge gender disparities exacerbated by negative social norms and cultural practices, the HIV epidemic and social media platforms that circulate sexualised images. From our findings, it was clear that participants also regarded poverty as exacerbating children’s vulnerability to CSA. Minors from poor families engaged in transactional sex for survival and social status. Some community members perceived girls dressed in short skirts or tight clothing as warranting unwanted sexual advances. Although poverty and gender roles and relations were viewed as increasing vulnerability to CSA, blame was often placed on survivors’ modes of dress or behaviour. There is a need for comprehensive education of the communities on CSA, its consequences and the rights of women and girls. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The United States Constitution allows individuals to practice any religion they choose. However, the austerity of this right is tested when an individual’s belief is publicly displayed. For Muslim women wearing the hijab, or headscarf, the intersection between private religious practice and its social expression is explored on a daily basis. To fully understand the manifestation of public religious expression, this paper examines a series of interviews with 35 hijab-wearing Muslim women living in the United States. By exploring the lived experiences of Muslim-American women, this paper highlights the broader issues of the media’s influence on perceptions of Muslim culture, the complex and often unclear legality of religious symbols in the workplace, and the barriers that exist for hijab-wearing women in the workplace. With the rise of Islamophobia, the participants found a stronger sense to exert their right to express their religious identities. Moreover, the women interviewed demonstrate their agency by continuing to embrace their religious practice despite intersecting forms of discrimination. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - Applying media analysis, this article addresses how the exclusion of Muslim women from fields of common public interest in Sweden, such as partaking as an active citizen, is materialized. Focusing on a specific event—the cancellation of a screening of Burka Songs 2.0—and the media coverage and representation of the cancellation, it discusses the role of discourses of gender equality, secularity and democracy in circumscribing space for Muslim political subjects. It casts light on Islamophobic stereotyping, questionable democracy and secularity, as well as the over-simplified approaches to gender equality connected to dealings with Muslim women in Sweden. Besides obstacles connected to Muslim political subjects, the study provides insights into media representation of Muslim women in general, specially connected to veils and the role of lawmaking connected to certain kind of veiling, in Sweden and Europe. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - Today we live and face a communication paradox: the world has never been richer with information, but unfortunately information with little authenticity and criticism. A great number of information storms create junk information, the purpose of which is not to present confront opinions, but to relativize, generalize, and thus put social criticism to sleep. Society is flooded with information coming from everywhere and most often in a disturbing, confusing way. Reality around us is strongly influenced by the mass media and it is very easily transformed into show the mass media offer. In addition, it seems that the values are being lost. Culture is the highest expression of human creativity, which is conditioned by social and historical circumstances. It is a model of living common to all people and it includes values, norms, customs, rules of behavior, knowledge and technology, language and art. It exists to satisfy the basic biological, psychological and social needs of individuals. The subject of this paper is the analysis of the relationship between the media and the culture. © 2018, Goce Delchev University of Shtip. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under authoritarian regimes, citizen-led NGOs such as environmental NGOs (ENGOs) often operate under close scrutiny of the government. While this presents a challenge to a single ENGO, we propose here – in line with existing research on network effects – that there are opportunities for multiple ENGOs to coordinate and thus work in ways that supersede government controls, affect public opinion, and contribute to policy revision and/or creation. In this paper, we specifically examine the possibility that the gamut of citizen-based ENGOs in China are coordinating. Based on network analysis of ENGOs web pages as well as interviews with more than a dozen ENGO leaders between 2014 and 2016, we find that ENGOs have few direct and public connections to each other, but social media sites and personal connections offline provide a crucial function in creating bridges. A closer examination of these bridges reveals, however, that they can be substantive to the environmental discussion or functional to the dissemination of web page information but typically not both. In short, ENGOs in China are not directly connected but rather are connected in a way that responds to the available social media and the government’s censorship practices. © 2018 World Association for Triple helix and Future strategy studies.

AB  - The Internet of Things (or IoT), which enables the networked interconnection of everyday objects, is becoming increasingly popular in many aspects of our lives ranging from entertainment to health care. While the IoT brings a set of invaluable advantages and opportunities with it, there is also evidence of numerous challenges that are yet to be resolved. This is certainly the case with regard to ensuring the cyber security of the IoT, and there are various examples of devices being hacked. Despite this evidence, little is known about the public perceptions of the opportunities and challenges presented by the IoT. To advance research in this direction, we mined the social media platform Twitter to learn about public opinion about the IoT. Analysing a longitudinal dataset of more than 6.7 million tweets, we reveal insights into public perceptions of the IoT, identifying big data analytics as the most positive aspect, whereas security issues are the main public concern on the negative side. Our study serves to highlight the importance of keeping IoT devices secure, and remind manufacturers that it is a concern that remains unresolved, at least insofar as the public believes.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to develop a reliable and valid measure to assess public beliefs in mythical causes of cancer: The Cancer Awareness Measure-MYthical Causes Scale (CAM-MYCS) Design and setting Cancer myth items were generated from a literature review, social media and interviews (n=16) The CAM-MYCS was prepared by reducing items using (a) an online sample (n=527) with exploratory factor analysis and (b) cancer experts with Delhpi methodology (n=13) To assess test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change, students (n=91) completed the CAM-MYCS at baseline and 1 week after exposure to information on lifestyle-related cancer causes or control information Construct validity was tested by comparing CAM-MYCS scores between cancer experts (n=25) and students (n=91) Factor structure and internal reliability were investigated in a national sample (n=1993) Results Out of 42 items generated, 12 were retained based on factor loadings, prevalence of endorsement and expert consensus CAM-MYCS scores improved (fewer myths endorsed) among students exposed to information on cancer causes compared with the control group (p<0001) and showed high test-retest reliability (r=090, p<0001) Cancer experts reported higher CAM-MYCS scores (fewer myths endorsed) than students (p<0001) The factor structure of the CAM-MYCS was confirmed in the national sample and internal reliability was high (α=086) Inclusion of the CAM-MYCS alongside items assessing knowledge of actual cancer causes did not affect responses Conclusions The CAM-MYCS tool is a reliable and valid tool assessing beliefs in mythical causes of cancer, and it can be used alongside items assessing known causes of cancer. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - This article analyzes the Ground Zero Mosque discursive event and the discourses surrounding the American Muslim Community and explores the role of the media in the production and reproduction processes of anti-Muslim frames. To understand Islamophobia in the United States in the context of religious pluralism, this article adopts Critical Discourse Analysis, under which two theories unfold: sourcing theory and framing theory. The sourcing analysis targeted the media voices monitoring the discourses and contributing to the discursive construction and interpretation of mosque proposal into an agenda-led image. The second theory is framing, which consists of including a perceived reality-in the news-, making it more salient, and presenting it to the audience. The data analyzed were collected from CNN and Fox News via Lexis Nexis online academic database. A total of 225 media transcripts-(n=138) Fox News and (n=87) CNN-constituted the text and were coded and analyzed using Atlas.ti data mining software program. The critical analysis has resulted in a number of 180 voices-e.g. journalists, politicians, academics, officials, etc. - contribution of the discursive construction of the non-violence event, of which 150 were anti-Muslim activists, journalists, politicians, reportedly former Muslim Brotherhood member, etc. The study has also resulted in two main frames: frame of illegitimacy and frame of terrorism, transforming the nonviolence event into a celebrated violent one, thereby providing a vivid image of America's project of religious pluralism and its capacity to accommodate the religions existing within the American confines. © 2018 Postgraduate Program State Institute of Islamic Studies.
Artikel ini menganalisis peristiwa acara diskursif Masjid Ground Zero dan wacana seputar Komunitas Muslim Amerika dan mengeksplorasi peran media dalam proses produksi dan reproduksi bingkai anti-Muslim. Untuk memahami Islamophobia di Amerika Serikat dalam konteks pluralisme agama, artikel ini mengadopsi Analisis Wacana Kritis, di mana dua teori terungkap: teori sumber dan teori framing. Analisis sumber menargetkan suara-suara media yang memonopoli wacana dan berkontribusi pada konstruksi diskursif dan interpretasi proposal masjid ke dalam pencitraan yang dipimpin oleh suatu agenda. Teori kedua adalah framing, yang terdiri dari memasukkan realitas yang dirasakan - dalam berita-, membuatnya lebih menonjol, dan menyajikannya kepada pemirsa. Data yang dianalisis dikumpulkan dari CNN dan Fox News melalui database akademik online Lexis Nexis. Sebanyak 225 transkrip media- (n = 138) Fox News dan (n = 87) CNN - merupakan teks dan dikodekan dan dianalisis menggunakan program perangkat lunak data mining Atlas.ti. Analisis kritis telah menghasilkan sejumlah 180 suara - misalnya wartawan, politisi, akademisi, pejabat, dll. - berkontribusi terhadap konstruksi diskursif dari peristiwa non-kekerasan, yang 150 di antaranya adalah aktivis anti-Muslim, jurnalis, politisi, mantan anggota Ikhwanul Muslimin, dll. Studi ini juga telah menghasilkan dua kerangka utama: bingkai illegitimacy dan bingkai terorisme, yang mengubah peristiwa non-kekerasan menjadi peristiwa yang sangat kejam. Inilah gambaran yang jelas tentang proyek pluralisme agama Amerika dan kapasitasnya untuk mengakomodasi agama-agama yang ada dalam batas-batas Amerika. © 2018 Postgraduate Program State Institute of Islamic Studies.

AB  - In a rapidly changing world, the challenges of migration, as well as its potential benefits, are hotly debated. Recent years have seen new challenges as a result of unprecedented levels of migration, instability following the Global Financial Crisis, economic and security concerns surrounding immigration, and negative portrayals of immigrants by some Western leaders. These developments make it all the more important to understand the psychological processes underpinning attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, support for particular immigration policies and responses to changing policies, the role of portrayals of immigrants in the media, and the consequences of immigration attitudes and policies. This special issue brings together researchers interested in the topic of immigration from a psychological perspective, with a focus on understanding the reception of immigrants and refugees in Western countries. In this introductory article, we outline the background to this special issue and briefly describe each article included. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - In three studies, we demonstrate that common metaphors used to describe immigrants in news media interact with national, but not political, identity to lead to feelings of disgust as well as anti-immigrant attitudes. The first study demonstrates that the current discourse in the U.S. surrounding unauthorized immigrants includes metaphors that readily activate thoughts of vermin (e.g., rodents). The second study shows that when these metaphors are present in a news article about immigrants, the more participants identify as American the more disgust they experience reading the article. The final study further shows that after reading a news article in which the vermin metaphors are present, the more participants identify as American the more likely they are to support stringent immigration policies. This research shows the power of metaphor to shape intergroup attitudes and support for government policies. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This article presents an empirical analysis of the Australian media representation of terrorism using the 2014 Sydney Lindt Café siege as a case in point to engage with the notion of moral panic. Deploying critical discourse analysis and case study as mixed methods, insights into trans-media narratives and aftermath of the terrifying siege are presented. While news media appeared to collaborate with the Australian right-wing government in the reporting of terrorism, social media posed challenges and raised security concerns for the state. Social media heightened the drama as sites were variously deployed by the perpetrator, activists and concerned members of the public. The amplified trans-media association of Muslims with terrorism in Australia and its national and global impact, in terms of the political exclusion of Muslims, are best described in this article in the form of an Islamophobic Moral Panic Model, invented for a rethink of the various stages of its occurrence, intensification and institutionalization. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study explores the attribute agenda-setting effects and attribute priming effects of news coverage on the issue of same-sex marriage. The affective attribute salience of news coverage on the same-sex marriage issue is stronger when related to public opinion than the substantive attribute salience of the news coverage. News coverage on the issue is strongly associated with audience attitudes about controversial issues. Last, on controversial issues, news media have long-term, rather than short-term, effects on public opinion. © 2018 NOND of AEJMC.

AB  - Given that the fictional narratives found in novels, movies, and television shows enjoy wide public consumption, memorably convey information, minimize counter-arguing, and often emphasize politically-relevant themes, we argue that greater scholarly attention must be paid to theorizing and measuring how fiction affects political attitudes. We argue for a genre-based approach for studying fiction effects, and apply it to the popular dystopian genre. Results across three experiments are striking: we find consistent evidence that dystopian narratives enhance the willingness to justify radical - especially violent - forms of political action. Yet we find no evidence for the conventional wisdom that they reduce political trust and efficacy, illustrating that fiction's effects may not be what they seem and underscoring the need for political scientists to take fiction seriously.

AB  - Despite the preoccupation with media depictions of crime and criminal justice, few studies have employed qualitative methodologies to investigate how audience members engage with, react to, and interpret media content. This analysis of Reddit forums dedicated to the 2015 Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer reveals the wide range of responses to the series and demonstrates the value of looking to user-generated content on social media platforms to understand how we think and feel about crime-related matters. I argue that Reddit users’ reactions to the series are consistent with existing research outlining the complexity of the public’s views regarding criminal justice policy and these responses are intelligible when we consider the broader socio-political context in which the series was released. Particularly important, in my view, are individuals’ affective responses – including empathy, confusion, heartbreak, anger, frustration, fear, and helplessness – and the ways these emotions are linked with beliefs about the efficacy of the criminal justice system and the purposes of punishment. Consequently, this article buttresses recent calls to consider the entire spectrum of human emotions and to investigate the ways these emotions are related to our multifaceted beliefs about crime and criminal justice. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Television advertising has been a primary method for marketing newhealth plans available under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to consumers. Data from Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group were used to analyze advertising content during three ACA open enrollment periods (fall 2013 to spring 2016). Few advertisement airings featured people who were elderly, disabled, or receiving care in a medical setting, and over time airings increasingly featured children, young adults, and people exercising. The most common informational messages focused on plan choice and availability of low-cost plans, but messages shifted over open enrollment cycles to emphasize avoidance of tax penalties and availability of financial assistance. Over the three open enrollment periods, there was a sharp decline in explicit mentions of the ACA or Obamacare in advertisements. Overall, television advertisements have increasingly targeted young, healthy consumers, and informational appeals have shifted toward a focus on financial factors in persuading individuals to enroll in marketplace plans. These advertising approaches make sense in the context of pressures to market plans to appeal to a sufficiently large, diverse group. Importantly, dramatic declines over time in explicit mention of the law mean that citizens may fail to understand the connection between the actions of government and the benefits they are receiving. © 2018 by Duke University Press.

AB  - This article responds to Gozdziak’s (2015: 30) call to explore how the knowledge that informs public debates about human trafficking is generated. Media imagery and narratives play a significant role in constructing both knowledge and ignorance. This article reflects on the construction of such knowledge by analysing how anti-trafficking docufiction videos from the Unchosen competition dramatize trafficking. We draw on Goffman’s (1974) work on frames to analyse how these videos present a simplified interpretation of reality, where certain constructed aspects of trafficking and exploitation are represented by video-makers as illustrating the general. In doing so, we highlight how anti-trafficking docufictions help efface everyday exploitation. The article contributes both to the empirical research on the construction of knowledge about trafficking, and to critical conceptual work on (anti)trafficking, exploitation and ignorance. It is part of a broader project to challenge exceptionalizing and individualizing representations of human trafficking – aiming to engage better with everyday exploitation. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The word "nanotechnology" has been exaggerated not only by media but also by scientist groups who have overstated the unforeseen benefits of nanotechnology to validate research funding. Even ecologists, who normally remain indulged in doom-and-gloom divinations, use this word to fuel their own motives. Such outcomes lead to widespread misinformation and an unaware public. This research work is a staunch effort to filter the Twitter-based public opinions related to this word. Our results clearly indicate more of positive sentiments attached to the subject of nanotechnology, as trust, anticipation and joy overweigh by many folds the anger, mistrust and anger related to nanotechnology. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Objective: Human trafficking problems have largely been framed by political elites and the media as a sexual crime involving innocent victims who are largely women and children. It is unclear how this framing impacts the public's attitudes about the issue. Here, we ask what types of sex trafficking victim frames produce the strongest response among the American public and how does increased exposure and accurate knowledge about the issue moderate the impact of the victim frames?. Methods: To answer these questions, we utilize data from a unique nationally representative survey experiment fielded to 2,000 Americans in which we designed a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment manipulating the gender, age, and nationality of sex trafficking victims. Results: We find the age of the victim has the greatest impact on affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to human trafficking, but that these victim frames are conditional on the amount of exposure a subject has had to the issue of human trafficking and the level of correct knowledge he or she possesses about human trafficking. Conclusion: Victim framing in public discourse on sex trafficking does make a difference, and the reasons these frames elicit different responses are complex and moderated by respondents’ exposure to information and knowledge about the issue. © 2018 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - Background: Comments made by readers in response to news articles about current events can provide profound insights into public understanding of and perspectives on those events. Here, in follow up to a paper published last year in this journal, we examined reader comments to articles in newspapers and magazines about neurosurgical interventions for treating psychiatric illness. Method: We conducted a thematic analysis of these comments (N = 662 coded units of data) posted in response to 115 newspaper and magazine articles from four countries (Canada, USA, Germany, and Spain) between 2006 and 2017. The comments were coded using an iteratively refined coding scheme that was structured around four a priori categories based on results from the parent study and two new categories that emerged. Results: We found many references to historical psychosurgery and mostly negative and pessimistic comments about ablative neurosurgical interventions. Comments to deep brain stimulation were more positive, and comments to optogenetics most controversial. We also found many expressions of distrust of medical professionals in the context of interventions on the brain and concerns about social and individual control. Conclusions: Overall, results suggest there is still much work to be done to raise public awareness about re-emerging and new neurosurgical interventions. Balanced discussion is needed if these approaches are to find a place in health care for psychiatric disorders. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The 2016 presidential election provided a unique opportunity to revisit two competing hypotheses for how voters establish their perceptions of electoral integrity. First, mass public opinion is believed to derive from elite messages. In the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump maintained that the election system was “rigged,” while election administration experts and officials received considerable media coverage in their efforts to counter Trump’s claims. Second, literature on voter confidence has established a “winner effect”—voters who cast ballots for winners are more likely than voters on the losing side to believe their vote was counted correctly. Thus, voters were exposed to two theoretically opposite effects. In this paper, we find that the “winner” effect mitigates the effects from strong pre-election cues from elites. We also show the effect of pre-election attention to the rigging issue, find a symmetry of the election outcome effect for winners and losers, and reconsider our explanations of the winner effect. Finally, we go beyond the existing studies of the winner effect to consider the kind of citizens who are most susceptible to that effect. © 2018 University of Utah.

AB  - The news media are often accused of reporting politics in a too narrow and consensual way, excluding certain perspectives and issues that might better reflect the public’s agenda. This study lends weight to this argument by not only demonstrating the party political focus of UK election coverage but also in the misleading way public opinion was, at times, represented. Analysing 6647 items and/or stories in the largest ever content analysis study of 4613 sources across five first- and second-order election campaigns in the United Kingdom, it comprehensively tracks how citizens and journalists appear in television news, as well as developing a finely grained, qualitative assessment of how public opinion was represented during the 2017 election campaign. Overall, the study found that political parties received the most amount of airtime, but in some election campaigns members of the public appeared in coverage more often than politicians. However, they were mostly granted limited airtime to articulate their views in vox pops. During the 2017 election campaign, the study found the editorial construction of public opinion in vox pops and live journalistic two-ways was shaped by a relatively narrow set of assumptions made by political journalists about the public’s ideological views rather than consulting more objective measures of public opinion. So, for example, voters were portrayed as favouring more right- than left-wing policies despite evidence to the contrary. The use of citizens as sources is theorised as serving the pre-conceived narratives of journalists rather than reflecting a representative picture of public opinion. The study reinforces and advances academic debates about journalists and citizen-source interactions. More accurately engaging with people’s concerns, it is concluded, will help move broadcasters beyond the narrow set of assumptions that typically serve their narratives of political coverage. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The prevalence of online media has attracted researchers from various domains to explore human behavior and make interesting predictions. In this research, we leverage heterogeneous data collected from various online platforms to predict Taiwan’s 2016 general election. In contrast to most existing research, we take a “signal” view of heterogeneous information and adopt the Kalman filter to fuse multiple signals into daily vote predictions for the candidates. We also consider events that influenced the election in a quantitative manner based on the so-called event study model that originated in the field of financial research. We obtained the following interesting findings. First, public opinions in online media dominate traditional polls in Taiwan election prediction in terms of both predictive power and timeliness. But offline polls can still function on alleviating the sample bias of online opinions. Second, although online signals converge as election day approaches, the simple Facebook “Like” is consistently the strongest indicator of the election result. Third, most influential events have a strong connection to cross-strait relations, and the Chou Tzu-yu flag incident followed by the apology video one day before the election increased the vote share of Tsai Ing-Wen by 3.66%. This research justifies the predictive power of online media in politics and the advantages of information fusion. The combined use of the Kalman filter and the event study method contributes to the data-driven political analytics paradigm for both prediction and attribution purposes. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent research and practice in environmental management suggest sentiment analysis of social media communication can be a useful tool in stakeholder analysis of environmental policy. This is certainly the case when it comes to the controversial use of biological controls in dealing with invasive species. Current numerical scored approaches of sentiment may not reveal the reasons for support or opposition to environmental policies in this and other areas. In this study, we examine how the use of more in-depth analysis based on what key stakeholders say about this issue in media at a national, city or regional geographic level. The analysis reveals quite different reasons for support and opposition to the biological control of carp in Australia, and that within each stakeholder group it is possible for individuals to hold conflicting views and attitudes on this issue. We find that there are concerns at the national and city level about the impact of the virus and mistrust of government and science and that the carp species may be viewed as a valuable resource. Those responding to regional media expressed hope that the virus may lead to the elimination of the carp problem, however, they were more interested in the possible impact on the local environment. The multi-scaled social media analysis of stakeholder views about the potential biological control of carp in Australia demonstrated how social media comments can be used to explore the nuanced and multidimensional nature of community attitudes and preferences. © 2018

AB  - In this article, I examine how US evangelical opposition to LGBT rights stems from a unique understanding of sexuality and the person. As my respondents explained to me in over sixteen months of field research, evangelical rejection of LGBT individuals and practices is rooted not simply in prejudice but also in a culturally specific notion of personhood that requires Christian bodies to orient themselves to the divine. In evangelical Christianity, the body, along with its capacity to feel and communicate, is understood as a porous vessel receptive to communication with God. In contrast to a dominant idea that sexual orientations shape individual identities, sexuality within this religious world instead facilitates the movement of moral forces across individual bodies and geographic scales. Sexual desires and sexual acts are broadly understood in evangelical cosmology as communicative mediums for supernatural forces. This understanding of sexuality as a central component of moral agency shapes widespread practices of ostracism of people who identify as LGBT within evangelicalism and often leads to anti-LGBT political positions. Claiming an LGBT identity is seen as making one a distinct kind of person incommensurate with evangelical porosity.

AB  - For those at risk for Zika virus infection, prevention requires an approach that includes individual, interpersonal, and community-level support for behavior change. In August 2016, the announcement of local Zika transmission in Florida provided an opportunity to determine whether Zika-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors might be affected differentially in Florida compared to the rest of the nation. From August 8–October 3, 2016, we conducted nationally representative weekly surveys (N = 12,236), oversampling Florida residents, measuring Zika virus news exposure, knowledge about transmission and prevention of the infection, and attitudes and behaviors toward prevention. We tested two classes of models: those focused on individual Zika risk perceptions (e.g., protection motivation theory) and one focused on community action beyond those directly at risk (social consensus model). Analyses assessed differences between Florida and the rest of the nation by survey week. Consistent with both models, Floridians demonstrated significantly higher levels of perceived susceptibility and knowledge, more positive attitudes toward Zika virus prevention, and higher likelihood of engaging in protective behavior than non-Floridians. Consistent with theories of individual risk perception, response was greater among respondents who saw themselves at risk of infection. However, consistent with the SCM, irrespective of personal risk, response was greater among Floridians. Nevertheless, more than half of the public took no direct action to prevent the spread of Zika. Communities at increased risk for a novel infection such as Zika may quickly acquire Zika-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, but large-scale community-wide response might be difficult without further community-level public education. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery, in recent times, has gained media attention that has influenced individual, healthcare provider and wider societal attitudes towards bariatric surgery. Studies exploring public and media levels of interest in bariatric surgery have been performed overseas but studies within New Zealand (NZ) are scarce. Analysis of Google Trends data may be a useful source of information in investigating public interest levels in bariatric surgery. We aimed to analyse Google Trends information on Internet searches in NZ and to explore sequential relationships with relevant changes in policy. Methods: Key search terms for our Google Trends query were retrieved by independently reviewing news articles relating to bariatric surgery in NZ published between January 2007 and December 2017 and following a brainstorming session. Trend analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 14.7.2. Data were captured for both NZ and worldwide search interests in Google Trends. Results: Trend analyses showed that total search volumes for ‘lap band’ and ‘lap band surgery’ declined while ‘gastric sleeve’ and ‘gastric sleeve surgery’ increased exponentially over the 10-year period. Furthermore, search interests for key terms in NZ were comparable with those worldwide. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that search interests related to bariatric surgery in NZ mirror those worldwide. This includes the popularity of some bariatric procedures over others. The use of Google Trends may provide us with an additional tool to evaluate public interest levels related to bariatric surgery in NZ and could add value in examining the socio-cultural and political contexts of obesity and bariatric surgery. © 2018 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons

AB  - Political public relations became headline news when Kellyanne Conway, Advisor to U.S. President Trump, described provable falsehoods as alternative facts. Other memorable/misstatements became part of the cultural zeitgeist even as journalists continued to interview her. Public relations professionals are inextricably connected to the journalists who shape public opinion. The author therefore conducted a qualitative framing analysis to understand how journalists framed her occupational role and job performance. Articles from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal revealed that journalists assigned Advocacy and Gendered framing for her occupational role. Analysis also indicated that journalists alternately depicted her performance as adequate, unreliable, and manipulative. The author considers implications of findings for public relations professionals. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fear of infectious disease often motivates people to protect themselves. But, it can also produce negative bio-social-psychological effects whose severity is on par with those of the disease. The WHO declaration of Zika as a world health crisis presented an opportunity to study factors that bring about fear. Beginning nine days after the WHO announcement, data were gathered from women aged 18–35 living in the southern United States (N = 719). Respondents reported experiencing fear of Zika at levels akin to those reported following other significant crises/disasters (e.g., the terrorist attacks of 9/11). Fear increased as a function of (1) personal, but not other-relevance, (2) frequency of media exposure, but not media content, and (3) frequency of interpersonal exposure and interpersonal content. It is argued that media and interpersonal message sources may be innately predisposed to amplify, rather than attenuate, risk. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Background: The public increasingly uses social media not only to look for information about emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), but also to share opinions, emotions, and coping strategies. Identifying the frames used in social media discussion about EIDs will allow public health agencies to assess public opinions and sentiments. Method: This study examined how the public discussed measles during the measles outbreak in the United States during early 2015 that originated in Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA, through a semantic network analysis of the content of around 1 million tweets using KH coder. Results: Four frames were identified based on word frequencies and co-occurrence: news update, public health, vaccination, and political. The prominence of each individual frame changed over the corse of the pre-crisis, initial, maintenance, and resolution stages of the outbreak. Conclusions: This study proposed and tested a method for assessing the frames used in social media discussions about EIDs based on the creation, interpretation, and quantification of semantic networks. Public health agencies could use social media outlets, such as Twitter, to assess how the public makes sense of an EID outbreak and to create adaptive messages in communicating with the public during different stages of the crisis. © 2018 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

AB  - This is a response to the rejoinder by Tolkach (2018) to Luo and Zhai's (2017) paper (“I will never go to Hong Kong again” How the secondary crisis communication of “Occupy Central” on Weibo shifted to a tourism boycott). The authors recognize Tolkach's suggestion on academic debates but hold different opinions to his arguments. Thus, further clarification is provided to Tolkach's two main concerns: the impact of Occupy Central on Hong Kong tourism and sentiment analysis of censored material. This response emphasizes that Luo and Zhai primarily discussed the secondary crisis communication and public emotions that arose in the Chinese social media over the events in Hong Kong, and not the events themselves. Additionally this rejoinder provides more information on Tourism between mainland China and Hong Kong, the environment of Chinese social media, and academic research progress in mainland China. It also advocates an “empathetic understanding” in cross-cultural academic dialogue. © 2018

AB  - While research in media and politics has long stressed the importance of television, the political impact of movies has largely been ignored. However, a small body of literature suggests that both political docudramas and popular films may have the capacity to change the issue attitudes of viewers. Building on that work, this paper examines the potential for selective exposure in movie viewership. We develop a theory that there is large-scale sorting into popular movies rooted in social identity theory. We argue that sorting is a result of two processes: film studios marketing films towards particular social groups and individuals sorting into films based on social group characteristics. We test this theory using a unique dataset in which undergraduate students were asked to rate trailers for a variety of political docudramas and popular films. Our results indicate that there is indeed widespread sorting into popular films on the basis of social identities rooted in socio-demographic traits. © 2018 Western Social Science Association

AB  - This text mining study examine how healthcare organizations and consumers characterize social media use differently-in word and deed-to better understand the challenges of using social media for health communication. Content from four sources was analyzed: (1) health organizations' social media policies; (2) their tweets; (3) discussions between professional communicators at health organizations and (4) discussions in the public about social media in healthcare settings. Text mining software was used for coding and theme analysis. Dialogic analysis identified domains that enact or antagonize mutuality, propinquity, risk, empathy, and commitment. Some policies limit mutuality to business transactions; empathy and commitment to monitoring conversations and protecting privacy; and engagement to risk aversion. They send mixed messages about timeliness or propinquity. Social media content itself-i.e., tweets-defined mutuality and propinquity as immediate interactions for providing and obtaining help, as well as empathy and commitment as providers who engage more online. A lack of propinquity might contribute to degrading empathy and commitment. Professional communicators who manage healthcare social media accounts prioritize risk and organizational promotion over mutuality and empathy with the public. Public attitudes put empathy and responsiveness above risk. Differences in rules, expectation, and actions between health organizations and users constrain user engagement, and, in turn, health outcomes such as increased patient engagement and satisfaction with the quality of care. Practical changes such as careful, qualified online response to criticism and more regular and active monitoring of sentiment and inappropriate content could help curate more responsive content. © American Communication Journal, 2018.

AB  - Public opinion research suggests that rapid and significant individual-level fluctuations in opinions toward various policies is fairly unexpected absent methodological artifacts. While this may generally be the case, some political actions can and do face tremendous backlash, potentially impacting public evaluations. Leveraging broadcast and newspaper transcripts as well as a unique two-wave panel study we demonstrate that a non-random, rapid shift in opinions occurred shortly after President Donald Trump signed executive order 13769 into law, which barred individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The ban set off a fury of protests across U.S. cities and airports, garnering tremendous media attention and discussion. Drawing insights from literature on priming, we claim that an influx of new information portraying the “Muslim Ban” at odds with inclusive elements of American identity prompted some citizens to shift their attitudes. Our study highlights the potential broad political effects of mass movements and protests as it pertains to policies that impact racialized minority groups, and suggests that preferences can shift quickly in response to changing political circumstances. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Gathering public opinion by analyzing big social data has attracted wide attention due to its interactive and real time nature. For this, recent studies have relied on both social media and sentiment analysis in order to accompany big events by tracking people’s behavior. In this paper, we propose an adaptable sentiment analysis approach that analyzes social media posts and extracts user’s opinion in real-time. The proposed approach consists of first constructing a dynamic dictionary of words’ polarity based on a selected set of hashtags related to a given topic, then, classifying the tweets under several classes by introducing new features that strongly fine-tune the polarity degree of a post. To validate our approach, we classified the tweets related to the 2016 US election. The results of prototype tests have performed a good accuracy in detecting positive and negative classes and their sub-classes. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Social media analysis is a fast growing research area aimed at extracting useful information from social networks. Recent years have seen a great interest from academic and business world in using social media to measure public opinion. This paper presents a methodology aimed at discovering the behavior of social network users and how news sites are used during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions. As a case study, we present an analysis on the constitutional referendum that was held in Italy on December 4, 2016. A first goal of the analysis was to study how Twitter users expressed their voting intentions about the referendum in the weeks before the voting day, so as to understand how the voting trends have evolved before the vote, e.g., if there have been changes in the voting intentions. According to our study, 48% of Twitter users were polarized toward no, 25% toward yes, and 27% had a neutral behavior. A second goal was to understand the effects of news sites on the referendum campaign. The analysis has shown that some news sites had a strong polarization toward yes (unita.tv, ilsole24ore.it and linkiesta.it), some others had a neutral position (lastampa.it, corriere.it, huffingtonpost.it and repubblica.it) and others were oriented toward no (ilfattoquotidiano.it, ilgiornale.it and beppegrillo.it). © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Many scholars and commentators have written on ways to counteract acts of terrorism initiated by Islamist militants associated with Jihadist groups operating predominantly in the Middle East and North Africa Region (hereafter the MENA region). Most of what has been published in the academic literature with respect to slowing, eventually stopping, the rate of Islamist-inspired terrorism has focused on short-term public safety solutions to the problem. In this paper, we build a quality-of-life model to address the drivers of Jihadist terrorism and deduce the underlying factors that contribute to counterterrorism programs directly from our understanding of these drivers. Specifically, we provide suggestive evidence to show increased incidence of Jihadist terrorism is mostly motivated by increased negative sentiment of aggrieved Muslims toward their more affluent Western neighbors. This negative sentiment is influenced by a host of quality-of-life factors: economic ill-being factors (e.g., income disparities, poverty, and unemployment; and disparities in technological innovation), political ill-being factors (e.g., authoritarian tribal and exclusionary regimes), religious ill-being factors (e.g., increased Islamic religiosity, and lack of secularism), globalization and media ill-being factors (e.g., the global media), and cultural ill-being factors (e.g., perceived decadence of Western culture, and Western prejudice and discrimination). More effective counterterrorism strategies are deduced directly from understanding how these quality-of-life factors influence increased incidence of Jihadist terrorism. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. and The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS).

AB  - Disability is not only a health problem faced by disabled people and their families; it is necessary to consider it as a situation closely related to social aspects and society. Disability is a social phenomenon that concerns the disabled, the family, the immediate surroundings, and the community to which they belong. Disabled individuals, like every human being, want to share their social surroundings and their experiences of briefly living their emotions, thoughts, dreams. However, even for non-disabled individuals, communication, which can be difficult under certain conditions, can become even more difficult for disabled people. Because the psycho-social structure, values, attitudes, perceptions of life, and thoughts of the individuals in society are different. Therefore, disabled individual who is evaluated as a pitiful and poor person by the influence of prejudices in the social perception process can be exposed to the negative attitudes of the society and be excluded. It is not an “obstacle” on the basis of the “disability” your disability faces; the society that prefers the difference created by the obstacle lies in the “obstructive attitudes” developed against the obstruction. Written media have been shown and proven as the reason for this difference in our work. Our work will be demonstrated by an in-depth interview methodology of approaching the subject of five disabled people with the highest number of disabled people in the TRNC. Negative perceptions of the disability within the society are not only something that the written media can correct, but are also closely connected with the consciousness of the associations’ authorities and their shaping of their strategies accordingly. We tried to emphasize the media importance of literacy and media literacy education in this area. The media literacy training program will reduce the negative representations created by the media and their negative consequences because there will be conscious media consumers. At this point, the social exclusion that the people living in the society in the presence of the media representatives of the disability will be reduced the most. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In January 2012, Beijing began releasing air quality report of PM 2.5. The move has been credited as a major breakthrough in China’s environmental governance as it is argued that online environmental activists in China were the major driving force behind it. Since then, the issue of air pollution has reemerged as one of the hottest issues and a series of new policies addressing air pollution have been adopted. Facing a relatively new phenomenon (wumai) and heightened public concerns, to what extent is the state still capable of guiding the pubic perception and opinions about the issue? By analyzing the discourse of air pollution in People’s Daily and comparing it with public opinion survey data, the paper finds that the state’s ability to guide public opinion is rather limited, indicating that opportunities do exist for civil society to play a bigger role in China’s environmental governance. © 2017, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.

AB  - The incidence of cervical cancer (CC) in the sub-Saharan Africa region, where Nigeria is located, is amongst the highest in the world; it is estimated that 70,722 new cases of invasive cervical cancer occur annually in sub-Saharan Africa. Immunosuppression, especially due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is a predisposing factor for persistent infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) and the development of squamous intraepithelial lesions. Four hundred and fifty women who attended the HIV clinic at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, and who consented to participate in the study were randomly selected. They were given self-administered questionnaires which sought to determine their awareness and knowledge of cervical cancer and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening and prevention. The media 23% (n = 103) was the most common source of information amongst respondents who had heard about cervical cancer. For all the women surveyed, the average percentage knowledge was 9.95%. Having attitude scores greater than or equal to the mean attitude score of 55.16% was regarded as having a positive attitude while a score lower than that was regarded as negative attitude. About 43.5% (n = 195) respondents had a positive attitude towards cervical cancer screening and prevention. Cervical cancer awareness and knowledge amongst women attending the HIV clinic in the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, were very poor. Their attitude towards cervical cancer screening practices and prevention was also very poor. © 2017, American Association for Cancer Education.

AB  - Leading up to the 2019 presidential election in Indonesia, campaigns have emerged through social media, particularly Twitter, using various hashtags, such as #2019GantiPresiden (2019 Change President) and #TetapJokowi (Always Jokowi). This paper tries to understand the presidential candidates' power map in forming opinions and influencing voter behavior by analyzing Twitter from August 6, 2018 to September 15, 2018, just before the beginning of the official campaign period, by searching for the keyword “pemilihan presiden RI Tahun 2019" (RI presidential election in 2019). According to our NodeXL's analysis, there were 1,650 active Twitter users talking about the 2019 presidential election. The 1,650 Twitter users have formed a communication network of 46,750 relationships formed from messages in the form of tweets, comments, and retweets. Our analysis found that those mentioning "pilihan presiden 2019" form large communication networks around four clusters: one for each of the two candidates (Jokowi and Prabowo) and two for opinion leaders who are undecided about the election (Gus Mus and Mas Piyu). GusMus is a religious leader, as an official of the PBNU Rais Syuriah (an Islamic organization) and has a large following both on and off Twitter. "MasPiyu" is an unidentified Twitter user; he only has a large following on Twitter, but does not have support offline. © 2018, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

AB  - Throughout Israel, unlike other countries, a growing use of electric bicycle (EB) by youngsters (below 18) has been observed, accompanied by a drastic increase in the number of related injuries. This phenomenon is widely discussed by various authorities and media in Israel, whilst its characteristics are actually unknown. Existing literature on the use of EBs is limited. Thus, an opinion survey of young EB riders was conducted, with the aim of recording and analyzing the characteristics and general perception of teen EB users and to explore their behaviors. The results show that using EBs increases the frequency and the distance of teens' daily commute. The use of EB improves mobility independence, allowing for less reliance on parents and a widening of potential destinations. In addition, the results indicate that a substantial percent of the teens are not familiar with the legal regulations concerning EBs having been involved in various dangerous behaviors. Though the overall preference is to use bicycle paths, the common acceptable alternative is pedestrian sidewalks. These results suggest that a combination of road safety education and training with an improvement of existing infrastructure are the best way to tackle this new and widespread phenomenon. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The food industry can influence individual and population level food consumption behaviours, shape public preferences and interfere with government policy on obesity prevention and NCDs. This paper identifies the Corporate Political Activity (CPA) of major food companies in Thailand which relate to obesity and NCDs. Methods: Using the INFORMAS framework to classify CPA, we reviewed publicly available information by 12 food companies between August 2011 and July 2016 in order to identify, analyse and classify the CPA contents. Semi-structured interviews with 17 key stakeholders who are experts in this field supplemented evidence from the document review. Data analysis applied a thematic approach. Results: Food industry in Thailand applied a variety of CPA strategies and practices. The two most common strategies were constituency building and information and messaging. Conclusion: The diverse range of CPA strategies which influence government policy and public opinion can undermine efforts to prevent obesity and diet-related NCDs. We recommend systematic monitoring of their CPA, strengthening mechanisms to hold the food industry accountable for their role in protecting and promoting the nutrition and health of the population, introducing mandatory registration of lobbyists, mandatory disclosure of political donations, and stronger oversight of conflicts of interest among the government actors. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Social networking websites have attracted considerable attention as a delivery platform for physical activity interventions. Current evidence highlights a need to enhance user engagement with these interventions to actualize their potential. The purpose of this study was to determine which post type generates the most engagement from participants and whether engagement was related to change in physical activity in an intervention delivered via Facebook. Subgroup analysis of the intervention condition of a randomized controlled trial was conducted. The group moderator posted a new message to the private Facebook group each day of the program. The Facebook posts (n = 118) were categorized into the following types: moderator-initiated running program, multimedia, motivational, opinion polls, or discussion question and participant-initiated experience shares, or questions. Four metrics were used to measure volume of engagement with each post type, "likes," "comments," "poll votes," and "photo uploads." One-way ANOVA was used to determine whether engagement differed by post type and an independent samples t-test to determine differences in engagement between moderator and participant-initiated posts. Pearson correlation was used to examine associations between total engagement and change in physical activity. Engagement varied by post type. Polls elicited the greatest engagement (p ≤.01). The most common form of engagement was "likes," and engagement was higher for moderator-initiated rather than participant-initiated posts (mean = 8.0 [SD 6.8] vs. 5.3 [SD 3.2]; p ≤.01). Total engagement with the Facebook group was not directly associated with change in physical activity (r =-.13, p =.47). However, engagement was associated with compliance with the running program (r =.37, p =.04) and there was a nonsignificant positive association between compliance and change in physical activity (r =.32, p =.08). Posts requiring a simple response generated the most engagement. Intervention moderators should facilitate familiarity between participants at the intervention outset, to encourage engagement between participants. Engagement was related to change in physical activity, and these recommendations should be incorporated to enhance engagement and efficacy of interventions. © 2018 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - The main objective of this exploratory study is to identify the social, economic, environmental and cultural factors related to the sustainable care of both environment and public health that most concern Twitter users. With 336 million active users as of 2018, Twitter is a social network that is increasingly used in research to get information and to understand public opinion as exemplified by Twitter users. In order to identify the factors related to the sustainable care of environment and public health, we have downloaded n = 5873 tweets that used the hashtag #WorldEnvironmentDay on the respective day. As the next step, sentiment analysis with an algorithm developed in Python and trained with data mining was applied to the sample of tweets to group them according to the expressed feelings. Thereafter, a textual analysis was used to group the tweets according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), identifying the key factors about environment and public health that most concern Twitter users. To this end, we used the qualitative analysis software NVivo Pro 12. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the key factors that most concern users about the environment and public health such as climate change, global warming, extreme weather, water pollution, deforestation, climate risks, acid rain or massive industrialization. The conclusions of the present study can be useful to companies and institutions that have initiatives related to the environment and they also facilitate decision-making regarding the environment in non-profit organizations. Our findings will also serve the United Nations that will thoroughly review the 17 SDGs at the High-level Political Forum in 2019. © 2018, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - In China, the demand for public infrastructure projects is high due to the acceleration of urbanization and the rapid growth of the economy in recent years. Infrastructures are mainly large scale, so local governments have difficulty in independently completing financing work. In this context, public sectors often seek cooperation from private sectors, in which public-private partnership (PPP) is increasingly common. Although numerous studies have concentrated on sustainable development, the unsustainability performances of infrastructures are often reported on various media. Furthermore, studies on the sustainability performances of PPP-type infrastructure (PTI) projects are few from the perspective of private sectors' behaviors. In this study, we adopted the modified theory of planned behavior and the structure equation model and conducted a questionnaire survey with 258 respondents for analyzing the sustainable behaviors of private sectors. Results indicated that behavioral attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm interact significantly. They have direct positive effects on behavioral intention and then indirectly influence actual behavior through this intention. Actual sustainable behaviors of private sectors have significantly positive effects on the sustainable development of cities. We offer theoretical and managerial implications for public and private sectors on the basis of the findings to ensure and promote the sustainability performances of PTI projects. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The term ‘Afrophobia’, implying fear of the African, has come to mean the hatred of the African other, and is increasingly being used in the literature and popular media to describe the negative attitudes of black South Africans towards African immigrants. These negative attitudes towards other Africans are in contrast to the more positive attitudes towards white immigrants from Europe and America. This emerging literature also suggests that black South Africans have more positive attitudes towards black foreigners with whom they share a language. This article uses data from the 2013 Social Attitudes Survey to assess the evidence for Afrophobia, with further analysis of gender and ethnicity. The results suggest that the term Afrophobia does not usefully describe black South Africans’ attitudes towards African immigrants. This article argues that South Africans have different attitudes towards immigrants from different countries. Also, the relationship between black South Africans’ attitudes and the immigrants’ ethnicity was not a straightforward one. Some immigrant groups that spoke a ‘South African language’ were among the black foreigners most disliked by those black South Africans with whom they shared a language. The study suggests the need for a more detailed and nuanced analysis of attitudes that understands the heterogeneous nature of black South Africans (and African immigrants) and goes beyond generalising terms such as ‘Afrophobia’ and ‘ethnic affinity’, which, based on the evidence, may be of limited use in understanding why some African immigrants are more disliked than others. © 2018 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.

AB  - Since the concept of “cultural confidence” was officially proposed by Chinese president Xi Jinping, there have been intensive social media discussions on how to carry forward Chinese cultural traditions. This article draws on the frameworks of intertextuality and hypermodality, and investigates Chinese social media users’ responses to the government’s advocacy of the promotion of cultural confidence. Using the method of critical discourse analysis, this study examines relevant posts on Sina Weibo in order to investigate the textual and semiotic realisations of different viewpoints about cultural confidence and to reveal the public opinions communicated on this social networking platform. The intertextual and hypermodal resources of social media communication present multiple voices representing Chinese netizens’ attitudes toward the government’s policy. © 2018, © 2018 Unisa Press.

AB  - The free press performs essential democratic functions, but widespread negative attitudes toward the press threaten its legitimacy and effectiveness as a check on formal institutions. In order to combat these attitudes, media organizations must understand who holds them and why. A survey-based study of U.S. adults (N = 2052) focuses on associations between perceptions of the news media industry as a threat to political performance and a range of politically oriented behaviors (i.e. news media exposure, political talk, political participation). Analyses reveal a series of non-monotonic relationships. Group differences between those who hold the most extreme views concerning news-media-as-threat are also explored. The opposing groups are distinct in some important ways (e.g. ideology, race), but are also found to be surprisingly similar (e.g. income, education, gender, news media exposure). The results suggest new strategies for maintaining and restoring confidence in media organizations. © 2018, © 2018 National Communication Association.

AB  - School interventions to address sexual orientation discrimination can be important tools for fostering inclusive school climate, and improving student wellbeing. In this study, we empirically evaluated a film-based intervention, Out in Schools, designed to reduce sexual orientation prejudice and foster inclusive school attitudes. Our evaluation mapped data about Out in Schools presentations onto student data from the random cluster-stratified, province-wide 2013 British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (BCAHS) as well as potential confounding variables of Gay-Straight Alliance clubs (GSAs) and inclusive school policies. Outcome measures included past year sexual orientation discrimination, bullying, suicidal ideation, and school connectedness among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual (HET) students in grades 8 through 12 (ages 13 to 18; unweighted N = 21,075, weighted/scaled N = 184,821). Analyses used complex samples logistic regression, adjusted for sample design, conducted separately by gender and orientation. We found Out in Schools presentations were associated with reduced odds of LGB students experiencing discrimination, and both LGB and HET girl students being bullied or considering suicide, and increased levels of school connectedness, even after controlling for GSAs and policies. Out in Schools appears to have an additive contribution to reducing orientation prejudice and improving LGB and heterosexual student wellbeing within schools. © 2018, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims at exploring how conservative and liberal newspapers in South Korea framed PyeongChang 2018 directly. Our research questions addressed four points: first, different attitudes of conservative and liberal newspapers in the PyeongChang news reporting; second, their success and failure in influencing public opinion; third, South Koreans' perceptions on PyeongChang 2018; and fourth, South Korean public reliance on the newspapers. To investigate the framing differences, we employed a big data analytic method (automated semantic network analysis) with NodeXL (analytic software). Conclusively, we were able to find out four main findings. First, the conservative media showed pessimistic attitudes to the Olympics, and the liberal media did conversely. Second, despite the conservative media's resourcefulness, they could not succeed in influencing public opinion. Third, the conservative media perceived the Olympics as an undesirable event, but the liberal media did the Olympics as a significant event for further peace promotion. Fourth, the conservative media's framings did not considerably influence upon the public opinion. As a conclusion, the public are no longer passive recipients of the messages from the media. Instead, they tend to selectively accept the information from the media based on 'collective intelligence'. This trend provides a significant implication for enhancing the sustainability of the media environment in South Korea. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The hegemonic framing of the ‘Greek crisis’, launched by leading liberal and conservative politicians in the European Union (EU) and elsewhere and followed by mass media, reflected deep Western racial prejudices towards the periphery, and stressed typical bourgeois values affirming hard work, while publicly asserting regimes of entitlement to citizenship, welfare and consumption. The article presents a class-oriented analysis of the ‘Greek crisis’ discursive construction in North-Western European media, by studying articles published between 2010 and 2015 in four newspapers from Germany and Denmark. The analysis shows that, along with cultural ones, upper/middle-class biases are publicly expressed through articulations of ridicule, contempt and resentment, three interrelated ‘affective modalities’ connected to essentialist binary constructions of the (Western/European) self and the (non-Western/European) Other. Thus, the bourgeois ideology is crucial in reproducing depoliticized frames of economic crisis, to pursue neoliberal crisis-reforms (such as various regimes of austerity and labour deregulation). The production and affirmation of middle-class subjectivities, is crucial for the organic advance of neoliberal reforms in society, while denying the advancing of working–class identifications and solidarities in the highly uncertain times of today. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - An analysis spanning 10 years of news reports about Muslims and Islam in Chinese state news media (N = 15,427) demonstrates that Chinese news reports project an overall negative view of Muslims. An implicit association test performed in the non-Muslim Chinese population (N = 1479) reveals negative stereotypes of Muslims. In addition, a survey of Chinese Muslims (N = 384) shows that they perceive negative coverage of Muslims and Islam in Chinese media, and that real-life discrimination might be a consequence of such negative stereotyping. This study reveals that (1) there is an overall negative framing of news coverage of Muslims and Islam; (2) non-Muslim Chinese hold a negative stereotype of Muslims and Islam; (3) Chinese Muslims are cognizant of a negative media portrayal of Islam and of themselves; and (4) some Muslim Chinese experience discrimination in their daily lives. The present study contributes to the literature on global Islamophobia, a phenomenon that is understudied in China. © 2018, © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2018.

AB  - This study maps, characterizes, and conceptualizes the media discourse and coverage of non-governmental organization–school interactions within public education in Israel, while depicting the evolving dynamics and framing of this ever prominent phenomenon. The authors employed two complementary methodologies for the analysis: critical discourse analysis and framing theory. Specifically, this study pinpoints how neo-liberal notions are used and communicated to the public, and what role different newspapers play in framing those interactions and in helping to shape public opinion regarding the new engagements between schools and non-governmental organizations. The authors depict the ways in which school–non-governmental organization interactions are presented and framed to popular and elite audiences, and discuss the possible implications of their findings in light of the growing prominence of external entities in public schooling. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - We analyze more than 3,000,000 Twitter, 800,000 Instagram, and 50,000 Tumblr posts concerning a single major in-real-life event, Super Bowl XLIX, to determine attitude. We consider three event phases (Pre, During, and Post). Findings show link-based recommendations and undirected broadcast patterns positively correlate with attitude in the Pre and Post phases, respectively. The usage of these specific features highlights the differing information needs of viewers during these phases, specifically the sharing of information in the Pre phase and the sharing of opinions in the Post phase. The volume of postings indicates a negative attitude for all social media platforms, demonstrating that adverse information is more likely to be shared than positive information; this finding contradicts prior findings. This second screens phenomenon research is important in identifying the sharing information on multiple social media platforms during an in real life event. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In this work, we study the task of predicting the closing price of the following day of a stock, based on technical analysis, news articles and public opinions. The intuition of this study lies in the fact that technical analysis contains information about the event, but not the cause of the change, while data like news articles and public opinions may be interpreted as a cause. The paper uses time series analysis techniques such as Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW) to study the existence of a relation between price data and textual information, either from news or social media. Pattern matching techniques from time series data are also incorporated, in order to experimentally validate potential correlations of price and textual information within given time periods. The ultimate goal is to create a forecasting model that exploits the previously discovered patterns in order to augment the forecasting accuracy. Results obtained from the experimental phase are promising. The performance of the classifier shows clear signs of improvement and robustness within the time periods where patterns between stock price and the textual information have been identified, compared to the periods where patterns did not exist. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - According to cultural cognition theory, individuals hold opinions about politically contested issues like climate change that are consistent with their “cultural way of life,” conforming their opinions to how they think society should be organized and to what they perceive are the attitudes of their cultural peers. Yet despite dozens of cultural cognition studies, none have directly examined the role of the news media in facilitating these differential interpretations. To address this gap, drawing on a national survey of US adults administered in 2015, we statistically modeled the cultural cognition process in relation to news choices and media effects on public attitudes about climate change. Individuals possessing strongly held cultural worldviews, our findings show, not only choose news outlets where they expect to find culturally congruent arguments about climate change, but they also selectively process the arguments they encounter. Overall, our study demonstrates the substantial role that cultural cognition in combination with news media choices play in contributing to opinion polarization on climate change and other politicized science topics. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The notion that the media’s principal role regarding public opinion is reinforcement of pre-existing attitudes – and that this idea is relative inconsequential politically – is pervasive, across many political and social science sub-disciplines, and in non-academic commentary. This article comprehensively challenges the evidential and theoretical underpinnings of this thesis, drawing on a wealth of contemporary survey data and media coverage research, across a range of issues, including climate change, Brexit, immigration, the economy and benefit fraud. It also argues that ‘reinforcement’ is an important and consequential power, and that the processes involved have significant implications for public misperception of salient political issues. It makes the case that the media create attitudinal uncertainty, and can have pervasive but subtle influences on political attitudes, particularly when there are persistent patterns of coverage across a range of media. But also that in contexts like particularly close political contests, such influences can be decidedly consequential. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: Democratic governance requires that policy outcomes and public demand for policy be linked. While studies have shown empirical support for such a relationship in various policy domains, empirical evidence also indicates that the public is relatively unaware of policy outputs. This raises a puzzle: Why do policy outputs influence public attitudes if the public knows little about them?. Methods: This study seeks to address this paradox by examining the conditioning role of media coverage. We rely on data derived from the Policy Agendas Project in the United States, allowing us to analyze the relationship between policy outcomes, public preferences, and newspaper content across a long span of time (1972–2007). Results: Our results indicate that public policy preferences respond to policy outputs, and that this relationship is strengthened by greater media attention to a policy area. Importantly, our findings also indicate that without media attention to a policy area, there is no direct effect of policy outputs on public demand for policy. Conclusions: Media coverage appears to be a key factor for public responsiveness to occur. In the absence of policy coverage by the media, public responsiveness to policy outputs is greatly reduced. © 2018 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - The main objective of the article is to conduct a critical media discourse analysis as presented in the Polish and international editions of the “Newsweek” magazine in the years 2001–2006 and 2012–2016; the subject of which was climate change. The introduction provides the definitions of the key terms, such as: the greenhouse effect and critical discourse analysis (CDA). The theoretical part presents the most important assumptions of the CDA and presents a characteristic of the weekly. The results of the conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis partially lead to varying conclusions. Based on the CDA, the hypothesis was assumed that more attention was provided to climate change in the international (English) edition of “Newsweek”, than in the Polish-language edition. Rejected in turn was the hypothesis, according to which, more importance to climate change and their repercussions was provided in the discourse within the last 5 years of publication of the weekly than in the discourse from the years 2001–2006. As a result of comparison of both discourses, the disturbing fact that media discourse did not present and encourage among the readers an active stance in favour of the climate was noticed. It is the task of this influential weekly, the message of which reaches many people, not only to provide knowledge and shape specific values or view, but also to encourage and popularise attitudes in favour of the climate. If man wants to continue to live on earth, then one of their goals is to modify the form of discourse by entities responsible for its form. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study analyses verbal aggression in cyberbullying against social workers in Israel. Given the particular nature of this type of aggressive behaviour, namely its repeated and public dimensions, the study focuses on the content of offensive messages. Drawing on examples from multiple anti-social workers’ weblogs and Facebook pages, the study employs constructionist social problems methodology in order to extract the logical structure of anti-social workers’ discourse as claims-making activity. The analysis demonstrates that, far from constituting isolated or momentary outbursts of anger or frustration, cyberbullying against social workers contains messages which share similarities in content and style, comprise a persistent set of claims against social workers and employ rhetorical means in order to enhance public support. The article holds that understanding the specificity and content of offensive messages against social workers in new-media saturated societies is crucial for understanding current shifts in social workers’ conflict environment and the formation of public opinion concerning social workers and social services. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - During 2015, New South Wales (N.S.W), Australia experienced an unprecedented spike in human-shark interactions. These interactions saw the escalation of public anxieties surrounding water safety and the implementation of the state's $16 m Shark Management Strategy. Of the 14 human-shark interactions that occurred in N.S.W, eight were recorded on the state's North Coast. The interactions ignited considerable public debate, which sought to explain the spike in interactions and how to best manage the risk of human-shark interaction. This controversy was documented by the media. This study takes its lead from McCagh et. al (2015) to examine the media's reporting of public and political response to human-shark interactions in N.S.W. Discourse analysis was used to investigate two newspaper's reportage of human-shark interactions on the North Coast. This paper outlines that the discourse used by the media examined was not fear-laden, sensationalized or emotive, which previous studies have emphasized. It highlights the importance of investigating local media as means of investigating public and political response to environmental issues. The W.A shark cull seems to be a turning point in public and political attitudes towards shark management. The N.S.W government did not offer lethal or seemingly knee-jerk policy, but insisted on the investigation of non-lethal, scientifically and conservationally focused management. The N.S.W government appeared to be successful in consulting the local community and delivering policy that reflects the values and interests of the North Coast public. Our research reflects Neff & Wynter's (2018a) suggestion that the 'save the sharks’ movement has indeed arrived. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The nature of media image, through either traditional or social media, may have an influence on public acceptance of energy technologies. The potential impact on decision-making can make media image a factor for technology market deployment, similar to technical, legal, and economic factors. Public acceptance tends to be shaped by how technologies are presented in the media. This study compares and analyses the media image of various power production technologies. Editorial and social media are analysed by using the M-Adaptive tool for media monitoring to obtain the media sentiment. The analysis is rather broad, including three million social media platforms and various news outlets in many regions and covering an enormous number of data points, from which this study has selected over 250,000 for further analysis with the help of artificial intelligence. The results indicate that public sentiment towards power production technologies varies among different technologies, and between editorial publications and social media. Editorial content is usually constructed by using news frames, whereas social media includes more emotional content from single users. A potential chain from media image to energy technology market deployment is suggested. The findings support the notion of social media having an increasing role in shaping public opinion, which may need to be acknowledged to a larger extent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The new reality of networked publics on social media calls for crisis communication practitioners and researchers to understand the narratives generated by publics on social media during organizational crises. As social media publics possess diverse, unique characteristics and communicative needs during a crisis, they form interpretative communities and co-create various symbolic interpretations of the crisis. Extending the public-centric and narrative perspective to the context of social media crises, we examined what crisis narratives were constructed by social media publics (i.e., multiplicity) and how these narratives changed by crisis stages (i.e., dynamics). Using topic modelling based on large-scale Twitter data of the Chipotle E. coli crisis (N = 40,610), we identified ten narratives subsumed under two themes (i.e., sharing-based and conversation-based) based on publics’ social constructions of their perceived risks and crisis experience. On the one hand, sharing-based narratives, heavily impacted by publics’ shared media coverage, reflected media crisis narratives and salient risk perceptions aligning with the news agenda. On the other hand, conversation-based narratives, fueled by publics’ opinion expression and emotional venting, demonstrated publics’ interpretations of their experience with the organization in the crisis with less salient but more diversified risk perceptions. Crisis managers are recommended to produce and deliver compelling narratives resonating with different groups of social media publics during crises. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Through this study, we shed new light on a key line of inquiry for criminologists: the way the media influence the public's understanding of crime and justice. We argue for expanding the lens of studies on the media's construction of crime, moving away from one-dimensional reactions to crime to an integrated set of frames about crime and justice policy while considering the potential influence of a diverse array of media forms and content. Most critically, this social construction process must be placed in context, specifically, the racial composition in which people consume media. By using two nationally representative surveys matched with contextual data, we identify two forms of media consumption that seem important to understandings of crime: local television news and TV crime dramas. Interestingly, local news seems more important than national news even to perceptions of national crime trends, whereas news consumed over the Internet is not relevant, nor are 24-hour cable news channels once political views are taken into account. Television news viewers are also more likely to support tougher crime policies. Importantly, context matters: The influence of television news and crime dramas on perceptions of crime is strongest among White respondents who live near larger numbers of Black neighbors. © 2018 American Society of Criminology

AB  - Media framing of an event can have a significant impact on both reader response and public opinion. Through an examination of the deadliest gang-related murder to ever occur in British Columbia, the current study extends previous research by analyzing the influence of victim characteristics on the development of a problem frame. We analyze all newspaper articles published in the Vancouver Sun mentioning at least one of the murder victims between October 19, 2007, and December 31, 2016 (N = 210). Results suggest that journalists use a number of techniques when creating a problem frame, including victim differentiation, purposeful inclusion of sources, and use of specific language. We argue that the extensive coverage of the murders provided an opportunity for the media to develop a problem frame that dichotomized victims, capitalized on societal fear of crime, and, consequently, affected calls for policy change. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - With the rapid development of social media, fluctuations in the price of vegetables are passed on to the people through the Internet in real time, which will certainly attract widespread attention in China. Therefore, Public opinion in social media is regarded as a latent factor contributing to market fluctuation. To predict the vegetable price fluctuation in China's market, a hybrid prediction model combining convolution neural network with corpora is constructed. Although a direct causality test shows the uncertainty between the vegetable price and public opinion in social media, strong causality is found after removing the seasonal effect of price. This shows that the spread of public opinion through the Internet can strengthen the link between vegetable price changes and external events by affecting the expectations of market traders. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Robots are increasingly discussed in academic literature as well as the popular media since they are becoming more usual in industry. The increased use of robots will meet with practical issues with regards to adoption in industry as well as resistance from customers and those working in the industry. This work explores data from a 2016–2017 survey of Russian consumers to determine how young Russian adults perceive the use of robots in hotels, showing which service-oriented tasks that Russian consumers find to be the most agreeable to be done by robots and which ones they are more likely to want humans to continue doing. The findings reveal that those who are most supportive of having robots in hotels tend to be Muscovites, males, and those already supportive of the use of service industries in general. In addition, there are noteworthy differences in how males and females perceive of the acceptability of different types of tasks that robots may do in hotels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article examines discourses on immigrants and immigration in local media by analysing texts from newspapers in three rural districts of Norway. It finds that articulations expressing appreciation of immigration dominated. There was a hegemonic discourse on the economic necessity of immigration. Immigrants were discussed as taking two particularly appreciated roles in society: workers, and participants in local civic and cultural life. When discussed as refugees/asylum-seekers and Muslims, they were more prone to be rhetorically connected to economic burdens, security threats, and irreconcilable cultural differences. Case differences correlated with differing editorial philosophies regarding what statements about minorities are acceptable or desirable to print. Also, with whether or not districts’ municipal self-representation material underscored the importance of immigration and multiculturalism. The latter is relatable to specifics of local history. Larger numbers of asylum-seekers settled in local reception centres were, to some extent, associated with larger numbers of immigration-critical texts. Case differences did not correlate with voting differences, or local differences in numbers of immigrants. The global economic crisis did not noticeably affect discursive tendencies. A right-wing terrorist attack in 2011 led to a confrontation with immigration-critics in the one newspaper that had earlier carried critical articulations to any notable extent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The popularity of televised political debates is growing, attracting millions of viewers. However, evidence that such debates can shift voters’ attitudes is mixed and the impact on voters’ preference is also mixed. In addition, the evidence comes mostly from presidential elections in the United States and almost exclusively from established democracies. A call for comparative research in new democracies has been made several times. Our research answers the call and contributes to this debate by comparing two experimental studies based on first-order national elections and second-order European Parliament elections in Slovakia. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a study has been performed in a post-communist EU country. We employed a pre-test/ post-test experimental design in a controlled environment with participants randomly assigned to both groups. The results show that debate exposure has a stronger effect on opinions about candidates’ leadership skills, credibility, and economic competence if the candidates were previously unknown. Familiarity with the candidates and preexisting preferences also function as a block to preference change. Almost all of our findings are in line with previous research originating from Western contexts. Therefore, we conclude that the causal mechanism linking debate exposure to voters’ preference and attitudes in the post-communist context is similar to that in Western countries with long-term democratic traditions. © 2018 Sage Publications.

AB  - Since 9/11, entertainment media has focused on depictions of terrorism and counterterrorism. How do dramatic depictions of counterterrorism practices—specifically torture—affect public opinion and policy? Using a mixed within-subjects and between-subjects experimental design, we examine how framing affects support for torture. Participants (n = 150) were randomly assigned to a condition for dramatic depictions showing torture as (a) effective, (b) ineffective, or (c) not present (control). Participants who saw torture as effective increased their stated support for it. Participants who saw torture—regardless of whether or not it was effective—were more likely to sign a petition on torture. We discuss the policy implications of our findings on how framing affects opinion and action regarding torture. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This study investigates how Burmese refugees were framed by Fort Wayne’s The Journal Gazette located in one of Indiana’s cities where refugee resettlement has taken place over the last two decades. We analyzed 335 stories and 286 accompanying images to identify salient textual and visual frames. Results show that the human interest and attribution of responsibility were most salient textual frames, while the visual frame of exotic was dominant. Feature stories were more likely to have a human interest frame and, if an image is included, to reflect the visual frame of Burmese as being exotic. As a global refugee crisis continues to unfold, this study presents implications for how media coverage of future refugees in the United States will evolve based on public opinion. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Analyses of racist discourse have often involved data from contexts concerning issues of human mobility. A great deal of this literature points to the extent to which people draw on the tropes of liberalism to justify social exclusion, and in particular to warrant negative evaluations of outgroups. Using media data from political debates involving the radical right-wing U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) in the U.K. General Election campaign of 2015, the present article highlights a different rhetorical strategy by which exclusion can be warranted by speakers arguing for a reduction in immigration. This novel strategy explicitly avoids any negative characterization of outgroups, and instead advocates the individualization of immigration decisions. This is exemplified in UKIP's policy of basing the United Kingdom's approach to immigration on an "Australian-style points-based system." This was invoked by UKIP representatives in the debates as a straightforward "off-the-shelf" system that would enable the U.K. to "take back control" of immigration, while ensuring that immigration decisions were based on individual merit rather than on group membership. As such, the points system could also be invoked specifically to anticipate and counter accusations of racism and/or xenophobia. The findings are discussed in relation to the tacit ideological assumptions underpinning UKIP's policy, specifically around psychologization, the reliance on an acultural version of Australia, and the tacit use of categorical accounting. © 2017 American Psychological Association.

AB  - In Australia since about the turn of the millennium, discrimination against Muslims has been increasingly normalized, made respectable, and presented as prudent precaution against violent extremism. Vilification of Muslims has posed as defending 'Australian values' against those who will not integrate. Liberal political leaders and press leader-writers who formerly espoused cultural pluralism now routinely hold up as inimical the Muslim folk devil by whose otherness the boundaries of acceptability of the national culture may be marked out and policed. The Muslim Other is positioned not only as culturally incommensurate, but dangerously so: dishonest, criminally inclined, violent, misogynist, homophobic, backward, uncivilized. On the far right, extremist nationalist organizations incite racist hatred under cover of this rhetoric, often cloaked as reasonable common sense. This paper undertakes an ideology analysis of political and media discussion, and examines the forms of social control that they advance and sustain. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, users have increasingly focused on the privacy of social networking sites (SNS); users have reduced their self-disclosure intention. To attract users, SNS rely on active platforms that collect accurate user information, even though that information is supposed to be private. SNS marketers must understand the key elements for sustainable operation. This study aims to understand the influence of motivation (extrinsic and intrinsic) and self-disclosure on SNS through soft computing theories. First, based on a survey of 1108 users of SNS, this study used a dominance-based rough set approach to determine decision rules for self-disclosure intention on SNS. In addition, based on 11 social networking industry experts' perspectives, this study validated the influence between the motivation attributes by using Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). In this paper, the decision rules of users' self-disclosure preference are presented, and the influences between motivation attributes are graphically depicted as a flow network graph. These findings can assist in addressing real-world decision problems, and can aid SNS marketers in anticipating, evaluating, and acting in accord with the self-disclosure motivations of SNS users. In this paper, practical and research implications are offered. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - One of the key democratic functions of the media is to provide people with the kind of information they need to be free and self-governing. This is equally important when it comes to the coverage of opinion polls. Thus far, there is however only limited research on the quality of the media’s coverage of opinion polls, including factors that might help to explain variation in the quality of opinion poll coverage. Against this background, the purpose of this study is (1) to investigate the extent to which news media take statistical uncertainties into account when covering opinion polls and making causal interpretations based on opinion polls, and (2) to explore some factors that might help to explain variation in the quality of opinion poll coverage. Among other things, the results show that journalists very often fail to take statistical uncertainties into account and that they, in about half of the cases, provide explanations for changes that are within the margin of error. The results also show that the quality of opinion poll coverage varies between different types of media organizations and between election campaigns and off-election periods. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Over 60% of households (HHs) in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) consume alcohol. These HHs were more likely to report illnesses, relationship problems, and behavioral problems with children. This study set out to determine what proportion of HHs were willing to support changes in specific policies, laws and regulations in a national alcohol campaign. Methods: A cross-sectional convenience sample of HHs were surveyed from a random sample of enumeration districts (ED) in T&T. An interviewer-applied, field pre-tested de novo questionnaire had 5 domains and was developed over 1 1/2 years after an extensive literature review and consultation. Many of the WHO 'best buys' recommendations were included. Results: One thousand six hundred ninety-five HHs (from 53 ED) responded from a total of 1837 HHs approached (response rate 92%). In a national campaign the following proportions of HHs would support: setting the legal age for drinking at 21 years (82.4%); restricting or banning alcohol advertising on TV and other media (73.1% and 54.4% respectively); banning all alcohol advertising at sports and cultural events (64.8%); banning radio stations playing songs with reference to alcohol use (71.3%); holding sellers of alcohol responsible for the amount of alcohol sold (79.5%); advocating that proof of age to be shown by persons buying alcohol (87.4%); placing more prominent warning labels on products displaying alcohol content (87.2%); placing more prominent warning labels on products showing harmful effects (88.5%); increasing taxes on alcohol sales (87.7%). Less than 50% of HH supported restrictions in density of outlets and reduction in opening times for alcohol outlets. Conclusions: Many HHs in T&T are willing to support changes in policies around alcohol, including many of the policies shown by the WHO to be effective in reducing the harmful consumption of alcohol. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Labour came to power in 1997 and immediately transferred many features of its party political news management style into government, overseeing the departure of most of the civil service communications leadership within two years, and developing the media management role of politically appointed special advisers. The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the changes in custom and practice that operated behind the scenes in government communications between 1997 and 2015, asking to what extent such changes challenge public trust in government in a liberal democracy. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a longitudinal, qualitative approach through in-depth interviews with former civil servants, journalists and special advisers, together with documentary and archival evidence. The data were analysed thematically through the text-processing software, NVivo. Findings: The paper finds that although the controversy over the 2002 dossier on Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction was an extraordinary episode, the creative approach to news management that characterised this case still operates within UK Government communications: the bypassing of civil servants, a partial approach to the facts, selective briefing of favoured journalists, a lack of due process in the management of information and a disregard for the letter and spirit of propriety codes. This has implications for public trust and confidence in the workings of liberal democracy. Originality/value: The study adopts a mediatisation approach to the study of public relations, using the concept of the “cross field” to demonstrate how PR professionals share media management responsibilities with a number of different promotional actors. PR professionals in government must therefore navigate between the hidden, competitive and demanding worlds of politics, the media and bureaucracy, working with journalists, politicians and political operatives to craft the narratives that seek to drive public opinion. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Examinations of the relationship between attitudes about police and news media have regularly been undertaken since the Rodney King incident in 1991. Although cultivation theory, which argues greater news consumption will result in adoption of views of policing provided in the news, offers an appropriate theoretical framework for media studies of this kind, this body of research has largely lacked theoretical grounding. This study tests underlying premises of cultivation regarding the roles of overall news consumption, consumption of different types of news mediums, and exposure to negative news coverage in determining public perceptions of common policing outcomes. It also tests the mostly neglected area of how audiences perceive news they are consuming by considering how fair they deem the news portrayal of police to be. Using a sample of residents from a mid-sized city in California, results indicate consumption of Internet news is related to negative attitudes about police and exposure to negative news about police impacts perceptions, but only if the coverage is seen as fair. Implications for future research and advancement of cultivation as a theoretical framework in this area are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - This research examines how fake identities on social media create and sustain antagonistic and racist discourses. It does so by analysing 11 Danish Facebook pages, disguised as Muslim extremists living in Denmark, conspiring to kill and rape Danish citizens. It explores how anonymous content producers utilise Facebook’s socio-technical characteristics to construct, what we propose to term as, platformed antagonism. This term refers to socio-technical and discursive practices that produce new modes of antagonistic relations on social media platforms. Through a discourse-theoretical analysis of posts, images, ‘about’ sections and user comments on the studied Facebook pages, the article highlights how antagonism between ethno-cultural identities is produced on social media through fictitious social media accounts, prompting thousands of user reactions. These findings enhance our current understanding of how antagonism and racism are constructed and amplified within social media environments. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This study emerged from an incidental, and somewhat surprising, finding that 15 percent of working journalists who attend training on improving the ways that mainstream new media report stories about Islam and Muslims, wrongly associated Sikhism with Islam. We wondered if this was indicative of the Australian population and, through a random stratified survey of the Australian population, found that it was. The question about the extent to which populations wrongly associate Sikhism with Islam is an important one. In Australia, Muslims and Sikhs are minorities. Ignorance of Islam and its religious diversity coupled with ignorance of Muslims and their ethnic and cultural diversity underpins the intolerance of Islam in the West and the concomitant animus directed at Muslims. Intolerance and violence directed at Muslims and people wrongly assumed to be Muslims (such as Sikhs) increased after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 (9/11). This speaks to religious literacy, the treatment of religious minorities and raises important questions around educating various publics (including the news media) about both Islam and Sikhism. It also speaks to the role of the mainstream news media in perpetuating Islamophobia, and its detrimental flow-on effects to Muslims and Sikhs. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial research has shown that perceived exposure can influence symptom reporting, regardless of actual exposure. The impact of this phenomenon on the interpretation of results from epidemiological research on environmental determinants of symptoms is unclear. Objective: Our aim was to compare associations between modeled exposures, the perceived level of these exposures and reported symptoms (non-specific symptoms, sleep disturbances, and respiratory symptoms) for three different environmental exposures (radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), noise, and air pollution). These environmental exposures vary in the degree to which they can be sensorially observed. Methods: Participant characteristics, perceived exposures, and self-reported health were assessed with a baseline (n = 14,829, 2011/2012) and follow-up (n = 7905, 2015) questionnaire in the Dutch population-based Occupational and Environmental Health Cohort (AMIGO). Environmental exposures were estimated at the home address using spatial models. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models were used to examine the associations between modeled and perceived exposures, and reported symptoms. Results: The extent to which exposure sources could be observed by participants likely influenced correlations between modeled and perceived exposure as correlations were moderate for air pollution (rSp = 0.34) and noise (rSp = 0.40), but less so for RF-EMF (rSp = 0.11). Perceived exposures were consistently associated with increased symptom scores (respiratory, sleep, non-specific). Modeled exposures, except RF-EMF, were associated with increased symptom scores, but these associations disappeared or strongly diminished when accounted for perceived exposure in the analyses. Discussion: Perceived exposure has an important role in symptom reporting. When environmental determinants of symptoms are studied without acknowledging the potential role of both modeled and perceived exposures, there is a risk of bias in health risk assessment. However, the etiological role of exposure perceptions in relation to symptom reporting requires further research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Islamophobia is the unfounded hostility against Muslims. While anti-Muslim feelings have been explored from many perspectives and in different settings, Internet-based Islamophobia remains under-researched. What are the characteristics of online Islamophobia? What are the differences (if any) between online and offline anti-Muslim narratives? This article seeks to answer these questions through a qualitative analysis of tweets written in the aftermath of the 2016 British referendum on European Union membership (also known as “Brexit”), which was followed by a surge of Islamophobic episodes. The analysis of the tweets suggests that online Islamophobia largely enhances offline anti-Islam discourses, involving narratives that frame Muslims as violent, backward, and unable to adapt to Western values. Islamophobic tweets also have some peculiar characteristics: they foster global networks, contain messages written by so-called “trolls” and “bots,” and contribute to the spreading of “fake news.” The article suggests that, in order to counteract online Islamophobia, it is important to take into account the networked connections among social media, news media platforms, and offline spaces. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - This paper investigates howfirm-level innovation and productivity affect the export propensity in manufacturing firms in seven Eastern European Union countries. With respect to innovation activities, we analyze the complementarity between pair-wise product, process and non-technological (organizational and marketing) innovations when the objective function is represented by the exporting probability of a firm. Analyzing CIS2008 data, we find that productivity always has a positive and significant impact on the exporting propensity of firms. Furthermore, complex innovative firms, when large in size and/or frommediumhigh-high technology sectors, can take advantage in terms of a higher attitude to export than non-innovators and simple innovators. By considering these results, governments have to introduce policies that can induce firms, especially small and medium ones, to implement complex innovations. This is fundamental in order to be more productive and more competitive. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The European economic crisis, the migratory crisis and the Brexit in the UK are the main causes of the increasing negative moods of the European Union citizens. The research offers a comparative analysis of pupils' and teachers' viewpoints on European citizenship and European identity in selected two Visegrad Group countries. The research held in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the research sample of 1,973 respondents shows that the Slovak pupils and their teachers have in most cases more positive attitudes towards European citizenship and European identity than Czech pupils and their teachers. The responding Slovak pupils are more proud of being citizens of the European Union, less skeptic of the EU's activities and believe in the future of the European Union. On the other hand, the Czech pupils and teachers are more proud of the membership of the Czech Republic in the EU, as well as of the Czech activities in the European Union. In this context, the authors point out that a more intensive education relating to the European citizenship and Europeanism could increase positive attitudes towards European identity and membership in the European Union. The European dimension of education is still up to date not only in the old member states of the European Union but also in the new ones or future member states. Citizenship education unifies several social fields and disciplines including education to Europeanism, environmental, global, media, multicultural, personal and social education, and education relating to democracy and constitutionality. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018

AB  - Some extreme weather events may be more likely to affect climate change beliefs than others, in part because schema individuals possess for different events could vary in encouraging such links. Using a representative sample of U.S. adults and geocoded National Weather Service data, we examine how a range of extreme weather event categories relate to climate change beliefs, and the degree to which individuals’ self-reported experiences are shaped by their political views across event types. For tornado, hurricane, and flood events, we find no link with beliefs. For polar vortex and drought events, we find that although self-reported experience is linked with climate beliefs, reporting of these experiences is influenced by political identity and partisan news exposure. These findings underscore a limited role for extreme weather experiences in climate beliefs, and show that events more open to interpretation, such as droughts and polar vortex disturbances, are most likely to be seen through a partisan lens. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - How is the air pollution issue in Delhi framed by the news media and narrated by nonprofit organizations? To study news media framing, we employed an inductive approach based on automated text coding of news coverage of the issue. To study nonprofit organization narrations, a deductive approach guided by the Narrative Policy Framework was used to focus on the stories told via online documents as found on nonprofit websites. The findings confirm existing theory and empirical research regarding the leading causes and effects of air pollution; however, perceptions are mixed regarding the government’s ability to implement policy. The combined deductive and inductive approaches provide a systematic and multi-method research study for understanding perceptions of air pollution in one of the largest cities in the world. The result is a depiction of the priorities that influence public opinions, political decisions, and eventually public policies. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Whether adored or ignored Jane Austen’s ironic narrative voice poses a challenge, at times amounting to a stumbling block, in the history of her reception. The present essay will discuss some selected samples of this voice and how it is interpreted in translations as well as film and television. The material for this discussion consists of two novels, Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park, their altogether seven screen adaptations, as well as five Norwegian translations of the first. This constellation will show that receivers of Austen’s texts struggle with similar challenges in grasping or rendering her ironic commentary, whether in a new language or a new medium. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The web video production company Pemberley Digital is most notable for their YouTube adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, the internet sensation The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Pemberley Digital specialises in the creation of transmedia adaptations of texts, with content stretching across a variety of platforms. However, their 2013-2014 adaptation of Emma, Emma Approved, is, by Pemberley Digital’s own admission, the company’s boldest experiment with the commodification potential of Jane Austen’s novels. Emma Approved played out over five platforms: video, blog posts, photographs, social media and music. After watching the videos, viewers are encouraged to click on links to purchase the clothes worn, or technological devices used by, the characters, incorporating product placement and advertorial into the text of Emma Approved. Pemberley Digital’s unique transmedia adaptation is a distinctly twenty-first century manifestation of Jane Austen’s afterlife: one that privileges a multi-dimensional, interactive “bite-sized” experience of texts, and one that seeks to transform the cultural capital associated with Austen into profit. The texts are rendered malleable to a transmedia storytelling mode across multiple digital platforms. The Pemberley Digital productions of Pride and Prejudice and Emma speak to the twentyand twenty-first century’s impulse to turn Jane Austen into a marketable, profitable commodity. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - South Africa is faced with water scarcity crisis. In recent years, conservation campaigns have emerged to encourage citizens in developing a social ethic of water conservation essential in creating sustainability of resource use. The conservation campaigns are disseminated using conventional media often with messages couched in English language with the attendant highfalutin jargon which obfuscates and limits reach and effectiveness. To this end, negative attitudes towards water resources persist. Using the parallel mixed methods approach, this paper examines the potency of Folk Theatre in creating awareness about water issues as well as in alleviating and advocating attitudinal and behavioural changes against the backdrop of a worsening water crisis. Based on data on a rural community, Folk Theatre is found to be effective in raising awareness and educating rural folks about water issues and breaking down misconceptions about water conservation. In conclusion, Folk Theatre offers a sustainable alternative approach to communicating water conservation in rural South Africa. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The intervention of feminist activists and scholars in the last three decades has led not only to far greater sensitization of public attitudes concerning gender but also a series of laws and regulations to promote greater gender justice. However, these effects seem to be more prominent at the higher levels of the bureaucracy, judiciary, higher education and the English-language media than among the popularly mobilized opinion in the regions. This essay examines this disparity in terms of a distinction between the history of the Indian nation-state and the collective consciousness of the people-nation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Based on the communication mediation model, the third-person effect hypothesis was integrated to analyze the influence of the exposure to South China Sea news on its perceived effects on the self and others. In addition, the influences of such exposure on online discussions and political attitudes were examined, specifically in relation to nationalism and government evaluation. The survey (N = 868) found that the respondents perceived a stronger media effect on others than on themselves, whereas exposure to traditional and news media exposure exhibited equivalent effects on the self and on others. Moreover, the perceived effects on oneself promoted online discussion and nationalism, whereas the perceived effects on others improved government evaluation. The findings of this study indicate that the effects of media exposure on nationalism and government evaluation are marginally mediated by perceived effects, online discussion, or both. © 2018, © 2018 The Centre for Chinese Media and Comparative Communication Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

AB  - When citizens believe the U.S. Supreme Court makes decisions in an insincere or politicized manner, their specific support for the institution can decline. The Court’s relative aversion to publicity means the media are the primary source of information about its decisions. We design a survey experiment that varies the type of coverage—game frame or principled. Game-frame coverage reduces agreement with and acceptance of the decision discussed. We then classify and analyze more than 1,000 transcripts of broadcast coverage of salient Court decisions from 1990–2010. Not only has game-frame coverage of the Court increased, but this coverage partially explains recent declines in specific support for the institution. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Shock events are often pivotal moments in geopolitics and objects of intense disagreement among conflicting parties. This paper examines the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 and the divergent blame storylines produced on Russian and Ukrainian television about the event. It then examines results of a question asking why MH17 crashed in a simultaneous survey conducted in December 2014 in six oblasts in Southeastern Ukraine, Crimea, and the de facto states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. An analysis of the surveys shows that blame attribution was driven more by television viewing habits than by any other factor. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper provides an insight into the methods that were adopted for the racial profiling of Muslims after 9/11; as suspected perpetrators of terrorism globally. This paper examines the history and origin of the word islamophobia, some phenomena that is effecting the stature and identity of Muslims worldwide. The purpose of this study is to analyze the tone, structure and themes presented by the print media prior to a terrorist activity, with the aim of finding out whether any inherent bias was visible or not. This paper explores the role of the international press in linking Islam and terrorism and highlights the effects of subtle print messages that can lead to racial profiling of Muslims and generation of Islamophobia. The data for this research is collected from the editorials in six leading international newspapers from 2014 to 2017, randomly creating strata of 10 major international terrorist activities. The researcher has analyzed editorials for a period of one month after the incident. Data is analyzed through event methodology and content analysis and after statistical interpretation provides the results and findings of the researcher. © 2018, University of Management and Technology.

AB  - Individuals who partake in video games are often regarded with prejudice. It is an activity that is perceived to be mainly related to senseless leisure and teenage entertainment. However, many diverse people make video games such an important part of their lives that they become passionately engaged in it. Video games and online video gaming offer the player immersive experiences unlike any other forms of media. A phenomenological and interpretive exploration is undertaken in order to gain a deeper understanding of the narratives of online gamers and their experiences of a sense of belonging to the associated online communities. Through the use of in-depth interviews, the article explores various aspects of the life stories of a group of eight South African university students. It attempts to show how online gaming has become a part of their lifeworlds. The aim of this article is to present the narratives of online gamers as rich and descriptive accounts that maintain the voices of the participants. Various aspects of the lifeworlds of online gamers are explored. Firstly, an exploration is undertaken to gain an understanding of what it means to be a gamer. It focuses on how a person can become involved with gaming and how it can evolve into something that a person is engaged with on a daily basis. Secondly, it explores how video games influence the perception of reality of gamers. Immersion in video games can transfer a player into an alternative reality and can take the focus away from the real world. This can lead to feelings of joy and excitement, but can also lead to escapism. Lastly, the article shifts attention towards how online video gamers experience online communities. Players can have positive experiences with random strangers online, but because of the anonymous nature of the online environment, it can also lead to negative and isolating experiences. © 2018 QSR.

AB  - Background: Social media have been increasingly adopted by health agencies to disseminate information, interact with the public, and understand public opinion. Among them, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the first US government health agencies to adopt social media during health emergencies and crisis. It had been active on Twitter during the 2016 Zika epidemic that caused 5168 domestic noncongenital cases in the United States. Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify the temporal variabilities in CDC's tweeting activities throughout the Zika epidemic, public engagement defined as retweeting and replying, and Zika case counts. It then compares the patterns of these 3 datasets to identify possible discrepancy among domestic Zika case counts, CDC's response on Twitter, and public engagement in this topic. Methods: All of the CDC-initiated tweets published in 2016 with corresponding retweets and replies were collected from 67 CDC-associated Twitter accounts. Both univariate and multivariate time series analyses were performed in each quarter of 2016 for domestic Zika case counts, CDC tweeting activities, and public engagement in the CDC-initiated tweets. Results: CDC sent out >84.0% (5130/6104) of its Zika tweets in the first quarter of 2016 when Zika case counts were low in the 50 US states and territories (only 560/5168, 10.8% cases and 662/38,885, 1.70% cases, respectively). While Zika case counts increased dramatically in the second and third quarters, CDC efforts on Twitter substantially decreased. The time series of public engagement in the CDC-initiated tweets generally differed among quarters and from that of original CDC tweets based on autoregressive integrated moving average model results. Both original CDC tweets and public engagement had the highest mutual information with Zika case counts in the second quarter. Furthermore, public engagement in the original CDC tweets was substantially correlated with and preceded actual Zika case counts. Conclusions: Considerable discrepancies existed among CDC's original tweets regarding Zika, public engagement in these tweets, and actual Zika epidemic. The patterns of these discrepancies also varied between different quarters in 2016. CDC was much more active in the early warning of Zika, especially in the first quarter of 2016. Public engagement in CDC's original tweets served as a more prominent predictor of actual Zika epidemic than the number of CDC's original tweets later in the year. © Shi Chen, Qian Xu, John Buchenberger, Arunkumar Bagavathi, Gabriel Fair, Samira Shaikh, Siddharth Krishnan.

AB  - The possibility of introducing the Controlled Human Infection Model of research into India is being discussed by some Indian scientists in order to develop biomedical technologies such as vaccines. CHIM studies involve the deliberate introduction of an infectious agent into a healthy person in order to observe the development and progression of the disease, or test potential treatments. This idea will be alarming to the Indian public who will demand the assurance that CHIM is needed and safe. Health communication is viewed by researchers as vital to getting communities on board in public health programmes. The role of the media, however, is to provide information and analysis that represents the public's interests, and enables the public to make informed decisions. The starting point for journalists will be the environment in which CHIM would be conducted in India: poor healthcare, poverty, vulnerabilities of various kinds, ethical violations, weak regulation, and industry's impunity. They will also consider that research agendas may be driven by a focus on technological solutions to complex problems, and promote unnecessary vaccines that subsidise the private sector vaccine industry. When talking to the media about its interest in conducting human challenge trials, the research community will have to be honest about its plans, transparent in its functioning, and also ready to admit the possibility that we should not introduce this technology in India.

AB  - Global threats, international terrorist groups and North Korea, paralyze political decisions by attacking and neutralizing the credibility of the main policy makers in the state and simultaneously manipulate the public opinion, which results in distrust and disconnection between each other. These threats use social media as their biggest core routine to conduct such attacks. This paper presents a series of processes and frameworks on how a commander should make a decision when performing a cyber psychological operation using social media. Based on the Endsley model, which is a situational awareness model, the paper compares the strengths and weaknesses of the three social media operations (IGMO, DeSMO, OSMO) performed by the military and proposes a guideline for performing an operation. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

AB  - Recent work has suggested that media reporting about the public’s policy preferences may be self-reinforcing, contributing to greater policy conformity. This article presents additional evidence in support of this theory and adds new detail about the conditionality of these effects. Results from two experiments are described in which respondents are presented with excerpted news stories containing varying polling information about six separate issues. Findings indicate that (a) exposure to such poll results can elicit differences in support for the issue by as much as 10–15 percentage points; (b) the magnitude of these effects varies systematically and inversely in relation to overall attitudinal intensity levels for each issue; and (c) the opinions of specific subgroups referenced in polls matter, producing larger or smaller effects depending on how salient the group is to receivers of the information. Taken together, these results underscore why news reporting about public attitudes deserves greater attention as an important factor in the policy process. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The study sheds light on the phenomenon of Polarization in the Arab World, whereby youths and adolescents are being recruited by radical groups, operating through social networks. There have been many recent examples of terrorist incidents that emphasize the seriousness of this phenomenon, taking place in many Arab and Western countries. The evidence confirmed that the young people who were caught in Clutches, inspired by intellectual radicals and terrorists, were subject of direct influence of individuals and groups promoting a culture of extremism through accounts on such social sites as Twitter, as well as YouTube and other forums that broadcast material of extremist nature. One of the reasons for the spread of this phenomenon is the increase of social media use among all age groups, yet the most affected and responsive categories are adolescents and young people. They are drawn by means of emotionally charged religious discourse urging them to break away from society, calls for the use of violence, and uphold symbols of extremism. The study is concerned with clarifying the importance of the role of the media due to its great impact on public opinion and communities, as well as providing guidance to young people, and drawing the attention of officials and decision makers. The study also emphasizes the need to observe and analyze the thinking patterns promoted by of the extremist ideology, detect the strategies used for advertising, in order to have access to how to confront this thought, so as to protect Arab youths. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - Background: Negative bias toward patients with obesity is an ethical challenge in patient care. Several interventions to mitigate medical students’ negative weight bias have been tried but none with an explicit focus on ethics. Here we describe first-year medical students’ attitudes toward obesity and our effort to improve their attitudes through an innovative ethics session embedded within the required course, “Obesity, Nutrition, and Behavior Change,” at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Methods: Precourse survey data were collected from 6 first-year cohorts (2012-2017). Before the ethics session, students take the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit weight bias. During the session, students discuss their classmates’ personal struggles with weight, beliefs about causes of obesity, and the IAT results. They also watch and discuss video clips from the TV show House depicting negative weight bias. In addition, the 2017 cohort was surveyed 4 months later to evaluate the impact of different components of the session on students’ self-reported attitudes. Results: All students responded to the precourse survey. Across cohorts, IAT results revealed that 70% of students held a thin preference, 18% were neutral and 12% held a fat preference. Forty-seven percent had personally struggled with weight loss. While most students thought obesity is a disease (89%) or behavioral (88%), 74% thought it results from ignorance, and 28% thought people with obesity are lazy. Among the 59 respondents to the follow-up survey, 30% reported improvement in their attitudes after the session. Over 40% thought it was useful to discuss students’ personal struggles with weight and the IAT and survey results, and over 70% thought the House video clips were useful. Conclusions: Medical students have negative attitudes about obesity that are consistent over time. Providing opportunities for students to discuss their personal experiences and beliefs about obesity within an ethics framework and using popular media as a basis for discussion might improve their attitudes toward obesity.

AB  - Objective: We wished to explore how UK national newspapers had covered the creation and operation of the Cancer Drugs Fund from 2010 to 2015. This was introduced to provide cancer patients in England with access to drugs not appraised or approved by the National Institute for health and Care Excellence. Design: We sought stories in nine newspapers from the Factiva database, and copied their salient details to a spreadsheet. They were categorised by whether they were supportive or critical of the Cancer Drugs Fund and their main arguments, which drugs they mentioned and for which cancers. Settings: Not applicable Participants: Not applicable Main outcome results: Press coverage was mainly very positive, arguing for the Cancer Drugs Fund's extension to Scotland and Wales, and a bigger budget, but neglecting the lack of patient benefit and the severe side effects that sometimes occurred. Leading this support was the Daily Mail, whose influence (measured by the product of number of stories and the paper's circulation) was almost greater than that of the other newspapers combined. Results: Press coverage was mainly very positive, arguing for the Cancer Drugs Fund’s extension to Scotland and Wales, and a bigger budget, but neglecting the lack of patient benefits and the severe side effects that sometimes occurred. Leading this support was the Daily Mail, whose influence (measured by the product of number of stories and the paper’s circulation) was almost greater than that of the other newspapers combined. Conclusions: Although there was some critical analysis of the Cancer Drugs Fund, our analysis shows that most press coverage was largely positive and unrepresentative in comparison with the lack of overall benefits to patients and society. It is likely that it contributed to the Cancer Drugs Fund’s continuation despite mounting evidence of its ineffectiveness. © 2018, The Royal Society of Medicine.

AB  - A succession of media scandals and policy arguments in the UK in recent years has been integral to the construction of a so-called ‘Muslim Problem’. Media and political attention paid to Muslims in British public life, across a vast and varied range of issues, suggests a social preoccupation that exceeds the security framing the ‘War on Terror’ once imposed. In this article, we develop and apply Slavoj Žižek’s Lacanian theory of ideology to produce an original conceptual and analytic framework centred on the social functions served by, as well as the co-constitution of, anxiety and fantasy. We then apply this framework to explore three scandals relating to child sexual exploitation, halal meat and education. We show that the representations of British Muslims that these scandals entail are best understood as ideological fantasies, mobilized to suture traumatic gaps and conceal contradictions in wider social practices around such issues. We argue that the unrelenting media and political focus on myriad aspects of British Muslims’ imagined lives is symptomatic of what Žižek calls an ‘unbearable anxiety’: Islamophobic ideological fantasies conjure a ‘conceptual Muslim’ to sidestep confrontation with the Lacanian ‘Real’ – antagonistic and anxiety-inducing structures and practices underpinning British society, of which we do not speak. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - During Hurricane María, individuals throughout the Caribbean uploaded video and photographs to social media, but as winds downed communication towers and electric lines, sharing stopped. Still, satellites orbiting high above Earth transmitted views of the massive hurricane. In the following weeks, the media bombarded viewers with scenes of devastated landscapes, people wading through waist-deep water, infrastructure shredded beyond recognition, apocalyptic desolation, and desperation. Media portrayals focused on a “powerless” people, literally without electrical power, further reduced into social, economic, and political powerlessness. This article combines ethnographic elicitation with cultural analysis to understand how images of trauma and suffering affect diverse audiences. Do these images compel viewers to fight for justice or do they desensitize them? Do they lead people toward feelings of pessimism, resignation, and cynicism? I explore how people's backgrounds and relationships to specific places inform the ways they are even able to look at, grapple with, and work through traumatic images. I demonstrate how long-term prejudice is imbedded into the media's imagery and representations of Hurricane María to show how associated governmental neglect exacerbates the trauma of disaster. Lastly, I engage with the place of responsibility and sorrow as I raise the question of how the specter of future natural disasters haunts the current state of devastation. © 2018 by the American Anthropological Association.

AB  - We show that entertainment-education reduces prejudice and does so more effectively than several established prejudice reduction methods. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to an educational television sitcom with diverse, yet relatable Arab/Muslim characters had lower scores on implicit and explicit measures of prejudice than participants exposed to a control sitcom featuring an all White cast. The prejudice reduction effect persisted 4 weeks after exposure. In Experiment 2, viewing of a 4-minute music video that portrayed Arabs/Muslims as relatable and likable resulted in a larger reduction in prejudice against Arabs/Muslims than two established prejudice reduction methods (imagined contact exercise and group malleability article), which produced no improvements. In both experiments, increased identification with target group members was associated with greater prejudice reduction. Entertainment-education, in addition to being scalable, is likely to be one the most effective methods for improving intergroup relations and promoting diversity. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Public opinion polls show that political trust tends to be higher in authoritarian regimes compared to liberal democracies. Many scholars have argued that respondents may provide false answers out of fear about repercussions by the state, thereby skewing survey results in a positive direction. Using an unobtrusive measure based on affect transfer, we find that adult participants in experiments conducted in China transfer positive affect toward the state onto evaluations of television advertisements upon mere exposure to the name of a central party institution. Participants did not have incentives to lie because they did not associate the advertisements with the state. Furthermore, people who evaluated the ads more positively upon viewing the name of the state also reported more positive levels of trust in government. Together, these findings raise doubt that Chinese misrepresent political trust in surveys out of political fear. © 2018 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Amid claims that forced marriage is rife in Australia’s minority communities, 2013 saw the introduction of criminal legislation outlawing forced marriage in Australia. Within public debate, this punitive measure came to overshadow all other modes of addressing the problem; for instance, education programmes, civil legislation and targeted domestic violence support services. This article examines print media coverage of forced marriage over the thirteen-year period leading up to the introduction of criminal legislation. Exploring a discourse that overwhelmingly understands forced marriage as a problem of Islam and multiculturalism, and that marginalises the experiences of women and service providers, the author identifies distinct conservative and liberal representations of forced marriage which racialise domestic violence. Conservatives maintain that forced marriage is empirical evidence of an impending Muslim ‘takeover’ of the West precipitated by multiculturalism. Liberals reassert the importance of western values through specific criminal legislation to temper male minority ethnic violence. The material consequence of these Orientalist framings is a narrowing of services available to women seeking to escape violence. The article seeks to understand the processes of meaning-making in which forced marriage is implicated and how the issue is situated within the domain of national political ideology, as opposed to family violence. © 2018 Institute of Race Relations.

AB  - The persuasiveness of right-wing populist communication has become a widely discussed topic; it is often assumed that such messages might foster anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens. The present study explores the effects of the different components of right-wing populist communication—anti-immigrant messages, populist content, and populist style—on attitudes toward immigrants. By combining a media content analysis (N = 605 articles) with a panel survey (N = 1,968) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), this study analyzes how citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants are influenced by the right-wing populist communication with which they are confronted in their individual media diet. The results show that anti-immigrant statements in the media lead to more negative cognitions toward immigrants, while populist content leads to more negative emotions. The study, thus, demonstrates that not only anti-immigrant rhetoric but also populism as a thin-centered ideology influence citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants on top of pre-existing attitudes. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Social media, as a subaltern public sphere (Fraser, 1990), have a democratic function in providing an alternative platform for minorities and marginalized to defy mainstream discourses in the public sphere. However, social media have been found to have an echo chamber effect, which may be detrimental to democracy. They may help to accelerate the ascendancy of a “post-truth” era in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. A study on political polarization, however, showed that selective exposure and avoidance in social media are weak indicators of polarization (Johnson et al., 2017). This study examines the role of social media in democracy and partisan politics. The authors considered that despite the echo chamber effect, social media have a limited part to play in the formation of polarized stances compared with other factors, such as demographics, political orientation, and mass media use. The study tested two main hypotheses: H1: Social media use is associated with political stance that is marginalized in the mainstream media; H2: Political orientation has a stronger relationship than social media use with the stance toward political values and social issues. The results supported both hypotheses. Social media are associated with political stance that is marginalized in the mainstream media. However, when compared with other factors, the relationship between social media and stance becomes less obvious. Although the echo chamber effect may reinforce the original stance, social media do not exhibit a strong relationship with the stance toward political values and social issues. Partisan orientation and use of partisan mass media are found to have stronger links with variations in stance. Social media, however, provide a subaltern public sphere for those excluded from the dominant public sphere, thus extending the public sphere to accommodate multiple opinions and perspectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Writing for the media is a task faced by many professionals at some point during their academic or clinical life. The style and purpose of writing for the media is strikingly different from that of an academic manuscript. When writing for the media, the author presents information and persuades the mass audience about a particular topic or issue. The author needs to bear in mind that information sent out to the media will make today's story but will be yesterday's news, so time is of the essence. The format of newswriting follows an inverted pyramid structure with the most important message taking center stage at the beginning of the article followed by any additional messages. The use of graphics enhances the message. While embracing the concept of modesty, the author needs to present the newsworthy information in a complete, accurate, efficient and precise manner. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The article is devoted to the issue to what extent mass media produces strong attitudes in an authoritarian political environment. A growing body of research scrutinizes how contemporary autocracies use media to promote legitimizing messages and undermine opposition. This study contributes to the literature by showing whether public opinion formed under authoritarianism is strong in the face of counterframing. While Russian state-owned TV-channels extensively promoted the idea that Donald Trump’s victory will be positive for Russian-American relations, we run an experimental study with various treatments.

AB  - Currently users on social media post their opinion and feelings about almost everything. This online behavior has led to numerous applications where social media data are used to measure public opinion in a similar way as a poll or a survey. In this paper, we will present an application of social media mining for the art market. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first attempt to mine social media to extract quantitative and qualitative data for the art market. Although there are previous works on analyzing and predicting other markets, these methodologies cannot be applied directly to the art market. In our proposed methodology, artists will be treated as brands. That is, we will mine Twitter posts that mention specific artists’ names and attempt to rank artists in a similar manner as brand equity and awareness would be measured. The particularities of the art market are considered mainly in the construction of a topic-specific user network where user expertise and influence is evaluated and later used to rank artists. The proposed ranking system is evaluated against two other available systems to identify the advantages it can offer. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Racial discrimination has been increasingly reported to have a causal link with morbidity and mortality of Black Americans, yet this issue is rarely addressed in a public health perspective. Racism affects health at different levels: institutional racism is a structural and legalized system that results in differential access to health services; cultural racism refers to the negative racial stereotypes, often reinforced by media, that results in poorer psychological and physiological wellbeing of the minorities. Lastly, interpersonal racism refers to the persistence of racial prejudice that seriously undermines the doctor-patient relationship. After analysing these concepts with examples and relevant studies, this paper explores current literature. Racism as a Determinant of Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (Paradies et al, 2015) is the most recent and comprehensive research on the issue, yet it cannot be used to base public health interventions as it contains several limitations. Forward Through Ferguson: A Path Toward Racial Equity (Ferguson Commission, 2015) is a report that identifies 4 priority areas for framing public health interventions: Racial Equity, Justice for All, Youth at the Centre and Opportunity to Thrive. This study represents an important milestone in the application of public health on racial injustices, yet racism must be tackled with a sustained, multilevel, and interdisciplinary approach. In conclusion, this paper addresses how public health interventions can empower Black minorities and bring forward long-term policies. Racism is a structural and long-standing system that can be eliminated only with the collective effort. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Male and female consumers differ in terms of decision-making. This is also true for inexperienced and experienced consumers. Although the extant research delineates studies that have centered on the interrelationships between perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived enjoyment (PE), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude toward using social media (ATUSM), and users' behavioral intentions, there is still a dearth of empirical research about gender and prior experience as the two potential moderators. With this recognition, our study examines gender and prior experience as moderators of the effects of PEU, PE, and PU on ATUSM. Our study also investigates ATUSM as a full mediator of the impacts of PEU, PE, and PU on users' intentions to attend festivals (IAF). Data came from the students of the Korean Government Scholarship Program. The results from structural equation modeling reveal that the positive influence of PE on ATUSM is stronger among female users. As expected, the positive impact of PU on ATUSM is stronger for male users. As hypothesized, prior experience strengthens the positive effects of PE and PU on ATUSM. The results further reveal that ATUSM fully mediates the effects of PE and PU on IAF. Based on the aforesaid findings, theoretical implications are discussed and managerial implications to enhance business sustainability are offered. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A cursory look at Indian prime-time news tells us much about the tone and tenor of the people associated with it. Exaggerations, hyperbole, and tempers run wild, and news anchors flail in theatrical rage. News channels and news editors display their ideological affiliations subliminally. These affiliations—a factor of personal political stances, funding bodies, and investors—lead to partisan bias in the framing of news and, in some cases, can easily translate into racial prejudice. In this paper, I examine news coverage related to Muslims in India. I study the coverage of two issues specifically—love jihad and triple talaq—in prime-time English news of two channels: Times Now and Republic TV. Love jihad is a term used to describe alleged campaigns carried out by Muslim men targeting non-Muslim women for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Triple talaq is a form of divorce that has been interpreted to allow Muslim men to legally divorce their wives by stating the word “talaq” three times. My analysis of the content, tone, and tenor of their coverage shows that these channels propagate associations between Islam and backwardness, ignorance, and violence through consistent employment of the following tropes: “Muslim women need to be saved from Muslim men”; “Hindu women need to be saved from Muslim men”; and, “Muslims are not fully Indian—they are anti-national”. I place this study of news media within the current political climate in India and briefly touch on the conversations it guides and provokes. This is a first step in detailing a problem. It is also a call for further analysis on this subject to examine and evaluate if and how discourse manipulates public conversations and policy decisions. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - Islamophobia, as a problem, is often argued to be a rational choice by the stereotypical media coverage of Islam and Muslims, even though it points to the symptom rather than the root cause. Islamophobia reemerges in public discourses and part of state policies in the post-Cold War period and builds upon latent Islamophobia that is sustained in the long history of Orientalist and stereotypical representation of Arabs, Muslims, and Islam itself. The book What is Islamophobia? Racism, Social Movements and the State, edited by Narzanin Massoumi, Tom Mills, and David Miller offers a unique contribution to how best to define and locate the problem of demonizing Islam and Muslims in the contemporary period. The three scholars provide a more critical and structural approach to the subject by offering what they call the “five pillars of Islamophobia”, which are the following: (1) the institutions and machinery of the state; (2) the far-right, incorporating the counter-jihad movement; (3) the neoconservative movement; (4) the transnational Zionist movement; and (5) the assorted liberal groupings including the pro-war left and the new atheist movement. The UK-based research group correctly situates Islamophobia within existing power structures and examines the forces that consciously produce anti-Muslim discourses, the Islamophobia industry, within a broad political agenda rather than the singular focus on the media. Islamophobia emerges from the “Clash of Civilizations” ideological warriors and not merely as a problem of media stereotyping, representation, and over-emphasis on the Muslim subject. In this article, I maintain that Islamophobia is an ideological construct that emerges in the post-Cold War era with the intent to rally the Western world and the American society at a moment of perceived fragmentation after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a vastly and rapidly changing world system. Islamophobia, or the threat of Islam, is the ingredient, as postulated in Huntington’s “Clash of Civilizations” thesis that is needed to affirm the Western self-identify after the end of the Cold War and a lack of a singular threat or purpose through which to define, unify, and claim the future for the West. Thus, Islamophobia is the post-Cold War ideology to bring about a renewed purpose and crafting of the Western and American self. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study compared representations of ideological violence by Muslim versus non- Muslim perpetrators in Canadian national news media (the Globe and Mail, National Post, and CBC). Both quantitative and qualitative disparities were examined. Acts of Muslim violence received 1.5 times more coverage, on average, than non-Muslim ones, and thwarted Muslim plots received five times more coverage. Muslim incidents were more likely to be labelled “terrorism” and linked to other episodes of violence, and Muslim perpetrators were more likely to be labelled by their religious and ethno-racial identities. These patterns in representation serve to stabilise the racial formations of the Canadian national security state in the “war on terror”. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The growing prevalence of foreign media consumption, including from Japan, has received considerable notice in recent work on PRC youth culture. To date, however, few studies have considered how youth of different social backgrounds perceive their consumption of Japanese popular culture in the context of the Party-state’s ‘patriotic education’ campaign waged in schools and in the mass media. Studies have also overlooked how rural and urban youth in China juxtapose the images and themes conveyed in the Japanese media that they consume with school and domestic media messages. Drawing on interviews with middle school students in Shanghai and Henan, the present study addresses these issues. It finds that while a majority of youths from different backgrounds express animosity toward Japan, they separate these feelings from their passion for Japanese popular culture. In some cases, consumption of Japanese media also allows teenagers to feel that they ‘know’-or even appreciate-the other country better. Amid the anti-Japanese messages currently circulating in PRC schools and domestic media, consumption of Japanese popular culture manifests a form of ‘expressive individualism’ among teenagers, who creatively construct their own notions of patriotism, national memory, and Sino-Japanese relations. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - After the Spring Festival of 2015, an environmental documentary called Under the Dome in which Chai Jing acted as a narrator has caused the public opinion to boom in social media in China. Why could a documentary released by internet attract so much attention and spark such a heated discussion? What are the factors that have influence on the information dissemination of social media environmental mobilization? This paper employed case study and semi-structure interviews to reveal these questions. It turned out that individual trust, group norms and information networks of the social capital played an important role in the social media environmental mobilization. The reason why Under the Dome became a hot issue was that it made full use of the social media users’ trust on the mobilizer, aroused the mobilized’s emotions and combined the network channels of social relationships. © 2018, © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2018.

In the first part, traditional Italian news media partisanhip is discussed as findings demonstrate that it still alive in-spite of novelties deriving from the development of new media. In the second part, authors investigate the level of negativity of news stories and how it is linked to different habits of consumption and different political affiliations of viewers and readers. Findings demonstrate that at the basis of the electoral result, which deeply modified the previous political landscape, there was a climate of opinion that was influenced by the way news media treated contentious issues such as immigration and Europe. © 2018, © 2018 The Founding Editors, Contemporary Italian Politics.

AB  - This article examines the representation of the fat female body in two films, namely Inji Iduppazhagi (Size Zero, 2015) and Dum Laga ke Haisha (Give in All Your Energy, 2015). The author shows how fatness is alternatively reconfigured, in these two films, to foreground radical definitions of beauty, sexuality, romance, and body politics. The slim, curvaceous, and fair-complexioned female celebrity—an ideal that is constantly reiterated in South Asia through popular media discourses, numerous beauty pageants, predatory cosmetic enterprises, and mainstream Bollywood cinema—is effectively discarded here, in favor of capturing the interests, aspirations, and priorities of the fat female protagonist. Fatness, through these two cinematic representations, thus facilitates a subversive discourse of destigmatization, which, in turn, serves as a powerful antidote to the dominant assumptions, prejudices, and stereotypes surrounding the fat female body. Through such compelling counternarratives, the fat female protagonists are not only positively constructed as lively, desirable, adventurous, and fun-loving subjects, but also strategically pitted against social and cultural practices of fat shaming to sensitize and reorient hitherto existing discourses of popular culture. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Research on media influence on attitudes and perceptions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), a prominent predictor of IPV, is limited. Using a convenience sample of 2057 Chinese undergraduate students, this survey explored influences of media exposure on attitudes and perceptions of IPV the first time in literature. Significant differences (p <.05) of perceptions of IPV were found between respondents who reported developing cognitions of IPV from books, magazines, or newspapers and those who didn’t, with the former having better perceptions than the latter. Positive associations were also found between print-based media access and perceptions and negative attitudes concerning IPV. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - From recreational to elite levels, sport has many benefits for disabled people. At the same time, it is acknowledged that there is a trickle-down problem from para-elite sport to sport participation of disabled people, in general. Newspapers are one form of media that sets agendas and influences public opinion. Many studies have highlighted problematic aspects of parasport and para-athlete coverage in newspapers. Paratriathlon was one of two new events added to the Paralympics in Rio 2016, which increased its visibility in the public domain. We investigated the coverage of paratriathlon and paratriathletes in 300 Canadian newspapers using the ProQuest database Canadian Newsstream as a source, and utilizing a descriptive quantitative and a qualitative thematic content analysis. The main themes evident in the reporting on paratriathlon and paratriathletes, in the three hundred Canadian newspapers we covered, were the supercrip imagery of the para-athlete, personal stories mostly linked to the supercrip imagery, and the theme of able-bodied athletes in juxtaposition to the para-athletes. Using the lens of the four legacy goals of the International Paralympic Committee, we conclude that our findings are detrimental to the fulfillment of the four legacy goals. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In times of increasing polarization and political acrimony, fueled by distrust of government and media disinformation, it is ever more important to understand the cognitive mechanisms behind political attitude change. In two experiments, we present evidence that false beliefs about one's own prior attitudes and confabulatory reasoning can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes. In Experiment 1 (N = 140), participants stated their opinions about salient political issues, and using the Choice Blindness Paradigm we covertly altered some of their responses to indicate an opposite position. In the first condition, we asked the participants to immediately verify the manipulated responses, and in the second, we also asked them to provide underlying arguments behind their attitudes. Only half of the manipulations were corrected by the participants. To measure lasting attitude change, we asked the participants to rate the same issues again later in the experiment, as well as one week after the first session. Participants in both conditions exhibited lasting shifts in attitudes, but the effect was considerably larger in the group that confabulated supporting arguments. We fully replicated these findings in Experiment 2 (N = 232). In addition, we found that participants' analytical skill correlated with their correction of the manipulation, whereas political involvement did not. This study contributes to the understanding of how confabulatory reasoning and self-perceptive processes can interact in lasting attitude change. It also highlights how political expressions can be both stable in the context of everyday life, yet flexible when argumentative processes are engaged. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The flow of information experienced complexity uncertainty and ambiguity in terms of information adequacy when Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. This incident demonstrated an unprecedented international humanitarian response from the technology sector. This study discovered that most respondents from Mainland China and Malaysia access information about Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 during and after the tragic incident through social media. This study revealed significant difference of active social media users' perceptions on this incident in these two countries. On one hand, social networking sites such as Facebook (in Malaysia), Weibo and Wechat (in China), become the public opinion field that illustrates sorts of openness and negotiation in Malaysia and China. This study, instead of conventional crisis communication approach, specifically examined active online users in both countries, as it aims to make a valuable contribution by synthesizing current research and identifying areas for investigation for each aspect of the survey process. Two hundred questionnaires had been collected from respondents in China and Malaysia respectively. The survey results contributed to mechanism of crisis communication for henceforth similar incident in the future. There is no doubt that the portrait of Malaysia Airlines on social media in these two countries affected its organizational reputation. However, the participants from Malaysia and China showed a very average level of confidence to empower themselves to enhance dialog capacity among various stakeholders for this incident. © Media Watch.

AB  - This article explores the dynamics of digital (dis)information in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. International Relations scholars have presented the online debate in terms of 'information warfare'-that is, a number of strategic campaigns to win over local and global public opinion, largely orchestrated by the Kremlin and pro-western authorities. However, this way of describing the online debate reduces civil society to a mere target for manipulation. This article presents a different understanding of the debate. By examining the social media engagement generated by one of the conflict's most important events-the downing of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine-we explore how competing claims about the cause of the plane crash are disseminated by the state, media and civil society. By analysing approximately 950,000 tweets, the article demonstrates how individual citizens are more than purveyors of government messages; they are the most active drivers of both disinformation and attempts to counter such information. These citizen curators actively shape competing narratives about why MH17 crashed and citizens, as a group, are four times more likely to be retweeted than any other type of user. Our findings challenge conceptualizations of a state-orchestrated information war over Ukraine, and point to the importance of citizen activity in the struggle over truths during international conflicts. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background and Objective: Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an infectious disease, which lacks curative treatment as well as vaccine. The only option to halt the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is to increase the knowledge of people regarding its modes of transmission and prevention and help people change their high-risk behavior. The present study has been undertaken in a rural area, Kangrali subcenter of Handignur, to determine the knowledge and attitude of rural married men regarding HIV/AIDS. Materials and Method: A ten–month cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 married men residing in Kangrali, India selected randomly. Ethical clearance was obtained from the IEC. Socio-demographic data and knowledge about different aspects of HIV/AIDS was obtained using a predesigned, pretested questionnaire. Results: Out of 400 selected married men, all had heard about HIV/AIDS. Majority (68.25%) of them learnt about AIDS from mass media. Majority (60.25%) knew that HIV/AIDS gets transmitted by sexual contact. Knowledge on prevention of HIV/AIDS by using condoms was known to only 10.25%; whereas prevention by avoiding multiple sex partners was known to 43.75% of participants. About 63% of men’s attitude was to give support to HIV-positive patients, whereas 5.25% of men had negative attitude towards HIV-positive patients. Conclusion: This study revealed that knowledge and attitude score about HIV/AIDS in married men was significantly associated with the age, literacy level, socioeconomic status, occupation, and type of family. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigated the portrayal of “personalized” and “precision” medicine (PM) in North American news over the past decade. Content analysis of print and online news was conducted to determine how PM has been defined and to identify the frames used to discuss PM, including associated topics, benefits, and concerns. Methods: A data set was built using the FACTIVA database, searching for popular North American publications with the terms “personalized (personalised) medicine” and/or “precision medicine” from 1 January 2005 to 15 March 2016. The final set of publications totaled 774. Results: PM is almost exclusively defined as related to genetics and is often part of a story related to cancer. The PM story is overwhelmingly one of highlighting (potential) benefits and optimism, especially in shorter publications, and ones where PM is not the main focus. This promotional PM discourse has remained fairly consistent over the past decade. Conclusion: The numerous concerns associated with PM have received little attention over the past decade, especially in articles more likely to be encountered by a more general audience. This promotion of PM serves as an example of the science hyping that takes place in science reportage and may have implications for consumers, public expectations, and related health policy. © 2018, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

AB  - The power of social media may be best captured in high-profile criminal cases where the court of public opinion can comment, often anonymously, and instantly re-share case information. In a poignant example of how social media can generate national and international attention on criminal behavior, this research explores the 2012 Steubenville, Ohio sexual assault case. Using qualitative textual analysis, news articles and social media content were coded for to assess how existing rape myth narratives were depicted in the Steubenville case. Emphasis is placed on how reporting and social media responses characterized the victim, perpetrators, and the rape itself. The study found that depictions included both legitimizing rape myths and subverting myths through social media and news coverage. Implications for how social media materials were used as evidence in the Steubenville case are also discussed. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.

AB  - Powell’s 2011 study of media coverage of 11 post-9/11 terrorist events argued that a thematic framing exists which results in a model of media coverage of terrorism that is different for acts of terror committed by Muslims than by non-Muslims. This pattern connects terrorism to Islam, thus creating a fear of the “other” and aids terrorists in achieving their goal of creating a climate of fear. This study examines the 11 terrorist events since the last study, between 2011 and 2016, to determine if any changes in media coverage of terrorism have occurred in a climate of increased awareness of Islamophobia. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - It is hardly an exaggeration to claim that one of the most turbulent political areas in recent years has been asylum policy, which has disclosed a rapidly increasing inflow of asylum seekers, and, in many countries, has been followed by fierce media discussion and political controversies. In Sweden, this development has been heated as the Swedish self-image is one of providing generous policies, which is also reflected in terms of strong refugee policy. The article uses this example to explore assumptions about public responsiveness in previous policy feedback literature and to examine the link between citizens' attitudes towards immigration and changes in asylum policy output, measured as asylums granted, over time in the period 1990–2015. It focuses especially on the link through which citizens become aware of policy output, operationalized as media visualization, and find that including media reveals a suppressed relationship between policy output and public attitudes. The relationship is negative and thus confirms the assumptions of the thermostatic models. Second, the article shows that feedback is mediated by political orientation: People defining themselves politically as right-oriented respond with negative feedback when the number of granted asylums increases, while left-oriented people do not change their attitudes. Based on these findings it is concluded, first, that analyses of democratic responsiveness need to incorporate a clear measure of the link by which exogenous factors become visible. Second, the importance needs to be stressed of considering important cleavages in the population in order to display responsiveness processes fairly. © 2018 Nordic Political Science Association

AB  - This article examines the different discourses in the online public debate surrounding the television dating show ‘The Undateables’. The programme, which exclusively focuses on dates of disabled people, was launched in the UK in 2012, and local adaptations of the format were broadcast in Belgium and the Netherlands. The article applies the dis/ability approach of Goodley and Runswick-Cole (2014) to examine the way in which representations of disabled singles are evaluated online. As a perspective, dis/ability destabilizes notions of normativity and enables an inquiry into not just marginalized identities, but also dominant identities. The analysis of blog posts, tweets and online press reviews of the first series of the British, Flemish and Dutch version of ‘The Undateables’ provides more insights into hegemonic and resistant notions on disability, dating and romantic relationships. This article argues that prejudices, as already identified by Morris in 1991, are still very dominant today. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - As a populist leader, Hugo Chavez famously used emotionally charged populist rhetoric to appeal to a broad base of poor and working-class Venezuelans. Was his choice of linguistic discourse a tool of popular control, response to public opinion, or both? Answering this question sheds light on the effectiveness of classical democratic conceptions of vertical accountability for populist leaders. Using a theoretical framework incorporating macro implications of Zaller’s receive-accept-sample (RAS) model, the concept of Erikson, Mackuen, and Stimson’s mood, and latent public opinion, we develop several competing expectations regarding rhetoric and presidential approval in Venezuela. Using computational sentiment analysis on a unique dataset of transcripts from Chavez’s Aló Presidente broadcasts, we evaluate Chavez’s quarterly public approval ratings with vector autoregression (VAR) and Koyck models. Results indicate presidential approval levels are causally linked to not only exogenous economic factors but also leader discourse. Results also indicate that leader language is not shaped by approval levels, illustrating the power of messaging and media control for populist leaders and the potential limits of democratic accountability. © 2018 University of Utah.

AB  - Healthcare systems performance is the focus of intense policy and media attention in most countries. Quebec (Canada) is no exception, where successive governments have struggled for decades with apparently intractable problems in care accessibility overall, poor performance, and rising costs. This article explores the underlying causes of the disconnection between the high salience of healthcare system dysfunctions in both media and policy debates and the lack of policy change likely to remedy those dysfunctions. Academically, public policies’ evolution is usually conceptualized as the product of complex, long-term interactions among diverse groups with specific power sources and preferences. In this context, we wanted to examine empirically whether divergences in stakeholders’ views concerning various healthcare reform options could explain why certain policy changes are not implemented despite consensus on their programmatic coherence. The research design was an exploratory sequential design. Data were analyzed narratively as well as graphically using a method derived from social network analysis and graph theory. Results showed striking intergroup convergence around a programmatically sound policy package centred on the general objective of strengthening primary care delivery capacities. Those results, interpreted in light of political science elitist perspectives on the policy process, suggest that the incapacity to reform the system might be explained by one or two groups’ having a de facto veto in policy-making. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The news media plays a vital role in providing child protection information and resources, shaping the public's understanding and perceptions of child maltreatment, and exposing system failures and setting policy agendas. To date, little is known about how child maltreatment is portrayed in the media in societies where these issues remain largely hidden and under-recognized. The purpose of the present study was to systematically examine newspaper coverage on child abuse and neglect in Hong Kong in order to assess how child maltreatment is currently presented and framed within public discourse. A total of 579 newspaper reports relevant to child maltreatment from four local newspapers in 2016 were reviewed. Similar to prior findings, cases involving sexual abuse received disproportionately more attention compared with other maltreatment types. The vast majority of news reports focused on specific cases or events, and seldom discussed child maltreatment as a broader social issue. Differences in reporting style and media framing were also compared by newspaper credibility, and for free versus paid newspapers. As a mass communication tool, more guidelines are needed to formulate public messages about child maltreatment that can improve individual, community, and structural capacities to prevent, identify, and respond to children who are victimized by abuse and neglect. This is especially important in jurisdictions where no mandatory reporting framework exists to help identify vulnerable children, and where the majority of child maltreatment is brought to the attention of authorities by families and those living within the child's community. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Public attitudes and stigma toward epilepsy may limit people with epilepsy (PWE) in seeking treatment and participating in social activities. The prevalence of epilepsy is approximately 0.8% in Japan, similar to rates reported in other countries. Although epilepsy is relatively common, few studies have investigated public awareness about epilepsy in Japan. Recently, several serious car accidents in Japan involving PWE resulted in pedestrian fatalities. Traffic accidents involving PWE have been reported extensively and repeatedly in the media since 2011. In 2013 and 2017, our research group conducted a large investigation of awareness about epilepsy targeting the general public. Previous studies have reported that knowledge is one of the factors involved in improving attitudes and reducing stigma. The aim of the current study was to compare survey results, especially regarding knowledge of epilepsy, and capture changes in public awareness between 2013 and 2017. Methods: A total of 2160 people (1080 in each year) participated, with a total of 540 women in each year, aged 20–79 years. Participants lived in the greater Tokyo area as well as the Tohoku and Kansai regions of Japan. All participants answered survey questions online in January 2013 and April 2017. We analyzed five questions regarding the participants’ demographic data, nine questions regarding knowledge about epilepsy, and five questions regarding experiences with epilepsy. For questions investigating the respondents’ knowledge about epilepsy, we counted only the correct answers and scored these for each respondent. Results: Knowledge scores decreased from 2013 to 2017, demonstrated by statistical analysis. However, the effect size was very small. Knowledge scores among the following groups were higher in both 2013 and 2017: people who had read or heard about epilepsy, those who had witnessed people having an epileptic seizure, people who had acquaintances who were PWE, those who had PWE in their family, and people who had studied medicine or worked in a medical profession. Conclusion: We revealed that participants who had some experience with epilepsy had higher knowledge levels in both 2013 and 2017. This suggests that such experiences could be important for motivating people to seek appropriate and accurate knowledge about epilepsy, and could result in a reduction of stigma. Greater awareness is needed among the general public in Japan about various aspects of epilepsy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Marijuana legalization has been one of the most controversial issues in the public health field. Since news frames can influence the public's perceptions about public health policy including marijuana legalization, it is important to understand how the media report this issue. Thus, we explore how U.S. newspapers present marijuana legalization stories, examining two key dimensions of framing: an organizing theme and a story tone. We analyzed news articles of national and regional newspapers between 1995 and 2014 (N = 640). Findings revealed that newspapers have largely presented marijuana legalization as a law enforcement issue, rather than an economic issue or a medical issue. Marijuana legalization has been differently presented according to each presidential period. Overall, marijuana legalization stories have been described using a neutral tone. However, findings showed that newspapers that were classified as politically liberal adopted a positive tone more frequently than newspapers that were classified as conservative. Our findings can help public health providers or policy makers understand the relationships between news stories and public opinion toward marijuana legalization. Conclusively, this study can provide a comprehensive analysis of news framing of marijuana legalization, examining two key dimensions of framing: organizing theme and story tone. © 2018

AB  - Objective: This study sought to demonstrate causal effects of exposure to Natural American Spirit (NAS) advertising content on misinformed beliefs of current and former smokers, and to empirically establish these beliefs as a mechanism driving intentions to use NAS. Methods: Our study employed a randomised experimental design with 1128 adult daily, intermittent and former smokers. We compared participants who were exposed to NAS advertisements or claims made in the advertisements with those in a no-message control group to test the effects of NAS advertising content on inaccurate beliefs about NAS and attitudes and intentions towards the product. Results: One-way analysis of variance revealed that exposure to NAS advertisements produced inaccurate beliefs about the composition of NAS cigarettes among current and former smokers (p<0.05). Planned contrasts indicated a compilation of arguments taken directly from NAS advertisements resulted in significantly greater beliefs that NAS cigarettes are healthier/safer than other cigarettes (for former smokers, t(472)=3.63, p<0.001; for current smokers, t(644)=2.86, p=0.004), demonstrating that suggestive claims used in the brand's marketing have effects on beliefs not directly addressed in the advertisements. Regression and mediation analyses showed that health-related beliefs predict attitudes towards NAS for current and former smokers, and mediate intentions to use NAS. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide causal support for the need for further regulatory action to address the potentially harmful ramifications of claims used in NAS advertising. © 2018 Article author(s).

AB  - Intergroup prejudice is a distorted opinion held by one social group about another, without examination of facts. It is heightened during crises or threat. It finds expression in social media platforms when a group of people express anger, resentment and dissent towards another. This paper presents a system for automated detection of prejudiced messages from social media feeds. It uses a knowledge discovery framework that preprocesses data, generates theory-driven linguistic features along with other features engineered from textual content, annotates and models historical data to determine what drives detection of intergroup prejudice especially during a crisis. It is tested on tweets collected during the Boston Marathon bombing event. The system can be used to curb abuse and harassment by timely detection and reporting of intergroup prejudice. © 2018

AB  - Recreational fishing has taken place for centuries and is a globally popular activity, yet a lack of monitoring data means historical trends in recreational fisheries are often little understood compared to their commercial counterparts. We examined archival sources and conducted fisher interviews to examine changes in the Queensland recreational snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) fishery throughout its documented history. We extracted data spanning the past 140 years on technological innovations, catch rate trends, and social and regulatory change. Technological innovations were evident throughout the history of the recreational fishery. During the 1960s, 1990s and 2000s, several periods of rapid technological transition occurred, where a technology was adopted by >50% of recreational fishers within 10 years of its introduction. Since the 1960s, the timing and rate of adoption of fish-finding technology by recreational fishers has kept pace with the commercial sector. These technological advances have profoundly increased recreational targeting ability, but despite these advances, recalled recreational catch rate trends demonstrated significant declines over the course of the 20th century. While minimum size limits have been imposed on the snapper fishery for over a century, in contrast, the introduction of recreational in-possession limits only commenced in the 1990s. At this time, the beginnings of a societal transition was also observed, where longstanding ‘take-all’ attitudes towards fishing began to be replaced by a more conservation-minded ethic. This shift was driven in part by the changing regulatory landscape, as well as wider attitudinal change influenced by the media and shifting societal norms, although whether this led to a reduction in total recreational catch remains unclear due to a lack of fishery-wide monitoring data and the open access nature of the recreational fishery. This study demonstrates that in the absence of systematic data collection, archival sources and fisher interviews can contribute an interdisciplinary knowledge base for understanding and interpreting historical fishery trends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering the growing salience of nuclear energy in Southeast Asia, this study examines public perceptions of nuclear energy in Singapore, a technologically-advanced and affluent nation well-equipped to develop nuclear energy capabilities. Drawing from the source credibility theory, this study examines the public's credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources, and their trust in potential stakeholders. Guided by the psychometric paradigm, this study also explores public perceptions of risks, benefits, and support. Four focus group discussions were conducted with Singaporeans aged 18–69. Participants across different age groups (e.g., Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers) concurred in their trust of potential stakeholders, risk perception, cost perception, and support. Intergenerational differences were observed for participants’ media use, credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources, and benefit perception. This study contributed theoretically by applying the source credibility theory and psychometric paradigm in an under-studied context. Practical implications were provided for policymakers and communication practitioners to effectively evaluate public awareness and acceptance for nuclear energy. Directions for future research were discussed. In conclusion, intergenerational similarities were observed for Singaporeans’ perceptions of risks, costs, and support. Meanwhile intergenerational differences were noted for their credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources, trust in potential stakeholders, and benefit perception. © 2018

AB  - Recognition that welfare states continue to change has fostered debate about the relationship between ideas and policy problems in driving governments towards reform. To move the debate forward, this article proposes a modification of Barbara Vis and Kees van Kersbergen's ‘open functional approach’. It first argues that while policy problems may provide ‘functional pressure’ to reform, this pressure is significant only in so far as inaction would risk electoral punishment. Reform pressure is hence best evaluated with reference to contemporaneous expert advice, public opinion data and the timing of elite and media attention. Second, it suggests that ideas may also lead parties to act as reform seekers, using policy problems as justification for cherished solutions or long-held programmatic goals. The modified approach is demonstrated through comparative application to two case studies, attempts at pension reform in Sweden and the United States. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This paper analyzes the nature of the debate generated prior to the implementation of the Act Respecting End-of-Life Care in 2015 in Québec (Canada). Including medical assistance in dying (MAID) along existing palliative care services, the act is an important policy change on a very sensitive issue. As such, MAID could be categorized as a morality policy issue, the latter being defined as a particular category of policy because of its specific features (issues of first principle, technical simplicity, high salience, public interest, and public participation). In line with Mucciaroni’s proposition, we rather analyze this issue by understanding morality policy as one of two framing strategies (moral and/or rational-instrumental frame). Our research reconstructs four public opinion framings as advanced and transmitted through the media between 2005 and 2015. It shows that although opponents to the bill unsurprisingly framed the debate in deontological terms, mostly referring to sanctity of life as one of the most important values in society, they also framed it on rational-instrumental grounds in a similar proportion, alleging the danger of a slippery slope and potential abuse. As well, if some of the proponents favored a moral framing centered on the argument that dignity and individual autonomy take precedence over all other values, others put forward a rational-instrumental one, where the slippery slope/abuse argument is used as a cautionary statement against the artificial prolongation of life. Our analysis reinforces Mucciaroni’s and Ferraiolo’s assertions that sensitive issues classified as morality policy cannot be apprehended solely through the unidimensional frame of morality. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers adjust to life in the US in order to understand their lives and help them to adapt to the new culture. Based on acculturation and mobile media theories, this study explores particularly how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers’ child-rearing practices in the US are mediated by mobile media. Guided by the theoretical framework of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers. Findings reveal that while going through the acculturation process, Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers attempt to play the traditional social role of mother as defined in their home countries when utilizing mobile media in their new home. Mobile media have symbolic meanings of empowerment and can be used as tools to deal with prejudice in the host country. This study also suggests that mobile media may mediate Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers’ acculturation processes when adopting different types of acculturation strategies (e.g., integration or separation). Implications for practice and future studies are further discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The development and use of nanotechnology in the food industry (nanofood) have grown steadily. While visions for nanofood suggest that the applications will improve quality and safety, they are also controversial for several reasons including potential health risks coupled with difficulty in assessing low-dosage nanoparticle risks as well as values-based objections. In recent years, debate over nanofoods has sparked inquiry into factors that predict public attitudes and purchase intentions. Such studies have investigated the roles of demographics and sociographics, value predispositions toward science and technology, preferences for natural products, trust in regulatory agencies, scientific knowledge, and media attention. This study assesses the role of each of these factors in shaping public attitudes toward nanofood and improves the predictive models by evaluating concepts from protection motivation theory. We find that incorporating threat and coping appraisals provides the best predictive models of public attitudes and intention to purchase nanofood products. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The following study explores the effect of social media visibility on public discussion and, possibly, on the results of the 2015 presidential elections in Poland, unexpectedly won by Andrzej Duda. Instead of newspaper analyses and polls, Facebook interactions proved more accurate in predicting the final results. In the study, focus is laid on two key sources of visibility of opinion that emerged during the campaign: major daily newspapers, which provide space for opinion only to selected writers; and presidential candidates’ Facebook fan pages, which offer broad visibility to Facebook users’ opinions. The proposed interpretation of this discrepancy is that of a major shift in making public opinion more self-expressive and personal: public discussion is formed ‘in between’ rationality and emotion, publicness and privacy. The 2015 presidential elections in Poland reveal that this ‘in-between’ emerged in people’s Facebook activity, and it uncovered a public affect which translated into election results. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the two leading cancers among women in Ethiopia. This study investigated knowledge and attitudes related to these two types of cancer among women in 4 zones of Ethiopia. This is the first study employing a validated questionnaire to investigate knowledge and attitudes relating to breast and cervical cancer in Ethiopia. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2015 in the North Shewa zone (Amhara region), Gamo Gofa zone (Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' region) and zones 1 and 3 (Afar region) of Ethiopia. A total of 799 women aged 18 years and older participated in the survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association of possible predictors with breast and cervical cancer knowledge. Results: A total of 799 women aged 18 years and older participated in the survey. Of the women interviewed, 63.0% had heard of breast cancer and 42.2% had heard of cervical cancer. Among those who had heard of breast cancer, 21.3% (107/503) had heard of breast cancer screening and 1.4% of women aged 40 years and older had undergone at least one breast screening examination. Fewer than half of the participants provided the correct response to questions related to risk factors for breast and cervical cancer. Among those who had heard of cervical cancer, 41.5% (140/337) had heard of cervical cancer screening and 3.3% had undergone at least one cervical cancer screening examination. Women with primary and higher levels of education were more likely to have heard of breast cancers (OR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.1-4.2; p < 0.001) and cervical cancer (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.6; p < 0.001). From the overall attitude score, the majority of the women were found to have negative attitudes towards breast cancer (67.4%) and cervical cancer (70.6%). Conclusions: This study found that the overall knowledge of risk factors for breast cancer and cervical cancer among women was low. Lack of cancer awareness, and lack of education in general, are the most potent barriers to access and care, and should be addressed through multi-faceted strategies including peer-education, mass media and other community-based interventions. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This comparative content analysis of Belgian and Swedish newspaper coverage of the 'refugee situation' in 2015 (N=898) revolves around responsibility indicators, news actor characteristics, and thematic emphasis. As they are a potential influential factor in the public-opinion formation process, the studying of media portrayals is an essential first step in investigating the dynamic interplay between media discourse and societal reactions. Belgium and Sweden differ with respect to migration policy, integration indicators, and the number of incoming refugees. They also differ in terms of journalistic cultural values. As a result, they make for an excellent case study of intercultural differences and similarities in how refugees are reported on. Our analysis made clear that Belgian news coverage shows regional diversity, with Francophone Belgian journalists showing more tolerance towards migrants and thus tending to be more in line with their Swedish counterparts. Still, refugees are seldom allowed to speak for themselves. This warrants attention and action by news professionals. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Belgium, and Europe in general, has seen a strong increase in the number of refugees arriving over the past three years. At the same time we also note an increasing polarization of Belgian public opinion on this subject. Among the main actors to shape this public opinion are news media, as they contribute to or combat stereotyping of (sub)groups in the population. The purpose of the current study is to analyze to which extent media consumption and trust have an impact on public opinion on two minority groups - immigrants and refugees - in a representative sample of the Belgian adult population (n = 1500). We gathered data on Belgian news media consumption and trust, and attitudes on immigrants and refugees through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that Belgian adults hold more positive attitudes on immigrants than on refugees. The reading of quality online newspapers as well as high levels of trust in television and radio are correlated with a positive attitude towards both groups, whereas the consumption of commercial television and popular newspapers go along with a negative attitude. Fear of terrorism (negative relation) and a negative evaluation of media coverage of refugees (positive relation) also have a sizeable influence. In terms of regional differences within Belgium, we find that citizens in the Brussels Capital Region hold more positive attitudes towards both groups than those in Flanders and Wallonia. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - This article examines the work of the anonymous Sámi artist and activist group Suohpanterror as an example of Indigenous culture jamming, which uses global visual archives and the social media to articulate a contemporary Sámi subjectivity politically. In a short time, Suohpanterror has gained national and international recognition as a new Sámi voice, which is challenging earlier representations and conceptions of the Sámi. However, instead of focusing upon Suohpanterror’s efforts to address the dominant society, this study is concerned mainly with Suohpanterror’s operation within, and at the fringes of, the Sámi community itself. To this end, I examine Suohpanterror’s entanglements in the small Sámi “uprising” that took place in the social media in spring 2013 around the interconnected issues of Sámi definition, identity and the potential ratification of the ILO convention 169 in Finland. I argue that in the context of a highly politicized national public sphere which is considered insensitive to Sámi perspectives, “liking”, consuming and sharing Suohpanterror’s work online has offered an easy, effective and unmistakably trendy way to publicly identify with a certain set of (Sámi) political views, and to perform a political “us” which feeds, in particular, on experiences of a shared community of knowledge, and of collective laughter. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite numerous health benefits for babies and mothers, many women do not either initiate or continue breastfeeding for the recommended duration, and increasing breastfeeding is a national priority. It is important to understand media messages on the topic, given that breastfeeding is influenced by many environmental factors and that perceived norms, social support, and perceptions of difficulties predict breastfeeding. The current study analyzes how media covers (1) breastfeeding in general, (2) public breastfeeding, and (3) extended breastfeeding (past 1 year). Guided by the theory of planned behavior, this study analyzes 318 news articles sampled from 10 of the most commonly read mainstream newspapers from 2008–2013. This sample covers a wide range of topics related to breastfeeding, including health benefits, societal reform efforts, social/human interest stories, parenting choices, and stories about pumped breast milk and formula. The results indicate approving social norms by public health officials and medical professionals about breastfeeding in general. A significantly larger number of articles discussed positive behavioral beliefs associated with breastfeeding rather than negative behavioral beliefs. However, articles more often presented barriers, rather than factors that facilitate breastfeeding. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - AIM: The Population-Based Funding Formula (PBFF) has a significant impact on health funding distribution between New Zealand’s 20 district health boards (DHBs) yet is subject to little independent oversight or public scrutiny. There has been widespread dissatisfaction among DHBs with the allocation process; however, there are limited formal avenues available for DHBs and the public to discuss the PBFF. As such, the news media has become a key platform for voicing concerns. This study aims to gain a better understanding of how the PBFF is portrayed in the news media and of perceptions of funding allocations across the country. METHOD: We conducted thematic analyses of 487 newspaper articles about the PBFF, published over 13 years from 2003–2016. We then identified trends in the data. RESULTS: Typically presented in a negative light, the PBFF was commonly framed against a background of financial struggle and resultant impacts on health services and staff. The effect of factors driving DHB allocations and the PBFF process itself were also key themes. There were significant regional and temporal variations in reporting volume, with most articles focusing on South Island DHBs and occurring during the introduction of the PBFF and at the time of the most recent review. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest general discontent with the PBFF model across the DHB sector and a sense that the PBFF has failed to address various challenges facing DHBs. The geographic imbalance in reporting volume suggests that frustration with the PBFF is particularly keenly felt in the South Island. Although the PBFF is a lightning rod for frustrations over limited health funding, the findings point to the need to improve transparency and dialogue around the formula and to monitor of the impact of PBFF allocations throughout the country. © NZMA.

AB  - During the past decade, the valley of the West Morava in the central part of the Republic of Serbia experienced several natural hazards that have changed the life of the inhabitants. The aim of this paper is to show how people perceive natural hazards in the areas where they do not have catastrophic consequences for the entire population. The perceptions of natural hazards were examined according to similar studies and collected through surveys and interviews. The obtained stratified sample information was coded, and the results are expressed in the parameters of descriptive statistics, using T-test and ANOVA. The population is partially affected if inhabited locations are in the threatened part of theWest Morava River valley and if their activities have direct consequences by natural disasters. They emphasize the importance of the political influences and mass media, but they show the need for additional information on prevention and protection. That is where they see geography as profession that sublimates all knowledge of natural disasters, unlike others that are more narrowly skilled. The results of the research are the starting point for further regional comparisons, which will complement the picture of the people's attitude and resilience to natural hazards in Serbia and the Balkan Peninsula. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the role of social and personal dimensions in predicting sustainable intention to use a social networking site (SNS). We propose and test an integrative SNS acceptance model based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the technology acceptance model (TAM), and the social influence theory. Included in the model are the attitudes toward the use of a SNS, the subjective norm, prevalence of information cascades, and the perceived behavioral control as antecedents of intention to use a SNS. An empirical analysis was conducted using data collected from a questionnaire survey with 228 college students in Korea, and it yielded the following findings. First, the two social dimensions, namely subjective norm and information cascade, were each found to have a significant positive relationship with behavioral intention to use a SNS. In particular, information cascades turned out to have a stronger impact than the remaining two antecedents to behavioral intention to use a SNS. Second, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were found to have a significant positive influence on the attitude toward SNS use. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - New tourism trends, such as vacation rentals websites and low-cost tourism, have generated a new environment of interactions between tourism and the citizens. To this, we must add the fortuitous increase in demand in some touristic destinations. This has derived in situations of rejection in traditionally tourism-dependent environments. In this study, which is focused on the city of Barcelona, we use work-field data to analyze the elements that lie behind the popular aversion to tourism. Assuming a non-forced analysis that takes the Social Exchange Theory as a framework, we have determined that the negative economic effects derived from the increase in the number of accommodations destined for vacation rentals and in the demand lie behind this rejection. The main impacts that are perceived directly from these factors are: the increase in residential rentals prices and a shift from a traditional market to one oriented to the tourist with higher prices. It has also been determined that the most vulnerable population groups are those who manifest a stronger rejection, tenants of apartments in city centers, and citizens with a low/medium income, who perceive rises in the prices and a change in the market focus to a larger extent. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A microblog is a new type of social media for information publishing, acquiring, and spreading. Finding the significant topics of a microblog is necessary for popularity tracing and public opinion following. This paper puts forward a method to detect topics from Chinese microblogs. Since traditional methods showed low performance on a short text from a microblog, we put forward a topic detection method based on the semantic description of the microblog post. The semantic expansion of the post supplies more information and clues for topic detection. First, semantic features are extracted from a microblog post. Second, the semantic features are expanded according to a thesaurus. Here TongYiCi CiLin is used as the lexical resource to find words with the same meaning. To overcome the polysemy problem, several semantic expansion strategies based on part-of-speech are introduced and compared. Third, an approach to detect topics based on semantic descriptions and an improved incremental clustering algorithm is introduced. A dataset from Sina Weibo is employed to evaluate our method. Experimental results show that our method can bring about better results both for post clustering and topic detection in Chinese microblogs. We also found that the semantic expansion of nouns is far more efficient than for other parts of speech. The potential mechanism of the phenomenon is also analyzed and discussed. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to study the impediments and difficulties that prevent Indian women from becoming entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained through a survey involving 15 experts. Based on the feedback provided by the experts, ten relevant barriers in the context of Indian micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) were chosen. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data. These ten barriers create obstruction for Indian women as entrepreneurs. These barriers were ranked, and causal relationships among them established using interpretive structural modeling and Matrice d’Impacts croises-multiplication appliqúean classment (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) (ISM–MICMAC) approach. Findings: This study identifies, on the basis of extant literature and experts’ opinion, ten barriers to female entrepreneurship. These barriers were ranked, and causal relationships among them established using the ISM–MICMAC approach. On the basis of ranking, women can move forward in MSMEs after removing these obstacles and it will have good results. Research limitations/implications: In this research, with literature reviews and experts opinion, ten barriers have been identified for women’s entrepreneurship and have been used to build the model. Practical implications: To bring Indian women forward in the field of entrepreneurship, both the society and the government should work together, and efforts should be made to overcome the obstacles coming in the way of entrepreneurs. Social implications: Female entrepreneurship in India faces many problems including negative attitude of authorities and society toward women. The society and authorities have no format or model for Indian women to move forward in the entrepreneurship sector. Originality/value: This study seeks to identify, on the basis of a thorough review of literature and expert opinion, major barriers to female entrepreneurship in the context of Indian MSMEs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Women leaders in outdoor environmental education (OEE) have begun to discuss the invisibility cloak that seems to envelope us. Women comprise approximately half the OEE professionals; however, women still face gender bias resulting in challenges of recognition and access to the upper echelons of the profession. Data show that implicit prejudice and limitations, arising from systematic hegemony and the gender binary, create an atmosphere that generally silences or ignores women's contributions and voices in media and history. As a collective group, our profession needs to actively challenge and positively change the forms of knowledge and recognition that render women invisible. Authors suggest that feminism and alternative discourses that have historically been marginalized or less visible can be used to replace and challenge current dominant narratives. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Moving beyond short-term public opinion accounts for Brexit this article considers how Britain's historic policy and political dynamics on migration led to the outcome of the EU referendum and how the latter is likely to transform current immigration policies. To do so, we explore historic and theoretical tensions in UK migration policy and politics over the last six decades. We show how these unresolved tensions allowed Eurosceptics to harness negative attitudes to the increasingly salient issue of immigration. We argue that a sufficient proportion of the UK's elite and electorate proved unable and unwilling to subordinate its desire for entirely domestic ‘control’ over immigration to the EU's right-based regime, let alone see fellow EU citizens in the UK as anything other than immigrants, ultimately giving Leave victory. The referendum process and outcome exposed the debate about free movement and migration to much wider public scrutiny and so raised more profound questions about the future of the British economy and the political model necessary to sustain it. We argue that, with the Brexit negotiations under constant public scrutiny a new, largely immovable parameter was set by the EU referendum result for the medium term that seems likely to lead to a decline in ‘Europeanised’ migration policy in the UK. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Prior investigations have examined both traditional media (e.g., television news) and entertainment media (e.g., crime-related shows) on policing-related outcomes; however, less is known how contemporary forms of media, such as the Internet and social media, may affect policing-related outcomes. Using a sample of young adults, the current study examines the effect of multiple types of media consumption (traditional, entertainment, the Internet, and social media) on attitudes toward police legitimacy. Findings reveal that respondents who read news online are more likely to have negative attitudes toward police legitimacy. However, when individual differences are controlled for, the effect of reading news online is weakened and using social media becomes marginally significant. Further, the impact of media consumption on attitudes toward police legitimacy varies by key audience characteristics. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Abstract Existing research on conflict framing in the news-media has focused disproportionately on political-party membership, where prior polarization between party elites implies strong pre-existing differences of opinion. To determine whether conflict framing can elicit polarization in the context of other important social identities, we compare the polarizing effects of conflict framing along partisan versus gender lines. In two experimental studies using different samples - i.e., college students (Study 1) and adult U.S. citizens (Study 2) - we found that framing news in terms of gender conflict polarized participants along gender lines. Moreover, polarization emerged primarily via increased self-stereotyping rather than gender-based motivated reasoning or increased gender-based animus. Importantly, this polarizing effect of gender-based conflict framing was not smaller than that of partisan conflict framing. The implications of our findings are discussed in light of work on media framing, social identity, and the formation of public opinion. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Mass media has long been discussed as an essential determinant of the threat perceptions leading to anti-immigration attitudes. The field of empirical research on such media effects is still comparatively young, however, and lacks studies examining precise measures of the media environment an individual is likely to be actually exposed to. We employ a nuanced research design which analyses individual differences in the yearly levels of both media salience and attitudes in panel data of 25,000 persons, who were at least interviewed twice, and a time span over 15 years, from 2001 to 2015. We find a substantive and stable positive effect: comparing periods of vivid discussions with times where the issue was hardly discussed in the German media results in an increase in the predicted probability of being very concerned by about 13 percentage points. Deeper investigations reveal that the media effect is most potent for individuals living in areas with lower share of ethnic minorities and for those with lower education or conservative ideology, stressing the importance of individual receptiveness. In sum, our findings strengthen the line of reasoning stressing the importance of discursive influences on public opinion and cast doubt on the argument that threat perceptions stem primarily from the size of ethnic out-groups. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Abstract Networked content flows that focus or fragment public attention are key communication processes in multimedia ecologies. Understandings of events may differ widely, as networked attention and framing processes move from core participants to more distant spectator publics. In the case of the Occupy Wall Street protests, peripheral social media networks of public figures and media organizations focused public attention on economic inequality. Although inequality was among many issues discussed by the activists, it was far less central to the protest core than problems with banks or democracy. Results showed how public attention to inequality was constructed through pulling and pushing interpretive frames between the core and periphery of dense communication networks. Various indicators of public attention - such as search trends, Wikipedia article edits, and legacy media coverage - all credited the protests with raising public awareness of inequality, even as attention to problems with banks grew at the protest core. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Public participation in water conservation projects is gaining more and more attention in the information era. Public opinion, showing the focus and interests of the public, is the basis of public participation. This paper proposes a social sensing system based on social media platforms, which employs two natural language processing technologies, namely, sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The public opinion on water conservation projects is monitored from three perspectives: public opinion intensity (POI) monitoring, topic detection, and sentiment analysis. To test their effectiveness, a case study on the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) in China is conducted. The public opinion data were acquired from Sina Weibo, China’s largest social media platform. The results indicate that: (1) POI peaks when hot project-related events occur, and POI of direct stakeholders apparently exceeds indirect stakeholders; (2) different stakeholders have different topics of concern closely associated with their interests; (3) negative events always lead to dramatic decreases in the sentiment value (SV), while positive events only slightly lift SV. The proposed system has achieved real-time monitoring of the public opinion on water conservation projects. Consequently, it can help to improve the level of public participation and provide a valuable reference in project management and policy-making. © IWA Publishing 2018.

AB  - Research Summary: Perp walks have been declared constitutionally acceptable even though the practice could be perceived to be a form of preconviction punishment and a manifestation of populist punitiveness. In adjudicating the constitutionality of perp walks, courts have employed a balancing test in which the interests of the press and the public's desire to know about the activities of law enforcement are weighted heavily. No research has been aimed at examining public opinion about this practice, however. We report the results of a national opt-in survey of public opinion on perp walks and find that less than one third of the sample respondents support them. By employing models derived from research on the influence of race and ethnicity on attitudes toward criminal justice policies, we find that, after controlling for concerns about the police and due process rights violations, African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are more supportive of perp walks than are Whites. These findings suggest that perp walks are one of a few areas in which racial/ethnic minorities might take a harsher view of punitive criminal justice policies compared with Whites. Policy Implications: Media coverage of some perp walks is likely unavoidable in a society with a free press, but the unscripted media coverage of a perp walk is different than the intentional coordination of a perp walk between law enforcement and the media. This practice of deliberately publicizing the arrest of criminal suspects has been defended by prosecutors and police. Contrary to claims that the public wants perp walks, however, we find that more people oppose than support perp walks. In light of the multiple constitutional concerns surrounding this practice, these results suggest that the orchestration of perp walks by law enforcement should be reconsidered. © 2018 American Society of Criminology

AB  - This article builds on prior writing on the ophthalmological aspects of climate change to argue that in an age of climate change denial and “post-truth”—which Oxford Dictionaries defines as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”—developing a visual language of climate change becomes of paramount importance. This article suggests that while media representations of climate change may serve to reduce climate change to a stock set of visual clichés certain art may improve our visual acuity of climate change. Accordingly, this article looks at select examples of artwork on the causes and consequences of climate change and considers the capacity of such work to inspire personal and political action. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Snowball sampling is a commonly employed sampling method in qualitative research; however, the diversity of samples generated via this method has repeatedly been questioned. Scholars have posited several anecdotally based recommendations for enhancing the diversity of snowball samples. In this study, we performed the first quantitative, medium-N analysis of snowball sampling to identify pathways to sample diversity, analysing 211 reach-outs conducted via snowball sampling, resulting in 81 interviews; these interviews were administered between April and August 2015 for a research project on anti-dam movements in Southeast Asia. Based upon this analysis, we were able to refine and enhance the previous recommendations (e.g., showcasing novel evidence on the value of multiple seeds or face-to-face interviews). This paper may thus be of particular interest to scholars employing or intending to employ snowball sampling. © 2018 Kirchherr, Charles.

AB  - Europe recently experienced a large influx of refugees, spurring much public debate about the admission and integration of refugees and migrants into society. Previous research based on cross-sectional data found that European citizens generally favour asylum seekers with high employability, severe vulnerabilities, and Christians over Muslims. These preferences and attitudes were found to be homogeneous across countries and socio-demographic groups. Here, we do not study the general acceptance of asylum seekers, but the acceptance of refugee and migrant homes in citizens’ vicinity and how it changes over time. Based on a repeated stated choice experiment on preferences for refugee and migrant homes, we show that the initially promoted “welcome culture” towards refugees in Germany was not reflected in the views of a majority of a sample of German citizens who rather disapproved refugee homes in their vicinity. Their preferences have not changed between November 2015, the peak of “welcome culture,” and November 2016, after political debates, media reporting and public discourse had shifted towards limiting admission of immigrants. A minority of one fifth of the sample population, who were initially rather approving of refugee and migrant homes being established in their vicinity, were more likely to change their preferences towards a rather disapproving position in 2016. Experience of contact with refugees and migrants, higher education, and general pro-immigration attitudes explain acceptance of refugee and migrant homes as well as preference stability over time. Country of origin and religion of refugees and migrants are considered less important than decent housing conditions and whether refugee and migrants arrive as families or single persons. In this respect our results highlight the importance of humanitarian aspects of sheltering and integration of refugees and other migrants into society. © 2018 Liebe et al.

AB  - Japan disputes the sovereignty of two islands: Senkaku/Diaoyu with China and Takeshima/Dokdo with South Korea. These disputes have triggered political performances. In August 2012, Chinese activists landed on Senkaku/Diaoyu, and South Korean politicians landed on Takeshima/Dokdo. The group threat theory suggests that these events constitute threats to Japanese citizens, which lead to negative attitudes towards these countries. The theory also expects personal variations in the reactions to the threats, and the empirical findings of the theory predict an improvement in the worsened attitudes immediately after the event. Drawing on a Japanese social survey that was conducted every month for the two years during which these landing events occurred, I tested the effect of the events on Japanese attitudes towards China and South Korea in a natural experimental framework. The results show that the events negatively impacted Japanese attitudes towards both countries. However, contrary to the expectations of the group threat theory, individual variations (i.e., socioeconomic status, media exposure, and political orientation) in the responses to the events are not supported. Additionally, the attitudes do not return to preevent levels for one year. The contradictions between previous studies and this study potentially originate from the importance of the territories. © 2017 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - The newly formed extensive flooded land associated with the Three Gorges Reservoir hold great potentials to provide ecosystem services (ESs) for surrounding cities and communities. Conflicting values and conventional management strategies may complicate and inhibit broad-scale decision-making for this novel ecosystem. Public attitudes are a crucial influence in the way this process plays out. This study was conducted to assess how the reservoir bank is perceived by the general public of Chongqing Municipality in terms of importance of riparian ESs, and preference for corresponding landscape design styles through photo-questionnaire interviewing. Although Chongqing citizens know little of the “ecosystem services” concept, they do recognise riparian environmental and ecological benefits especially the bank protection and pollution interception functions, while benefits of habitats for wildlife and flood attenuation were of less concern. Recreational values were least appreciated, which is inconsistent with other studies. This may be attributed to a wider, intensive environmental education in various social media in today's China. But publicity has been dominated by toxic air, water and soil pollution control rather than the benefits of nature conservation and personal contact with nature. In line with recognition of ESs, there is quite strong preference for the forested design scenario and particularly vegetation components across the socio-demographic spectrum. Overall, socio-demographic variables have very low explanatory power for the perceptual responses. Our study also revealed misunderstandings around riparian functions and a gap between public expectations and special abiotic and biotic prerequisites in restoring novel ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this research to urban novel ecosystems in general, and implications for raising public awareness, engaging appropriate public values in sustainable design and management of such ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Objective: Although the benefits of vaccines are widely recognized by medical experts, public opinion about vaccination policies is mixed. We analyze public opinion about vaccination policies to assess whether Dunning-Kruger effects can help to explain anti-vaccination policy attitudes. Rationale: People low in autism awareness – that is, the knowledge of basic facts and dismissal of misinformation about autism – should be the most likely to think that they are better informed than medical experts about the causes of autism (a Dunning-Kruger effect). This “overconfidence” should be associated with decreased support for mandatory vaccination policies and skepticism about the role that medical professionals play in the policymaking process. Method: In an original survey of U.S. adults (N = 1310), we modeled self-reported overconfidence as a function of responses to a knowledge test about the causes of autism, and the endorsement of misinformation about a link between vaccines and autism. We then modeled anti-vaccination policy support and attitudes toward the role that experts play in the policymaking process as a function of overconfidence and the autism awareness indicators while controlling for potential confounding factors. Results: More than a third of respondents in our sample thought that they knew as much or more than doctors (36%) and scientists (34%) about the causes of autism. Our analysis indicates that this overconfidence is highest among those with low levels of knowledge about the causes of autism and those with high levels of misinformation endorsement. Further, our results suggest that this overconfidence is associated with opposition to mandatory vaccination policy. Overconfidence is also associated with increased support for the role that non-experts (e.g., celebrities) play in the policymaking process. Conclusion: Dunning-Kruger effects can help to explain public opposition to vaccination policies and should be carefully considered in future research on anti-vaccine policy attitudes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Events and controversies in the agro-food domain frequently generate peak selective activity on social media. These social media hypes are a concern to stakeholders because they can affect public opinion and policy, and are almost impossible to predict. This study develops a model for analysing social media hypes and builds a typology to provide insights into the dynamics of social media hypes in the context of agro-food governance. Five cases of peak social media activity in the Dutch livestock sector are analysed along four dimensions: (1) peak patterns of activity, (2) issues and frames, (3) interaction of actors, and (4) media interplay. An analysis of the dimensions and the interrelations across cases shows that social media hypes revolve around activism, scandals, and conflicts – each with characteristic patterns of activity, framing, interaction and media interplay. Hypes do not just result from important events in the sector, but are generated through the use of organizing concepts with a hashtag to evaluate and establish occasions. Peak activity thus revolves around a few themes and is recurrent and judgmental. Moreover, stakeholders play an active role in instigating and framing social media hypes. Our results show the need to adopt a proactive and interactive approach that transcends the view of social media as a mere communication channel to respond in crisis situations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The internet is playing an increasing role in the development of rural areas. Farmers in particular, can benefit from new opportunities concerning farm management decisions. Hence, the goal of this study was to investigate German farmers’ willingness to accept (WTA) e-commerce. Primary data of 165 farmers was collected by conducting a discrete choice experiment about the purchase of crop protection products. WTA estimates show that farmers are willing to switch to an online merchant if they are offered a significantly lower price. However, word-of-mouth-reputation and consultation offered via traditional media do not influence farmers’ WTA for an online merchant. In contrast, delivery time significantly affects farmers’ WTA for inputs purchased online. We also show that farmers’ risk attitudes, prior online shopping experiences, and education are influential factors for the WTA for an online merchant. Surprisingly, age and farm size do not impact farmers’ WTA. Since e-commerce has not been widely established in agriculture yet, these results are of great practical importance. The findings of this study demonstrate that online merchants of agricultural inputs should focus on trust, service quality and timely delivery. Furthermore, it might be useful to introduce farmers to e-commerce during their education. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is a lively debate whether to consider vote decisions based on leader evaluations a threat to democracy, as this has long been assumed to constitute irrational decision-making behavior. Empirical evidence indicating that leader effects are not necessarily expressions of irrationality has recently mounted up, though skepticism towards leader effects remains resilient especially when considering voters being influenced through media coverage of party leaders. This paper studies some of the core assumptions of the ‘irrationality of leader effects’ thesis, by testing the conditionality of mediated leader effects based upon four voter characteristics: education, political interest, ideological distance to the leader's party and political cynicism. Two datasets are combined: a manual content analysis of leadership images in television coverage and a five-wave panel-dataset in the four months preceding the 2012 Parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. The results are mixed: one the one hand, being influenced by leadership images through the media is not a shortcut for voters who are incapable of understanding politics, while ideological considerations and other political attitudes are not completely excluded from the decision-making process, but, on the other hand, mediated leader effects are found to be strongest for voters who care least about politics. Thus, the empirical evidence can be brought to bear on both sides of the discussion, and, hence, does not conclusively settle the issue how mediated leader effects must be considered in relation to the irrationality of the vote decision. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To evaluate the effects of demographic and perceptive factors on the knowledge, perception, and behavior regarding antibiotic use in the general public, we conducted three serial telephone interview surveys in 2010, 2012, and 2015. Computer-aided telephone interview was conducted, with a predetermined quota stratified by sex, age, and geographic location. Respondents who answered correctly to four or more questions were categorized as having better knowledge. A total of 3013 respondents participated. Better knowledge was associated with age < 60 years (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04–1.82), college education (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26–1.97), healthcare-related occupation or education (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52–3.36), and media exposure (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02–1.54). In contrast, correct antibiotic use behavior was associated with male sex (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.27–1.73), older age (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.34–1.99), and being married (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04–1.52), along with better knowledge (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19–1.71). However, multifaceted analysis indicated that better knowledge was associated with correct behavior in all subgroups. Other demographic factors were associated only in respondents with poor knowledge. Various factors other than knowledge on antibiotics, many of them traditionally underappreciated, affect antibiotic use behavior. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Motorcyclists are involved in a disproportionate number of crashes given the distance they travel, with a high proportion of these crashes occurring at junctions. Despite car drivers being solely responsible for many road crashes involving a motorcycle, previous research has mostly focussed on understanding motorcyclists’ attitudes towards their own safety. We compared car drivers’ (n = 102) and motorcyclists’ (n = 579) opinions about junction crashes using a web-based questionnaire. Motorcyclists and car drivers were recruited in similar ways so that responses could be directly compared, accessing respondents through driver/rider forums and on social media. Car drivers’ and motorcyclists’ opinions were compared in relation to who they believe to be blameworthy in situations which varied in specificity, ranging from what road user they believe is most likely to cause a motorcyclist to have a road crash, to what road user is at fault in four specific scenarios involving a car and motorcycle at a junction. Two of these scenarios represented typical ‘Right of way’ (ROW) crashes with a motorcycle approaching from the left and right, and two scenarios involved a motorcycle overtaking another vehicle at the junction, known as ‘Motorcycle Manoeuvrability Accidents’ (MMA). Qualitative responses were analysed using LIWC software to detect objective differences in car drivers’ and motorcyclists’ language. Car drivers’ and motorcyclists’ opinions about the blameworthiness of accidents changed depending on how specific the situation was that was being presented. When respondents were asked about the cause of motorcycle crashes in a general abstract sense, car drivers’ and motorcyclists’ responses significantly differed, with motorcyclists more likely to blame car drivers, demonstrating an in-group bias. However, this in-group favouritism was reduced when asked about specific scenarios, especially in MMA situations which involve motorcyclists manoeuvring their motorcycles around cars at a junction. In the four specific scenarios, car drivers were more likely to blame the car driver, and motorcyclists were more likely to blame the motorcyclist. In the typical ROW scenarios, the responses given by both road users, as analysed by the LIWC, show that the law is taken into account, as well as a large emphasis on the lack of observation given around junctions, especially from car drivers. It is concluded that the perception of blameworthiness in crashes is very much dependent on the details of the crash, with a more specific situation eliciting a fairer evaluation by both car drivers and motorcyclists. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Nursing and care robots (NCR) have become an important technological innovation in various areas in the medical discipline. Previous studies have found that implementation of robots in healthcare is both associated with positive and negative attitudes. This study aims to improve the understanding of the general public's communication about nursing and care robots through analyzing the content of posts in social media. An advanced social intelligence platform was used to mine Twitter content. From the platform, data were collected historically. An archival and cross-sectional observational study was conducted online. The data set comprising of 5954 tweets were thematically analyzed. Tweets under the theme of absorbability show that nursing and care robots are considered to be a part of users’ lives, either now or sometime in the future for Twitter users, and the topic is tackled as a fact but with humor, skepticism and enthusiasm. Tweets falling under applicability show that potential nursing and care robots usage covers a range of arenas in everyday life. Results thematized as availability show sincere concern about how the accessibility of nursing and care robots in everyday life will affect costs and other economic aspects, both on a global and an individual level as well as on micro and macro levels of economies. Twitter offers a window into attitudes and ideas as well as fundamental beliefs and practices. Thus, monitoring Twitter discussions on social media can provide valuable insights into current attitudes as well as forecasting coming trends. The data includes information about Twitter users’ anxious relationships with nursing and care robots. We raise important questions about the nature of nursing and care robots and their implementations, both in health care but also in everyday living. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study was to incorporate measures of attentional bias and implicit attitudes in the evaluation of a community-wide physical activity program, UWALK, by examining the relationships among proximal, intermediate, and distal outcomes of the program as outlined in the hierarchy of effects model. UWALK incorporated various communication and marketing strategies via mass media, on- and off-line platforms. Participants (N = 127) reported unprompted then prompted awareness of UWALK followed by measures of attentional bias and implicit attitudes, watched a 30-second UWALK video, then completed a thought listing task and questionnaires measuring instrumental and affective attitudes, leisure time physical activity, and demographics. Results showed that participants with unprompted awareness of UWALK demonstrated attentional bias toward UWALK images, positive implicit attitudes, and greater physical activity participation compared to unaware counterparts. Attentional bias, awareness, and implicit attitudes significantly predicted behavior, accounting for 15.2% of the variance. This study emphasizes the importance of including measures of automatic cognitions during evaluation can further inform the effects of a program. The results also showed that it is problematic to assume that visiting a website indicates a program will be remembered and related cognitions will be affected. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Existing research suggests that, in contemporary liberal democracies, complaints of racism are routinely rejected and prejudice may be both expressed and disavowed in the same breath. Surveys and historical research have established that – both in democratic states and in those of the Soviet Bloc (while it existed) – antisemitism has long been related to or expressed in the form of statements about Israel or ‘Zionist’ permitting anti-Jewish attitudes to circulate under cover of political critique. This article looks at how the findings of a survey of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli attitudes were rejected by users of three Facebook pages associated with the British Left. Through thematic discourse analysis, three recurrent repertoires are identified: firstly, what David Hirsh calls the ‘Livingstone Formulation’ (i.e. the argument that complaints of antisemitism are made in bad faith to protect Israel and/or attack the Left), secondly, accusations of flawed methodology similar to those with which UK Labour Party supporters routinely dismiss the findings of unfavourable opinion polls, and thirdly, the argument that, because certain classically antisemitic beliefs pertain to a supposed Jewish or ‘Zionist’ elite and not to Jews in general, they are not antisemitic. In one case, the latter repertoire facilitates virtually unopposed apologism for Adolf Hitler. Contextual evidence suggests that the dominance of such repertoires within one very large UK Labour Party-aligned group may be the result of action on the part of certain ‘admins’ or moderators. It is argued that awareness of the repertoires used to express and defend antisemitic attitudes should inform the design of quantitative research into the latter, and be taken account of in the formulation of policy measures aiming to restrict or counter hate speech (in social media and elsewhere). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: For radiographers, gaining informed consent with our patients represents a challenging undertaking. Reconciling the need to gain meaningful consent with time pressures represents one challenge, as does differing expectations of how risk communication should be undertaken. Different methods and thresholds of risk disclosure are considered, with the aim of finding a realistic best practice. Methods: A cross-sectional study of radiographers and members of the public was undertaken. Participants were asked their preferences for how they would like to receive ionising radiation risk information. This included the health care professional(s) most suited to provide the information, the media through which the information was delivered, and the technique for delivering the information. In addition, participants were asked to consider hypothetical scenarios in which they were a patient receiving an ionising radiation examination, and to give the threshold of ionising radiation cancer risk which they would consider material. These scenarios considered variations in the cancer-onset time, and the accuracy of the test. Results: One hundred and twenty-one (121) radiographer participants and one hundred and seventy two (172) members of the public met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. There was strong agreement in the most appropriate media, and person, to disclose risk, as well as what represents a significant risk. There was considerable agreement in risk delivery technique. However, some of the agreed-upon strategies may be challenging to achieve in clinical practice. Conclusion: Radiographers and patients fundamentally agree upon risk communication strategies, but implementing some strategies may prove clinically challenging. © 2018 The College of Radiographers

AB  - This article examines the surprising outcome of the 2016 presidential election, which saw Donald Trump defy nearly all of the conventional wisdom to become the 45th president of the United States. Political commentators and experts offered several immediate postelection explanations for Trump’s victory, one of which focused on how Trump was able to generate considerable unpaid or free media for himself, often directly through Twitter. This article explains the theory and rationale underlying the free media thesis (FMT) and then examines whether there is any preliminary empirical support for it. Using media tracking data and public opinion surveys, the results reveal that Trump indeed dominated the unpaid media market. Although the findings in this article cannot make causal claims about whether Trump’s advantages in free media are the primary reason for his upset victory, the results, nonetheless, suggest that some of the basic conditions necessary for the FMT were present in the 2016 election and that the FMT offers a plausible avenue for further analysis and future research. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Our everyday life is influenced by an overproduction of images and by an iconogenic surplus that is connected to the proliferation of media. These contribute to both the quality and quantity of communication, but simultaneously amplify the knowledge gap between an audience that is able to critically process messages and another that is affected uncritically by prejudices and stereotypes. Bellino argues for a critical media education to address this gap by encouraging the development of students' critical thinking and social awareness. In this article we will discuss the results of a research-driven design project in which visual communication design students engaged with theories of cultural stereotypes and critiqued the role of media in their perpetuation. We adopted Kolb's model of experiential learning as recent published research demonstrates that art and design students have difficulties in conventional academic approaches to learning theory. In this regard students learned theories of stereotype through doing and making and embodied this learning in their critical project outcomes. © 2017 The Authors. iJADE © 2017 NSEAD/John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - NIE (newspaper in education), which is the study utilizing newspaper-based educational resources in the classroom, has been pursued for a long time. Traditional NIE allows only one-way interaction and available media are limited. In addition, it has difficulty in capturing the latest “hot” issues or recognizing public opinions. In this paper, we propose a platform called TNIE (Twitter news in education) that utilizes Twitter in NIE. TNIE has many advantages compared to traditional NIE: (1) it classifies the latest news into various topics, (2) the classified news content can be browsed effectively via a hierarchical visualization scheme, and (3) effective discussion or debate groups can be easily formed based on the learners’ news selection. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we implemented a prototype system and performed several experiments. According to the results, our news classification scheme achieved an 87.8 % F-measure on average, which is superior to the 78.94 % of previous studies. We also had volunteers use our prototype system and evaluate its main functions, e.g., news visualization, classification, learner clustering, and collaborative learning. We report some of these evaluation results. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Using Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory as an organizing framework, the research closely examines the text of the Amazon Studios hit show Transparent and, by extension, the evolution of public opinion toward transgender individuals. By examining the Pfefferman family in detail and their related microsystem and macrosystem, we are able to closely unpack the transition of Jeffrey Tambor’s character from Mort to Maura and the show’s connections with broader developments in the Los Angeles LGBT community and the Jewish diaspora in postwar and contemporary Los Angeles. In addition, by focusing on the influence of the chronosystem, we are able to examine how both opinions toward Maura and public opinion toward transgender issues more generally have evolved within the family system and the larger American community over time. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose: Although Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in the USA, much controversy exists with respect to HPV vaccination, especially among parents of adolescents. Previous research has shown that exemplars in the media influence public opinion estimates about controversial social issues. However, little is known about the underlying psychological processes of how exemplars influence public opinion formation. The purpose of this paper is to systematically explore such psychological processes based on the projection theory. To this end, the important yet controversial public health issue, the mandatory HPV vaccination, was chosen. Design/methodology/approach: A two-factor (exemplar vs proportion), between-subject experiment was conducted using online newspaper articles as main stimuli. A total of 138 participants completed the study. The analytical framework comprised the Sobel test with the Bootstrap method and a series of Ordinary Least Square hierarchical regression analyses. Findings: The higher the proportion of exemplars against the HPV vaccination in a news article was, the greater the number of individuals who became opposed to it was. And the high personal opposition translated into negative public opinion change estimation. Originality/value: The findings indicate that news exemplars may influence individuals’ personal opinion formation, and, in turn, contribute to their estimations of future public opinion climate, as suggested by the projection theory. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications for journalists, health educators and policy makers are discussed. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach: This study involved 206 research participants who live in Jakarta and Surabaya and who answered online questionnaires to measure attitudes, receptivity to #CondomEmoji advertising, brand impression and intention to buy condoms. Questionnaires were circulated on several social media platforms and instant messaging apps. The participants were asked to watch the #CondomEmoji advertising video before proceeding to fill out the questionnaires. Findings: Research findings suggested that participants mostly held negative attitudes and receptivity to the campaign. Non-sexually active participants were more likely to perceive the advertising as offensive. Attitudes and receptivity were good predictors for brand impression, yet attitude was not significantly attributed to intention to buy condoms. The result was stronger in sexually active participants. Research limitations/implications: Non-sexually active young people need to be more informed about healthy sexual behavior so that they would not feel embarrassed to discuss and ask about sexual behavior. A socially acceptable condom-use advertising campaign needs to be conducted to lessen the resistance of conservative audiences. Originality/value: This paper offers an insight into how conservative audiences may respond to social-media-based campaign of safer sex. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Although ethics are frequently debated within the social marketing literature, there has been very little empirical study of deliberate ethical transgressions in promoting a good cause. The current study therefore aims to contribute by examining public reaction to the Fakegate scandal involving a climate scientist’s use of ethically questionable tactics in the “selling” of the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) cause. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis catalogues the Fakegate justifications and criticisms used by eight UK and US print media editorials and 1,010 associated reader comments. Findings: Among the argument classification categories, the most common Fakegate justifications rely on a utilitarian “greater good” ethics perspective, while the most frequent criticisms rely on a normative “violation of rules” ethics perspective. AGW believers represent nearly all the scandal justifiers, while AGW skeptics and a substantial minority of AGW believers represent the critics. Research limitations/implications: Content material is limited to only the Fakegate case and people with enough interest to contribute a relevant comment, although the expressed viewpoints may be more widely representative because they are generally consistent with findings from the AGW public opinion polls. Originality/value: This study provides an understanding of the ethical dilemma that social marketers face when assigned a “difficult-to-sell” good cause. The findings of the widespread public skepticism toward the AGW cause suggest that social marketers should resist the temptation of using ethically questionable tactics in such difficult cases. Unfortunately, honest and effective AGW “selling” may be impossible until current technology and policy tradeoffs are reduced. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study aims at establishing the benefits of actively utilizing the intangible resources of solid waste management customers in designing and implementing solid waste collection services, using the social media platforms. While Ghana generates high volumes of solid waste on a daily basis, less than half of it is effectively collected and disposed of. This calls for the adoption of innovative strategies to better connect and serve customers. Adopting a marketing approach to solid waste management has not been given much needed attention in Ghana and Africa, and this research sought to contribute in that direction. There is high usage of mobile telephony services in Ghana which a waste firm can explore to change negative attitude to waste disposal by the populace. Online co-creation is seen as a modern marketing approach leading to behavioral change in consumers. In this regard, the study looked at customer online co-creation in the solid waste collection sector in Ghana. The study adopted the survey strategy using structured questionnaire as the measure instrument, and data analyzed using both the structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical multiple regression. The key findings are that customer intangible resources (online experience and skills) can be tapped by waste firms to co-create services that would generate positive attitude towards sanitation issues and the willingness to advocate the services and programs of the firm. Similarly, waste firms must invest in well-functioning and information rich digital platforms, and to devise innovative strategies to direct traffic to these platforms for effective customer participation. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Many researchers and practitioners have attempted to predict financial market trends for excess returns using multiple information sources including social media. Recent studies have investigated the relation between public sentiment and stock price movements and demonstrated that investment decisions are affected by public opinion. In this paper, we design a novel framework that combines the wisdom of crowds and technical analysis for financial market prediction using a new fusion strategy. A machine learning technique called deep random subspace ensembles (DRSE), which integrates deep learning algorithms and ensemble learning methods, is proposed according to the characteristics of the prediction task. Based on collected real-world datasets, the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline models in predicting stock market by at least 14.2% in terms of AUC value, indicating the efficacy of DRSE as a viable mechanism for financial market prediction. © 2018

AB  - We have become increasingly aware of the importance of addressing diversity across media landscapes. Whilst we are still far from a genuine appreciation for difference, media outlets that view themselves as progressive understand the value of appearing diverse. This has meant that a number of Muslim voices have risen to prominence in recent years. Often these voices have attracted the title of ‘moderate Muslim’ as they are thought to represent a non-radical politics. This paper examines how the voice of this ‘moderate Muslim’ has been co-opted by the White mainstream as a sign of inclusion and commitment to multiculturalism but emphasizes that the moderate is never truly permitted to speak. In exploring how divergent voices have been publicly disciplined and how the right to speak has been positioned as a ‘privilege’, we show how Islamophobia permits a religious population to speak only via a select few voices, denying the spectrum of narratives, ideas and dissent. We argue that one troubling consequence of this dynamic is the chilling and marginalizing effect it has on dissenting Muslim voices who seek to destabilize efforts to produce and reproduce Islamophobia’s good/bad, moderate/radical dichotomies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies – online and offline – serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Public perceptions often diverge widely from reality on the size and make-up of immigrant populations, with likely consequences for public opinion about immigration. Prior research has not established whether the media has any causal role in the construction of these perceptions. This paper examines whether and how actually occurring media portrayals of immigrants in Britain affect perceptions of immigrants among members of the British public. We begin by conducting a large-scale quantitative study of the British national press. We then report on an original survey experiment that tests for causal impact of news frames derived from the media study. Specifically, we focus on three depictions of immigrants: as ‘illegal’, Eastern European, or highly skilled. Results show that even subtle media interventions can shift public perceptions of immigration, in this case towards more realistic understandings of the overall size and make-up of the immigrant population in Britain. We suggest empirical, theoretical, and methodological implications for the study of media effects on public opinion towards immigration. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The concept of women engaging in physical recreation was anathema to late nineteenth-century Mexican society. While underlying scepticism continued throughout the decades that followed, post-Revolutionary reforms provided a surprisingly open arena within which both men and women could practice sport. We analyze how the issue of gender influenced these reforms and the degree to which this affected popular participation in sports. Identifying media coverage as a barometer of broader society’s perceptions of female sporting activity, we consider the salient trends in the Mexican press, how these changed over time, and the ways in which female journalists approached wom-en’s sport. Our findings suggest the need for caution in leaping to gender-based assumptions and provide evidence that, in some respects, male journalists became more enlightened than their female counterparts in confronting underlying prejudices. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Central and Eastern European countries, like Hungary and Slovakia, are located along the Western section of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and serve as a gateway to the European Union. Thus, the participation of the CEE region is inevitable in the BRI, and the attitude of national governments and the public opinion may have an impact on the future of EU-China relations in the framework of the new “Silk Road” connecting the East to the West. The following paper offers an introduction to the so-called 16 + 1 cooperation of China and its 16 partners in the CEE region, and analyzes the political environment, public support, and media discourse of the BRI in two selected countries of Central and Eastern Europe. © 2018, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we seek to understand the contemporary power of the presidential “bully pulpit”—the persuasive power of the nation’s highest elected office—in a context of shifting patterns of mediation. We do so by examining a major social media communication platform (Twitter) for evidence of changes in public opinion before and after President Obama’s high-profile statements on net neutrality in November 2014. This study includes novel and comprehensive data on the effects of a presidential announcement on public opinion. With social media playing a growing role in both electoral and policy discourse, this paper offers a methodological foundation for future studies in the changing nature of the presidential bully pulpit and the role of social media as a tool of mediation in political communication. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article argues for the analysis of public engagement as an essentially mediated activity. Although recent studies note that academic knowledge is increasingly available for consumption by nonacademic audiences, they tell us little about how it gets recontextualized while passing through the hands of media professionals on its way toward such audiences. In Burawoy’s (2005) influential call for the rebirth of public sociology, as in the debates his work provoked, the media is treated solely as a means for the transportation of knowledge. But as this article demonstrates, the media does not simply transport knowledge; it also, and at the same time, translates that knowledge in various, rhetorically consequential ways. Focusing on the mediated trajectory of an attempt by a group of academics to connect with audiences beyond academia, their initial contribution is compared to its subsequent translation(s) across various British newspapers. A discursive analysis reveals the techniques via which a classic form of public sociology came to be recontextualized such that, remarkably, these authors were left appearing to voice nothing but their own petty prejudices. The article concludes by noting that where public engagement involves mediation, public sociology should pay more attention to the recontextualizing affordances of media discourse. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - On 24 February 2012, then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Zambia for three days. His call to respect human rights and give protection to all people regardless of sexual orientation was received mostly with hostility by the Zambian public. The media was inundated with opposing press statements from both government and civil society persons and entities. Politicians, church leaders, and the public widely condemned Ban's advocacy for “gay rights”. Although the debate on homosexuality is not new in Zambia, there is a dearth of research on the subject. This paper seeks, modestly, to re-examine popular rationale for heterosexism to contribute to the resolution of one of the perennial problems colouring African political, social, and cultural discourse. By deconstructing the popular views and systematising the debate, the paper aims at providing a baseline and guideline for addressing the problem of heterosexism in Zambia. Without suggesting that Africa is homogenous, what happened in Zambia following Ban's visit could have predictably happened in many African countries, notably Uganda and Nigeria. This paper, however, uses Zambia as a point of reference. The paper relies on views indicating negative attitudes and beliefs that legislators, and policy makers, church leaders and ordinary citizens have toward homosexuality. These positions have been thematised into six major grounds for the sexual prejudices against homosexuality. These are subjected to logical and epistemic scrutiny. Ultimately, the arguments in support of heterosexism are shown to be untenable. © 2018, © 2018 South African Journal of Philosophy.

AB  - This study develops a model for analyzing the flow of frames and the multiple levels of framing effects in Chinese crisis communication both online and offline. To investigate the convergence and/or divergence of traditional media and social media in framing a crisis event in China, the study uses the sample of a celebrity scandal case that received extensive attention both online and offline. The empirical findings showed that crisis communicative strategies (CCSs), that is, the frames used in crisis communication, were correlated with those used in newspaper coverage (i.e. frames in representation) but were not correlated with the CCSs used by the online public (i.e. frames in thoughts). Specific and defensive CCSs, such as attacking the accusers and denial, led to fewer favorable responsibility-oriented frames than ambiguous strategies, such as excuses and justification. This finding supports the assumptions of classic situational crisis communication theory. However, none of the above-mentioned CCSs significantly predicted the relationship-oriented frames in thoughts. Relationship-oriented frames were found to be a predictor of the valence of online public opinion whereas no CCS was observed to be influential in the online public opinions expressed by social media users. © 2018, © 2018 The Centre for Chinese Media and Comparative Communication Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

AB  - In contrast to the centrality of ‘coming out’ in the gay rights movement, transgender people may be less likely to disclose their transgender status due to the severity of anti-transgender stigma, structural factors and differences in how transgender status and sexual identity are expressed. As a consequence, intergroup contact with transgender people may be less common than gay contact, which may limit its effectiveness. In Study 1 (N = 174), transgender contact was much less frequent than gay contact, and transgender contact frequency was not associated with anti-transgender bias, although more positive transgender contact was associated with lower anti-transgender bias, and gay contact frequency was also independently associated with lower anti-transgender bias. In Study 2 (N = 277), greater transgender ‘media contact’ was associated with increased empathy for transgender people and decreased anti-transgender bias. In addition, several participants left unsolicited anti-transgender comments at the end of the study, and these participants tended to have less transgender contact and were higher in right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. Our results suggest that increasing contact with the LGBT community and increasing media representations of transgender people may decrease anti-transgender bias. Future directions building on these results are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, a proof of concept study is performed to validate the use of social media signal to model the ideological coordinates underpinning the Brexit debate. We rely on geographically enriched Twitter data and a purpose-built, deep learning algorithm to map the political value space of users tweeting the referendum onto Parliamentary Constituencies. We find a significant incidence of nationalist sentiments and economic views expressed on Twitter, which persist throughout the campaign and are only offset in the last days when a globalist upsurge brings the British Twittersphere closer to a divide between nationalist and globalist standpoints. Upon combining demographic variables with the classifier scores, we find that the model explains 41% of the variance in the referendum vote, an indication that not only material inequality, but also ideological readjustments have contributed to the outcome of the referendum. We conclude with a discussion of conceptual and methodological challenges in signal-processing social media data as a source for the measurement of public opinion. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is rising faster in Asia-Pacific region of the world. Although self-protection is the best preventive measurement for AIDS. Inadequate knowledge, negative attitudes, and risky practices are identified as the key factor for the AIDS. College students constitute a vulnerable group of AIDS due to their curiosity, lack of knowledge, and risk-prone behavior. Purpose: The study aims to examine the knowledge, attitude, and awareness about HIV infection/AIDS among a group of the college students’ in Bankura district, West Bengal. Method: This study was quantitative and cross-sectional, with a descriptive design. Students have performed self-completed questionnaire, designed to measure their knowledge, attitudes, and awareness to HIV/AIDS. Results: Of the college students, 82% were aware about HIV infection/AIDS. Of which, 4.60% were found outstanding and high level of knowledge and 11.50% of students with excellent knowledge. The major sources of information on HIV infection/AIDS to 80% of respondents were electronic media and print media. Conclusion: From the survey report, we can conclude that AIDS awareness among college students of the Bankura is not satisfactorily. © 2018 BRNSS Publication Hub. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social media use can have major impacts on one’s construction of identity, sexuality, and gender. However, some social media sites exhibit problematic and prejudiced themes through their photo and video posts. This paper examines two Instagram sites specifically targeting traditionally college-aged individuals. These sites have tens of thousands of followers, post frequently, and solely focus on highlighting the college experience. Through a textual analysis of these two sites, problematic themes emerged, including objectification of female college students, submissiveness of female college students, and emphasis on a young white college experience. These themes are detailed and explored, followed by a discussion on their potential impacts on broader societal structures and ideas for education on gendered prejudices in the media. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Political campaigns’ use of digital technologies has been a topic of scholarly concern for over two decades, but most studies have been focused on analyzing the use of digital platforms without considering contextual factors of the race, like public opinion polls. Opinion polls are an important information source for citizens and candidates and provide the latter with information that might drive strategic communication. In this article, we explore the relationship between the use of social media in the 2016 US presidential elections and candidates’ standing in public opinion polls, focusing on the surfacing and primary stages of the campaign. We use automated content analysis to categorize social media posts from all 21 Republican and Democratic candidates. Results indicate that a candidate’s performance in the polls drives certain communicative strategies, such as the use of messages of attacks and advocacy, as well as the focus on personal image. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In recent years, increasing attention has been dedicated to the hazardous and volatile situation in the Middle East, a crisis which has pushed many to flee their countries and seek refuge in neighboring countries or in Europe. In describing or discussing these tragic events, labels such as “European migrant crisis” and “European refugee crisis” started being widely used by the media, politicians, and the online world alike. The use of such labels has the potential to dictate the ways in which displaced people are received and perceived. With this study, we investigate label use in social media (specifically YouTube), the emergent patterns of labeling that can cause further disaffection and tension or elicit sympathy, and the sentiments associated with the different labels. Our findings suggest that migration issues are being framed not only through labels characterizing the crisis but also by their describing the individuals themselves. Using topic modeling and sentiment analysis jointly, our study offers valuable insights into the direction of public sentiment and the nature of discussions surrounding this significant societal crisis, as well as the nature of online opinion sharing. We conclude by proposing a four-dimensional model of label interpretation in relation to sentiment—that accounts for perceived agency, economic cost, permanence, and threat, and identifies threat and agency to be most impactful. This perspective reveals important influential aspects of labels and frames that may shape online public opinion and alter attitudes toward those directly affected by the crisis. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - A seismic shift in the racial landscape of the United States occurred in 2016. The prevailing discourse about a “postracial America,” though always, in the words of Catherine Squires a “mystique,” was firmly and finally extinguished with the election of Donald J. Trump. Race, in the form of racial prejudice, erupted in Trump’s political rhetoric and in the rhetoric of his supporters. At the same time, the continued significance and consequences of racial division in America were also being asserted for politically progressive ends by the increasingly prominent #blacklivesmatter movement and by the newly opened National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, DC, not far from the White House. This article tracks the resurgence of race in the US cultural landscape against the racially depoliticized myth of the “postracial” by focusing first on the HBO television series Westworld, which epitomizes that logic. The museum, which opened its doors against the backdrop of the presidential campaign, lodges a scathing critique of the very notion of the postracial; in fact, it signals the return of race as an urgent topic of national discussion. Part of the work of the museum is to materialize race, to move race and white supremacy to the center of the American national narrative. This article points to the way the museum creates what Jacques Rancière calls “dissensus,” and thus becomes a site of possibility for politics. The museum, in its very presence on the Mall, its provocative display strategies, and its narrative that highlights profound contradictions in the very meaning of America, intervenes in what Rancière calls “the distribution of the sensible” and thus creates the conditions for reconfiguring the social order. In part, it achieves this by racializing white visitors, forcing them to feel their own race in uncomfortable ways. The article suggests that this museum, and the broader emerging discourse about race in both film and television, offers new ways to think about the political work of culture. © 2018 Duke University Press.

AB  - Background: Timely understanding of public perceptions allows public health agencies to provide up-to-date responses to health crises such as infectious diseases outbreaks. Social media such as Twitter provide an unprecedented way for the prompt assessment of the large-scale public response. Objective: The aims of this study were to develop a scheme for a comprehensive public perception analysis of a measles outbreak based on Twitter data and demonstrate the superiority of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models (compared with conventional machine learning methods) on measles outbreak-related tweets classification tasks with a relatively small and highly unbalanced gold standard training set. Methods: We first designed a comprehensive scheme for the analysis of public perception of measles based on tweets, including 3 dimensions: Discussion themes, emotions expressed, and attitude toward vaccination. All 1,154,156 tweets containing the word “measles” posted between December 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015, were purchased and downloaded from DiscoverText.com. Two expert annotators curated a gold standard of 1151 tweets (approximately 0.1% of all tweets) based on the 3-dimensional scheme. Next, a tweet classification system based on the CNN framework was developed. We compared the performance of the CNN models to those of 4 conventional machine learning models and another neural network model. We also compared the impact of different word embeddings configurations for the CNN models: (1) Stanford GloVe embedding trained on billions of tweets in the general domain, (2) measles-specific embedding trained on our 1 million measles related tweets, and (3) a combination of the 2 embeddings. Results: Cohen kappa intercoder reliability values for the annotation were: 0.78, 0.72, and 0.80 on the 3 dimensions, respectively. Class distributions within the gold standard were highly unbalanced for all dimensions. The CNN models performed better on all classification tasks than k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, or random forest. Detailed comparison between support vector machines and the CNN models showed that the major contributor to the overall superiority of the CNN models is the improvement on recall, especially for classes with low occurrence. The CNN model with the 2 embedding combination led to better performance on discussion themes and emotions expressed (microaveraging F1 scores of 0.7811 and 0.8592, respectively), while the CNN model with Stanford embedding achieved best performance on attitude toward vaccination (microaveraging F1 score of 0.8642). Conclusions: The proposed scheme can successfully classify the public’s opinions and emotions in multiple dimensions, which would facilitate the timely understanding of public perceptions during the outbreak of an infectious disease. Compared with conventional machine learning methods, our CNN models showed superiority on measles-related tweet classification tasks with a relatively small and highly unbalanced gold standard. With the success of these tasks, our proposed scheme and CNN-based tweets classification system is expected to be useful for the analysis of tweets about other infectious diseases such as influenza and Ebola. © Jingcheng Du, Lu Tang, Yang Xiang, Degui Zhi, Jun Xu, Hsing-Yi Song, Cui Tao.

AB  - Of the many influences on how Moroccan people perceive the Moroccan woman, Moroccan digital media is presumably the most powerful tool used throughout; in fact, Moroccan digital media direct the public opinion, frame specific images, and perpetuate both realistic and unrealistic speculations about the Moroccan woman, whose voice is carefully selected and whose presence goes sometimes reported and at other times unreported. This article is a deep reflection of the overall images chosen to manufacture consensus about the Moroccan woman in the Moroccan digital media; more specifically, emphasis is going to be laid on how Hespress, as an emerging Moroccan news outlet, advertises different conceptions and representations about the Moroccan woman at home and overseas. The article is predicated on the notion of framing news stories, which propel journalists to decide on what is newsworthy and what is not. The researcher’s pivotal argument is that a process of selection is obviously developed by Hespress in its dealing with and detailing on the question of the Moroccan woman. Put otherwise, a large space is arguably accorded to certain women who have outperformed their peers in many vital sectors of life and led successful stories nationwide. As for those women, whose stories do not correlate with the policy and the editorial line of Hespress, they are devoiced and still marginalized. To address this topic more effectively, the researcher suggests utilizing a multimodal analysis to the discourse of Hespress about the Moroccan woman. A preliminary examination of the literature documenting the media’s discourse about her will be considered. Then, an elaboration of the methodology adopted will be explored. Finally, some pedagogical recommendations will be advanced in this article to enable students promote critical reading and hone not only their analytical but also their interpretative skills as concerns Hespress discourse on the Moroccan woman. © 2018 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - In this study, we examined exposure to stereotypical movie portrayals of American Indians, motivations to respond without prejudice, and awareness of White privilege on racist attitudes. European American participants (N = 232) were randomly assigned to watch stereotypical representations of American Indians or control videos. Hierarchical regression results revealed that higher internal motivations to respond without prejudice and awareness were associated with lower levels of racist attitudes. Higher external motivations to respond without prejudice were associated with higher levels of modern racist attitudes. For participants high in awareness, there was no significant difference in modern racist attitudes between the control and stereotype conditions. For participants low in awareness, those in the control condition reported lower modern racist attitudes than those in the stereotype condition. Results suggest awareness is an important predictor of lower racist attitudes but needs to be reconceptualized within the counseling literature. Social justice implications and limitations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The long distance export of livestock from Australia to Asia has long aroused controversy for suspected animal welfare concerns during and after the voyage. However, there is little or no information on the attitude of the Australian public towards this trade. A total of 522 Australians were surveyed in Brisbane to find out about their understanding of the trade, their attitudes towards it and the influence of demographic factors. Approximately one half of respondents were surveyed just before a media exposé of cruelty on sheep shipments in 2017 from Australia to the Middle East and one half just after the exposé, to see the impact of media depiction of cruel treatment of live export sheep. Most respondents believed that they were familiar with the industry, and more after the media exposé than before. More respondents had negative than positive feelings about the trade, and just over a quarter had no feelings. Twice as many thought it should be ended than maintained, particularly women, but 40% said that it depends, mainly on ethics and animal-based reasons. Those that thought it should not be ended mainly did so to support farmers and the country’s economy. Almost one half had seen the media exposé, particularly older respondents, and expressions of sadness, empathy for the animals and anger were the most common responses to such footage. Although it increased the number of people saying that they were familiar with the trade, it did not affect people’s view of the trade, except that fewer indicated that ending the trade was dependent on other factors. It is concluded that the majority of Australian respondents in one capital city had negative views towards the live export trade, and that a media exposé had some influence on this view. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Popular social media platforms have faced recent criticism because of the tendency for users to exhibit strongly negative behaviors, threatening the open, prodemocratic discourse that proponents believe was made possible when social media sites first gained widespread adoption a decade ago. A conceptual model suggests that the microblogging site Twitter, and especially sportthemed debate through hashtags, can still realize these ideals. Analyzing a dataset of tweets about the firing of former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling by ESPN on April 20, 2016, as well as a qualitative questionnaire given to the users of the hashtag, this study attempted to ascertain how closely the discourse comes to realizing the ideal of the Habermasian public sphere. The findings demonstrate that although users draw value from participation in the discussion, they are less inclined to desire interaction with other hashtag users, particularly those who disagree with them. This suggests that Twitter hashtags provide an open forum that approaches the participatory requirement of the public sphere, but the lack of back-and-forth engagement suggests the medium is not ideal for the generation of deliberative public opinion. © 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - This research explores the role of weathercasters as local climate change educators and identifies attributes of those who present climate science to their viewers. In 2015, the authors attempted to survey all television weathercasters currently working in the United States (n 5 2128); 478 participated, yielding a 22.5% participation rate. Using logistic regression to identify attributes of weathercasters who report on climate change on-air, it was found that the strongest predictors were participation in Climate Matters (a climate change reporting resource program) (b 5 1.01, p, 0.001), personal interest in reporting on climate change (b 5 0.93, p, 0.001), age (higher rates of reporting among older weathercasters) (b 5 0.301, p, 0.05), and number of climate reporting interests (b 5 1.37, p, 0.05). Linear regression was used to identify attributes of weathercasters who showed the most interest in climate change reporting. Weathercasters most interested in reporting about climate change on-air were more certain that climate change is happening (b 5 0.344, p, 0.001), were convinced climate change is human caused (b 5 0.226, p, 0.001), were older (b 5 0.157, p, 0.001), and found the Third National Climate Assessment to be useful (b 5 0.134, p, 0.05). Weathercasters who are personally motivated to seek and share broad scientific information, acting as ‘‘station scientists,’’ appear to be those who are also proactive in sharing climate change information. Assisting motivated weathercasters with programs that reduce barriers to climate change education outreach complements their abilities to educate the public regarding climate change science. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Background: Although suicide experts recommend using neutral suicide referents in news media reporting, this recommendation has not yet been tested empirically. This recommendation, based on the empirically yet untested assumption that problematic suicide referents carry meaning that is inappropriate from a prevention perspective, may lead to a different perspective on suicide, termed “framing effects.” For example, in German-speaking countries, the neutral term Suizid (suicide) is recommended. Conversely, Freitod (“free death”) and Selbstmord (“self-murder”) convey associative meanings related to problematic concepts such as free will (Freitod) and crime/murder (Selbstmord), and are therefore not recommended. Method: Using a web-based randomized controlled trial focused on German speakers (N = 451), we tested whether the news media's use of Suizid, Selbstmord, and Freitod elicits framing effects. Participants read identical news reports about suicide. Only the specific suicide referents varied depending on the experimental condition. Post-reading, participants wrote short summaries of the news reports, completed a word-fragment completion test and a questionnaire targeting suicide-related attitudes. Results: We found that the news frame primed some frame-related concepts in the memory and also increased frame-related word choice. Importantly, we found that participants reading the free will-related Freitod frame showed greater attitudinal support for suicide among individuals suffering from incurable diseases. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of how the news media write about suicide and supports the language recommendations put forward by suicide experts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper analyses how people negotiate representations of other cultures in the media, in particular those traits that can be considered controversial in the sense of generating strong opinions and opposing stances. A news story about an Egyptian television channel run by Egyptian women journalists wearing the niqab (Maria TV) was used to stimulate debate in four focus groups. Although most of the participants initially criticized the approach adopted by the television channel, they also expressed opinions on journalists in niqab that agreed with the representation proposed by the channel. The article shows that even though audiences may seem capable of criticizing media biases, they do not recognize their own internalized prejudices and, ultimately, accept the discourse proposed by media. © 2018, Immigrant Institutet.

AB  - Child abuse in New Zealand is a matter of ongoing concern for the government, public officials, health practitioners and wider society, with most information on the issue coming from mass media, which have played an influential role in forming public opinion. This study investigates the coverage of serious child abuse between November 2007 and November 2009 in three largest New Zealand newspapers: The New Zealand Herald, The Dominion Post and The Press. The analysis of 205 articles shows that three-quarters of the data described severe physical abuse and/or death, and one-quarter described sexual abuse. More than half of all media pieces (56%) represented reporting of ‘crime stories’, such as police and court reports, in addition to statistical data, recommendations and critique (44%). Two cases of Nia Glassie and the Kahui twins’ deaths were sensationalised by the media and were described or mentioned in 63 articles altogether. The dominant construction of child abuse as a ‘Māori issue’ was achieved through individual framing, focused on the personalities of the perpetrators and their inferred innate characteristics, such as being prone to violence and dysfunctional by nature, which were further generalised to Māori society as a whole. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - With the advent of social media, individual public opinions about firms can be more easily accessed and aggregated, and recent research suggests that various platforms, such as Twitter, Seeking Alpha, and Estimize, provide information relevant in predicting future corporate disclosures. Rather than focusing on the general public's opinion, we examine a public platform designed to convey insider information - Glassdoor.com, where employees voluntarily share their opinions on a number of issues, including the company's near-term business outlook. Using a sample of approximately 150,000 employee reviews, we extract both employees’ explicit assessments of outlook and a measure of their latent outlook derived from factor analysis. We then examine whether the opinions employees share on social media relate to future corporate disclosures. In particular, we find evidence that employee opinions are useful in predicting growth in key income statement information, transitory reporting items (e.g., restructuring charges), earnings surprises, and management forecast news. While voluntary disclosures about firm performance have traditionally come from executives, our evidence suggests that rank-and-file employees are chipping away at upper-level management's exclusive control over that channel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

By analyzing open-ended responses in the 2012 American National Election Study using a previously validated dictionary, I find systematic ideological differences in moral reasoning, even when respondents are not explicitly asked about morality. The study proceeds to show that the reliance on moral considerations in attitude expression is amplified by the moral content of individual media environments. © 2018 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - Frailty has become the focus of considerable research interest and media attention over the past 15 years. While it has much to offer geriatric medicine, potential pitfalls also need to be acknowledged. The conceptualisation of frailty in very different ways-as a syndrome or a risk state-has created semantic dissonance: the frailest patients by one definition may have early sarcopenia, by another be bedbound and in institutional care. Caution is required in transferring findings between studies enroling these different populations. Furthermore, a yawning gap has emerged between the number of studies reporting the associations of frailty and those investigating interventions such that the empirical benefits of identifying and treating frailty currently remain unclear. Perhaps most importantly, frailty research has evolved with little account of the perspectives and preferences of patients themselves. The label of 'frail', being linked to mental or moral weakness, has pejorative implications and care should be taken to avoid the adverse functional effects of negative priming. Here, we suggest pathways for future studies to provide a stronger evidence base to apply this important concept. This research is essential to avoid frailty becoming the new cloak of ageism, a tool for discrimination and disempowerment applied to the most vulnerable. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Punitive populism is common throughout Latin America. It involves political and public opinion support for more police officers, greater police autonomy, and tougher laws to punish crime—options that often perpetuate old police practices and resist police reform efforts. This article critically examines the role of the media in fostering punitive populism by examining the sources used by journalists. Comparing the ‘most different’ cases of Argentina and Chile and drawing on interviews conducted from 2009 to 2015, I argue that the choices made by journalists regarding their sources are affected by neoliberal media policies in a particular way that favours tough-on-crime discourses. © 2018 The Author.

AB  - The implicit association test (IAT) and concept of implicit bias have significantly influenced the scientific, institutional, and public discourse on racial prejudice. In spite of this, there has been little investigation of how ordinary people make sense of the IAT and the bias it claims to measure. This article examines the public understanding of this research through a discourse analysis of reactions to the IAT and implicit bias in the news media. It demonstrates the ways in which readers interpreted, related to, and negotiated the claims of IAT science in relation to socially shared and historically embedded concerns and identities. IAT science was discredited in accounts that evoked discourses about the marginality of academic preoccupations, and helped to position test-takers as targets of an oppressive political correctness and psychologists as liberally biased. Alternatively, the IAT was understood to have revealed widely and deeply held biases towards racialized others, eliciting accounts that took the form of psychomoral confessionals. Such admissions of bias helped to constitute moral identities for readers that were firmly positioned against racial bias. Our findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the IAT in prejudice reduction interventions, and communicating to the public about implicit bias. © 2018 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Statistics about citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services are required for governing urban areas. Such statistics are often unavailable or outdated. At times, existing statistics are irrelevant to the major problems of most citizens. In this article, we propose a cost-effective method for estimating citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services using crowdsourced place data. Two indicators are proposed based on place data derived from the Foursquare social media application. Both indicators are based on the hypothesis that the higher the number of places is that belong to a facility or service type on social media, then the higher the satisfaction of citizens regarding this facility or service type will be. This hypothesis was tested by using the Eurobarometer survey data as reference. The accuracy assessment revealed strong and statistically significant linear relationships (R2 ˃ 0.6) between the reference percentage of very satisfied citizens and some categories (i.e. “Sport facilities”, “Cultural Categories,” and “Streets &amp; buildings”). Other categories showed moderate and statistically significant linear relationships (i.e. “Public spaces” and “Green spaces”). Therefore, the proposed indicators provide estimates about citizen satisfaction with regard to these five categories. The new indicators can be used to better design public opinion surveys by making them more relevant to the public in terms of topics, space, and time. © 2016, The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - We describe a student-centered, hands-on conservational program designed to alter adolescent environmental values and cognitive knowledge. The values (defined as sets of attitudes towards nature conservation) were measured using the 2-MEV scale (Two Major Environmental Values: Preservation, Utilization). Pre-existing knowledge levels and subsequent cognitive learning (short-, medium- and long-term) were scored on the basis of the three knowledge dimensions (system knowledge: Sys, action-related knowledge: Act and effectiveness knowledge: Eff ). Two hundred and seventy-one 6th to 8th graders, unaware of the testing schedules, completed our questionnaires two weeks before (T0), immediately after (T1), six weeks after (T2) and six months (T3) after participation in our nature and wildlife conservation program module. The linear mixed effects model (LMM) was used to analyze the relationships of cognitive knowledge with Preservation and Utilization: high Preservation scores predicted high overall pre-knowledge for all three knowledge types. High Utilization scores correlated with low pre-knowledge scores for all knowledge types. For Preservation, this positive relationship remained constant at all testing schedules. Utilization and knowledge acquisition correlated negatively in both the short (six weeks) and long terms (six months). Students scoring high on Preservation knew more, learned more, and forgot less in the short term than the low scorers. Students scoring high on Utilization briefly added cognitive knowledge immediately after the intervention, though this disappeared again in the short term. Educators are advised to build upon existing values and adjust their teaching on nature conservation issues accordingly. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A majority of Americans identify as sports fans, and sports broadcasts attract substantially larger audiences than news on both broadcast and cable television. But despite the outsize role of sports in American life, we know little about how-or whether-sports fandom is related to political attitudes. This paper draws on a representative survey to examine (1) the association between sports fandom and political opinions; and (2) opposition to the “politicization” of sports. Republicans and Democrats are equally likely to follow sports closely. However, sports fandom is positively associated with individualistic attributions for economic success and support for the US military. In addition, conservatives are more likely to resist the intrusion of partisan politics into sports. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - What explains public opinion toward transgender people, rights, and candidates? Drawing on original data from a national telephone survey of US adults, this study explains attitudes regarding (1) the personal characteristics of transgender people; (2) a variety of transgender rights; and (3) transgender candidates for public office, measured through a randomized experiment included in the survey. Results indicate majority support on most policy questions, but more tepid views of transgender people, and solid opposition to supporting a transgender candidate for office. Our analyses reflect and extend previous research on American public opinion. Respondents' fundamental values (egalitarianism, moral traditionalism, party identity, ideology, and religiosity) and personality characteristics (need for cognitive closure) predict views of transgender people and support for their rights. A significant relationship also emerged between television use and views of transgender people, suggesting that media portrayals may play a role in shaping these perceptions. In contrast, there is no evidence that interpersonal contact with a transgender person is related to opinions. Further, many of these independent variables have little moderating effect on responses to transgender candidates, which remain negative among most subgroups. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The article focuses on Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech and its recontextualisation 50 years later in view of the rising anti-immigration sentiment and Brexit campaign. Having discussed the dynamics of the threat construction process and its role in shaping public attitudes to migration and policies related to it across time and space, we proceed to analyse Powell's speech in terms of lexical, grammatical, and discursive fear-inciting devices and strategies. While doing so we draw on the insights from neuroscientific research on the role of lexis in fear stimulation and functional-cognitive models of grammatical structure. The second part of our analysis is meant to demonstrate how the semiotic potential of cyberspace and social media, along with multimodal integration of various forms, intertextuality, and interdiscursivity they enable, endow fear-inciting discourse with new spatiotemporal and affective qualities. To this end we examine one of the most popular YouTube videos making "Rivers of Blood" speech part of its anti-immigration stance. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - On the basis of internet forum and press media data, this article studies the expression of hostile attitudes towards multilingualism and multiculturalism in the context of debates about immigration. The forum data are drawn from the BBC's Have Your Say website, which is a moderated forum that excludes polemical and abusive postings. Nevertheless, it still seems to provide its users ample opportunity for airing strongly anti-immigrant attitudes. The narratives in which these attitudes are being expressed are exemplary stories of the posters' supposed encounters with the use of foreign languages in the street, in the workplace or at school. This presence of foreign languages in the British public sphere is evaluated as being (at least) problematic and is "explained" as a result of mass immigration, which serves to reinforce the scenario of a culture mix that will destroy British "home" culture. Media coverage of immigration partly supports such vilification of multilingualism and multiculturalism, and the reports and comments often seem to be drawn from similar narrative-argumentative templates as those of the discussions on Have Your Say. In conclusion, we argue that counterspeech informed by Critical Discourse Analysis has to develop alternative narratives and figurative scenarios that question the bias against linguistic and cultural diversity. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as larger enterprises, generate economic, social, and environmental impacts on their environment. However, in the case of these types of enterprises, the accumulation of these impacts is very significant in the immediate surroundings where they offer their products and services. This discussion is particularly relevant in Ecuador, where 99% of all enterprises are SMEs. The objective of this research is to find out if small and medium-sized enterprises in this country are involved in the adoption of sustainable practices as well as see if there are significant differences in adoption based on size, sector, and age. The methodology used is the performance of a descriptive analysis and regression of the data obtained through a structured questionnaire (indicators of the Ethos Institute of Brazil). Previously, the reliability of the questionnaire was validated through an exploratory factor analysis. The target population consists of 9843 enterprises, obtaining a sample size of 188 valid surveys, which implies a response rate of 2%, representing a sampling error of ±7.08%. The results obtained enabled us to perform a sustainability diagnosis of SMEs in Ecuador, identifying the strengths and weaknesses. The managers have a positive and favourable attitude towards sustainability. The practices considered show a medium-high implementation level of 79.71% in economic sustainability, 82.28% in social sustainability, and 78.14% in environmental sustainability in the enterprises considered in the sample. Although these percentages are significant, there is plenty of scope for improvement. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine consumers from distinct cultural groups and identify similarities and differences in their green purchase behaviors. The sample consisted of consumers from the U.S.A. and South Korea and the theory of planned behavior was used as a theoretical framework to test the influence of diverse constructs on consumers' purchase intentions toward organic cotton apparel. For both countries, perceived behavioral control (PBC) and descriptive norms were strong predictors of purchase intentions and injunctive norms strongly influenced attitude formation. However, the study also found different results between the two groups. For example, while attitude was the strongest predictor of purchase intentions in the U.S.A. group (strength of influence on intentions: attitude > descriptive norms > PBC > injunctive norms), it had an insignificant effect in the South Korea group. For the South Korea group descriptive norms and PBC had strongest effects on consumers purchase intentions (strength of influence on intentions: descriptive norms = PBC > injunctive norms > attitude). South Koreans were more affected by the social pressure: their purchase intentions were strongly influenced by both injunctive norms and descriptive norms in contrast to the findings from American consumers. Injunctive norms were an insignificant predictor of purchase intentions in the U.S.A. group. This result is consistent with previous research that suggest conformity is a crucial factor for people belonging to a collectivistic culture. Exposure of others' purchasing behavior is particularly important in motivating consumers' buying in collectivistic culture. Marketers of organic cotton apparel may consider using diverse formats of media to display consumers' ethical buying behaviors or creating product design or packaging that can directly reveal the ethical features of the product to display greater exposure in the market. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as a major global health threat. Having access to any type of information in social media has been suggested as a potential influence on the growth of anti-vaccination groups. Recent studies w.r.t. other topics than vaccination show that access to a wide amount of content through the Internet without intermediaries resolved into major segregation of the users in polarized groups. Users select information adhering to theirs system of beliefs and tend to ignore dissenting information. Objectives: The goal was to assess whether users’ attitudes are polarized on the topic of vaccination on Facebook and how this polarization develops over time. Methods: We perform a thorough quantitative analysis by studying the interaction of 2.6 M users with 298,018 Facebook posts over a time span of seven years and 5 months. We applied community detection algorithms to automatically detect the emergence of communities accounting for the users’ activity on the pages. Also, we quantified the cohesiveness of these communities over time. Results: Our findings show that the consumption of content about vaccines is dominated by the echo chamber effect and that polarization increased over the years. Well-segregated communities emerge from the users’ consumption habits i.e., the majority of users consume information in favor or against vaccines, not both. Conclusion: The existence of echo chambers may explain why social-media campaigns that provide accurate information have limited reach and be effective only in sub-groups, even fomenting further opinion polarization. The introduction of dissenting information into a sub-group is disregarded and can produce a backfire effect, thus reinforcing the pre-existing opinions within the sub-group. Public health professionals should try to understand the contents of these echo chambers, for example by getting passively involved in such groups. Only then it will be possible to find effective ways of countering anti-vaccination thinking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research applies a positive stereotype perspective to test the effect of individuals' choices between pro-environmental versus pro-safety behavior, while considering the role of media exposure. We test our hypotheses in China, where both food-safety and environment are major issues and are widely covered by the media and government reports. Based on a quasi-experiments and survey questionnaires focused on attitudes towards disposable chopsticks, we find that individuals form cognitive perceptions in ways that either have stronger positive environmental or safety stereotypes. Based on these stereotypes, they either believe that reusable chopsticks are more environmentally friendly or that disposable chopsticks are safer, each impacting individuals' choices differently. In addition, awareness of information related to the environment augments the link between environmental stereotypes and pro-environmental behavior, while having no influence on the effect of safety stereotypes on pro-safety behavior. On the other hand, while awareness of safety-related information accentuates the link between safety-related stereotypes and pro-safety behavior, it has no impact on the effect of environmental stereotypes on pro-environmental behavior. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) have become a debated issue for tobacco control over recent years. In this study we investigate how Chinese newspapers have covered E-cigarettes over the past ten years. Methods: The study analyses the salience, patterns and content of news articles pertaining to E-cigarettes in regional and national Chinese outlets. A total of 476 articles are examined via content analysis and supervised automatic text analysis. The manual content analysis generates a coding scheme, which is then validated and applied to machine learning. The whole research methodology demonstrates satisfying human-human and human-to-computer reliabilities. Results: The study reveals that E-cigarettes have not received enough attention in terms of its salience in the media, though the amount of coverage has been growing. A large share of the articles is published around May of each year - which is when the No Tobacco Day of the WHO takes place. The results point to four major themes on E-cigarettes: nicotine/constituents/features, tobacco control/regulation, children's use of E-cigarettes, and tobacco market/industry. Conclusions: Overall, E-cigarettes have not been a topic at the top of media agenda; however, we have identified a considerable growth of coverage about the potential concerns regarding young people's adoption of E-cigarettes advocated by parents and educators. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the factors that are related to Small and Medium Enterprises' (SMEs') environmental attitude. We focus on Spain and Norway-two contrasting countries in this regard. Drawing on evidence from the Flash Eurobarometer 381 Survey: SMEs, Resource Efficiency and Green Markets, the results show that there is a significant difference on environmental commitment in favor of Norway. Our estimation results show that firms' structural characteristics are strong factors influencing attitudes towards environmental responsibility, but even after controlling for such firm-specific differences, Norwegian firms still show a higher probability for a pro-environmental attitude. Moreover, our estimation results also show that the drivers for firms to go beyond environmental legislation are not the same in the two countries. Norwegian firms are more market-driven than Spanish firms in their pro-environmental attitude. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The current study examined conversations on Twitter related to use and perceptions of e-cigarettes in the United States. We employed the Social Media Analytic and Research Testbed (SMART) dashboard, which was used to identify and download (via a public API) e-cigarette-related geocoded tweets. E-cigarette-related tweets were collected continuously using customized geo-targeted Twitter APIs. A total of 193,051 tweets were collected between October 2015 and February 2016. Of these tweets, a random sample of 973 geocoded tweets were selected and manually coded for information regarding source, context, and message characteristics. Our findings reveal that although over half of tweets were positive, a sizeable portion was negative or neutral. We also found that, among those tweets mentioning a stigma of e-cigarettes, most confirmed that a stigma does exist. Conversely, among tweets mentioning the harmfulness of e-cigarettes, most denied that e-cigarettes were a health hazard. These results suggest that current efforts have left the public with ambiguity regarding the potential dangers of e-cigarettes. Consequently, it is critical to communicate the public health stance on this issue to inform the public and provide counterarguments to the positive sentiments presently dominating conversations about e-cigarettes on social media. The lack of awareness and need to voice a public health position on e-cigarettes represents a vital opportunity to continue winning gains for tobacco control and prevention efforts through health communication interventions targeting e-cigarettes. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study employs the uses and gratifications perspective to examine the motives that led a sample of 466 university students in Egypt to view television news and political programs and whether those motives and the frequency of exposure to media predict political efficacy, support for democracy, and political cynicism. The outcomes revealed that motives for viewing were Support in Discussions, Watchdog on Government, Reinforcement, Opinion Formation, Information, and the Free Marketplace of Information. Although Support in Discussions predicted political efficacy and the Free Marketplace of Information negatively predicted it, levels of prediction were not powerful. Support for democracy was weakly predicted by Information, Support in Discussions, the Free Marketplace of Information, and Watchdog on Government. Political cynicism was not predicted by any media variables. The motives for media use are discussed in relation to the political psyche of Egyptians and the political conditions affecting Egypt after the revolution. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - News reporting on conflict situations mainly manipulates discursive and representational strategies in portraying people, actions and events either negatively or positively based on certain prejudiced ideologies. This article examines salient discursive strategies deployed by Nigerian and Cameroonian newspapers to represent socio-political ideologies in their reports on the Bakassi Peninsula border conflict. Data comprise 127 instances of discourse strategies drawn from two Nigerian and two Cameroonian English-medium national newspapers published between August 2006 and August 2010. By integrating insights from van Dijk’s Critical Discourse Analysis, findings reveal that both countries’ reports create polarity of positive in-group and negative out-group ideologies through seven discursive strategies which include slanted headlining, negative labelling, evidentiality, number game, hyperbolism, victimization and depersonalization. The strategies embody ideological prejudices of positive self- and negative other-representations which are rife in both nations’ news reports on the disputed Peninsula. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This paper introduces 'Recording of Oral History' as a suitable pedagogical tool to inculcate the spirit of inclusiveness, respect for History, feeling of community, bridging knowledge gaps, understanding the importance of public opinion, understanding the meaning and nature of interpretation, respect for diverse perspectives besides learning the skill to conduct fruitful interviews. The pedagogy also sits well with the advances in the digital humanities in liberal arts. The students of 'Interpretative Reporting' Semester III of MA, Mass Communication and Journalism, School of Communication Studies, Panjab University, interviewed senior citizens to collect and record their memories of changing circumstances with time. The interviewees recounted their experiences - historical and personal - creating a veritable memory bank of, 'Then' and 'Now'. As unique as they are similar, their stories are oral histories that were recorded and presented using 'Guide to Transcribing and Summarizing Oral Histories of the Columbia River Highway Project' (Mershon, 2010).At the end of this exercise the effort to bridge the gap between the digital native students and digital immigrant adults around them is successful. © 2017, Journal of Content, Community & Communication.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed the emigration of young Spanish people searching for labor opportunities. A decade after the beginning of the worldwide economic crisis in 2007, the rapid deterioration of living conditions and lack of opportunities for personal development combined with the breakdown of professional expectations have led thousands of young people to emigrate from Spain, creating the so-called youth exodus. The press has paid recurrent attention to this phenomenon, often using eye-catching headlines such as ‘Brain Drain’. Given the regular interest of the media in this phenomenon, the objective of this research is to analyze the media coverage of the drain of Spanish talent capital, or the emigration of young Spanish people seeking a better future, to create a distributive map that defines the characteristics and trends of this coverage. The analyzed corpus comprises 346 articles from eight Spanish and eleven international newspapers. The articles were coded based on descriptive variables (i.e., author, publication year, newspaper and language) and categorical variables (i.e., section, method, approach to the phenomenon, assessment of the phenomenon and overview of the phenomenon). The results indicate a significant increase in press coverage over the past few years and reveal associations between assessment of the phenomenon and year and between assessment of the phenomenon and section. As a result of this research, new investigative lines are unveiled regarding the social construction of the phenomenon in the media and the identity and individual construction of the ‘truncated careers’ of young Spanish people. © 2018 Selva, Recordà.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to systematically analyze and describe the tone of media coverage of the nursing home sector and its relationship to other dimensions of the coverage reported. Through a search of the LexisNexis database, 16,280 articles were identified from 51 U.S. newspapers from 1999 to 2008. Articles were analyzed for tone, themes, prominence, central actor, and issue jurisdiction. Multinomial logit was used to examine the correlates of tone. Most articles were negative (36.9 percent) or neutral (45.5 percent) in tone; very few were positive (12.6 percent) or mixed (5.0 percent). Differences in tone were noted with regard to article placement and content. Findings highlight the preponderance of negative coverage and suggest that its adverse influence on public attitudes toward nursing homes may be enhanced by its prominence and focus on state/local concerns and industry interests/behavior. Future research should examine the relationship between media coverage and government agendas and outcomes related to nursing homes. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization

AB  - This article investigates the impact of the deliberative quality of online news items on argument repertoire. Participants in an online experiment (N = 557) read a news item that covers a local debate on underground CO2 storage. Two dimensions of deliberative quality are manipulated: justification, or the extent to which arguments in the news item are substantiated, and constructive debate climate, that is, the extent to which stakeholders are reported to work together toward a solution. The findings suggest that public opinion quality would be higher, if news media would better meet deliberative standards. © The Author 2016.

AB  - The current experimental study (N = 546) compares the effect of exposure to a television news story with a positive and negative tone on anti-immigrant attitudes and carry-over effects to uninvolved immigrant groups. Results reveal that exposure to a "negatively" valenced news story about North African immigrants increased negative attitudes toward that same group. Importantly, however, we find carryover effects of exposure to a "positively" valenced news story about North African immigrants to attitudes toward uninvolved immigrant grops. Together, these findings show that the effect of exposure to television news tone has more ramifications than previously thought, and that the impact of exposure to a positive or negative news story differs for direct effects vis-à-vis carry-over effects. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Social media use continues to grow among pathologists. Discussions of current topics, posts of educational information, and images of pathological entities are commonly found and distributed on popular sites such as Facebook and Twitter. However, little is known about the presence of neuropathology content in social media and the audience for such content. We designed and distributed a survey to assess the demographics of users viewing neuropathology content and their opinions about neuropathology in social media. User posts on the Facebook group, Surgical Neuropathology, were also analyzed. The results show that there is a demand for neuropathology content of high quality, curated by experts, and that this demand is present among both specialists and nonspecialists. These findings suggest that social media may be useful for rapid dissemination of information in the field of neuropathology. This format also offers a unique opportunity to extend the reach of information to nonneuropathologists who may not receive neuropathology journals or have access to specialty-level neuropathology training, to build networks between professionals, and potentially to influence public opinion of neuropathology on an international scale. © 2018 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

AB  - This paper focuses on digital behaviour, self-assessment of vulnerabilities to digital disinformation, and patterns of trust as exposed by Romanian citizens. By corroborating the data of the first national public opinion survey on fake news and disinformation (implemented between February and March 2018) with the Special Eurobarometer no. 464 - Fake News and Disinformation Online - implemented in the same time frame (February 2018), we capture the perceptions and attitudes of Romanian citizens over the use of new media and news trustworthiness, and we also compare the Romanians' online behaviour with the average European's. As similar research reveals, digital disinformation affects resilience of citizens in Member States and in the European Union overall, it "threatens the democratic political processes and values" (European Commission, 2018: 12), the integrity of elections and political processes, and should therefore, be approached as a legitimate public concern. Our paper opens the floor for more dedicated research and applied policies - at both the Member States and EU levels - aimed at mitigating the rising and ever worrying fake news phenomenon. © 2018, European Institute of Romania.

AB  - There is no doubt that politicians exert a significant impact on stock markets. The evolving financial market volatility over the United States presidential election is a prime example of how elections have an impact on financial markets. This study assessed whether BRICS stock markets were equally vulnerable to Trump’s agenda using event-study methodology and regression-based intention votes over a period of 120 days toward the final election result on 08 November 2016. It was shown that although Trump’s win had a negative effect on some markets, it had a positive effect on others. It had the most adverse impact on China together with Brazil. Although not to the same degree as these two countries, India and South Africa were also affected negatively. These adverse reactions can be explained by Trump’s neo-mercantilist attitude, which involves cancelling trade deals and instituting tariffs. However, the effects on Russia appear to be positive due to the expectations about the easing of sanctions imposed on Russia because of the Russian role in the conflict of Ukraine. © 2018-Center for Economic Integration, Sejong Institution, Sejong University, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and "criminals." First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump's statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages' effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background Technological advancements, such as patient-centered smartphone applications, have enabled to support self-management of the disease. Further, the accessibility to health information through the Internet has grown tremendously. This article aimed to investigate how big data can be useful to assess the impact of a celebrity's rheumatic disease on the public opinion. Methods Variable tools and statistical/computational approaches have been used, including massive data mining of Google Trends, Wikipedia, Twitter, and big data analytics. These tools were mined using an in-house script, which facilitated the process of data collection, parsing, handling, processing, and normalization. Results From Google Trends, the temporal correlation between "Anna Marchesini" and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) queries resulted 0.66 before Anna Marchesini's death and 0.90 after Anna Marchesini's death. The geospatial correlation between "Anna Marchesini" and RA queries resulted 0.45 before Anna Marchesini's death and 0.52 after Anna Marchesini's death. From Wikitrends, after Anna Marchesini's death, the number of accesses to Wikipedia page for RA has increased 5770%. From Twitter, 1979 tweets have been retrieved. Numbers of likes, retweets, and hashtags have increased throughout time. Conclusions Novel data streams and big data analytics are effective to assess the impact of a disease in a famous person on the laypeople. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the causes of fluctuations in public concern about immigration and contends that issues emphasized in media coverage explain these fluctuations. Drawing on agenda-setting research and theories about issue attributes, it is argued that media emphasis on aspects of immigration that are likely to be unobtrusive but with potentially concrete consequences for the public is likely to raise concern about immigration far more than unobtrusive but abstract issues. The analysis, based on public opinion data and newspaper articles on the topic of immigration to the U.K., shows that press emphasis on two unobtrusive but concrete issues within the theme of immigration - the economy and education - appears to increase concern about immigration; emphasis on more abstract issues evokes little reaction from the British public. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Background: In October 2016, the first French drug consumption room (DCR) opened in Paris. We propose to examine the process through which this issue has been framed as a matter of public concern, after being ignored for almost 20 years. Our analysis of the controversy on DCRs investigates how public conversations on harm reduction evolve according to the time period (from the 1990s to the present), scale of discourse (local vs. national), and involved actors (politicians, professionals, local residents, and drug users). Methodology: Our methodology includes analyses of media content: we reviewed 1735 articles published between 1990 and 2017. Our theoretical approach is in line with the sociology “des épreuves” derived from pragmatic sociology and controversy analysis. This approach goes beyond interactionism by attempting to place situations back into broader sociological realities. We also pay special attention to governance, a political lens that focuses on local aspects of negotiations and on the implication of a variety of actors. Results: While the current debate on DCRs in France draws on constraints and resources already present in the harm reduction debate of the 1980s, it also repositions itself by avoiding moral argumentation and featuring less confrontation in the professional sphere. Today, we can see that the center of this tense debate has shifted from the professional sphere to the political and residential spheres. Most often, residents advance concerns that are not directly related to drug users themselves, but that derive from their apprehension of living in a displaced and stranded neighborhood. The public conversation leaves little room for drug users, even though they are the primary stakeholders of harm reduction and play a crucial role in DCR advocacy. Conclusion: Our work reveals that the controversy about DCR is the product of complex interactions between different kinds of actors harm reduction professionals, political actors at the local and national levels, local residents, and drug users. Comparing different instances of public debate reveals the specific limitations and potentials for change in French drug policy. © 2018

AB  - This article adds to earlier research revealing that the American news media did not discharge their responsibility as a watchdog press in the post-9/11 years by failing to scrutinize extreme and unlawful government policies and actions, most of all the decision to invade Iraq based on false information about Saddam Hussein’s alleged weapons of mass destruction arsenal. The content analyses presented here demonstrate that leading US news organizations, both television and print, did not expressly refer to human rights violations when they reported on the torturing of foreign detainees during “enhanced interrogations” in US-run prison facilities abroad and the killing of civilians, including children, in US drone strikes overseas and outside theaters of war. Moreover, by framing torture and the “collateral damage” caused by drone-launched missile attacks episodically rather than in the context of human rights, the news media failed to alert the American public to the grave humanitarian violations in the so-called war on terrorism during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: There is growing interest in alopecia among the general population. Many people obtain information from easily accessible media rather than from doctors; thus, the media can play an important role in shaping public opinion. Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the content and reliability of newspaper articles on alopecia. Methods: Newspapers were categorized into three groups: one group of print newspapers and two groups of online newspapers. Online newspapers were further divided into two groups according to type of publishing company; one publishes both print and online newspapers and the other publishes online newspapers only. The most frequently subscribed or circulated newspaper in each group was selected. Articles containing information on alopecia were selected from 3 years of each newspaper and evaluated for reliability. Results: Most articles in each group used the general term “alopecia” instead of naming a specific hair loss disease. The majority of articles were based on consultation with experts. Assessment of the accuracy of articles with three grade scales showed that the percentage with high accuracy was 38.9%, 47.2%, and 23.3%. Assessment of reliability scores for five selected articles in each group showed that there were statistically significant differences between common readers and dermatologists (p＜0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that closer monitoring of the media is required to supply easily accessible, balanced, and trustworthy information regarding alopecia.

AB  - Objectives: Counterfeit/falsified medicines (CFM) have serious public health consequences in both developed and less developed countries. The study aimed to assess public awareness and views towards CFM in Lebanon. Methods: The study used convenience sampling and was based on cross-sectional surveys of the public that took place in different regions in Lebanon, using two questionnaires (Q1 and Q2). Key findings: A total of 849 participated in the study (464 Q1 and 385 Q2). The majority (93.4%) of respondents reported being aware of the term CFM, and television was the source of awareness for 84.4% of respondents. Additionally, 28.9% of respondents did not know how to compare CFM to their original, 19.6% did not answer the question, and only 3.7% reported that the original medicine would have the hologram on the package. Respondents reported the best way to avoid buying CFM would be via a trustworthy pharmacist (83.4%). The majority (83.1%) disagreed that CFM were as good as the originals, and 46% agreed that the original medicines were highly priced, and CFM were of better price value. Moreover, respondents reported agreeing that pharmacists who dispensed CFM were unprofessional (81.3%) and unethical (83.1%). Conclusions: The awareness, experiences and views of respondents showed the perceived risk that CFM have on public health and the need to develop continuous awareness and educational campaigns about the safety and efficacy of medicines. Additionally, this study highlighted the need for the government and regulatory authorities to apply and enforce the law against counterfeiters. © 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society

AB  - Food safety is a crucial thematic to any nation and the frauds in the food chain are an increasingly phenomena nowadays. The general goal of the present work was to identify the perception and behavior of Brazilian fresh milk consumers' in relation to the fraud in the milk production and sell chain. A total of 1015 consumers answered an online questionnaire on the variables that shape decision-making (individual differences, environmental influences and psychological stimuli or processes) and the behavior related to this decision process. The results were discussed based on the theoretical model proposed by Blackwell, Miniard, and Engel (2005) and their 7 stages. The results of this qualitative study showed that the impacts were declared, specially, in the reduction of milk consumption; losses to the image of the sector and the warming of the informal milk market, due to the increase in demand in this trade. The reduction of demand and the depreciation of the agents' image, have a negative impact on the entire chain, since it reduces revenues for all agents and, to a greater degree, for processors and related suppliers/farmers directly with the brands identified in the investigation actions and disclosed in the media. The female consumers were more affected, impacting on a greater reduction of the consumption. Unlike young consumers, they have not changed their behavior in relation to the chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The term “climate change” has evolved from what was originally a technical term employed by scientists into a symbolic referent involving complex social, political, and moral considerations that have spurred worldwide debate. As evidence of the anthropogenic influence on the Earth’s climate has grown over the past few decades, climate change has come to be viewed as a primary challenge to be confronted in the twenty-first century. Geoengineering, or climate engineering, is a set of large-scale technological interventions proposed to offset climatic changes. This study seeks to understand which factors contribute to, or alternatively, detract from public acceptance of geoengineering through robust path analytic modeling of public perceptions of geoengineering that may better serve the academic community and decision-makers. This study finds that familiarity, epistemic trust, preference for alternative solutions to climate change, and media consumption are interrelated in their influences on opinions toward geoengineering proposals and support for funding further geoengineering research. Such predictive modeling can enable risk communicators and policy-makers with vital information to support anticipatory governance approaches to policy initiatives and improve future public engagement and communication about geoengineering. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Since 2004, online social media (OSN) have evolved hugely. This fast development had interesting effects to increase the connection and information exchange of users, but some negative effects also appeared, including fake accounts number growing day after day. The sockpuppets are the multiple fake accounts created by the same user. They are the source of several types of manipulation such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization or to manipulate public opinion. In this article, we present SocksCatch, a complete process to detect and group sockpuppets which is composed of three main phases: first phase is the data collection and selection; second phase is the detection of the sockpuppet accounts using machine learning algorithms; third phase is the grouping of sockpuppet accounts created by the same user using graph theory. Experiments have been performed for the three phases using real data crawled from english Wikipedia. The results compare six machine learning algorithms for the detection phase and show that SocksCatch detects between 89% and 95% of the selected sockpuppets depending on the algorithms. We also compare five community detection algorithms for the grouping phase, and show that SocksCatch's grouped sockpuppets and the real sockpuppet's groups are similar between 80% and 88%, according to the cluster's comparison measures: normalized variation of information (NVI) and normalized mutual information (NMI). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transportation systems are one of the most frequent and high-profile targets for terrorist attacks, and such attacks can cause reduced or altered public travel behavior that can have severe economic consequences. Thus, understanding the relationship between transportation terror and public response is critical. We recruited n = 430 participants to read one of three hypothetical transportation-based terror attacks, and use Partial Least Squares path modeling to identify the interrelationships between the affective, cognitive, and (intended) behavioral facets of their reactions. The three terror scenarios were structured to allow for comparisons between a cyber and non-cyber attack on ground transportation, and an aviation versus ground explosives attack, which allowed us to test the robustness of the path model across situational features. Results indicated that the attack features did not moderate any of the interrelationships between reaction variables, but had medium-sized effects on self-reported risk perception. Collapsing data from all three scenarios into a single path model confirmed previously reported findings regarding the opposing roles of fear and anger in risk perception, suggested differing roles for terrorism risk attitudes and general risk attitudes, and found a surprisingly negligible role for self-reported trust in government. Implications for further research on soft-target and transportation-based terrorism risk perception are discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: The Swiss Medical Board (SMB) has recently revived the controversy over mammography screening by recommending to stop the introduction of new systematic mammography screening programs. This study aimed to examine the Swiss media coverage of the release of the SMB report. Methods: The dataset consisted of 25 newspaper and “medical magazine” articles, and TV/radio interviews. The analytic approach was based on argumentation theory. Results: Authority and community arguments were the most frequent types of arguments. With respect to authority arguments, stakeholders for instance challenged or supported the expertise of the SMB by referring to the competence of external figures of authority. Community arguments were based on common values such as life (saved thanks to systematic mammography screening) and money (costs associated with unnecessary care induced by systematic mammography screening). Conclusion: The efficiency of mammography screening which was the key issue of the debate appeared to be largely eluded, and the question of what women should do endures. Practice implications: While interpersonal and interprofessional communication has become a major topic of interest in the medical community, it appears that media communication on mammography screening is still rather ineffective. We call in particular for a more fact-based discussion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Individual aspirations of associating with role models are routinely harnessed by marketers, who for instance, use celebrity endorsement in selling brands and products. It appears there has been no research to date, however, on the potential for celebrity activism, or role model advocacy beyond celebrities, such as from politicians, to form effective interventions for encouraging sustainable transport behavior. This is despite studies suggesting that celebrity endorsement is a potential gateway for transforming public opinion on carbon intensive transport modes. The present paper consequently offers a critical review of the literature on role model advocacy and celebrity activism, and how these concepts have been harnessed to address environmental issues, in order to conceptually assess the potential for extending these intervention techniques to the context of sustainable transport. The scope of the paper includes the potential that high profile politicians/celebrities might play as role models in exercising referent power to influence social norms surrounding sustainable transport, given that the success of social marketing interventions are closely tied to the need for changes in the policy landscape. Key dimensions of role model endorsement in transport are identified and applied to a series of examples of how celebrity and political role models have influenced transport cultures. In addition to offering an original application of a theoretical framework to a new context, in order to help address the increasingly important societal issue of transport's growing contribution to climate change, the paper discusses the challenges associated with the neoliberal framing of this approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The publication of ‘A darker side of hypermobility’ (Cohen and Gössling, 2015), which reviewed the personal and social consequences of frequent travel, led to considerable media coverage and sparking of the public imagination, particularly with regards to the impacts of business travel. It featured in more than 85 news outlets across 17 countries, engendering over 150,000 social media shares and 433 media comments from readers, with the latter a source of insight into how the public reacts online when faced with an overview of the negative sides of frequent business travel. The present paper is theoretically framed by the role of discourse in social change and utilises discursive analysis as a method to evaluate this body of media comments. Our analysis finds two key identities are performed through public responses to the explicit health and social warnings concerned with frequent business travel: the ‘flourishing hypermobile’ and the ‘floundering hypermobile’. The former either deny the health implications of frequent business travel, or present strategies to actively overcome them, while the latter seek solace in the public dissemination of the health warnings: they highlight their passivity in the construction of their identity as hypermobile and its associated health implications. The findings reveal a segment of business travellers who wish to reduce travel, but perceive this as beyond their locus of control. Business travel reductions are thus unlikely to happen through the agency of individual travellers, but rather by changes in the structural factors that influence human resource and corporate travel management policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The presence of non-humans in media narratives - for example, in the supernatural genre - may make salient that we are all human. According to the common ingroup identity model, the human superordinate category should influence attitudes toward lower-level outgroups. The present study examines this in the context of ethnic outgroups, specifically African Americans. Similarity of supernatural villains to humans was manipulated to influence whether “human” was a relevant superordinate group. Additionally, character race was varied to understand the influence of group diversity cues. Consistent with the common ingroup identity model, exposure to a Black human character fighting non-humans reduces prejudice toward African Americans, and this reduced prejudice generalizes to other minority groups. Results suggest a complex relationship between exposure to supernatural villains and diversity cues on attitudinal outcomes, with identity as human as one possible mechanism for reducing prejudicial attitudes. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Journalists and readers of celebrity news regularly bash celebrities online, a behavior that is easily accepted among adolescents. This study investigates whether these attitudes of acceptance differ according to the perpetrator of the bashing (media versus public) and the likeability of the involved celebrity (liked versus disliked). Using a vignette study, we examine adolescent girls’ attitudes toward media (journalists’) and public (readers’) bashing of a generally disliked celebrity (Miley Cyrus) and a generally liked celebrity (Selena Gomez). All participants read an identical negative news story (media bashing) and two related negative reader comments (public bashing). Participants were randomly assigned to read this information about either Miley Cyrus or Selena Gomez. Results of a mixed-design ANOVA showed that the girls had less negative attitudes toward media bashing compared with public bashing. Moreover, they more easily accepted the bashing of a disliked celebrity than the bashing of a liked celebrity. © 2018, © 2018 Eastern Communication Association.

AB  - Ahonen attempts to provide some historical contextualization for the refugee crisis that has dominated much of European public and political debate since 2015. He draws comparisons between the crisis-ridden present and the decade of the previous century that was particularly laden with anticipation of disaster and doom: the 1930s. More specifically, his article explores parallels in public discussions of refugees by European political leaders and media commentators in 1938, on the one hand, and 2015-16, on the other. The coverage of 1938 focuses on the Evian Conference, organized to discuss the problem of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, while the analysis of 2015-16 concerns the period from the rapid acceleration of the refugee influx into Europe in the late summer of 2015 to the Brexit referendum of June 2016. Ahonen contends that, despite obvious and significant structural and contextual differences between the late 1930s and the mid-2010s, recent public discussions of the refugee crisis in Europe have closely resembled those conducted around the time of the Evian Conference. Fear and a sense of threat have been the dominant sentiments in the mid-2010s, as they were in the late 1930s, with many similarities in the language and analytical categories in which those sentiments have been publicly expressed. He also provides observations about the potential benefits and pitfalls of diachronic historical comparison, suggesting that an analysis of the failings of refugee policy during the 1930s can provide lessons for better practice today. Aggressive, racialist language about refugees of the kind that was common in the 1930s should have no place in today’s public discourses in Europe. Awareness of the continuities that exist in this area can provide important historical perspective, highlighting the persistence of prejudice and the urgency of the need to reject and resist it. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Private corporations that do not normally interact with, nor regularly communicate with, the public often do not perceive the public as a relevant or active stakeholder. The public may not view themselves as a stakeholder, particularly when they are unaware of, have no direct dealings with, or do not have any problems associated with such a corporation. The current study, utilizing a national survey of the United States public (N = 424) found that through directed strategic communication activities of a private spaceflight corporation, utilizing social and new media tools, a latent public can perceive a corporation and its mission in a positive manner, and transition it towards a status of an aware public and possible active public. Positive perceptions were found regarding corporate credibility, brand awareness, public engagement, communicating a corporate mission, educating the public, and influencing public opinion. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The question of what constitutes torture has perhaps never held as prominent a place in US political discourse as it has since the attacks on 9/11. This has fueled a national conversation that causes us to consider to what extent do our actions as a nation reflect our values as a nation? In a post 9/11 world in which the country will confront terrorism at home and abroad and our values will be tested we should strive for a better understanding of citizens' attitudes towards the practices that are (and have been) used to counter terrorism. To the extent that democratic theory is correct in necessitating public policy and public opinions to be reasonably congruent, understanding the distribution and formation of citizen attitudes towards torture is an important endeavor. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals. Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved. Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel. Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities’ subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Coverage of issues by news media is known to impact on both public perceptions and policy development aimed at addressing the featured issues. We examine the potential impact of news media coverage regarding the health and potential future of the World heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, which is under multiple pressures, both natural and anthropogenic. We draw on the extant literature regarding the impact of news media coverage of other complex issues, linking to relevant, albeit limited theoretical concepts that have been applied to previous media studies. We find that media coverage is predominately sensationalized and negative, with the potential to reinforce perceptions that mitigation attempts will be ineffective and thus likely to inhibit future policy development. We discuss the need for a review of existing science communication models and strategies to reduce the knowledge-practice gap between scientists and policy makers, together with proactive strategies to counter negative news coverage. © 2018

AB  - The impacts of vegetation fires on ecosystems are complex and varied affecting a range of important ecosystem services. Fire has the potential to affect the physicochemical and ecological status of water systems, alter several aspects of the carbon cycle (e.g. above- and below-ground carbon storage) and trigger changes in vegetation type and structure. Globally, fire is an essential part of land management in fire-prone regions in, e.g. Australia, the USA and some Mediterranean countries to mitigate the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires and sustain healthy ecosystems. In the less-fire prone UK, fire has a long history of usage in management for enhancing the productivity of heather, red grouse and sheep. This distinctly different socioeconomic tradition of burning underlies some of the controversy in recent decades in the UK around the use of fire. Negative public opinion and opposition from popular media have highlighted concerns around the detrimental impacts burning can have on the health and diversity of upland habitats. It is evident there are many gaps in the current knowledge around the environmental impacts of prescribed burning in less fire-prone regions (e.g. UK). Land owners and managers require a greater level of certainty on the advantages and disadvantages of prescribed burning in comparison to other techniques to better inform management practices. This paper addresses this gap by providing a critical review of published work and future research directions related to the impacts of prescribed fire on three key aspects of ecosystem services: (i) water quality, (ii) carbon dynamics and (iii) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity). Its overall aims are to provide guidance based on the current state-of-the-art for researchers, land owners, managers and policy makers on the potential effects of the use of burning and to inform the wider debate about the place of fire in modern conservation and land management in humid temperate ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that “for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it’s not, but for me it’s a choice, and you don’t get to define my gayness for me.” The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon’s controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers’ comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have “choice”; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon’s critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both “born-this-way” and “choice” arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - An emerging research trend in climate change studies is to use user-generated-data collected from social media to investigate the public opinion and science communication of climate change issues. This study collected data from the social Q & A website Quora to explore the key factors influencing the public preferences in climate change knowledge and opinions. Using web crawler, topic modeling, and count data regression modeling, this study quantitatively analyzed the effects of an answer's textual and auxiliary features on the number of up-votes received by the answer. Compared with previous studies based on open-ended surveys of citizens, the topic modeling result indicates that Quora users are more likely to talk about the energy, human and societal issues, and scientific research rather than the natural phenomena of climate change. The regression modeling results show that: (i) answers with more emphasis on specific subjects, but not popular knowledge, about climate change can get significantly more up-votes; (ii) answers with more terms of daily dialogue will get significantly fewer up-votes; and (iii) answers written by an author with more followers, with a longer text, with more images, or belonging to a question with more followers, can get significantly more up-votes. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Scientists use popular media to share views or facilitate greater understanding of their work. Social media also offers scientists the opportunity to build public opinion. Hailed as one of three most influential Indians of the 20th century by Time Magazine1, renowned agriculture scientist M. S. Swaminathan has written prolifically in scientific and mainstream media. From March 2015, for a period of one year, his use of social media platform Twitter is being taken up as a case study of social media communication by scientists. This article analyses themes articulated by a scientist on social media and finds that this provides an entry for discussions on science and development. Through this study, it is suggested that scientists, especially in India, can intervene more actively, for greater authenticity, accuracy and understanding among social media users on scientific subjects. © 2018 Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - We sought to identify the characteristics of men who have sex with men (MSM) who are opinion leaders on immunization issues and to identify potential opportunities to leverage their influence for vaccine promotion within MSM communities. Using venue-based sampling, we recruited and enrolled MSM living in Los Angeles (N = 520) from December 2016 to February 2017 and evaluated characteristic differences in sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and technology use among those classified as opinion leaders versus those who were not. We also asked respondents about their past receipt of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY) and meningococcal B (MenB) vaccines, as well as their opinions on the importance of 13 additional vaccines. Multivariable results revealed that non-Hispanic black (aOR = 2.64; 95% CI: 1.17–5.95) and other race/ethnicity (aOR = 2.98; 95% CI: 1.41–6.29) respondents, as well as those with a history of an STI other than HIV (aOR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.10–3.48), were more likely to be opinion leaders. MenACWY (aOR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.13–3.25) and MenB (aOR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.77–5.41) vaccine uptake, and perceived importance for these and seven additional vaccines, were also associated with being an opinion leader. The results suggest that the co-promotion of vaccination and other health promotion initiatives via opinion leaders could be a useful strategy for increasing vaccination among MSM. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study assesses the relationship between pornography consumption and support for sex education in public schools among adults in the United States. Goals were theoretical and applied. At the theoretical level, conditional process analyses are needed to further evaluate the predictions of the primary theory applied to pornography and social influence, the sexual script acquisition, activation, application model (3AM) of sexual media socialization. At the applied level, themes in pornography are most often associated with socialization outcomes that are a threat to the public health. In certain instances, however, pornography may socialize its users in ways that lead to health-promoting attitudes. An increased likelihood of support for sex education among youth may be one such example. Probabilistic national survey data gathered between 1988 and 2016 from 16 unique samples were utilized. A moderated-mediation path analysis indicated that pornography consumption was associated with support for sex education through more acceptance of teenage sex, but that this indirect effect (IE) was moderated by religiosity. Specifically, as religiosity decreased, the magnitude of the IE increased. These results are consistent with 3AM tenets about the role of sexual scripts in mass media socialization and factors that increase the likelihood of sexual scripting effects. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The relationship between the disciplines of communication and sociology has been primarily described as being abandoned by sociologists. This article historicizes the alleged sociological abandonment of communication and media research and centers on media sociology as the key manifestation of an ongoing vibrant relationship between the two disciplines. It has two goals. First, I examine the contours of the abandonment notion since Berelson vs. Schramm, Riesman, and Bauer in Public Opinion Quarterly in 1959. I demonstrate the diversity and the depth of media sociology and argue that an US-centric positivist understanding of media sociology has led to the exaggerated and misleading notion of abandonment, which homogenizes theoretical discourse and discounts scholarly contributions from outside of the US. Personal and collective memories have also documented institutional and organizational growth of media sociology. Second, I propose to conceptualize media sociology as a networked transfield driven by questions transcending disciplinary little boxes. Rather than returning to the Lazarsfeldian media effect paradigm, media sociology as a networked transfield driven by questions will allows scholars take advantage of structural holes for synthesis and innovation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The need to elicit public opinion about predefined topics is widespread in the social sciences, government and business. Traditional survey-based methods are being partly replaced by social media data mining but their potential and limitations are poorly understood. This article investigates this issue by introducing and critically evaluating a systematic social media analytics strategy to gain insights about a topic from YouTube. The results of an investigation into sets of dance style videos show that it is possible to identify plausible patterns of subtopic difference, gender and sentiment. The analysis also points to the generic limitations of social media analytics that derive from their fundamentally exploratory multi-method nature. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explored the relationship between exposure to television programs featuring gay male characters and homonegativity in a diverse adult sample. Specifically, this relationship was examined at both the program and character level. Participants (N = 120) responded to an online survey that asked about exposure to television shows known to feature gay male characters that aired between 2000 and 2015. Next, participants recalled specific characters from these programs before reporting their homonegative attitudes and beliefs. Results revealed that both viewing programs featuring gay male characters and recall of specific gay male characters decreased their negative attitudes toward gay men in society, irrespective of individual difference factors (e.g., religiosity, gender, close interpersonal contact with gay men). Results are discussed in terms of mediated intergroup contact theory. © 2018 Western States Communication Association.

AB  - Nowadays, Big Data, a large volume of both structured and unstructured data, is generated from Social Media. Social Media are powerful marketing tools and social big data can offer the business insights. The major challenge facing social big data is attaining efficient techniques to collect a large volume of social data and extract insights from the huge amount of collected data. Sentiment Analysis of social big data can provide business insights by extracting the public opinions. The traditional analytic platforms need to be scaled up for analyzing a large volume of social big data. Social data are by nature shorter and generally not constructed with proper grammatical rules and hence difficult to achieve high reliable result in Sentiment Analysis. Acquiring effective training data is a challenge, although learning based approaches are good for sentiment classification. Manual Labeling for training data is time and labor consuming. In this paper, Sentiment Analysis system on Big Data Analytics platform is proposed to provide valuable information by analyzing large scale social data in an efficient and timely manner since they have been implemented using a MapReduce framework and a Hadoop distributed storage (HDFS). The proposed Sentiment Analysis system consists of four modules: data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, class labeling and sentiment classification. The system enables high-level performance of sentiment classification while taking advantage of combining lexicon-based classifier's effortless setup process and learning based classifier. Twitter stream data is used for system evaluation as the Twitter is widespread Social Media and a good source of information in the sense of snapshots of moods and feelings as well as up-to-date events. The evaluation results show that this system achieve a promising accuracy by 84.2%. Moreover, this system is able to scale up to analyze the large scale data by decreasing the processing time when adding more nodes in the cluster. ©2018 CRL Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Context: Buses take up more than 90% of public transport in Indian cities and serve as a cheap and convenient mode of transport for all classes of society. However, the well-being of employees of this mode of transport is paramount in passenger and personal safety. As in any job, the person has to balance work and personal issues. Work-life balance is a concept that supports the effort from an employee in any sector to split their time and energy to balance work and personal lives. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study using a structured interview schedule was conducted among 103 Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) workers in Anekal town, Karnataka, to determine the work-life balance among them. The total score was classified into high, medium, and low work balance categories. The scores for each domain were analyzed separately to derive at the factors which act against work-life balance. Results: Low work-life balance was found in 26 (25.2%) of all subjects. The important factors that affected work-life balance were identified to be shift work, work load, night duties, social functions, and negative attitude of family members. The reasons that motivated them to work were to support family (35%), future security (33%), and to clear personal debts (15.5%). Conclusion: Given the low work-life balance in a quarter of several individuals in this study, there is a need to address this issue to ensure necessary balance and safety and well-being of both road transport employees and passengers. © 2018 Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Background: Society always has limited resources to expend on health care, or anything else. What are the unmet medical needs? How do we allocate limited resources to maximize the health and welfare of the people? These challenging questions might be re-examined systematically within an infodemiological frame on a much larger scale, leveraging the latest advancement in information technology and data science. Objective: We expanded our previous work by investigating news media data to reveal the coverage of different diseases and medical conditions, together with their sentiments and topics in news articles over three decades. We were motivated to do so since news media plays a significant role in politics and affects the public policy making. Methods: We analyzed over 3.5 million archive news articles from Reuters media during the periods of 1996/1997, 2008 and 2016, using summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Summary statistics illustrated the coverage of various diseases and medical conditions during the last 3 decades. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling helped us automatically detect the sentiments of news articles (ie, positive versus negative) and topics (ie, a series of keywords) associated with each disease over time. Results: The percentages of news articles mentioning diseases and medical conditions were 0.44%, 0.57% and 0.81% in the three time periods, suggesting that news media or the public has gradually increased its interests in medicine since 1996. Certain diseases such as other malignant neoplasm (34%), other infectious diseases (20%), and influenza (11%) represented the most covered diseases. Two hundred and twenty-six diseases and medical conditions (97.8%) were found to have neutral or negative sentiments in the news articles. Using topic modeling, we identified meaningful topics on these diseases and medical conditions. For instance, the smoking theme appeared in the news articles on other malignant neoplasm only during 1996/1997. The topic phrases HIV and Zika virus were linked to other infectious diseases during 1996/1997 and 2016, respectively. Conclusions: The multi-dimensional analysis of news media data allows the discovery of focus, sentiments and topics of news media in terms of diseases and medical conditions. These infodemiological discoveries could shed light on unmet medical needs and research priorities for future and provide guidance for the decision making in public policy. © Ming Huang, Omar ElTayeby, Maryam Zolnoori, Lixia Yao.

AB  - Starting in 2013, SeaWorld faced a public relations disaster with the release of the documentary titled Blackfish that accused the company of mistreatment of its orcas. SeaWorld attempted to respond and rebuild its credibility, but activist group ‘People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ (PETA) doubled down on the corporation through its rhetorical shock tactics, deepening the organization’s woes. The PETA/SeaWorld controversy does more than provide another example of poor corporate public relations decision-making made in light of an activist group’s savvy use of digital technology. We argue that the case helps explain how digital technologies fundamentally change activism, whereby activists can use rhetorical fracturing, or quickly using digital media to puncture a target’s narrative, to create messages that challenge an opponent’s legitimacy to cultivate public opinion, thereby pressuring corporate policy change. Recent activism scholarship points out how digital media transforms organizational-activist relationships in profound ways, but this essay contributes to a gap in public relations scholarship by showing how strategic, message-level digital activism helps contribute to broad societal change. Indeed, given that SeaWorld’s stock was down nearly 40 percent in 2015 and ‘is about 50% below its all-time high’, its profits were down 84 percent in 2015, and attendance has fallen more than 7 percent at its parks, the case illustrates how digital activist campaigns help reshape societal understanding of a controversial issue such as using animals for entertainment. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The choice of medical services affects an individual’s treatment and health. However, few studies have focused on medical electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), which has the greatest impact on such choices. This study was performed to explore the need for and general public’s attitude toward medical eWOM and provide a reference for government, media, and medical practitioners. In this study, 84% of the respondents had experience using online evaluation platforms to search for eWOM, and those who were satisfied with the online evaluation platforms substantially outnumbered those who were dissatisfied. The respondents generally believed that there is a need for physician evaluation platforms, although a difference remained between respondents who needed the online evaluation platforms (72.0%) and were willing to reference them (72.0%) and those who trusted them (46.5%) and were willing to provide their opinions (55.0%). These results could signify that despite the public’s need, the public remains doubtful of the information provided by these online evaluation platforms. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Having the advantage of reaching massive audience, mainstream media can frequently influence public opinions and attitudes. However, recent statistical data shows that the average user stickiness of mainstream media websites is much lower, in comparison with other types of media websites in China. To gain insights into this phenomenon, we construct a model to examine the impacts of various website attributes and user influence on user stickiness. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that media website attributes and user characteristics have different effects on user stickiness. Our results shed fresh light on how to enhance mainstream media website user stickiness in a competitive and ever-evolving landscape. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Claims and accusations of political bias are common in many countries. The essence of such claims is a denunciation of alleged violations of political neutrality in the context of media coverage, legal and bureaucratic decisions, academic teaching etc. Yet the acts and messages that give rise to such claims are also embedded within a context of intergroup competition. Thus, in evaluating the seriousness of, and the need for taking a corrective action in reaction to a purported politically biased act people may consider both the alleged normative violation and the political implications of the act/message for the evaluator’s ingroup. The question thus arises whether partisans react similarly to ingroup-aiding and ingroup-harming actions or messages which they perceive as politically biased. In three separate studies, conducted in two countries, we show that political considerations strongly affect partisans’ reactions to actions and messages that they perceive as politically biased. Namely, ingroup-harming biased messages/acts are considered more serious and are more likely to warrant corrective action in comparison to ingroup-aiding biased messages/acts. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the implementations of measures intended for correcting and preventing biases, and for the nature of conflict and competition between rival political groups. © 2018 Yair, Sulitzeanu-Kenan.

AB  - Traditional political polling methods have become less reliable as society adopts more smartphone technology. Internet and social media use have also risen due to increased smartphone use, which have given a digital voice to political views. This study assessed one social media platform, Twitter, as a means for predicting election outcomes more accurately than traditional methods. Michigan and Wisconsin’s ‘tweets’ related to the 2016 presidential election campaign slogans of candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were compiled and a numerical comparison was performed. WordCloud technology was employed for a visual representation of the numerical data. Numerical comparison yielded results and predictions that were inconsistent with the actual outcome of the election, visual content analysis of the WorldCloud images revealed that qualitative data might be more useful in election predictions. Future studies should expand on qualitative analyses of social media involvement as a potential replacement for traditional polling methods. © 2018 by Gamma Theta Upsilon.

AB  - Authors assume that in the post-Soviet time, political consciousness among the Russians has significantly changed. Causes of this not only include general depoliticization in the society, but also a modified nature of the media influence. The research purpose is to search for reasons that cause booms and falls in the interest of the Russians in politics. The methodological framework of the research included the Verba-Pye model of engagement in politics, Lipset's conclusions about citizens' engagement in political affairs; assumptions from the Lipset- Rokkan model of political preferences of citizens; Scott's concept of imitation of political activism, and Bryant's conclusions about specifics of media influence on public opinion. The empirical basis of the research includes data from sociological and marketing research made by Russian centers for the study of public opinion. As a result of the research, its authors have established that country residents do not mostly show high political engagement and civil activism. © Media Watch.

AB  - Constitutional reforms in Ecuador and Bolivia and the subsequent laws on communications have opened up the media space to new social and political actors: public and community media. While the former tend to be associated with the state in form and with governments in substance, the latter are not clearly defined and occupy a place in the midst of the hegemonic struggle between the public and private sectors to enable citizens to actively intervene in the competition for shaping public opinion. It is therefore necessary to lay the groundwork for a definition of “community media” that includes both its legal and sociopolitical dimensions. Indeed, operationalizing such a definition might allow community media to recognize themselves in it and to take the measures required to fully project themselves as subjects of the law. Las reformas constitucionales de Ecuador y Bolivia, y las siguientes leyes de comunicación, han abierto el espacio mediático a nuevos actores sociales y políticos: los medios públicos y los comunitarios. Si los primeros tienden a ser referibles al Estado en la forma y a los gobiernos en la sustancia, los segundos se quedan indefinidos e irrumpen en la lucha hegemónica entre los sectores público y privado, para que la ciudadanía intervenga de forma activa en la disputa por la generación de opinión pública. Por lo tanto, es necesario sentar las bases para una definición del concepto de “medio comunitario” que sepa mantener unidas las dimensiones de significado legales y socio-políticas. Traducir en términos operativos esta definición podría permitir a los medios comunitarios reconocerse en los rasgos observables del concepto y, por ende, tomar medidas para proyectarse plenamente como sujetos de derecho. © 2018, © 2018 Latin American Perspectives.

AB  - In recent years, serious smog and haze have shrouded vast areas of northern and eastern China, which has drawn broad attention at home and abroad. Although China is an authoritarian country with strict media control, public opinion may still affect air quality by putting pressure on the local and central governments to enhance environmental protections. In this paper, the impact of public opinion on air quality in China is for the first time quantitatively examined. Specifically, the monthly average levels of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentrations of several main air pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, are utilized as indicators for air quality. Using a dataset consisting of 109 prefecture-level Chinese cities for the period between November 2013 and October 2016, the estimation results indicate that air pollution significantly affects public opinion on air quality, and the surge in public opinion on air pollution occurs more frequently in the winter. Public opinion seems to have a positive effect on the environment only in the short run: air quality tends to improve two months after the surge in negative public opinion. In general, public opinion about air pollution helps to improve air quality in China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Empirical research on sources of prejudice and anti-immigrant hostility has grown considerably over the years, and the literature on the topic has become substantial firstly in classical receiving countries and in recent years also in Europe. This work analyses the anti-immigrant attitudes in Italy. The main results of this study are three. The first is the importance of individual characteristics in explaining anti-immigrant hostility: much of the variability in anti-immigrant hostility is due to individual characteristics, and in particular to the educational level achieved. Second, contacts have opposite effect on hostility: real contacts (i.e., real interpersonal contacts) decrease anti-immigrant hostility, while abstract contacts (i.e., contacts mediated by mass media) increase hostility towards migrants. Third, anti-immigrant hostility is lower among issues concerning family immigration dynamics. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Providing information to the public is critical for government agencies during times of crisis. However, little is known about the communications that take place in the long term after disasters and emergencies. How are information and communication managed during the postdisaster reconstruction (PDR)? And how do social media platforms support or hamper the government-to-citizen (G2C) communications management? A case study approach is taken to investigate these questions, using a mix of qualitative (semistructured interviews) and quantitative (multiple choice questionnaire) research methods. Officers involved in the recovery activities after the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 in New Zealand were surveyed and interviewed. Results suggested that the recovery information and communications were managed using a wide array of communication means, with preference given to face-to-face interactions, printed material, and websites. Information management during the PDR focused on addressing individual issues rather than on mass communication. Social media played a relevant role in information provision and sharing during disaster recovery. However, some features of the social media technology undercut its utility for PDR communications. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This research analyses cloaked Facebook pages that are created to spread political propaganda by cloaking a user profile and imitating the identity of a political opponent in order to spark hateful and aggressive reactions. This inquiry is pursued through a multi-sited online ethnographic case study of Danish Facebook pages disguised as radical Islamist pages, which provoked racist and anti-Muslim reactions as well as negative sentiments towards refugees and immigrants in Denmark in general. Drawing on Jessie Daniels’ critical insights into cloaked websites, this research furthermore analyses the epistemological, methodological and conceptual challenges of online propaganda. It enhances our understanding of disinformation and propaganda in an increasingly interactive social media environment and contributes to a critical inquiry into social media and subversive politics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Objective: Among surgeons, professional use of social media (SM) is varied, and attitudes are ambiguous. We sought to characterize surgeons’ professional use and perceptions of SM. Design: Surgical faculty and trainees received institutional review board-approved e-mail surveys assessing SM usage and attitudes. Regression analyses identified predictors of SM attitudes and preference for professional contact. Setting: Surveys were administered to surgical faculty, fellows, and residents at 4 academic medical centers between January and April 2016. Participants: Of 1037 surgeons, clinical fellows, and residents e-mailed, 208 (20%) responded, including 132 faculty and 76 trainees. Results: Among 208 respondents, 46 (22%) indicated they preferred some form of SM as their preferred networking and communication modality. A total of 145 (70%) indicated they believe SM benefits professional development. The position of clinical resident predicted preference to maintain professional contact via SM (p = 0.03). Age <55 predicted positive attitude (p = 0.02) and rank of associate professor predicted negative attitude toward SM (p = 0.03). Lack of time as well as personal and patient privacy concerns were cited most commonly as reasons for not using SM. Conclusions: Most of surgeons responding to our survey used some form of SM for professional purposes. Perceived barriers include lack of value, time constraints, and personal and patient privacy concerns. Generational differences in surgeon attitudes suggest usage of SM among surgeons will expand over time. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery

AB  - Efforts are on the way on the Swedish West Coast to develop the capacity for cultivation of marine resources, notably of kelps. Given that this is a region of great natural and national heritage, public opposition to marine developments has been identified as a possible risk factor. This survey thus sought to shed light on awareness levels, perceptions of different types of aquaculture and on reactions to a scenario depicting future aquaculture developments on the West Coast. When asked about their general opinions of aquaculture, respondents tended to be favourable though a majority chose neutral responses. On the whole, respondents were favourable to the depicted scenario. Finally, it was found that the high-awareness group tended to be more supportive than the low or medium-awareness groups, hinting at the benefits of increasing awareness to reduce public aversion and to support a sustainable development of aquaculture on the Swedish West Coast. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - In Munchausen by proxy (MBP) maltreatment, increasingly termed “medical child abuse” (MCA), a caregiver fabricates or induces illness in another. The perpetrator's goal for the behavior is to meet personal emotional needs by forcing unnecessary or misguided medical or psychological treatment. Generally, a mother is the perpetrator and her child is the victim. There is a serious lack of research into most aspects of MCA, and this study is the first to utilize the anonymity of an Internet forum to investigate victims' first-hand experiences of, and the public's opinions about, suspected and confirmed MCA. Three-hundred and fifty-six posts by 348 members were explored and coded using formal qualitative content analysis. By accessing an open-thought online forum, this paper acquired information regarding social perceptions about the nonperpetrating partners who are unaware of the maltreatment; the disturbing and counterintuitive phenomenon of MCA itself; and the resistance often faced by those who attempt to report it. © 2017 American Academy of Forensic Sciences

AB  - This study investigates the association between news exposure and attitudes/beliefs about a Dutch road pricing proposal (Kilometerheffing) with individual level data. We have combined the data from a public attitude survey (N = 705) with a content analysis of 280 news articles on the pricing proposal published in five leading Dutch newspapers. Our findings show that news exposure and attitudes/beliefs about road pricing policies are associated not only at the aggregate level, as shown by past research, but also at the individual level. The direction of attitudes/beliefs and tone of news change in the same direction (e.g., the higher the amount of negative news exposed, the more negative the attitudes towards Kilometerheffing). Our findings also show that the significance and direction of association (in parallel with or opposite to the tone of news—negative or positive) changes according to the issue featured in the news and the strength of the individual’s values. News exposure is not associated with beliefs about the impact of Kilometerheffing on one’s own financial situation but rather with beliefs about the impact of Kilometerheffing on the environment and congestion. Furthermore, the strength of the biospheric value (which concerns the quality of nature and environment) negatively moderates the relationship between news exposure and beliefs about the impact of Kilometerheffing on environment-congestion. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to (a) assess knowledge of official vaccination recommendations and attitudes towards vaccinations among adults and (b) examine their association with vaccination uptake among adults. Methods: This study was part of the HaBIDS study (Hygiene and Behaviour Infectious Diseases Survey), which is an online panel established in March 2014 in Lower Saxony, Germany with males and females aged between 15 and 69 years (n = 2379). Every few months, participants completed questionnaires on different aspects of infectious diseases. In September 2014, knowledge of vaccination recommendations, attitudes towards vaccinations and information on uptake of vaccinations in the last 10 years (practice) were collected using a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) questionnaire. Multiple correspondence analysis was applied to identify underlying structures in each KAP domain and fractional polynomial regression analysis to examine the associations of knowledge and attitudes with vaccination uptake. Results: Of the 2379 panel members, 1698 (71%) completed the KAP questionnaire on vaccinations. The majority of participants (80%) knew that the vaccine against diphtheria and tetanus should be administered every 10 years. Regarding other recommendations, the proportion of correct answers varied between 35% and 60%. 82% of participants agreed that adult vaccinations should be mandatory for selected groups such as health care workers and 40% stated that vaccinations should be mandatory for all adults. For the different vaccines, the odds of being unvaccinated were 1.5- to 5-times higher among participants with poor knowledge of vaccination recommendations compared to participants with good knowledge. Participants with negative attitudes towards vaccinations were also more likely to be unvaccinated. Conclusions: Efforts should be undertaken to improve knowledge of official vaccination recommendations in the general population and reduce common misconceptions about vaccinations.

AB  - Social media provides a medium for people to express themselves on different issues. Twitter has gained a lot of popularity in the past decade as a social media platform where people create micro-blogs providing a valuable data source to understand trends and public opinion. However, the volume of tweets even on specific topics may reach millions creating a big challenge for the analyst. Clustering is a technique which can be utilized to better understand such large volumes of data. The main idea of clustering is to group similar tweets into batches in order to find patterns, to summarize, and to compress a large dataset. Though clustering is a natural technique for the analysis of tweets, there is no clustering tool specifically designed for Twitter data that utilizes lexical and semantic similarities; and that can be readily used by non-technical experts such as social scientists. I-TWEC is a web based tweet clustering tool where users can upload their data and the resulting clusters are presented with different visualizations which further enable the user to interactively select and merge clusters based on their semantic similarity. I-TWEC has the lexical and semantic clustering components implemented as two consecutive phases. For the lexical clustering of tweets, Longest Common Subsequence is a widely accepted similarity metric, however it is also very costly, and therefore not applicable to large data sets such as the ones collected through Twitter. In order to overcome that challenge, we have implemented a suffix tree based index structure in I-TWEC to efficiently cluster tweets based on the Longest Common Substring similarity which is an approximation of the Longest Common Subsequence. Experiments we have conducted show that lexical clustering phase of I-TWEC can produce results with comparable clustering quality in a fraction of the time required by the baseline methods which use Longest Common Subsequence and Suffix Tree. We have also experimented with a k-means document clustering as well as a state-of-the-art word-based suffix tree clustering algorithm and the results show that I-TWEC outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of time with comparable clustering quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Snakes are controversial animals, therefore a better understanding of public attitudes is critical for their effective protection and future survival. The attitudes towards snakes of 951 adults in Greece were investigated in personal interviews. Factor analysis revealed a dual mode of attitudes: respondents were highly intolerant of snakes, while they supported their conservation at the same time. Respondents had high knowledge about the behavior of snakes, medium knowledge of their biology and were strongly affected by folklore. Structural models revealed that tolerance was a positive mediator of conservation. Knowledge about snake behavior and biology was positively correlated with attitudes towards snakes. Moralistic and naturalistic attitudes were positively, and dominionistic attitudes negatively, correlated with snake tolerance and conservation attitudes. Younger, more educated people were more snake-tolerant than older, less educated people. Females were less snake-tolerant and more conservation-oriented than males. These findings increased the understanding of human attitudes towards snakes and helped identify factors critical for their conservation. As such they could be used to design environmental education programs incorporating both information-based and experiential activities that will improve attitudes, behaviors and, eventually, the chances for the survival of these uncharismatic animals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to explore the influence of online news dissemination on public opinion in social media and examine what factors determine the influence. Online news stories (N=51) from 37 sources and Facebook posts (N=317) on the construction of Africa’s first modern international railway line, the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway line, were retrieved between June and November 2017 for the period April 11, 2012 to November 30, 2017. Comparative content analysis of online news and Facebook posts revealed that there was positive correlation between frame repetition by news media and prevalence of the frame in social media opinion. The results showed that there were statistically significant associations in the presence of positive as well as negative frame tones between news articles and Facebook posts. However, the relationship in the use of neutral frame tone between news and opinion was not significant. Regarding composition, short news stories exert more influence on social media opinion than longer news articles, as indicated by negative correlation between news article length and its influence on opinion. Overall, the results suggest that online news dissemination strongly influences opinion formation in social media. © 2018, © 2018 Unisa Press.

AB  - China is one of the world’s most sophisticated Internet censoring countries. Chinese Internet users who wish to visit blocked Web sites will have to use circumvention tools to get around the Great Firewall, a censoring system inspecting, filtering, and blocking foreign Web sites outside China. Using a nationally representative survey dataset, this study compares circumvention tool users and nonusers in terms of demographic features, Internet-use motivation, levels of media trust, and, most importantly, political attitude and behavior differences. We found that more than 11% of Chinese Internet users had ever used circumvention tools and they were most likely to be young and well-educated. Compared to nonusers, circumvention tool users were more likely to oppose censorship, to place less trust in news media, and to participate more actively in civic activities. However, circumvention tool users tend to hold more politically conservative attitudes than nonusers. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Political communication is the process of putting information, technology, and media in the service of power. Increasingly, political actors are automating such processes, through algorithms that obscure motives and authors yet reach immense networks of people through personal ties among friends and family. Not all political algorithms are used for manipulation and social control however. So what are the primary ways in which algorithmic political communication—organized by automated scripts on social media—may undermine elections in democracies? In the US context, what specific elements of communication policy or election law might regulate the behavior of such “bots,” or the political actors who employ them? First, we describe computational propaganda and define political bots as automated scripts designed to manipulate public opinion. Second, we illustrate how political bots have been used to manipulate public opinion and explain how algorithms are an important new domain of analysis for scholars of political communication. Finally, we demonstrate how political bots are likely to interfere with political communication in the United States by allowing surreptitious campaign coordination, illegally soliciting either contributions or votes, or violating rules on disclosure. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article examines the sources of ideological skepticism about two issues where there is a scientific consensus: climate change and evolution. The results indicate that self-identified conservatives doubt global warming in large part because of elite rhetoric, but that evolution beliefs are unrelated to reception of political discourse. News reception is perhaps the strongest predictor of conservatives’ climate change skepticism, but has no influence on their aversion to evolution. Moreover, the article leverages three sources of variation in elite discourse on climate change—temporal, cross-national, and experimental—to show that changes in the prevalence of ideological cues strongly affect public opinion about global warming. Politically attentive conservatives, in fact, were more likely to believe scientists about global warming than liberals were in the 1990s before the media depicted climate change as a partisan issue. The United States is also the only nation where political interest significantly predicts both conservatives’ skepticism about, and liberals’ belief in, climate change. Finally, evidence from a national survey experiment suggests that Americans would be less skeptical of manmade global warming if more Republicans in Congress believed in it, but a growing Congressional consensus about evolution would not diminish doubts about its existence.

AB  - This paper analyzes politicization and mediatization of immigration in Poland in the context of the recent European “refugee crisis.” Although largely absent from Polish political discourse after 1989, anti-refugee and anti-immigration rhetoric has recently become extremely politically potent in Poland. The analysis shows that, soon taken over by other political groups, the new anti-immigration discourses have been enacted in Poland's public sphere by the right-wing populist party PiS (Law and Justice). Its discourse in offline and online media has drawn on discursive patterns including Islamophobia, Euro-scepticism, anti-internationalism, and historical patterns and templates of discrimination such as anti-Semitism. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - An increasing number of citizens change and adapt their party preferences during the electoral campaign. We analyze which short-term factors explain intra-campaign changes in voting preferences, focusing on the visibility and tone of news media reporting and party canvassing. Our analyses rely on an integrative data approach, linking data from media content analysis to public opinion data. This enables us to investigate the relative impact of news media reporting as well as party communication. Inherently, we overcome previously identified methodological problems in the study of communication effects on voting behavior. Our findings reveal that campaigns matter: Especially interpersonal party canvassing increases voters’ likelihood to change their voting preferences in favor of the respective party, whereas media effects are limited to quality news outlets and depend on individual voters’ party ambivalence.

AB  - Social media could serve as an easy and fast window to the climate of public opinion. In the current study, we examined the influence of perceived opinion climate revealed via Twitter postings in shaping televised debate viewers’ candidate evaluation. We conducted two Web-based experiments in the high- and low-stimulus elections: (a) the 2012 Korean presidential election and (b) the 2014 Seoul mayoral election. Instead of using contrived stimulus materials, we were able to examine the influence of exposure to Twitter postings in voters’ judgment of candidate performance in real time. Using a custom-designed Web application, participants evaluated the candidates as debate-related Twitter postings were being fed in real time during each televised debate. Our results suggest that exposure to Twitter postings has induced significant bandwagon effects. Bandwagon effects were pervasive even among partisans and the knowledgeable. Our findings show that more policy efforts ought to be made to strengthen the informative role of social viewing. Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The anti-immigration continuum of public attitude-media-politics has undergone changes in the course of the “refugee crisis” in Germany. By examining migrant representations and discursive events taking place in 2015 and early 2016, we will show the volatility of the recent discourse on refugees. A historical/critical discourse analysis will show how new topoi arose and old topoi of the security/power paradigm have lastly reconquered the discourse. Using newspaper coverage, we discuss discursive events in three main sections: borders, arrival, and presence. Discursive shifts have taken place that have had an impact on the configuration of migration categories such as migrants or refugees. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Communication scholars have raised concerns that the media present contradictory or conflicting information on health, science, and political issues, speculating that such information may have adverse effects on public cognitions, affect, and behaviors. However, the evidence base for the effects of contradictory messages remains thin. Using nutrition as a case example, this study builds upon this nascent literature by employing a three-wave panel dataset from a survey with a nationally representative sample of American adults. We found that exposure to contradictory nutrition messages from television increases nutrition confusion, whereas exposure from print media decreases confusion. Moreover, nutrition confusion was positively associated with nutrition backlash, and nutrition backlash decreased engagement in fruit and vegetable consumption. Implications for campaigns and other communication interventions are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There are heated debates in Australia for and against culling kangaroos. Understanding community attitudes to wildlife management may aid strategic communication, leading to better outcomes for humans and wildlife. For decision-makers, social media present tantalizingly available attitude data. Using the “appraisal” framework, this study analyzed attitudes toward kangaroo culling expressed in Facebook discussions. Scholarly wildlife attitude models provide useful descriptors and categories but do not account for the complexity and contradictions within individuals’ attitudes to culling kangaroos. The findings reveal conflation of human interests and attitudes to culling; proponents generally justified culling with reference to financial cost or harm reduction. Opponents of culling argued that human convenience and economics do not justify taking the lives of kangaroos. Proponents and opponents often attacked each other based on perceived personal and ideological differences, ignoring the substance or validity of others’ comments. An urban–rural divide promulgated by some culling proponents may fuse cultural/political allegiances with attitudes to culling in ways that undermine kangaroo welfare. Humans charged with wildlife management and decision-making should aim to make assessments that benefit wildlife as well as humans. Future research on decision-making should elucidate relationships between human interest and decisions and communication concerning animal welfare. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Often, social perspectives of the Arab Revolution give a lot of credit to Facebook as the primary catalyst for political mobilization and citizen journalism. Although Facebook as a platform can be acclaimed for helping to shape this situation, this research argues that the role of Facebook is often exaggerated. In the context of this work, the ‘Arab Revolution’ refers to the period in which former President, Hosni Mubarak, was ousted from power in January 2011 and the term ‘revolution’ is not used to signal a radical transformation of society. Empirically, this article addresses the role of social media and in particular, Facebook, before, during and after this revolution. It examines the impact of this new technology on the rise of online social activism by investigating the effect of citizen journalism on forming public opinion, exploring the relationship between citizen journalism and the acceleration of the events that led to the Egyptian revolution. It also explores the impact of social media on citizen activism after the fall of Mubarak’s regime. In this case citizen journalism refers to the production of media content with the aim of changing public opinion. Empirical data for this research work were both qualitative and quantitative. Four hundred survey questionnaires were distributed to Facebook users to identify their usage before, during and after the 25 January Revolution to find out their views on social media activism and its impact on public opinion. The questionnaires covered the duration from June 2010 to June 2015. In addition, intensive interviews were conducted with media experts and political activists to gain a deeper insight of the role of citizen journalism in social change. Findings demonstrate that during the three stages of the Egyptian revolution, covered by this research, social media remained significant, albeit with a slight difference in its use by protesters. During the revolution, social media networks were primarily the outlets that Egyptians used to report local events to international media. The post revolution period has also witnessed an interest in social media networks. Facebook has made Egyptians more politically and socially conscious and encouraged them to participate in social and political events such as presidential and parliament elections. However, this research work reports that the use of such platforms does not seem to have had much impact on political change in Egypt during the last few years. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Australian jurisdictions have increasingly moved to facilitate trial by judge alone in cases which are the subject of significant prejudicial publicity. These moves have been predicated upon the assumption that the ordering of a trial by judge alone is an effective means of reducing the risk of prejudice in cases of this kind. This article has two objects. First, it investigates the principles underpinning the availability of trial by judge alone in cases of serious prejudicial publicity, and the different legislative frameworks that have evolved in different Australian jurisdictions. Second, it critiques these principles by analysis of a line of psycho-legal research which examines the comparative abilities of judges and jurors to disregard prejudicial publicity. The article interrogates the reformist assumption that a trial by judge alone will be fairer to an accused who is the subject of significant prejudicial publicity. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Emergence of diaspora communities has resulted in diasporic media playing a key role in enabling a reconnection of diasporic populations with a mediated homeland. This becomes more poignant amongst diaspora communities that feel marginalized, racially discriminated against and battle threats of xenophobia, Islamophobia and other forms of social exclusion in their adopted Western homes. This makes mediated co-presence more powerful than physical co-presence as diaspora individuals try to find community at a distance. Taking the Somali diaspora community as a case study, this article explores how diasporic media content is consumed amongst conflict-generated diaspora audiences. When conflict dynamics are manifested within diaspora social networks, the re-creation of conflict takes place, which then facilitates the engagement of diaspora with homeland conflicts. But their views, reactions and concerns regarding diasporic media content also indicate their potential for deliberatively engaging with it. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Due to political, economic and environmental factors, global immigration will only increase. Using Germany as a case study, the research question addressed in this article is not if the public thinks immigrants and asylum seekers should be permitted entrance to politically stable countries, but rather once they have arrived, what active strategies can be implemented to achieve healthy integration and who should set the agenda? A qualitative data analysis, culled from interviews conducted during the summer of 2016, contribute to the debate on public opinion around the politicization of immigration and identity. This analysis examines the media coverage of specific socially and politically charged events in relation to Germany’s solidarity movement, known as Willkommenkultur (welcome culture). The study found that the way in which a society defines, frames and understands the motivations behind its movements of opposition, or solidarity, potentially allows for a shift in perspective leading to a reimagining of what is and what could be. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - As a performance venue, online social spaces afford users a variety of ways to express themselves. Many of these expressions include social identity work, such as the articulation, affirmation, or policing of a shared identity. In this study, we examine one online space in which users engage in social identity work: a Reddit forum (r/starterpacks) that primarily generates and discusses image memes of a very specific format: the “starter pack.” Users leverage these image memes to convey what we refer to in this article as prototypes of social identities. Many of these prototypical depictions are necessarily influenced by offline social groups and/or consumer culture, and are furthermore constructed around gendered, racial, or ethnic stereotypes. To understand how these image memes are used to form and perpetuate prototypes of social identities, we employed content analysis to evaluate a sample of 500 image meme artifacts created, shared, and upvoted by the subreddit’s users. We discuss the process of applying visual analysis techniques to articulate themes identified in the image meme expressions, in particular: (1) the default of the White, male identity in starter pack characterizations; (2) the production of oppressive social identities through the use of visual and textual content; and (3) the dedication to a stance of “consumption” in assembling starter pack memes, both through body politics expressed therein and use of consumer goods in images. Finally, we draw on reader response theory to frame the challenges of researchers “reading” starter pack memes, despite employing systematic methods of analysis. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - How did the Austrian public think about immigrants at the peak of the 2015 migrant crisis? News media and policy makers suggested a cleavage in public opinion along the lines of humanitarian support and economic competition. We empirically disentangle these groups using a Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT). The data were collected by Project Implicit as a part of an online panel survey initiated by the Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES). The analyses reveal that Austrian citizens predominantly associate immigrants with the need for support. However, implicit associations also seem to vary depending on citizens’ backgrounds and beliefs. The findings further indicate that implicit associations towards immigrants affect citizens’ policy preferences. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Representative democracy entails the aggregation of multiple policy issues by parties into competing bundles of policies, or "manifestos", which are then evaluated holistically by voters in elections. This aggregation process obscures the multidimensional policy preferences underlying a voter's single choice of party or candidate. We address this problem through a conjoint experiment based on the actual party manifestos in Japan's 2014 House of Representatives election. By juxtaposing sets of issue positions as hypothetical manifestos and asking respondents to choose one, our study identifies the effects of specific positions on the overall assessment of manifestos, heterogeneity in preferences among subgroups of respondents, and the popularity ranking of manifestos. Our analysis uncovers important discrepancies between voter preferences and the portrayal of the election results by politicians and the media as providing a policy mandate to the Liberal Democratic Party, underscoring the potential danger of inferring public opinion from election outcomes alone. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The role of national parliaments in EU matters has become an important subject in the debate over the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. Yet despite a remarkable increase in parliamentary involvement in EU affairs, the added value in terms of democratic legitimacy will remain limited if citizens are not aware of their activities. Given that citizens mainly experience politics through the media, the aim of the paper is therefore to explore whether and under what conditions parliamentary involvement in EU matters is visible in national newspapers. The paper draws on two quantitative datasets covering parliamentary EU activities and relevant newspaper articles in seven Member States between 2010 and 2013. Results suggest that the efforts of active parliaments pay off. In addition, conflict within government coalitions over EU issues and greater salience of EU politics in public opinion increase coverage while, surprisingly, both public and parliamentary euroscepticism do not. © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study explains when, how and why WikiLeaks emerged as a global phenomenon. Its media strategies were clearly systematised into three stages. Web analytics tools were used to collect data from four different levels of digital popularity: Google searches for the term "WikiLeaks", "WikiLeaks" website traffic, Twitter activity and Twitter followers. Data for more than five years were analysed (from December 2006, when WikiLeaks arose, to the Stratfor case, in 2012). Our results indicate that, in the age of the network society, the popularity of a digital and antiestablishment phenomenon such as WikiLeaks (and the impact of its messages) paradoxically depends on traditional press newspapers ("quality press"). Therefore, newspapers still maintain their influence and legitimising power. © 2018 Centro de Investigaciones Sociologicas. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the dynamics of political participation on the ‘We Are All Khaled Said’ Facebook page, which hosted the call for Egypt’s 25 January 2011 revolution. It shows that the page served as a proto-democratic instrument by introducing both qualitative and quantitative polls and following up with actions based on majority opinion. This argument is developed through an analysis of discussion threads and polls from the page, selected from a data set of 14,072 posts, 6,810,357 comments and 32,030,731 likes made by 1,892,118 users, extracted via a customized version of Netvizz. The analysis demonstrates that the page provided a basic lesson in democratic participation to its users. ‘We Are All Khaled Said’ constituted an unprecedented public space for active discussions on fighting corruption, torture and police brutality. Moreover, it served as a practical example of shared governance and political participation, which became a model for its users to strive to apply to their country. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: This experimental study tests effects of exposure to video narratives about successful symptom relief with Medical Cannabis (MC) on attitudes, beliefs, and intentions related to recreational cannabis use. Methods: Patient video testimonials were modeled after those found in extant media coverage. Israeli participants (N = 396) recruited through an online survey company were randomly assigned to view a narrative or a non-narrative video containing equivalent information about MC. Video content was further manipulated based on whether the protagonist had a stigmatized disease or not, and whether attribution of responsibility for his disease was internal or external. Results: Exposure to patient testimonials indirectly increased positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use through changing attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to MC. Furthermore, exposure to narratives in which the patient was presented as not to blame for contracting his illness (external attribution) was associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions toward MC, a factor that was significantly associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use. Conclusions: These results suggest that narrative news media coverage of MC may influence public attitudes toward recreational cannabis. Because such media stories continue to be commonplace, it is important to examine potential spillover effects of this coverage on public perceptions of recreational cannabis. Cannabis prevention programs should address the role of media coverage in shaping public opinion and address the distinction between medical and recreational cannabis use. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The main concern that has been raised in this connection is that the complexity of political processes is being reduced to achievements and standpoints of individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country and people. ©2018, Midwest Political Science Association

AB  - In the ongoing national policy debate about how to best address serious mental illness (SMI), a major controversy among mental health advocates is whether drawing public attention to an apparent link betweenSMI and violence, shown to elevate stigma, is the optimal strategy for increasing public support for investing inmental health services or whether nonstigmatizing messages can be equally effective.We conducted a randomized experiment to examine this question. Participants in a nationally representative online panel (N= 1,326) were randomized to a control arm or to read one of three brief narratives about SMI emphasizing violence, systemic barriers to treatment, or successful treatment and recovery. Narratives, or stories about individuals, are a common communication strategy used by policy makers, advocates, and the news media. Study results showed that narratives emphasizing violence or barriers to treatment were equally effective in increasing the public's willingness to pay additional taxes to improve the mental health system (55 percent and 52 percent, vs. 42 percent in the control arm). Only the narrative emphasizing the link between SMI and violence increased stigma. For mental health advocates dedicated to improving the public mental health system, these findings offer an alternative to stigmatizingmessages linking mental illness and violence. © 2018 by Duke University Press.

AB  - This article examines the discourse practices of Greek journalism on mainstream commercial prime-time news. The article draws on data from Greek prime-time news and political current affair programmes over a 15-year period (from the early 2000s to date). By focusing on discourse and conversation analysis of journalistic talk in the studio, it will be shown that shifting discursive practices already in place long before the onset of the financial crisis that has afflicted Greece since 2010 have endowed Greek journalism with the discursive entitlements (or ‘frame space’) to challenge and hold politicians to account, in principle, allowing for more democratic journalistic gatekeeping. In reality, however, these same practices have created the conditions for an epistemological upgrading of opinion to the status of factual news reporting, in fact proposing ‘conversation as news’. These conversational practices have facilitated the Greek media’s role in shaping public opinion while allowing for the ideological manipulation of audiences. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: Despite supporting scientific evidence, community water fluoridation (CWF) often fails in public referenda. To understand why, the authors quantitatively analyzed text from news media coverage of CWF referenda. Methods: The authors analyzed text from 234 articles covering 11 CWF referenda conducted in 3 US cities from 1956 through 2013. The authors used cluster analysis to identify each article's core rhetoric and classified it according to sentiment and tone. The authors used multilevel count regression models to measure the use of positive and negative words regarding CWF. Results: Media coverage more closely resembled core rhetoric used by fluoridation opponents than the rhetoric used by fluoridation proponents. Despite the scientific evidence, the media reports were balanced in tone and sentiment for and against CWF. However, in articles emphasizing children, greater negative sentiment was associated with CWF rejection. Conclusions: Media coverage depicted an artificial balance of evidence and tone in favor of and against CWF. The focus on children was associated with more negative tone in cities where voters rejected CWF. Practical Implications: When speaking to the media, advocates for CWF should emphasize benefits for children and use positive terms about dental health rather than negative terms about dental disease. © 2018 American Dental Association

AB  - The use of educational video games (EVGs) is gaining momentum as a means to motivate and to engage students in their learning process. Nevertheless, previous research is taking for granted that students have a positive attitude towards EVGs and did not ensure a proper understanding of students’ characteristics that might influence their attitude towards them. Therefore, this study's main goal is to explore four students’ characteristics (perceived relevance, perceived confidence, media affinity, and perceived self-efficacy) that influence students’ attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Using the fsQCA method to analyze data gathered on a sample of 128 undergraduate students we delve into different configurations underlying students’ positive and negative attitude towards the use of EVGs. Main results suggest three configurations leading to a positive attitude with perceived relevance being a necessary and sufficient condition for students’ positive attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop their competencies. Four configurations were found to condition a negative attitude suggesting that equifinality can be considered when explaining students’ attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Implications for teachers, limitations of the study, and future research lines are addressed at the end of the paper. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper examines the effectiveness of popularity cues in online fashion retail. Despite the fact that popularity cues have shown to be effective, we expect that popularity cues can be detrimental to expressive products like fashion products under certain conditions. Two experimental studies were conducted. The first study adopted a single-factor (popularity vs. no cue) between-subjects design. The results revealed that consumers exhibited a negative attitude toward the brand (Ab) for fashion products with a popularity cue vs. no cue. In the second study, a 2 (popularity vs. no cue) by 2 (conspicuous vs. non-conspicuous fashion product) by 3 (low vs. medium vs. high price) between-subjects factorial design was conducted. Upon running a series of moderated mediation analyses, the results showed that the price level and the product conspicuousness moderated the indirect effect of popularity cues on Ab through perceived quality. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To help inform the debate over whether social media is related to political polarization, we investigated the effects of social media use on changes in political view using panel data collected in South Korea (N = 6411) between 2012 and 2016. We found that, although there were no direct effects of social media use, social media indirectly contributed to polarization through increased political engagement. Those who actively used social network sites were more likely to engage in political processes, which led them to develop more extreme political attitudes over time than those who did not use social network sites. In particular, we observed a clear trend toward a more liberal direction among both politically neutral users and moderately liberal users. In this study, we highlight the role of social media in activating political participation, which eventually pushes the users toward the ideological poles. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of social media has become an integral part of daily routine in modern society. Social media portals offer powerful public platforms where people can freely share their opinions and feelings about various topics with large crowds. In the current study, we investigated the public opinions and sentiments towards the Syrian refugee crisis, which has affected millions of people and has become a widely discussed, polarizing topic in social media around the world. To analyze public sentiments about the topic on Twitter, we collected a total of 2381,297 relevant tweets in two languages including Turkish and English. Turkish sentiments were considered important as Turkey has welcomed the largest number of Syrian refugees and Turkish tweets carried information to reflect public perception of a refugee hosting country first handedly. We performed a comparative sentiment analysis of retrieved tweets. The results indicated that the sentiments in Turkish tweets were significantly different from the sentiments in English tweets. We found that Turkish tweets carried slightly more positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees than neutral and negative sentiments, nevertheless the sentiments of tweets were almost evenly distributed among the three major categories. On the other hand, the largest number of English tweets by a significant margin contained neutral sentiments, which was followed by the negative sentiments. In comparison to the ratio of positive sentiments in Turkish tweets, 35% of all Turkish tweets, the proportion of English tweets contained remarkably less positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees, only 12% of all English tweets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Offline networks have been the subject of intense academic scrutiny for many decades, but we still know little about the nationwide spatial interaction patterns and its application for public opinion management of online social networks. With the aim of uncovering the geographic interaction characteristics of online public opinion propagation, we analyze a large dataset obtained from WeChat, the most popular social media application in China, and construct the spatial interaction network G, which contains 359 city-nodes. It is found that the communities in the network and the administrative division corresponded well with each other, and cities with high betweenness and degree also develop well in the economy. Public opinion propagation depends on the state of online interaction. The findings indicate that public opinion should be managed separately by regions divided according to the community division, and different regions should adopt different management methods according to their economic, historical and political characteristics. In our work, the possibility and opportunity is presented to study the spatial interaction patterns of online public opinion propagation with the massive behavioral data and the methods of complex network. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Portrayals of characters with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in films and TV series are subject to intense debate over whether such representations are accurate. Inaccurate portrayals are a concern as they may lead to increased stereotypes toward the condition. We investigate whether portrayals of characters with autism spectrum disorder in film and TV-series align with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Our data show that characters present a full range of characteristics described in the DSM-5. The meaning of this finding is discussed in relation to potential educational value of on screen portrayals and the notion of authenticity in representing the autistic experience. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - The object of this exploratory study is to identify the positive, neutral and negative environment factors that affect users who visit Spanish hotels in order to help the hotel managers decide how to improve the quality of the services provided. To carry out the research a Sentiment Analysis was initially performed, grouping the sample of tweets (n = 14459) according to the feelings shown and then a textual analysis was used to identify the key environment factors in these feelings using the qualitative analysis software Nvivo (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). The results of the exploratory study present the key environment factors that affect the users experience when visiting hotels in Spain, such as actions that support local traditions and products, the maintenance of rural areas respecting the local environment and nature, or respecting air quality in the areas where hotels have facilities and offer services. The conclusions of the research can help hotels improve their services and the impact on the environment, as well as improving the visitors experience based on the positive, neutral and negative environment factors which the visitors themselves identified. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study explored the consumer behavior of intention to purchase green products based on a decision-making model that integrates cognitive attributes, affective attributes, and behavioral intentions in Belt and Road countries. The questionnaires were collected from customers who previously purchased green products; this study distributed the questionnaires at the appliance section of the department stores and collected 227 valid responses. Environmental attitude, product attitude, social influence, and perceived monetary value positively affected purchase intention; among these attributes, product attitude most substantially affected purchase intention. Cognitive values (collective and individual) significantly and positively affected environmental and product attitudes. Regarding individual environmental literacy, objective knowledge did not significantly affect environmental attitude, whereas subjective knowledge positively and significantly affected product attitude. In addition, both environmental awareness and government role (extrinsic motivating attributes) significantly and positively affected environmental and product attitudes for sustainable consumption. Media exposure also exerted a significant positive effect on environmental attitude for reducing, reusing and recycling emissions. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Current sanitation systems are inherently limited in their ability to address the new challenges for (waste)water management that arise from the rising demand to restore resource cycles. These challenges include removal of micropollutants, water (re)use, and nutrient recovery. New opportunities to address these challenges arise from new sanitation, a system innovation that combines elements of source separation, local treatment and reuse, and less use of water. New sanitation is applied, but not yet widespread, in several residential areas in Europe. Implementation is hindered by the lack of insight into the general public's willingness to engage in new sanitation, and the resulting uncertainty about this among decision makers and other stakeholders in wastewater management. Using value-belief-norm theory as a conceptual lens, this paper addresses the individual motivations (pro-environmental personal norms) and personal drivers (benefits) and barriers (risks) for acceptance of new sanitation by the Dutch general public. The results of an online survey (N = 338) indicated that both pro-environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions predict consumers' willingness to accept new sanitation. More specifically, they showed that consumer acceptance is driven by perceived risks relating to the housing market and the need to change behavior, but also by environmental benefits. Overall, new sanitation was favorably evaluated by respondents: 64% indicated that they would likely use new sanitation if they were owner-occupiers. The results of this explorative study are discussed in light of the development of novel sanitation systems that are sensitive to perceptions of end-users and other key stakeholders. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Employees creativity has been recognized as a crucial part of an organization's ability to be innovative. To know which factors contribute to employee involvement in creative work, in this paper, we first examine the effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to employees. Moreover, we study the employees' positive work attitudes and their intention to leave as a mediating mechanism to explain the effect of CSR to employees on the involvement of employees in creative work. Survey data from 209 employees in 45 small-sized enterprises in Iran were used to test the hypotheses of the study. The hypotheses were tested with hierarchical regression analyses using SPSS software. The results support the direct impact of CSR to employees on employees' creative work involvement. In addition, the findings indicate that the indirect effect of CSR to employees on the involvement of employees in creative work through positive work attitudes and their intention to leave are significant. Consequently, small-sized enterprises should reinforce CSR to employees to elevate their involvement in creative work. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s, which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as ‘guestworkers’ or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a ‘natural reaction’ against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the ‘guestworkers’. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian ‘tigers’ pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While anthropomorphizing nonhuman animals has been shown to increase identification with them and, by extension, concern for their wellbeing, little research has directly tested whether identifying with nonhuman animals is similarly associated with concern for their wellbeing. We tested hypotheses related to this premise across three cross-sectional studies. In study 1 (n = 224), we tested the hypothesis that therians—a group of people who self-identify with nonhuman animals, show greater concern for nonhuman animal rights than non-therian furries—people with a fan-like interest in media featuring anthropomorphized animal characters. In study 2 (n = 206), we further tested this hypothesis using implicit and explicit measures of identification with nonhuman animals to predict behavioral intentions to support nonhuman animal rights. In study 3 (n = 182), we tested the generalizability of our findings in a sample of undergraduate students. Taken together, the studies show that explicit, but not implicit, identification with nonhuman animals predicts greater support for their rights. The implications of these findings for research on anthropomorphism and animal rights activism are discussed, as well as the limitations of these findings and possible avenues for future research. © 2018 ISAZ.

AB  - Influenza vaccines represent a major tool to contain the clinical and epidemiological burden generated by influenza. However, in spite of their effectiveness, vaccines are victims of prejudices and false myths, which contribute to the increasing phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy and loss of confidence. Media and, mainly, new media, and information and communication technologies play a major role in disseminating health-related information. While, on the one hand, they can be extremely promising in promoting disease prevention, on the other hand, they can also have a negative impact on population's health attitudes and behaviors when delivering information not based on scientific evidences. The “Fluad-case” is an excellent example of the crucial role of an adequate information campaign. Following the cluster of deaths allegedly related to the administration of the adjuvanted influenza vaccine “Fluad” during the 2014–2015 influenza campaign, the Italian health authorities and regulatory bodies decided the withdrawal of two potentially contaminated Fluad batches. This fostered a huge media coverage, with resulted in negatively impacting on influenza vaccination coverage. Monitoring and tracking the Fluad-related web searches, we showed that Liguria resulted the Italian region with the highest number of Fluad-related website searches and that, interestingly, Fluad was searched also in Regions in which this vaccine was not distributed. A positive moderate correlation between accessing Fluad-related websites and overall influenza vaccination coverage was found (r = 0.66 ([95%CI 0.29–0.86], p = 0.0026). Considering subjects ≥65 years, who are the subjects for which the Fluad vaccination is recommended, the correlation resulted r = 0.49 ([95%CI 0.03–0.78], p = 0.0397). As such, health authorities and decision-makers should promote high-quality communication campaigns in order to raise awareness of vaccination practices. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between online alternative media consumption and public support for radical social movement goals and tactics. Theoretically, online alternative media use could relate to the holding of more radical views either because such views are propagated by the alternative media or because of the breeding of extreme views through communications among like-minded people. At the same time, this relationship is expected to be particularly strong when online alternative media use is coupled with specific types of movement experiences. Analysis of a representative survey (N = 1012) in Hong Kong shows that both online alternative media use and participation in the Umbrella Movement in 2014 related positively to the attitude toward violent protests and toward Hong Kong independence, and the relationship between online alternative media use and radical views was particularly strong among the Umbrella Movement participants. The analysis also shows a distinction between the implications of consumption of alternative media belonging to different political factions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - One of the overarching goals of international large-scale assessments (ILSA) is to inform public discourse about the quality of education in different countries. To fulfil this function, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for example, raises awareness of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results through different forms of traditional and social media (e.g. press releases and other activities under the slogan PISA Day). Scholars have responded to the rapid growth of ILSA by examining public discourse through newspaper articles, policy documents, and other outlets. However, we know very little about whether and to what extent the general public is actually affected by PISA results. In order to address this gap, this study uses data regarding public trust in education from the 2011 wave of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Drawing on survey data from 30 countries and Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM), the study shows that PISA rankings have a significant effect on public perceptions. We find that in high performing countries the general public expresses higher levels of confidence in the education system. We discuss these patterns in the context of growing politicisation of education policy making and the use of ILSA as evidence. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article is based on the hypothesis that the Egyptian institutional media played an active role in the Egyptian ‘Arab Spring’; revolution in 2011 and analyzes how Egypt’s official newspapers constructed and presented a moderate and positive image of the Muslim Brotherhood (hereinafter the Brotherhood) despite the fact that they had labeled the Brotherhood ‘he outlawed movement’: a year earlier. In order to examine whether their attitudes changed after the downfall of the Mubarak regime, a critical discourse analysis of newspaper texts has been made of the news columns written throughout 2011 of two of the most popular Egyptian newspapers; al-Ahram (n = 115) and al-Gumhuriyya (n = 94) both of which identify with the Egyptian government's official policy. In addition, an analysis made of three of the Brotherhood's publications (n = 72) (N = 281) revealed that the Brotherhood exploited the printed media not only to replace the regime but also to gain control of its narrative. Ultimately, by controlling the shaping of public opinion, the media contributed to the drawing of a parallel between the motivation that formed the basis of the mass protest and the Brotherhood’s agenda. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Recent legislation in Pennsylvania allows police officers to administer naloxone to individuals in an opioid overdose. Pressure has subsequently been placed on police departments to adopt naloxone programs. Objective: To survey Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police regarding potential obstacles to officer-administered naloxone, and their overall opinion toward such programs. Methods: A confidential survey was administered at the Annual Conference for the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police Association and online over the organization’s listserv. Respondents rated their level of concern toward four potential obstacles on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. A fifth question asked the degree to which they agree that the benefits of naloxone programs outweigh the risks. Results: Of 180 attendees, 36 Chiefs of Police responded at the conference and 48 to the online survey. The potential agitation of revived victims was their largest reported concern, with 60% responding either a 4 or 5; this was followed by officers correctly identifying situations to use naloxone (42%), the cost of the medication (38%), and the additional administrative duties of the department (32%). Overall 60% responded they “Strongly Agree” or “Agree” the benefits of naloxone programs outweigh the risks, while 23% responded “Strongly Disagree” or “Disagree.” No significant differences were seen when separating participants from rural and urban counties or from counties with high, medium, and low rates of overdose fatalities. Conclusions: The results suggest that although a significant subset shows concern for the above obstacles, the majority of Chiefs of Police believe that the benefits of equipping officers with naloxone outweigh the risks. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper examines 96 US and British Commonwealth articles on the 2014 Wisconsin Slender Man stabbing. Using critical textual analysis, this study examined how media took a horror-themed meme from the underbelly of the Internet and curated a moral panic, once the meme was thrust into the international limelight. Because memes are a particular intersection of images and technology, media made sense of this meme-inspired attack in three ways: (1) through an idolatrous tone that played on long-standing Western anxieties over images; (2) by hyper-sensationalizing women’s so-called frivolous uses of technology; and (3) by removing blame from the assailants and, in turn, finding the Internet and the Slender Man meme guilty in the court of public opinion. Through this tripartite rhetoric, this study suggests that when media set out to curate a moral panic surrounding images and technology, together, the discourse that emerges is one that feminizes the Internet, turning it into technology-as-mother and image-as-child. This study also suggests this is the case because when women receive macro-level structure equality, micro-level inequities and attempts of control against them increase. Digital and image rhetoric are not exceptions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - At the intersection of behavioral and institutional studies of policy making lie a series of questions about how elite choices affect mass public opinion. Scholars have considered how judicial decisions—especially US Supreme Court decisions—affect individuals’ support for specific policy positions.These studies yield a series of competing findings.Whereas past research uses opinion surveys to assess how individuals’ opinions are shaped, we believe that modern techniques for analyzing social media provide analytic leverage that traditional approaches do not offer. We present a framework for employing Twitter data to study mass opinion discourse. We find that the Supreme Court’s decisions relating to same-sex marriage in 2013 had significant effects on how the public discussed same-sex marriage and had a polarizing effect on mass opinion. We conclude by connecting these findings and our analyses to larger problems and debates in the area of democratic deliberation and big-data analysis. © 2018 by the Law and Courts Organized Section of the American Political Science Association.

AB  - The present study was prompted by awareness of prejudicial attitudes towards refugees evident in Australian media and politics. It used some innovative measures of prejudice including the distance apart in chair placements made by respondents prior to sitting next to a refugee and estimates of the hypothetical dollar value of resources to be allocated to refugees in comparison with the amount to be allocated to indigenous Australians and other social groups. More conventional attitude scale measures were also used (the Attitudes Towards Asylum Seekers Scale, an infrahumanisation measure, an empathy measure, a measure of perspective taking). In an attempt to reduce prejudice levels, the social psychology technique of imagined contact with an outgroup (asylum seekers who travel to Australia by boat) was used. The experimental design used randomised, independent groups (imagined contact and control conditions) with repeated measures for time (post intervention and follow up). University students (N = 54) who imagined an interaction with an asylum seeker showed higher levels of empathy than did the control group. While measures of prejudice did not differ between experimental conditions, notably low levels of prejudice in this student sample from a north Queensland university were found. The low levels of prejudice found in the present sample were both gratifying and somewhat unexpected. The study needs to be replicated with a community sample comparison group included or one initially shown to hold more strongly prejudicial attitudes. © 2018 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - Background: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) stigma (ie, negative attitudes toward PrEP users) has been widely documented and is considered a significant barrier to implementation. However, few studies have examined PrEP stigma using implicit measures designed to reduce demand characteristics in responding. This study examined implicit PrEP- and HIV-related stigma among gay and bisexual men using geospatial social networking applications (ie, “hookup apps”). Methods: Participants were presented with 4 simulated online profiles (pretested for comparability) paired with each of the following characteristics: HIV negative, HIV positive, on PrEP, or substance user. Participants rated the profiles on attractiveness, desirability, trustworthiness, likelihood of condom use, and riskiness of sex. Results: There was no evidence of PrEP-related stigma, ie, participants did not rate profiles of PrEP users more negatively than profiles of HIV-negative individuals not disclosing PrEP use. However, profiles of HIV-positive individuals were rated significantly less attractive and desirable than HIV-negative or PrEP profiles. When the sample was split by history of PrEP use, negative ratings of HIV-positive profiles remained only among participants who had never taken PrEP. Participants with any history of PrEP use demonstrated no difference in ratings by HIV status. Conclusion: These data provide the first empirical evidence for lower HIV stigma among PrEP users. Individuals who have used PrEP may “see” HIV-positive individuals differently than those without a history of PrEP use. The lack of evidence for PrEP-related stigma is encouraging and suggests that negative stereotypes about PrEP users may not extend to negative implicit judgments about them on social networking sites.

AB  - In the modern world, the media has become an important tool for shaping public discourse. Although it is not clear to what extent public opinion is shaped by media frames, there is no doubt that the media plays an important role in providing information to the public and influencing the way in which reality is perceived. This article critically analyses the framing of corruption narratives in Zimbabwean newspapers through the prism of framing theory. Scholars have long established that news disseminated by the media is not necessarily neutral information but frames and/or ideological perspectives of news organizations and/or journalists. When news organizations report news, they do so from a certain perspective, guided by the policies and interests of the media organization and its sponsors. Post-2000 Zimbabwe has faced an unprecedented economic/political crisis that has arguably created a conducive atmosphere for corruption.This article focuses on the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (Zimdef) corruption scandal of 2016 in which the then Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Professor Jonathan Moyo, was implicated. The objective is, first, to determine how corruption is framed in Zimbabwean newspapers, and second to critically analyse the different frames of the Zimdef corruption scandal as presented by selected newspapers. The results of the analysis show that newspapers in Zimbabwe frame corruption as a moral issue with economic consequences and suspects of corruption are often framed as morally bankrupt criminals. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - The deluge of online and offline misinformation is overloading the exchange of ideas upon which democracies depend. Fake news, conspiracy theories, and deceptive social bots proliferate, facilitating the manipulation of public opinion. Countering misinformation while protecting freedom of speech will require collaboration across industry, journalism, and academe. The Workshop on Digital Misinformation ' held in May 2017, in conjunction with the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media in Montreal ' was intended to foster these efforts. The meeting brought together more than 100 stakeholders from academia, media, and tech companies to discuss the research challenges implicit in building a trustworthy web. In this article, we outline the main findings from the discussion. Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper spotlights the sporting lives of young people who live in ‘Redcrest’, a public housing community in the Niagara region of Canada. We report on data culled from neighborhood-centric documents (municipal data, planning council reports, media coverage) and ethnographic fieldwork (interviews, community mapping, go-alongs) collected over eight months with 14 young people. This paper also offers a critique of Robert Sampson’s work on neighborhood effects and draws on the theoretical insights and urban scholarship of Henri Lefebvre, Loic Wacquant, and the work of postcolonial scholar Frantz Fanon, who further understandings of racism as a spatial relation. At the center of this research are narratives that highlight that public housing projects, negative stigma notwithstanding, can be good places to live. The results highlight the various contradictions and tensions experienced by young people living in Redcrest, specifically their experiences with neighborhood stigma, racism and Islamophobia, and how this impacts their sporting lives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Several previous studies have explored air travellers’ willingness to compensate for their aviation carbon emissions or their willingness to pay for voluntary carbon offsetting programs. These studies have concluded that it is important to educate air travellers about the negative impacts of aviation on the environment. This study proposes two types of communication media and measures their effects on passengers’ knowledge about the environmental impacts of aviation. Then, travellers’ attitudes toward carbon offsetting and their willingness to offset their flights or change their travel behaviour are measured. Finally, a path model is estimated to analyse the effects of the various sources of knowledge on travellers’ knowledge about aviation and the environment, their attitudes toward the environmental impacts of aviation and their willingness to mitigate these impacts. The outcomes suggest that appropriate media could be adopted to enhance passengers’ knowledge of aviation impacts and the benefits of carbon offset programs, which could help passengers develop positive attitudes toward carbon offsetting and be more willing to offset their flights and change their travel behaviour. Not only does this study verify the relationships among knowledge, attitude, and behaviour (intention), it also has implications beyond academic research: it demonstrates that environmental education for air travellers should be prioritized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - News media plays an important role in shaping public opinions and attitudes about the environment. Tracking and analyzing media coverage can provide insight into public exposure to narratives that impact resource consumption, environmental behavior, and emergency response, which can help to inform model development or provide additional model inputs. This paper presents Articulate, an open-source, flexible tool for discovering, compiling, and quantifying newspaper coverage on a user-specified topic. Articulate is written in Python and interfaces with Google Custom Search Engine API. We demonstrate the tool's application and validate its performance on two case studies of news media coverage in the New York Times about drought in California and flooding in Houston, Texas in recent years. Our results show that Articulate can generate data similar to or better than proprietary databases. Thus, Articulate can help researchers and environmental managers gain important insights to better understand and quantify changing socio-environmental dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - News consumers expect news outlets to be objective and balanced in their reports of events and opinions. However, there is a growing body of evidence of bias in the media caused by underlying political and socio-economic viewpoints. Previous studies have tried to classify the partiality of the media, but there is little work on quantifying it, and less still on the nature of this partiality. The vast amount of content published in social media enables us to quantify the inclination of the press to pre-defined sides of the socio-political spectrum. To describe such tendencies, we use tweets to automatically compute a news outlet’s political and socio-economic orientation. Results show that the media have a measurable bias, and illustrate this by showing the favoritism of Chilean media for the ruling political parties in the country. This favoritism becomes clearer as we empirically observe a shift in the position of the mass media when there is a change in government. Even though relative differences in bias between news outlets can be observed, public awareness of the bias of the media landscape as a whole appears to be limited by the political space defined by the news that we receive as a population. We found that the nature of the bias is reflected in the vocabulary used and the entities mentioned by different news outlets. A survey conducted among news consumers confirms that media bias has an impact on the coverage of controversial topics and that this is perceivable by the general audience. Having a more accurate method to measure and characterize media bias will help readers position outlets in the socio-economic landscape, even when a (sometimes opposite) self-declared position is stated. This will empower readers to better reflect on the content provided by their news outlets of choice. © 2018 Elejalde et al.

AB  - Micro-blogging systems have become one of the most important ways for information sharing. Network structure and users’ interactions such as forwarding behaviors have aroused considerable research attention, while mention, as a key feature in micro-blogging platforms which can improve the visibility of a message and direct it to a particular user beyond the underlying social structure, is seldom studied in previous works. In this paper, we empirically study the mention effect in information diffusion, using the dataset from a population-scale social media website. We find that users with high number of followers would receive much more mentions than others. We further investigate the effect of mention in information diffusion by examining the response probability with respect to the number of mentions in a message and observe a saturation at around 5 mentions. Furthermore, we find that the response probability is the highest when a reciprocal followship exists between users, and one is more likely to receive a target user’s response if they have similar social status. To illustrate these findings, we propose the response prediction task and formulate it as a binary classification problem. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of discovered factors. Our results have consequences for the understanding of human dynamics on the social network, and potential implications for viral marketing and public opinion monitoring. © 2018 Bao et al.

AB  - Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample data-sets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios. © 2018 Mozetič et al.

AB  - Analyzing data from the LA Jewish Journal Survey conducted in July 2015 (N = 501), the study empirically examines the relative influence of politics versus place on support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement among members of the American-Jewish community. The results suggest that personal politics, or identifying as a Democrat and holding liberal political views, has the largest impact on support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Place, or having been to Israel, has the largest influence on opinion strength or supporting or opposing the deal rather than maintaining a position of ambivalence. The strategic implications of these findings for key stakeholders, including politicians, ethnic news media organizations, and lobbying groups, are discussed. © The Author 2016.

AB  - To investigate the phenomenon of patient–physician mistrust in China, a qualitative study involving 107 physicians, nurses and health officials in Guangdong Province, southern China, was conducted through semi-structured interviews and focus groups. In this paper we report the key findings of the empirical study and argue for the essential role of medical professionalism in rebuilding patient-physician trust. Health professionals are trapped in a vicious circle of mistrust. Mistrust (particularly physicians’ distrust of patients and their relatives) leads to increased levels of fear and self-protection by doctors which exacerbate difficulties in communication; in turn, this increases physician workloads, adding to a strong sense of injustice and victimization. These factors produce poorer healthcare outcomes and increasingly discontented and angry patients, escalate conflicts and disputes, and result in negative media coverage, all these ultimately contributing to even greater levels of mistrust. The vicious circle indicates not only the crisis of patient-physician relationship but the crisis of medicine as a profession and institution. Underlying the circle is the inherent conflict of interest in the healthcare system by which health professionals and hospitals have become profit-driven. This institutional conflict of interest seriously compromises the fundamental principle of medical professionalism—the primacy of patient welfare—as well as the traditional Chinese ideal of “medicine as the art of humanity”. Patient trust can be restored through rectifying this institutional conflict of interest and promoting medical professionalism via a series of recommended practical measures. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A review of media reports and government communications showed evidence of anti-asylum seeker sentiment and prejudicial attitudes towards asylum seekers in Australia (those arriving by boat). In the context of this background, reasons for the unexpected finding of relatively low levels of prejudice towards asylum seekers in a sample of university students from a north Queensland university are discussed, including the potential relevance of a relationship between attitudes and educational level. The salience of education in attitude formation led to a discussion of the importance of culturally aware university teaching policies to counter prejudice based on misinformation or bias. University teaching policies, in turn, have been strongly influenced by professional accreditation requirements, particularly in the health sector. Attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers are also used to illustrate the role of good journalism in attitude formation and examples of positive and negative journalism practices are described. While much greater attention to cultural awareness issues is evident in current university teaching, there is, as yet, no strong evidence to support positive outcomes as a result of this teaching focus. © 2018 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - This article contributes to the theoretical and methodological discussion on textual-contextual analysis in political communication and media research. It argues that taking into consideration both text and context throughout an analysis of the process of production enables the observation of the relation between the social and the linguistic. It opens up a non-deterministic perspective for the analysis of the above relation. The article rests upon an empirical study on the production of discourses for the campaign of European Parliament elections. The use of such a multilevel approach adds important elements to the research findings, particularly in terms of showing on the one hand how power relations within ‘Europarties’ results in the construction of common European identities in different European Union (EU) states, and on the other hand how professionalization of political communication reinforces discursive dissimilarities between parties of the same ideological family in different EU states. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Purpose: In March 2017, the ACGME relaxed resident duty-hour restrictions to allow first-year residents to work 24-hour shifts, affecting the internship experience of incoming radiology residents. The aim of this study was to assess the media response to this duty-hour change, comparing news articles with favorable and unfavorable views. Methods: Google News was used to identify 36 relevant unique news articles published over a 4-week period after the announcement. Articles’ stance was categorized as favorable, unfavorable, or neutral. Additional article characteristics were explored. Results: Article sources were 58% national, 22% local, and 20% medical news. Article stance was most commonly unfavorable for national news sources (48%), compared with neutral for local (62%) and medical (72%) news sources. Most common reasons for unfavorable stance were sleep deprivation (n = 11), medical errors (n = 11), residents’ health (n = 9), risk for car accidents (n = 9), a patriarchal hazing system (n = 6), and work-life balance (n = 5). Most common reasons for favorable stance were impact on resident education (n = 7) and continuity of care (n = 7). Supporting data were cited by 38% of unfavorable and 100% of favorable articles. Unfavorable articles most commonly quoted physicians affiliated with resident advocacy groups; favorable articles most commonly quoted physicians affiliated with the ACGME. Conclusions: The relaxed duty-hour restrictions received an overall unfavorable media response, particularly in nonmedical news sources, driven by concerns regarding sleep-deprived doctors. Favorable articles ubiquitously cited data supporting the safety of relaxed duty hour restrictions. Further research is warranted to better understand the impact of relaxed resident duty-hour limits on sleep deprivation, residents’ health and education, and the quality of patient care. © 2017 American College of Radiology

AB  - Within the current hybrid media system, in which the “old” and “new” media coexist, the role of social networks in the consumption of news has become increasingly important in recent years. Previous research has highlighted the importance and the transformational potential of user interactions in social networks in the traditional news cycle, when exchanging or discussing content related to news or public affairs, jeopardizing the traditional hegemony of the journalists and media as gatekeepers of public affairs. Our research follows a mixed methodological approach (survey plus focus groups) that reach relevant conclusions that expands the body of research about the role of news sites and social networks within the formulation of public opinion and its effects on audiences and journalism. Results showed how news sites and social networks, through links posted by friends, relatives, or acquaintances, facilitate people to access news outside their usual patterns of news consumption. Social networks, in this way, could break with the preestablished dynamics of selective exposure of individuals. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.

AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Do popular films activate authoritarianism? We theorize that, because of the willing suspension of disbelief, films encourage social learning, which primes viewers to respond to messages activating latent personality traits such as authoritarianism. This activation then affects citizens’ political attitudes. To test our theory, we use a 1 × 3 posttest experimental design where treatment groups watch feature-length films. As treatments, subjects watch 300 and V for Vendetta, and the control film is 21 Jump Street. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that 300 activates authoritarianism while V for Vendetta activates antiauthoritarianism. As expected, 21 Jump Street has no effect. In addition, we show that the activation of authoritarianism produces significant differences in attitudes on U.S. primacy, rights of protestors, immigration, and military service. This research demonstrates how the causal mechanism between entertainment media and latent personality activation affects political attitudes, which advances both the American political behavior and media politics literature. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The emotional reaction and outrage following the publication of photographs of Alan Kurdi who drowned while crossing borders in September 2015 highlighted the major impact visual representations of refugee deaths at border crossings can have on public opinions and political will. The impact of these photographs also shows that depictions of deaths as a result of border crossings are relatively rare in the media; analyses of such representations and their potential impact on policy are also neglected in the literature. This article offers a commentary on the key themes linked to visual representations of refugee deaths at border crossings by considering three recent examples, and argues for further interdisciplinary discussions on such images. It focuses on two points: that depicting refugees alone has a greater impact on viewers and is more likely to trigger sympathy or outrage; concurrently, that anonymity can reduce viewers’ ability to connect with the tragedy. This discussion adds to the body of literature on the links between media representations and policymaking, and on the mediation of human vulnerability through visual means. The themes outlined here have much currency in contemporary discussions on refugee deaths at border crossings. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - While extensive literatures study the responsiveness of policy to public opinion and the influence of interest groups, few studies look at both factors simultaneously. This article offers an analysis of the influence of media advocacy and public opinion on political attention and policy change for four regulatory issues over a relatively long period of time in Sweden. The data pools together measures of public support for specific policies with new data on attention to the policy issues in the Swedish parliament, policy developments over time and detailed coding of the claims of interest advocates in two major Swedish newspapers. Analyzing this data, a complex picture without a general tendency for either public opinion or media advocacy to act as dominant forces in producing policy change is revealed, although some evidence is found that the public is successful in stimulating political attention when it supports policy proposals aimed at changing the status quo. © 2018 Nordic Political Science Association

AB  - While heightening public awareness through social media can enhance wildlife conservation and management efforts, the influence of media content and quality in relation to these efforts is poorly understood. In this study, online news and related public comments on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), one of China's flagship species, was collected and evaluated to determine the performance of media news releases in strengthening public awareness. Media releases on the incidents of dolphins straying into freshwater systems at Dongping, Beijiang, and Baisha Rivers, in the Pearl River Delta of China were examined. WeChat, the largest social networking platform in China, was used as the data source. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to test the news popularity by publisher type, title tone, picture counts, and word counts. Content analysis (CA) was used for mining wildlife conservation information in articles and identifying public opinions. GLM results showed that three publishers (traditional, governmental and private) as well as articles with more pictures attracted greater online readerships. CA results showed that articles were unable to popularize wildlife conservation knowledge, and the public was highly doubtful about conservation efforts by the government and experts. The finding here suggests that greater attention is needed for depicting and delivering conservation knowledge (e.g., rescue methods, biological features), negative impact on wildlife by diverse human behavior, and detailed proper descriptions to promote public awareness on wildlife conservation using multi-faceted thinking so as to reduce public misunderstanding of policymakers and experts. A suggested concerted framework could help strengthen wildlife management through social media. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Media representations of sexuality after childbirth depict vaginal birth as harmful and cesarean delivery as protective, although research does not support these depictions. The objective of the current study was to investigate perceptions of the effects of mode of delivery on sexuality. Methods: Nulliparous participants who were able to and interested in giving birth (N = 1428) completed an online survey about their preferences for mode of delivery and their perceptions of childbirth as they specifically relate to sexuality. Participants provided demographic information, rated how influential different sources of information about childbirth were, and completed the Attitudes Toward Women's Genitals Scale. Results: Up to half (16-48%), the participants agreed with different statements about vaginal birth as harmful to, and cesarean delivery as protective of, future sexuality. Participant characteristics that were independently predictive of endorsing these beliefs were: self-identifying as heterosexual, holding negative attitudes toward women's genitals, and reporting that reality media, nonreality media, and online media sources are influential sources of childbirth information. Participants who rated health care professionals as an influential source of information were less likely to endorse these beliefs. Conclusion: Given that there is no clear evidence in the empirical literature to support the claim that vaginal births are harmful and cesarean delivery is protective to one's future sexual life, it is important to dispel the existing misconceptions. Various media sources likely play a role in the perpetuation of this misinformation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Communities are continually shaped by immigration. As immigrants join receiving community members as members of the same community, all must co-navigate emergent and evolving relationships. These intergroup relations can range from quite positive, marked by mutual enrichment and engagement, to quite negative, marked by prejudice and discrimination. This study seeks to illuminate immigrant and receiving community member relations by exploring what factors play a role in each group's attitudes and actions toward, and experiences with, one another. Thirty first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America and 30 third-generation or more U.S.-born respondents participated in semistructured interviews, which were thematically analyzed. Results indicated that while both intergroup contact (Allport, 1954) and the formation of common in-group identities (Gaertner, Dovidio, & Bachman, 1996) helped to create positive intergroup relations, numerous personal characteristics–including values and beliefs, visible features, and relative power–affected experiences and attitudes. Further, in the absence of knowledge based on direct contact, media played a strong role in shaping attitudes toward both groups of community members. These findings show how attitudes and actions of immigrants and receiving community members are each shaped by experiences, or lack thereof, between these groups. Moreover, this pathway is iterative and reciprocal. Therefore, efforts aimed at increasing and improving positive intergroup relations must consider the bidirectional iterative process and experiences of both groups. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The mass media has the ability to shape public opinion on child sexual offenders. To date, research has found that offenses committed by female child sexual offenders have been portrayed in the media with undertones of sympathy and romanticization. With the apparent shift in gender roles toward gender egalitarianism, the aim of the present study was to obtain an up-to-date understanding of how female child sexual offenders are portrayed in the print media across western countries. The study utilized newspaper articles involving female child sexual offenders, published in English across western countries from 2012 to 2016 (N = 35 articles). A qualitative content analysis revealed two major themes: female child sexual offenders are dangerous and they are accountable for their actions. The findings of the current study are positive and shed light on the potential advancement of the reporting of female child sexual offenders in the print media at an international level. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Sentiment analysis has applications in diverse contexts such as in the gathering and analysis of opinions of individuals about various products, issues, social, and political events. Understanding public opinion can help improve decision making. Opinion mining is a way of retrieving information via search engines, blogs, microblogs and social networks. Individual opinions are unique to each person, and Twitter tweets are an invaluable source of this type of data. However, the huge volume and unstructured nature of text/opinion data pose a challenge to analyzing the data efficiently. Accordingly, proficient algorithms/computational strategies are required for mining and condensing tweets as well as finding sentiment bearing words. Most existing computational methods/models/algorithms in the literature for identifying sentiments from such unstructured data rely on machine learning techniques with the bag-of-word approach as their basis. In this work, we use both unsupervised and supervised approaches on various datasets. Unsupervised approach is being used for the automatic identification of sentiment for tweets acquired from Twitter public domain. Different machine learning algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines are applied for sentiment identification of tweets as well as to examine the effectiveness of various feature combinations. In our experiment on tweets, we achieve an accuracy of 80.68% using the proposed unsupervised approach, in comparison to the lexicon based approach (the latter gives an accuracy of 75.20%). In our experiments, the supervised approach where we combine unigram, bigram and Part-of-Speech as feature is efficient in finding emotion and sentiment of unstructured data. For short message services, using the unigram feature with MNB classifier allows us to achieve an accuracy of 67%. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants’ attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Aim: This study examines perceptions of the implementation of National Council Licensing Examination in Canada through a content analysis of articles in the media. Background: Public opinions of nursing in the media have been acknowledged as important for the profession, specifically in relation to their portrayal of nursing. Introduction: The Canadian Council of Registered Nurse Regulators began using the US-based National Council Licensing Examination as entry examination (also known widely as NCLEX) for Canada's registered nurses, discontinuing the previous Canadian Registered Nurse Examination in 2015. Methods: A qualitative content analysis was conducted of media reports that emerged following adoption of the National Council Licensing Examination in Canada, and highlight the image of nursing portrayed in the media during this key regulatory policy change. Results: Release of the examination results for the first three quarters of 2015 identified a much lower overall Canadian pass rate than with the previous exam. Media reports highlight differences in perception of the examination between Canadian regulators and other stakeholders in the context of the examination experiences reported and test results. Issues around applicability of the examination to Canadian nursing practice, curriculum alignment, language translation concerns and stakeholder engagement were identified. Discussion: The implementation of the National Council Licensing Examination in Canada highlighted lack of communication among nursing stakeholders in the country. Conclusions: Most of the media reporting has been negative and poses a reputational risk to the Canadian nursing profession. Implications for Nursing Policy: This change in the licensing requirement has significant policy implications for nursing in Canada and globally. Issues such as appropriate examination translation, access to appropriate test preparation materials, assurance that the examination reflects distinctive aspects of a country's healthcare system and the need for stakeholder engagement were identified. © 2017 The Authors International Nursing Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Council of Nurses

AB  - YouTube™ is a frequently visited website that contains a large and diverse collection of health-related videos. The aim of this study was to identify the most popular videos on YouTube™.com related to human papillomavirus (HPV) and describe their content. This cross-sectional study involved using the search terms "HPV" and "human papillomavirus" to determine a purposive sample composed of an equal number of the most popular "professional" (n=35) and "consumer" (n=35) videos identified. Video content was analyzed and those videos related to HPV vaccination in any way were analyzed further to denote the nature of the message. The majority of videos (81.4%) provided general information related to HPV, discussed the association of HPV infection and the development of cancer (81.4%), and addressed HPV screening (64.3%). Just under one-half (n=34) of the videos addressed vaccination. Fifteen of these were neutral, while six were encouraging and 13 were discouraging. The videos included in this study were viewed ~17 million times, which indicates their potential for influencing public awareness and opinions. Of the videos devoted to HPV vaccination, few were encouraging. These videos may impede efforts to increase rates of HPV vaccination, which are already far below target levels. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.

AB  - Although many studies have examined the role of values in shaping public opinion, the number of values that inform this research is limited. This article employs the concept of issue-relevant values as a means to explore the broader range of values associated with policy issues. After discussing the concept in general terms, the article explores issue-relevant values pertinent to public opinion about gay rights. Using the policy examples of employment nondiscrimination and same-sex couple adoption, the present study identifies, measures, and assesses several values that add to the very short list previously used to explain public opinion about gay rights issues. Content from interest-group Web sites and news media coverage of the two issues aided in identifying the values. Data from an original Internet survey yield valid measures of the values. Multivariate analyses indicate that the values behave in predictable ways: they are strongly influenced by partisanship, and they strongly affect opinions about the two issues. The performance of the values is consistent with findings from previous research on the partisan basis of values and the value-based nature of opinions. The article concludes with suggestions for further empirical and theoretical work that could apply and extend the concept of issue-relevant values. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the worldwide lesbian and gay movements have diversified and increased their rights claims. The achievement of gay rights claims in society is the result of an interplay among various social factors and forces. Media is one of most influential players in building homosexual images and promoting mutual understanding. Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental illness patients anymore in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization. Thus this article aims to explore how homosexuals were portrayed in the official media of China, particularly the People’s Daily, to illustrate the changing perception of homosexuals in China’s political and social spheres. It argues that representation of homosexuals in the People’s Daily changed gradually from a negative perception to a more positive one with less discrimination and prejudice as shown by the article’s quantitative and qualitative results. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The emergence of new digital technologies, such as the Internet and new business models such as over-the-top (OTT) operators that utilize them, has transformed the media and broadcasting industries. As advanced technologies and business models are adopted, convergence between the broadcasting and telecommunication ("telecom") sectors has become a common business practice. Using the South Korean case study of a failed acquisition attempt of CJ HelloVision by SK Telecom, this research identifies the three essential features (economic, sociocultural, and industrial structure issues) related to convergence in the broadcasting and media industries. Further, this study reveals the potential consequences of convergence to the public, industry, and society, and offers critical implications for future policy direction. Finally, this study suggests the need for a change in the policy direction in the age of convergence in the broadcasting and media industries. In addition, it calls for the importance of a public-centric public benefit. Social and consumer welfare, and not profit or industrial growth, should dictate the public interest orientation in the broadcasting and media industries. Therefore, the meaning of public interest in broadcasting and media should not be limited in the industrial context of media; rather, it should consider the access to service by the public, the condition of consumption, and its consequences in the perspective of social and consumer welfare. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The last 15 years have seen a remarkable shift in the educational representation of British-born Muslim young men. In the media-led reclassification of them, from South Asian to Muslim, they have moved from ideal student to potential jihadist. This article draws upon a three-year ethnographic study with young Muslim men located within the West Midlands. A shared emphasis on structural issues across critical theoretical frameworks on neoliberalism, government discourses, such as Prevent, and counter narratives on Islamophobia serves to underplay young Muslim men’s subjectivity, and in so doing limits their self-authorization. We argue that at a time of intense state/institutional surveillance as a ‘suspect community’ and the criminalization of ethnic and religious difference, Muslim young men are in the process of negotiating late-modern urban masculine identities. Simultaneously, deploying a methodological reflexivity indicates that a re-reading of their narratives provides insights into recent political changes and national belonging. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Communication strategies involving news media and environmental groups are well documented and research into protest politics and other forms of environmental communication has made considerable progress in the analysis of the strategies that various actors use to influence environmental policy. There is less scholarship, however, on the journalistic representation of the legal strategies employed by environmental non-government organizations, such as the mediatized debates about the use of law by these groups and the laws themselves. Further, while legal scholarship observes the role of public interest litigation in environmental matters, the role of news media as an influential force in public opinion formation and mobilization in the context of environmental litigation as an activist strategy remains less understood. Using the 2015 “green lawfare” debate in Australia that followed a successful Australian Federal Court challenge to a coalmine, this paper argues that the “mediatized visibility” inherent in public interest litigation is an important, but mostly overlooked, element of mediatized environmental conflict. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The ability of authoritarian regimes to maintain power hinges, in part, on how well they are able to manipulate the flow of information to the masses. While authoritarian states have had success controlling traditional media, the growth of social media over the last decade has created new challenges for such regimes. The Russian experience offers an example of how an authoritarian regime responds to this potential threat. Because of the massive demonstrations surrounding the 2011–2012 Duma elections, the ruling Russian government suspected that social media provided a significant impetus for the demonstrations. Social media, through its dissemination of opposition blogs, could have helped drive negative attitudes about the governing party. As such, the government responded by employing strategies to tighten their grip on the digital flow of information. We use survey data to demonstrate that exposure to blogs via social media at the time of the demonstrations led many to believe that the elections were fraudulent. Ultimately, we contend that Russian fears concerning the importance of social media for the fomenting of opposition movements is well grounded. Social media can drive support for opposition in an autocratic state. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Public discourses over the same social crisis—the most deadly train crash in recent times in China, in July 2011—show three divergent but interactive packages across the government, the media, and online public opinion. The government dominated public discourse and framed the crash as an intra-institutional flaw. The media sought to legitimize the official rhetoric by focusing on victim compensation, official concern, and rescue. Online public opinion, however, contested both official rhetoric and media discourse, and highlighted the train crash as terrible malfeasances of the government. Constructed as a result of the state legitimation crisis, the three perspectives are entangled in a tense “dominator–mediator–challenger” relationship. However, the seemingly diversified opinions and conflicting ideas have been maintained within the sphere of legitimate controversy that does not necessarily undermine state legitimacy. The coercive state’s control and the mimetic organizational responses to crisis direct social actors to behave similarly and form institutional isomorphism. The dominance of political power over social power is thus manifest in the process of discursive competition and interaction. The discursive framework developed in this study illuminates similar crisis events in Asia and in Western democracies where social trust in government and in media is relatively low. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Although leprosy is one of the oldest diseases known to humanity, it remains largely misunderstood. Misconceptions about leprosy lead to stigma towards people with the disease. This study aimed at exploring the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes regarding leprosy in rural Cameroon. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional community survey of 233 respondents aged 15–75 years, free from leprosy, and living in two rural health districts of the South-west Region of Cameroon. A questionnaire designed to evaluate knowledge, perceptions and attitudes about leprosy was used. Binary logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of negative attitudes. Results: About 82% of respondents had heard about, and 64.4% knew someone with leprosy. Information on leprosy was mainly from community volunteers (40.6%), friends (38.0%), and the media (24%). Only 19.7% of respondents knew the cause of leprosy, and a considerable proportion linked it to a spell (25.3%), unclean blood (15.5%) and heredity (14.6%). About 72% knew that leprosy is curable and 86.3% would advise medical treatment. Attitudes towards leprosy patients were generally negative. Only 42% would shake hands, 32.6% would share the same plate, and 28.3% and 27% respectively, would allow their child to play or marry a person with leprosy. Furthermore, only 33.9% approved of participation of leprosy patients, and 42.9% of their employment. Independent predictors of negative attitudes were: the belief that leprosy is a curse; is caused by a germ; and having seen a leprosy patient. The negative attitudes were dampened by: the beliefs that leprosy is a punishment, is hereditary and is due to poor personal hygiene. Conclusion: An awareness intervention using community volunteers and the media, with information on the cause of leprosy, its clinical manifestations and curability, and sensitization messages correcting the misconceptions and beliefs regarding leprosy, could improve the community knowledge and attitudes towards leprosy. This would ultimately contribute to the reduction of leprosy burden in the community. © 2018 Tabah et al.

AB  - Twitter provides a rich database of spatiotemporal information about users who broadcast their real-time opinions, sentiment, and activities. In this paper, we sought to investigate the holistic influence of land use and time period on public sentiment. A total of 880,937 tweets posted by 26,060 active users were collected across Massachusetts (MA), USA, through 31 November 2012 to 3 June 2013. The IBM Watson Alchemy API (application program interface) was employed to quantify the sentiment scores conveyed by tweets on a large scale. Then we statistically analyzed the sentiment scores across different spaces and times. A multivariate linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the fixed effects of land use and the time period on the variations in sentiment scores, considering the clustering effect of users. The results exposed clear spatiotemporal patterns of users’ sentiment. Higher sentiment scores were mainly observed in the commercial and public areas, during the noon/evening and on weekends. Our findings suggest that social media outputs can be used to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of public happiness and well-being in cities and regions. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates in the UK are poor, and non-medically trained individuals have been identified to perform substandard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Millions watch televised medical dramas and, for many, these comprise their only education on CPR. This study aims to investigate the quality of CPR portrayed on these programmes and whether this has an effect on public knowledge. Methods Prospective observational study of 30 consecutive episodes of three popular medical dramas. Public knowledge of CPR and viewing habits were assessed with a survey of non-medically trained personnel. Results 90 episodes were reviewed with 39 resuscitation attempts shown. Chest compression rates varied from 60 to 204 compressions per minute with a median of 122 (95% CI 113 to 132). Depth varied from 1.5 to 7.5 cm with a median of 3 (3.15-4.31). Rate and depth were significantly different from the UK Resuscitation Council Guidelines (2010) (p<0.05, t-test). Survey participants (n=160, 80% response rate) documented what they thought was the correct rate and depth of chest compressions and were scored accordingly. Those who documented watching medical dramas regularly scored significantly worse than those who watched occasionally (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusion Televised medical dramas depict CPR inaccurately and laypersons may be less well informed about the correct technique the more they tune into these programmes. While there may be other confounding variables, given the popularity of television medical dramas, the poor depiction may be significantly contributing to poor public CPR knowledge and represent a potential new avenue of public education. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

AB  - Website of Non-governmental organization (NGO) is a focal medium of sharing information in response to transparency demands and addressing trust deficits between stakeholders. Many researchers have proposed accountability approaches to measure information sharing trends through websites. This article discusses a new index to measure online disclosure trends along with the theoretical properties of the index and a practical application of data from NGOs working in Pakistan. The websites have been coded in 2016. Results show that NGOs with branch offices have better disclosure scores than single-office NGOs, and international NGOs score better than local NGOs. NGOs that are more often the subject of newspaper reports have better disclosure trends. © 2018 Nazuk, Shabbir.

AB  - Mass-media reports on an epidemic or pandemic have the potential to modify human behaviour and affect social attitudes. Here we construct a Filippov model to evaluate the effects of media coverage and quarantine on the transmission dynamics of influenza. We first choose a piecewise smooth incidence rate to represent media reports being triggered once the number of infected individuals exceeds a certain critical level I c 1 . Further, if the number of infected cases increases and exceeds another larger threshold value I c 2 (&gt;I c 1 ), we consider that the incidence rate tends to a saturation level due to the protection measures taken by individuals; meanwhile, we begin to quarantine susceptible individuals when the number of susceptible individuals is larger than a threshold value S c . Then, for each susceptible threshold value S c , the global properties of the Filippov model with regard to the existence and stability of all possible equilibria and sliding-mode dynamics are examined, as we vary the infected threshold values I c 1 and I c 2 . We show generically that the Filippov system stabilizes at either the endemic equilibrium of the subsystem or the pseudoequilibrium on the switching surface or the endemic equilibrium E c =(S c ,I c 2 ), depending on the choice of the threshold values. The findings suggest that proper combinations of infected and susceptible threshold values can maintain the number of infected individuals either below a certain threshold level or at a previously given level. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article maps the negative reaction of the Scottish press to devolution after the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, and relates this episode to its coverage of the 2014 independence referendum. The article also considers how the rising profile of social media and a shift in Scottish public opinion towards the Yes side late in the 2014 referendum campaign highlights the decline of the traditional newspaper press in Scotland. It concludes by considering the value of the national press in Scotland to the nation's wider cultural health, and the negative implications for the state of Scottish civil society if the national press disappears. © 2018, Edinburgh University Press.

AB  - Although research has tested the spiral of silence theory using a variety of issues, little attention is paid to how the nature of the issues affects the spiral of silence processes. This study adopts issue typologies provided by Yeric and Todd and recommended by Salmon and Glynn to test the theory using three issues: immigration (transitory), gay marriage (emerging), and abortion (enduring). Using a nationwide survey of Facebook users (N = 1,046), this study investigates how the nature of issues influences the dynamics of the spiral of silence processes. Results identify issue-specific differences, especially regarding the opinion congruency. Theoretical implications for future tests of the spiral of silence theory and public opinion research are discussed. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - The bulk of current literature on partisan media explores its various detrimental influences on the democratic sphere. This study highlights a possible positive outcome of partisan media consumption: enhanced political participation. It is hypothesized that consumption of congruent partisan media will tilt perceptions of opinion climate so that it is viewed as more supportive of one’s views, while consumption of incongruent partisan media is viewed as less supportive. Consequently, consumers of congruent partisan media will participate more, and vice versa. The hypotheses are tested using two panel studies: the first conducted during the 2012 U.S. presidential elections (N = 377) whereas the second, during the 2013 Israeli election (N = 340). In the Israeli case, survey data are supplemented with behavioral measures. All hypotheses are supported except the one regarding the effects of incongruent partisan media exposure. The results are discussed in light of the spiral of silence theory and the selective exposure hypothesis. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - A new image was engendered in twentieth-century Bengal. The image clarified the direction of public opinion, whether it sanctified the actions of the colonizers or that of the colonized. In the process, those who chose to side with the colonized developed a close bond with the others who became a part of the camaraderie. The resultant image, envisioned by the people, did not come to them naturally; it was produced in their mind. The word of the age, printed and performed, helped produce this vision using the context as an index of reference. Words were transmitted and circulated among large number of people, who came to know, discuss and debate it. Despite the strict vigilance of the Raj that censured objectionable words, it nevertheless reached the public. Words found expression in ephemeral media that made the words disseminated untraceable. One such medium was the placard. This article analyses the placards circulated and posted, during the early twentieth century, and delves deep into the process of demonstration and persuasion adopted by the placards to invoke an image of nation among the Bengalis. © 2018, © 2018 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in research on advocacy success, but limited attention has been paid to the role of public opinion. We examine how support from the public affects advocacy success, relying on a new original data set containing information on public opinion, advocacy positions, and policy outcomes on 50 policy issues in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Claims by advocates are measured through a news media content analysis of a sample of policy issues drawn from national and international public opinion surveys. Our multilevel regression analysis provides evidence that public support affects advocacy success. However, public opinion does not affect preference attainment for some of the lobbying advocates whose influence is feared the most, and the magnitude of its impact is conditional upon the number of advocates who lobby on the policy issue in question. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Studies on organizational crisis communication via social media have mainly focused on the effects of messages from one source, organizations. Little is known about the interaction effects of multiple messages from multiple sources through social media on audiences' perceptions of organizational reputation. Guided by the Message Convergence Framework, this study used a 2 × 2, between-subjects experiment (N = 165) to explore the impact of crisis communication strategies and message convergence on Facebook on audiences' perceived organizational reputation in a preventable crisis. The results suggest that organizational reputation was affected by the consistency between the organization's Facebook posts and followers' comments, and the effects were moderated by the perceived credibility of the comments by Facebook followers. The results also revealed that unlike pre-existing positive attitudes toward an organization, which were negatively affected by inconsistent information on Facebook, pre-existing negative attitudes did not change significantly because of the information on Facebook. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are then discussed. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd & Reputation Institute.

AB  - Aspect-based opinion mining is finding elaborate opinions towards a subject such as a product or an event. With explosive growth of opinionated texts on the Web, mining aspect-level opinions has become a promising means for online public opinion analysis. In particular, the boom of various types of online media provides diverse yet complementary information, bringing unprecedented opportunities for cross media aspect-opinion mining. Along this line, we propose CAMEL, a novel topic model for complementary aspect-based opinion mining across asymmetric collections. CAMEL gains information complementarity by modeling both common and specific aspects across collections, while keeping all the corresponding opinions for contrastive study. An auto-labeling scheme called AME is also proposed to help discriminate between aspect and opinion words without elaborative human labeling, which is further enhanced by adding word embedding-based similarity as a new feature. Moreover, CAMEL-DP, a nonparametric alternative to CAMEL is also proposed based on coupled Dirichlet Processes. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-collection reviews data demonstrate the superiority of our methods to competitive baselines. This is particularly true when the information shared by different collections becomes seriously fragmented. Finally, a case study on the public event '2014 Shanghai Stampede' demonstrates the practical value of CAMEL for real-world applications. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the presence of vaccine criticism on the French Web and to analyze strategies and arguments used by opponents of vaccination. Methods: The most frequently used keywords associated with the terms “vaccination” and “vaccine” on Google.fr in September 2013 were identified and searched for individually on Google.fr. The links presented in the first three pages of results were reviewed to identify the most frequent providers of information. The proportion of critical content was determined by website type and a content analysis was performed. Results: The main preoccupations about vaccination were general concerns; < 1% of searches were guided by negative keywords. Institutional websites, healthcare websites, news websites and anti-vaccine websites were the most frequent providers of results. The proportion of anti-vaccine websites among the results was 11% for a neutral search and 24% for a search guided by negative keywords. Critical content was observed in other types of website. Six major strategies and categories of arguments used by opponents of vaccination were identified: the manipulation of science, the use of shocking images and an appeal to emotions via testimonies, a general vaccination conspiracy, the individual's freedom of choice not respected, an unnatural act and a negative benefit/risk balance. Conclusion: It seems important to monitor online vaccination debates, to develop an institutional presence that meets the needs of Internet users and to help them develop a critical view. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Urban transport policymakers in Latin America are increasingly utilizing the “sustainable mobility” paradigm. This paradigm involves not only considering more seriously the environmental consequences of transport, but also including a wider variety of actors in transport policymaking processes. In this article we use qualitative evidence from Mexico City and Guadalajara to show the tensions that exist within the apparent consensus around sustainable mobility policy in Latin American cities. In doing so, we analyze a particular kind of non-state actor who has become a critical figure in both the production and contestation of sustainable mobility policy in Mexico. These actors, whom we call expert-citizens in this article, are characterized by their mobilization of legitimacy as both experts and citizens to influence urban transport policy agendas. This legitimacy is mobilized through three key practices: 1) their focus on small-scale interventions; 2) their capacity to engage the state and civil society through the use of a toned-down language; and 3) a strategic use of media and public opinion tools. We argue that the work these expert-citizens undertake –and the strategies, practices and spaces they use– are telling of a new type of urban political actor that goes beyond the traditional divide between state planners and civil society groups that has characterized studies of urban transport politics. Finally, by focusing on the relational ways in which these actors confront and collaborate with transport activists, planners and experts, both globally and in their home cities, we show new ways in which “sustainable mobility” policy is produced, circulated and contested in Latin American cities. © 2017

AB  - Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Food safety challenges are a global concern especially in emerging economies, which are in the midst of developmental changes. The challenges are directly or indirectly related to the behaviour and decision-making of personnel, and to an organisation's food safety culture. This study evaluated the prevailing food safety culture in three Zimbabwean dairy companies of different size (multinational, large and medium) using a comprehensive mixed-methods approach. Four key elements were assessed, namely enabling conditions, employee characteristics, actual behaviour and microbial safety performance. Card-aided interviews provided data on enabling conditions, and questionnaires and storytelling on employee characteristics. Observations and microbial analysis assessed actual behaviour and microbial safety performance, respectively. The multinational company demonstrated a more proactive food safety culture compared to the other companies, which operated at an active level as exhibited by multiple inconsistencies in the enabling conditions and compliance behaviour. The large company had a moderate microbial safety performance even though it operated in a potentially risky situation, which could have been mitigated by the food safety management system. The medium-sized company had a poor microbial safety performance likely related to noncompliance with sanitation requirements, negative attitudes towards personal hygiene and an ambivalent attitude towards sanitation. Our study demonstrated the ability of the mixed-methods approach to assess and distinguish an organisation's prevailing food safety culture into identified classification levels (reactive, active, proactive). Specifically, storytelling elicited respondents to share stories, which reflected the food safety and hygiene control attitudes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many environmental problems are rooted in human behavior. This study aimed to explore the causal effect of cultural environmental bias on ‘sustainable behavior’ among agricultural groundwater users in Fars province, Iran, according to Klockner’s comprehensive model. A survey-based research project was conducted to gathering data on the paradigm of environmental psychology. The sample included agricultural groundwater users (n = 296) who were selected at random within a structured sampling regime involving study areas that represent three (higher, medium and lower) bounds of the agricultural-groundwater-vulnerability spectrum. Results showed that the “environment as ductile (EnAD)” variable was a strong determinant of sustainable behavior as it related to groundwater use, and that EnAE had the highest causal effect on the behavior of agricultural groundwater users. The adjusted model explained 41% variance of “groundwater sustainable behavior”. Based on the results, the groundwater sustainable behaviors of agricultural groundwater users were found to be affected by personal and subjective norm variables and that they are influenced by casual effects of the “environment as ductile (EnAD)” variable. The conclusions reflect the Fars agricultural groundwater users’ attitude or worldview on groundwater as an unrecoverable resource; thus, it is necessary that scientific disciplines like hydrogeology and psycho-sociology be considered together in a comprehensive approach for every groundwater study. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Political agenda-setting research has shown that policy makers are responsive vis-à-vis media priorities. However, the mechanisms behind this effect have remained understudied so far. In particular, agenda-setting scholars have difficulties determining to what extent politicians react to media coverage purely because of the information it contains (information effect), and to what extent the effect is driven not by what the media say but by the fact that certain information is in the media (media channel effect), which is valued for its own sake – for instance, because media coverage is considered to be a reflection of public opinion. By means of a survey-embedded experiment with Belgian, Canadian and Israeli political elites (N = 410), this study tests whether the mere fact that an issue is covered by the news media causes politicians to pay attention to this issue. It shows that a piece of information gets more attention from politicians when it comes via the media rather than an identical piece of information coming via a personal e-mail. This effect occurs largely across the board: it is not dependent on individual politician characteristics. © 2017 European Consortium for Political Research

AB  - Purpose - For about four decades, Iran and the USA have continued to be two most stubborn enemies and this has drawn much research on this subject. Yet, only a very small fraction of this body of research has been allocated to studying the perceptions that the people of the two countries have of each other. Using a mixed method survey, the purpose of this paper is to explore cross-cultural schemata US American people have of Iranians. Design/methodology/approach - By way of an e-mail survey, the authors collected 1,752 responses from American citizens across 50 American states. The open ended responses were codified and categorized. Three out of six categories were further sub-categorized. Findings - The outcomes showed that about 40 percent of Americans had negative cross-cultural schemata of Iranians with the media being the main source of negative cross-cultural schemata. Conversely, personal contact and communication with Iranians proved to be the source of positive cross-cultural schemata toward Iranians. Other results showed that US American exceptionalism and negative attitudes toward Iranians had a direct and positive relationship with having negative cross-cultural schemata of Iranians. Originality/value - As the authors have explained in this paper, very few scholars have taken up the issue of cross-cultural schemata Iranian and American people have of each other. By doing this and several other works, the authors have tried to create a new research interest in academic circles. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Opinions expressed by the common (wo)man on the street influence audience judgments about perceived public opinion and even people’s own opinion. While we know from experimental research that the distribution of opinions expressed in vox pop interviews—the balance between pro and contra quotes, for example—influences audiences, little research has actually looked at the distribution of opinions expressed in vox pops in the real world. Are the vox pops shown in news items balanced or not? We address this research gap by analyzing the opinion balance of vox pop statements with a specific focus on political news. We conducted an in-depth content analysis on a random sample of 2000 vox pop interviews in Belgian (Flanders) main evening television news drawn from a total population of vox pop interviews in the period 2003–2013. Results show that in half of the news items in which they are used, vox pops present opinions and that vox pops play an important role in political news. We find that, contrary to our expectations, the opinions expressed in vox pops are unbalanced both in non-political and political news. A large majority of vox pop news items contains vox pop voices that present only one point of view. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Exposure to lead has long been a community health concern in St. Louis, Missouri. The objective of this study was to examine public response to reports of elevated lead levels in school drinking water in St. Louis, Missouri via Twitter, a microblogging platform with over 320 million active users. We used a mixed-methods design to examine Twitter user status updates, known as “tweets,” from 18 August to 31 December 2016. The number of tweets each day was recorded, and Twitter users were classified into five user types (General Public, Journalist/News, Health Professional/Academic, Politician/Government Official, and Non-Governmental Organization). A total of 492 tweets were identified during the study period. The majority of discourse on Twitter occurred during the two-week period after initial media reports and was driven by members of the General Public. Thematic analysis of tweets revealed four themes: Information Sharing, Health Concerns, Sociodemographic Disparities, and Outrage. Twitter users characterized lead in school drinking water as an issue of environmental inequity. The findings of this study provide evidence that social media platforms can be utilized as valuable tools for public health researchers and practitioners to gauge public sentiment about environmental health issues, identify emerging community concerns, and inform future communication and research strategies regarding environmental health hazards. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Given the scientific uncertainties and differing arguments for and against genetically modified food, perceptions and valuation may depend on information about their different and conflicting potential effects. In this study we explore generic attitudes towards genetically modified organisms, particularly in food, and adopt an economic contingent valuation approach to highlight the relevance of information provision. The study focuses on young college students, who are more scientifically informed than the rest of the population. It explores perceptions and economic valuation of genetically modified food, and exposes respondents randomly to three information treatments concerning genetically modified organisms’ impacts (negative, positive or mixed). Applying the contingent valuation methodology allows us to expose individuals to a situation where they can express their willingness to accept a genetically modified ingredient in exchange for lower prices. We observe that exposing respondents to critical arguments about this kind of food negatively affects their economic valuations, whereas positive or mixed information have no impact. Albeit the conclusions are limited in terms of generalizability to the rest of the population, the results suggest there may still be scope for information provision. Furthermore, both policy-makers and firms may benefit from a more informed public. Policy-makers can gauge public opinion to legitimize policy options and firms can shape market decisions based on more informed and stable consumer preferences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In 1972, for the first time, the term “sustainable development” was coined at the Stockholm conference, and in 1987, the Brundtland report established the sustainability-innovation “binomial”. Since then, extensive research into sustainability-oriented innovation has been conducted, focused during the last decade on SMEs and recognizing these as the main actor of sustainable development, for which foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered, from a research and institutional point of view, as a vital source, although academic literature presents conflicting conclusions. In this context, this paper aims to perform a microeconomic analysis of how FDI influences the innovative process of SMEs and how this can lead to a process oriented towards sustainability. To this end, a panel of 4667 SMEs has been analyzed, spanning a sample period between 2004 and 2013, through a binary logit model, which compares and contrasts SMEs with FDI and equivalent SMEs without FDI, over time and, therefore, exposed to a changing economy. The most significant results are that FDI is attracted mainly by factors associated with technological supply, which, when coupled with being of medium size and located in a manufacturing sector of medium-high technology, generates positive spillovers. These depend, to a large extent, on public funding, which allows these companies to be more innovative and makes it more likely they focus their innovative process on sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Public opinion, especially the online public opinion is a critical issue when it comes to mining its characteristics. Because it can be formed directly and intensely in a short time, and may lead to the outbreak of online group events, and the formation of online public opinion crisis. This may become the pushing hand of a public crisis event, or even have negative social impacts, which brings great challenges to the government management. Data from the mass media which reveal implicit, previously unknown, and potentially valuable information, can effectively help us to understand the evolution law of public opinion, and provide a useful reference for rumor intervention. Based on the Dynamic Network Analysis method, this paper uses ORA software to mine characteristics of public opinion information, opinion topics, and public opinion agents through a series of indicators, and quantitatively analyzed the relationships between them. The results show that through the analysis of the 8 indexes associating with opinion data mining, we can have a basic understanding of the public opinion characteristics of an opinion event, such as who is important in the opinion spreading process, the information grasping condition, and the opinion topics release situation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recurrent xenophobic violence in South Africa highlights the strong undercurrent of popular opinion opposition to international immigrants. This article examines public attitudes towards the international immigrant community in South Africa and the factors influencing those attitudes. The author uses public opinion data from the 2014 South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS). The article will show that there is an asymmetry in the processes of opinion formation on immigrants in the country. The findings seemed to call into question the bipolarity of attitudinal measures used in public opinion studies of anti-immigrant sentiment. In addition, the author found that stereotypes about the harmful impact of international immigration were powerful drivers of public antipathy towards foreigners. Greater scrutiny of harmful stereotypes of foreign immigrants voiced by the media, politicians and national leaders is therefore needed. © 2018, © 2018 Unisa Press.

AB  - Building from the third-person effect model of DRR policy adoption and mediated policy learning, this study provides an experimental examination of how specific elements of news media’s localisation of distant events directly influence public opinion. Controlling for salience effects, the construction of affinities between the distant, stricken community and the newspaper’s audience is argued to create a sense of shared vulnerability to the reported disasters. This is correlated within an increase in the respondent’s intention to act directly and an increase in their willingness to punish elected officials who do not act accordingly. The construction of difference between the communities, even though it is not related to risks related to the disaster, is argued to create implicit reassurances that the observing community does not need to act. This leads to an increased intention to act directly in opposition to efforts to reduce risk, but a neutral response towards political actors who pursue risk reduction policy actions. © 2018, © 2018 The Research Trust of Victoria.

AB  - This article reports the results of three meta-samples investigating U.S. adults' pornography consumption, attitudes toward teen sex, and support for teen access to birth control. Findings were based on multiple independent samples totaling more than 11,000 people. Pragmatic motivations included examining what public health advocacy groups would consider a positive public opinion effect of pornography at a potentially pivotal time for U.S. policy makers. Theoretical motivations included probing key tenets from the sexual script acquisition, activation, application model (3AM) of sexual media socialization and the reinforcing spirals model (RSM) of media uses and effects. Consistent with the 3AM, path and mediation analyses of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggested that pornography consumption may increase support for teens' birth control access through a shift in perspective on teen sex. In alignment with the RSM, participants' prior beliefs and attitudes were prospectively predictive of their likelihood of future pornography consumption. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Does coordination affect threat perceptions? The attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016 received a significant amount of attention in the media. The attacks were transnational, fatal, and perpetrated by the same group in western European countries. We argue that these are not the only features of the attacks that matter. The attacks involved coordination among teams of militants. This coordination signals sophistication. Sophistication amplifies threat perceptions independent of group reputation, fatality rate, or target location because sophistication suggests a greater capability to inflict harm. We provide experimental evidence of the relationship between coordination and threat perceptions. Our results contribute to a growing literature looking at the features of terrorist attacks and public perceptions of terrorism, and lay the groundwork for future research on the political and security consequences of coordinated terrorist attacks. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Media and political discourses have positioned Muslims as a threatening ‘Other’ to Quebec society and Quebecois culture and values. This article examines the potentials and limitations for Quebec educational curricula to challenge these discourses. A thorough analysis of the Quebec Education Program informed by a critical race perspective reveals that the potential exists to engage in anti-racism educational praxis within this educational curriculum. This article argues that teachers need to exercise agency and professional judgment to challenging anti-Muslim racism in Quebec secondary schools and suggested approaches for doing so by employing principles rooted in critical race curriculum. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Discussions generated in Russian and Western academic, policy-making and media circles by recent terrorist attacks in the Middle Volga and Urals (İdel-Ural) derive primarily from hegemonic state discourses and as such miss the wealth of discussion generated in local-language sources about the causes and implications of these attacks. The goal of this study is to provide an examination of the various perspectives concerning terrorism in the region, focusing on the level of Tatar (and secondarily Russian) society. Employing insights from a recent body of literature on ‘everyday’ and ‘vernacular’ (in)securities as well as on conspiracy theories, I examine Tatar-language Internet forums posted on the Radio Free Europe website related to the terror events of July 2012. I detect no incitement to violence among the Tatar-speaking participants. However, my results suggest that Tatar publics use diverse interpretive repertoires to make sense of a securitizing reality. The study suggests that Tatar-speaking publics depart in important ways from the dominant narrative of the ‘police’ order as well as from the Weltanschauung of their Russian-speaking compatriots. © 2018 Southseries Inc.

AB  - This paper maps out photography’s newer ethics by examining Boris Mikhailov’s Case History that often stirs controversy over its bold depiction of human misery. The paper criticizes the idea that photographers should not represent “the other’s pain”: an idea that has sabotaged the medium’s inherent visual desire in order to prioritize its moral responsibility. In that idea is found a resilient Platonic antagonism against image, a logo-centric prejudice that marks a biased demarcation between art and politics in photography theory. The paper challenges this photographic Platonism through recent arguments that illuminate the medium’s inter-regimic, dialectical, redemptive roles (Jacques Rancière, Walter Benjamin, Ariella Azoulay, et al.). With this theoretical challenge, the paper aims to outline a new ethics of photography for an era in which the image’s “pandemic” growth is resetting the mode of human communication and the role of photography. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the following mini-study, quantitative content analysis was used to investigate differences in the United States print media’s coverage of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Four articles were analyzed, two from the corporate media and two from independent sources. The four articles did not disagree on the existence of terrorism, but they differed in terms of their assumptions regarding the cause(s) of terrorism as well as in terms of how the terrorist subject is configured discursively. Blaming Islam in general, or all Muslims, in relation to terrorist acts perpetrated by a few criminals can have drastic results, such as Islamophobia. © 2018 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.

AB  - This project explores public opinion on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in news and social media outlets, and tracks elected representatives’ voting records on issues relating to SNAP and food insecurity. We used machine learning, sentiment analysis, and text mining to analyze national and state level coverage of SNAP in order to gauge perceptions of the program over time across these outlets. Results indicate that the majority of news coverage has negative sentiment, more partisan news outlets have more extreme sentiment, and that clustering of negative reporting on SNAP occurs in the Midwest. Our final results and tools will be displayed in an online application that the ACFB Advocacy team can use to inform their communication to relevant stakeholders. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A number of voices have emerged in U.S. political discourse questioning the legitimacy of American exceptionalism, suggesting we are in a “post-American world.” Our research examines the effects that political messages that explicitly challenge American exceptionalism can have on U.S. public opinion. Drawing upon social identity theory, we find that explicit challenges to American exceptionalism significantly impact Americans’ views toward their own nation, their willingness to denigrate foreign publics, and their broader foreign policy preferences. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Depression accounts for nearly 400 million disability days per year, and has been identified as the definitive public health priority in the decades to come (Greenberg et al., 2015). Despite the passage of the 2008 Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which requires coverage of mental health services, behavioral health and substance-use disorders to be equal to physical health coverage, individuals face numerous barriers when seeking help for depression. This research tests whether changing the way stories frame depression affects how audience members attribute responsibility for depression and their intentions to participate in civic engagement activities supporting policy solutions. Findings from this study contradict earlier scholarship and have implications for how information about depression and policy solutions are framed for the public including how to develop health policy messaging when working with the news media. Suggestions for future research are included. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article argues that restrictions on expression based on ‘gross offensiveness’ or similar public morality notions embedded in speech offences are not and cannot be politically neutral and be evenly applied to political speech, no matter who is the author. Such concepts draw on a majoritarian perspective purporting to be reflective of unified base values of the ‘national community’. The article explores why such concepts of unacceptable speech are a poor fit for a deeply heterogeneous community, and all the more so on the internet, where those who engage in public discourse are even more numerous and more diverse in ethnic, cultural, political and social terms. Set against such a diverse speech landscape the prohibition of ‘gross offensiveness’, or what are considered the outer boundaries of acceptability, is repressive of minorities and of challenges to conventional opinions and existing power dynamics, and is liable to reinforce the very bigotry it seeks to relieve. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article examines congruence between public opinion and politicians’ positions on same-sex marriage in the Australian House of Representatives from 2012 to 2016. In contrast median voter theorem and other office-motivated frameworks, Australian federal politicians have largely ignored majority opinion, which has been supportive of same-sex marriage for a decade. Using a unique dataset (n = 601,550) of voter preferences collected during the 2013 federal election, and collated Hansard and media data, we compare public opinion on same-sex marriage with politicians’ public positions. We find a status quo bias, suggesting the influence of special interest groups in this policy area. Yet, we also find parliamentarians are responsive to public opinion once it reaches a critical level, and that very low opposition to same-sex marriage in an electorate predicts policy support from its MP, which varies by party and over time. © 2017 Australian Political Studies Association.

AB  - We examined effects of customizability technology (also known as tailoring or personalization) on political selective exposure and political attitude polarization. Our experiment showed that selective exposure mediated the relationship between customizability technology presence and political attitude polarization. We also found that user-driven customizability (technology that enables users to modify their information environment) weakened the relationship between system-driven customizability (technology that modifies users’ information environment unobtrusively, without active involvement of the users) and political selective exposure. This research contributes to a better understanding of how important characteristics of today’s communication environment influence political selective exposure and political attitude polarization. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The subject of homosexuality remains taboo in contemporary China, given that the public maintains a considerably negative attitude toward the subject. Recent Pew Research indicates that, on average, 21% of Chinese respondents believe that homosexuality should be accepted. However, parallel surveys of Internet users paint a different picture, as online surveys found a more liberal atmosphere toward homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The online and offline discrepancy in attitudes toward homosexuality begs the question of whether the Internet carries a stigma-reducing function in terms of views on sexual minority groups. Guided by the contact hypothesis and parasocial contact theory, the current study investigates the de-stigmatizing effect of the social media on homosexuality in China. A web-based survey with 980 social media users with a heterosexual orientation confirmed the positive role of interpersonal-mediated contact with lesbian and gay celebrities via social media venues in stigma reduction; but findings did not lend support to the parasocial-mediated contact hypothesis. © 2017, © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2017.

AB  - On the screens of televisions and computers in their California homes, the women of the Egyptian Sisters Club (ESC) have witnessed the unfolding of political crisis and the unravelling of certainty about the meaning of ‘home’. Drawing from concepts of diaspora and social support, the study explores how the ESC, an informal group of young Egyptian mothers living in Southern California, maintains cohesion in a time of conflict in their home country, and hostility towards visibly Muslim women in their host country. This qualitative study draws from participant observation, interviews and focus groups over a period of 9 months in 2014. Findings, largely expressed in members’ own words, suggest that despite heterogeneous perspectives and subjective motives, participants largely negotiate a prioritization of cultural values over political differences. This case offers insights into how local context and life stages influence how diaspora members adapt to contentious home and host country politics. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using content analysis, this study investigated the coverage of the Trojan Horse news story aiming to ascertain whether its representation by the British press emphasized ‘Islamist extremism’ over ‘poor school governance’. The sample coverage was extracted from five national newspapers and ranged from 9 June (the date of release of the Ofsted Advice Note) to 26 June 2014. Our analysis shows that the coverage reported evidence of Islamist ideology much more frequently (61.5%) than evidence of poor governance (38.5%). This suggests that the Trojan Horse news story was predominantly represented as a case of Islamist extremism and therefore covered in an unbalanced manner. Such a partial coverage relied on ideological dualisms and negative stereotypes to represent Islam and Muslims, and on the textual strategy of selecting some features (extremism) whilst omitting others (governors’ professional misconduct). This bias has arguably diverted attention away from systemic problems within the national school system whilst reinforcing Islamophobic discourses. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A considerable number of studies have investigated the influence of new media on political attitudes and behaviors. However, much of this research focuses on young people, ignoring other age cohorts, particularly Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964). To fill this gap, this research examines the influence of attention to specific forms of traditional and online media on Baby Boomers’ online and offline political participation during the fall 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Drawing on a Baby Boomer survey panel, responses were collected during the 2012 general election to analyze the empirical relationship between attention to traditional and online media sources and political participation. Data analyses reveal that Boomers’ attention to traditional media sources, particularly television, did not increase their offline and online political participation. Instead, various forms of offline and online participation were consistently heightened by Boomers’ attention to presidential candidate websites. In addition, attention to Facebook for campaign information was positively linked to online engagement. Boomers’ attention to blogs, Twitter, and YouTube were associated with only certain types of online and offline activities. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Socially mediated visibility refers to technical features of social media platforms and the strategic actions of individuals or groups to manage the content and associations visible on social media channels, as well as inferences and consequences resulting from that visibility. As a root affordance, the visibility of content and associations shared in mediated settings can vary, with users typically retaining only partial control over visibility. Understanding how social and technical factors affect visibility plays a critical role in managing one’s online self-presentation. This qualitative study of young dissident Azerbaijanis (N = 29) considers the management strategies as well as the risks and benefits associated with increased visibility when sharing marginalized political views through social media. Socially mediated visibility helps dissidents advocate and connect with like-minded others, but also increases the likelihood that their dissent is visible to those who may disagree with it and can punish them for it. This study considers the effect of the visibility of dissent on peer relationships. © 2018 (Katy E. Pearce, Jessica Vitak, and Kristen Barta).

AB  - Over the last half-century, African Americans have been supplanted as the represen tational face of Islam in America by an immigrant population they initially perceived as obsequious to power and unconcerned with seeking redress to their historical grievances. Recently, however, a widespread cognizance of this strategic miscalcula tion coupled with the precipitous rise of Islamophobia in the Trump era has younger descendants of Muslim immigrants identifying with the left, combating Islamopho bia as a type of racism in intersectional solidarity with other social justice platforms like the Black Lives Matter movement (blm). Thus, when fundamental disagreements emerged at the ris conference in late 2016 over endorsing the non-profit blm entity, they sparked robust social media debates. This paper analyzes those inter-communal negotiations as they played out on the Facebook pages of Muslim scholars, associating discourse models with contestations of community members negotiating the bound aries involved with integrating the heterogeneous discourses of antiracism. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018.

AB  - Since the fall of communism in 1989, many formerly communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe have undergone a tremendous amount of social, political, and economic change. In the nearly 30 years after communism, these countries have become democratic and integrated into the European Union. Despite these changes, the consolidation of democracy is in question as citizen trust in government remains low and nationalist populism has risen. Given that other studies have shown that online media can affect attitudes toward government and that a massive technological revolution has occurred alongside democratization, it is imperative to better understand whether the Internet can aid consolidation by making citizens more supportive of democratic governance. This study uses Eurobarometer data to evaluate this question empirically and finds that online news consumption leads to more positive evaluations of government in the region.

AB  - Nowadays social media plays a vital role in sharing the information, sharing the views on a particular topic, expressing the sentiments and opinions. Mood is a sub form of sentiment analysis and opinion mining which generally describes the state of mind of a person whether happy, sad, fear and anger etc. Twitter is one of the most popular sources of public opinions. Sensing of mood is generally required to analyze the impact of marketing campaigns, launching of new products etc. This paper focuses on sensing the mood on crimes against women in social media using the quantitative measures of valence and arousal. This paper gives a comparative analysis on mood sensing among different time periods over the same topic. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Social media provide a free space for opinion leaders (OPLs) to influence public opinion in contemporary China, where OPLs need to compete with the powerful propaganda machine. So how much influence can OPLs exert on the public under the shadow of authoritarianism? A survey experiment of 1,326 Internet users in Beijing found that OPLs guide respondents’ policy opinions and encourage information sharing when the OPLs are not perceived to be a part of the propaganda campaign. However, when audiences believe that OPLs are the agents of propaganda, such effects disappear. The results reveal that the OPLs’ effects are conditioned by the authoritarian institutional context in which the public discussion takes place. We conclude that such effects have ambiguous consequences in cultivating critical citizens. Copyright © 2018(He Huang, Fangfei Wang, and Li Shao).

AB  - Concerns about livestock animal welfare are well documented worldwide. Public attitudes are often studied as indicators of risk for the livestock industries, but are less often studied in relation to behaviours that may affect the livestock industries. The present paper examines the relationships between public attitudes, opinion leadership and self-reported pork consumption and community behaviours that may have a negative impact on livestock industries by promulgating views that farming engages in unacceptable practices. To the extent that these attitudes and behaviours are based on a lack of knowledge or a lack of understanding about the actual relationship between current practices and animal welfare and farm productivity, care needs to be exercised to determine what industry practice change should occur or what should be done to inform the public. The results showed that in regard to consumption, being male and holding positive attitudes towards eating meat and livestock welfare explained 11% of the variance in pork consumption. Notably, however, information seeking and trust in information, attitudes related to animal welfare and the livestock industries, and membership to an animal-welfare group, accounted for 44% of the variance in community behaviours that express dissatisfaction with the livestock industries. Opinion leaders, that is, people in the community who indicate that they are used by others as a source of information about livestock animal welfare, tended to eat less pork and engaged in many more community behaviours, such as calling talkback radio or writing to politicians. Together, these results suggest that more needs to be done to identify the population segment of opinion leaders and to engage them in dialogue about pork production. Journal compilation © CSIRO 2018

AB  - Studies have shown that politicians follow the news media closely and react to news through their parliamentary activities. However, we know little about what kinds of information politicians look for in the media and actively use when being responsive to the media. Inspired by the uses and gratifications tradition, we ask what kinds of information politicians look for in the news and how these “informational media use motives” explain their media responsiveness. A survey of Finnish parliamentarians shows that most politicians use the news to learn about society and societal problems. Politicians also use the news to look for information about public opinion, and younger politicians especially search information about other political actors. Politicians who look for information about public opinion from the media are more reactive to media regarding symbolic agendas. Politicians who use the media to learn about other political actors are more responsive to media regarding substantial agendas.

AB  - Due to the increase of aging population in all societies, it seems important to explore this issue from different aspects in order to improve the position of the elderly and recognise their contribution to the society. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and views of the Generation Z on the discrimination and prejudices against the elderly. There were 6 participants in the focus group, 4 girls and 2 boys, all of whom belong to the Generation Z. The data was collected in the focus group who answered open-ended questions. Results of the qualitative research indicate: 1) that there is an unfavourable attitude towards the elderly in the investigated group of children; 2) causes of discrimination against the elderly; 3) prejudice against the elderly. Encouraging the society to provide better education (especially for children and young people), direct contact with the elderly (organising exchange of experience and transfer of traditional and cultural values), as well as better presentation of ageing and old age in the media would contribute to the decrease of global ageing and improve attitude of the younger generation towards ageing animosity. Family has the main influence on young people’s views and it is necessary to motivate parents to present ageing and old age in a favourable light. Furthermore, it is important to work with the elderly in terms of empowerment and developing a more positive self-image. © 2018, Croatian Anthropological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The important role the press has in modern society arises from its position: It is a "bridge" between the authorities and citizens, it presents the government's views to the general public, and also the public's view to the government. As a component of the press (journalism), the caricature also presents standpoints, the public's standpoints in democratic societies, and those of the authorities in autocracies. Th is research focuses on political caricature. In terms of its specifi cs, it belongs to a socially engaged caricature and as such it strives, using witty presentation, to unmask social, most frequently political negatives, expose to ridicule the actions of those responsible for events or the social situation, or simply assume the role of a medium for promoting certain ideas, thus influencing public opinion and encouraging change. Also important are social caricatures which, like political ones, belong to a socially engaged caricature. However, they do not encroach upon political issues, but rather put socio-economic topics in focus. © 2018 Hrvatski Institut za Povijest. All rights reserved.

AB  - Every era has its unique challenges, but history may still offer lessons on how law empowers and restrains presidents. This Essay examines how President Lincoln negotiated the tension between crisis authority and the rule of law. This analysis requires an appreciation of the wartime imperatives, institutions, and political forces confronting Lincoln, as well as the legal framework in which he acted. Similar issues unexpectedly arose in our times in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, providing a new point of comparison with Lincoln’s era. We need to better understand how political actors and institutions, the media, and public opinion can provide support for legal norms, lest we place all of our trust in presidential self-restraint and good judgment. © 2018 by Daniel A.

AB  - The authors’ aim is to analyze the degree of openness to different religious convictions among students of Department of Music, Faculty of Arts in Niš, and also to test whether these students have an active attitude on overcoming religious prejudice. The research was initiated due to the fact that during their education, through various teaching activities (playing, singing, conducting, composition, listening to music and its analysis) students become familiar with religious, spiritual, and church music, as a constituent part of different religions. The assumption is that precisely through music as one of the most universal media of artistic communication students can establish and develop a positive attitude to religious differences. Research results show that students are aware of various religious convictions and affiliations, but they do not show enough sensitivity to respecting differences, and they do not take part in the struggle against prejudices that accompany those differences. © 2018 IJCRSEE.

AB  - There have been many studies that applied a data-driven analysis method to social media data, and some have even argued that this method can replace traditional polls. However, some other studies show contradictory results. There seems to be no consensus as to the methodology of data collection and analysis. But as social media-based election research continues and the data collection and analysis methodology keep developing, we need to review the key points of the controversy and to identify ways to go forward. Although some previous studies have reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the social media-based election studies, they focused on predictive performance and did not adequately address other studies that utilized social media to address other issues related with public opinion during elections, such as public agenda or information diffusion. This paper tries to find out what information we can get by utilizing social media data and what limitations social media data has. Also, we review the various attempts to overcome these limitations. Finally, we suggest how we can best utilize social media data in understanding public opinion during elections. © 2018, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

AB  - The rise of populism and the polarization of traditional and new media pose threats to pluralistic democratic action and judgment. Citizens often vilify each other, deny each other the space to test and justify their perspectives publicly, either because they hold radically different political views, or because they ascribe an essentialist identity upon the other, one that they believe must be negated in accordance with the logic of their own ideology. This paper presents three vital resources in Hannah Arendt's thought for addressing these challenges to democracy. First, Arendt promotes physical - not merely virtual or digital - spaces of public deliberation in which actors disclose "who" they uniquely are and the "world" that contextualizes their action. Arendt proposes a principle of resistance to totalitarianism and a "responsibility for the world" as the appropriate limit to free action within these spaces. Second, Arendt presents a limit, or standard of intelligibility, to political action and speech permissible in public: the sensus communis of Kant's theory of aesthetic judgment. This standard of common sense, which binds the public sphere, demands that a speech act's intersubjective validity appeal to an objectivity that can be shared from different perspectives, but which allows for disagreement, and is not as restrictive as an Aristotelian ethos or an internally consistent ideology. Finally, Arendt asserts the imperative of factual truth telling and attention to the details of public phenomena, as necessary conditions for intelligible action and judgment in a pluralistic public sphere. © Trevor Tchir, 2018.

AB  - Nowadays, social media has a pivotal role in political communication. Politicians, parties, and the public engage in social networks like Twitter or Facebook. This panel focuses on election campaigns and policy-making process in social media. How do politicians use social media during elections? How can we identify the public opinion of voters through the application of text-mining in social media? The US presidential election in 2016, possess big discussions and critics about the general social media usage in the context of election campaigns. Considering the case of Cambridge Analytica, information leakage, privacy issues, and trust also play an essential role as well. In respect of truthfulness, how can we encourage more robust and wide-reaching sharing of trustworthy material, such as scholarly research? Besides politicians, the public comes more and more into the focus as a political stakeholder in social media. How does the public engage in policy-making? Electronic-petitioning serves as a medium to mobilize support and interest of the public. The panel provides the possibility for speaker and participants to exchange both, information as well as methodological approaches of political communication in social media.

AB  - By examining mental illness through the lens of intimate firsthand accounts of caregivers and patients, including caregiver blogposts and a conversation between Liza Long and her son as recorded by StoryCorps, we demonstrate how new media can be leveraged to shift societal perceptions of those with mental illness from blameworthy potential perpetrators of terror to vulnerable persons in need of compassion and support. Exploring patient, caregiver, and societal roles through a close reading of new media firsthand accounts, we argue for shared responsibility in caring for those with mental illness and, in particular, for physicians to leverage their unique knowledge of the patient experience by promoting media coverage of stories of mental illness recovery.

AB  - The article systematizes the main provisions of issue ownership theory. This theory states that politicians and parties closely associated with the most topical issues and perceived by the public as capable of solving the problems receive greater public support. This theory has gained popularity in recent years. However, researchers still disagree over the definition of issue ownership and its measurement. The stability of the phenomenon over time as well as its applications not only to political parties but for individual politicians is still under discussion. Researchers distinguish two types of issue ownership: competence (confidence in the ability of a political actor to solve problem) and associative ownership (spontaneous identification of a political actor with an issue). Each of these «forms of ownership» is measured using various questions. This makes it more difficult to compare research results through the lens of this theory. Issue ownership plays a significant role in the political struggle and can contribute to the victory of the candidate (or party) in elections. This situation stimulates politicians to «capture» the most advantageous issues. However, political actors have unequal opportunities for that. The advantage is enjoyed by parties currently in power. In addition, the effect of issue ownership can be different for the authorities and the opposition. The opposition benefits from the media attention to the opposition-related issues but does not lose significantly due to active discussion of the issues that the ruling party owns. Meanwhile, the ruling parties lose their votes when the news media cover the issues owned by the opposition and do not gain much from the attention to the issues they own. © 2018 Russian Public Opinion Research Center VCIOM.

AB  - Mathematics is necessary to enable children to gain the knowledge and skills required for daily life, it teaches them how to solve a problem, enables them to gain ways of thinking and prepares them for the future. The prejudice developed towards mathematics affects the students' perceptions related to the mentioned course. The students' low motivation and high anxiety concerning mathematics are among the most important problems encountered. This research was conducted with students in the third and fourth grades in primary schools in Istanbul province to examine their mathematics motivation and anxieties. It was concluded that students' mathematics motivation was at a medium level and their mathematics anxieties were very low and there were no differences according to gender. Mathematics motivations among fourth grade students were higher than that of third grade students. It can be recommended that classroom teachers should prepare the environment in which they can introduce the entertaining world of mathematics to students. © 2018 SciencePark Research, Organization & Counseling.

AB  - The steel industry is a fundamental driving force of development for the Italian economy. It has been the focus of political and the media as well as public opinion attention for a long time. Certainly, steel production processes have had a significant impact on the environment. It is necessary to handle the productive processes with a different, careful attitude to pollution problems and its consequences for public health and future generations. Two new labels have been introduced in the Green Economy field: the Water Footprint and Carbon Footprint. They represent the new environmental accounting frontier. This case study examines the company "Acciaierie di Sicilia s.p.a." belonging to the group "Alfa Acciai", located in Catania. The aim of this paper is to carry out an analysis of the water and carbon footprint, to optimise productive processes with a view to the safeguarding resources. © 2018, Procedia Environmental Science, Engineering and Management.

AB  - Many previous studies have proven that social media is more likely to promote selective exposure in the acquisition of political information and to escalate political polarization than is older media. However, this study argues that the impact of social media on selective exposure and political polarization occurs differently according to the characteristics of their platforms. To prove this argument, we firstly compared old and social media in terms of their impact on selective exposure. Secondly, we compared the two different types of social media, Facebook and KakaoTalk, to examine their influences on selective exposure and the political polarization of public opinion during the presidential impeachment in South Korea. As a result, we observed that people using social media were more selective in choosing news sources than those using television. We also found that users of KakaoTalk were more selective in acquiring political information on the presidential impeachment than were Facebook users, and the same consequences appeared in political polarization. Therefore, we determined that the political and social influence of social media varies according to its platform characteristics. © 2018 by INSTITUTE OF KOREAN STUDIES.

AB  - Objectives. There is a lack of published data regarding patient interaction in basic scientific research, including methodologies for simple, cost-effective interactions and the outcomes of such studies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the ease of generating patient opinion data on specific scientific research projects whilst establishing a template for other groups to follow. Our secondary objective was to assess which research topics are of most interest to patients with SLE and/or APS. Methods. Through patient-based interactions, we developed a lay summary of a mechanistic research proposal and a set of associated questions to assess patient opinion on this research topic. We disseminated the questions as an online survey with associated lay summary through patient-based charity websites and social media. The survey was open for 3 weeks. Results. Of 527 respondents, 520 reported having SLE or APS. The patient response to the research proposal was overwhelmingly positive, with the majority expressing strong interest in the mechanistic aspect of the project. Analysis of free text box responses confirmed that the most popular research topics for patients were as follows: treatment, genetics, triggers, diagnosis and mechanistic research. Interestingly, patient interest in diseasemechanisms featuredmore frequently than clinical topics, such as management of disease flares. Conclusion. It is possible to conduct short-term, valuable patient engagement at low cost, using an online survey and social media. This methodology may form a good template for future patient engagement. The volume and distribution of positive response shows that patients are interested in mechanistic research. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Both news media and politicians, taking advantage of their cultural authority through spoken and written texts, contribute to forming public opinion, in particular with the use of discursive means, to shape the way people understand migration. Research has so far pointed to negative representations of the Other and argumentation against migrants and refugees revolves around the topoi of burden, illegality, insecurity, violence and threat, which are known to trigger emotions such as resentment, anger and fear. However, media coverage of refugees’ arrivals can also contribute to a positive construction of migrants’ identities: this is what has been called ‘counter-narrative’, i.e. a set of narratives aimed at changing the mainstream discourse, which is overwhelmingly negative. This study focuses on the thematic, lexical and syntactic choices in Greek Cypriot and French communist newspapers (Haravgi and L’Humanité respectively) and the choices used to construct an argumentation which fosters the inclusion of migrants. Focusing mainly on headlines, the study adopts critical discourse approaches (Wodak 2001, inter alia; van Dijk 2001, inter alia) and uses tools from corpus linguistics methodologies (Bednarek 2008; Baker et al. 2008; van Dijk 1995, inter alia) to extract and analyze salient lexical items. The results show similarities in the way stance is constructed, for instance an anti EU stance is common to both newspapers, however the Greek Cypriot newspaper appeals to Christian values to foster charity and empathy, and the French newspaper appeal to the legal rights of migrants and the French citizen’s duty to foster solidarity. © 2018 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

AB  - Alongside the reform and opening-up policies in China since 1978, there has been a transformation of China's governmental functions and of its media system. While adapting to the complex political process towards democratization, the Chinese Communist Party media have further expanded their dual identity as both organizational communicator and mass communicator, and are involved in Chinese political communication in a variety of ways. To improve the role of internal organizational communication, the Party media have extended their sphere of activity from traditional Internal Reference (xinwen neican ) to Online Public Opinion Monitoring (yuqing jiance) and Media Think Tank Consultation (meiti zhiku). As leaders in China's market-oriented media reform and tech-driven media integration, the Chinese Party media have remained dominant and privileged agents in China's mass media system, and active participants in social political communication in a number of ways, from traditional policy publicity, to media supervision and timely external opinion guiding. © 2018 LED Edizioni Universitarie.All right reserved.

AB  - In March 2018, a qualified majority of members of the National People's Congress of China voted for the adoption of the fifth amendment to the current constitutional text. In the five years prior to the vote on the amendment, President Xi Jinping delivered a constellation of public speeches, and the CCP and state organs published a series of documents in order to reaffirm the centrality of the Constitution in the country's political life, thus building the discursive framework in which the new text was discussed and adopted. The Constitution hence became one of the keywords of the political discourse and the discursive framework stemming from the central leadership documents echoed in the news production of national and international media. This paper will map how the political discourse on the Constitution permeated Chinese press texts from 2012 to 2018. The aim of the contribution is both to illustrate the influence that political language exerts on the press in China through a specific case study, and to verify to what extent the importance accorded to the constitutional text by the leadership was conveyed by the press to public opinion before and after the adoption of the 2018 amendment. © 2018 LED Edizioni Universitarie.All right reserved.

AB  - China is now one of the biggest online game markets, and the games are seen as both an economic opportunity and a social threat, especially to the young. I investigated the nature of, reasons for, and influences of online game quitting in China with 176 participants selected using deviant case sampling. I examined the relationships between the attitudes of those who were quitting playing toward online games, their perception of media portrayal of online games, family pressure, peer influence, functional alternatives, self-esteem, loneliness, online game quitting, and satisfaction with life after quitting. Results showed that the more negatively the participants felt about online games, the more likely they were to quit, and perception of peers’ negative attitude toward online gaming, perception of alternatives, and lower income were significant predictors of online game quitting. These findings could help policy makers rethink healthy gaming and antiaddiction strategies. © 2018 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This essay investigates the recent boom in the use of animated cartoons for political communication in China which began in late 2013. A series of political cartoons are examined against the background of a comprehensive media revolution designed by top-following the Chinese Communist Party's (hereafter CCP) new understanding of the role of media and public opinion. I argue, by looking closely at the creative use of political cartoons, that the CCP has adjusted its views on the role of media in the digital age - from propaganda mouthpiece, to guiding opinion unifier for popularizing the Party's rule. Their efforts and success in stimulating a significant number of responses through the use of animated cartoons has given rise to a new communication model of mixing top-down and bottom-up flow of message. Behind the new model was the CCP's changing understanding of the public: from “target audience of propaganda” to guided audience, and then to central players in popularizing the Party. The major media reform since Xi took office in early 2013 has laid institutional, managerial and editorial foundations to sustain this conceptual change in practice. The boom in political cartoons is the most conspicuous result of that. © 2018 LED Edizioni Universitarie.All right reserved.

AB  - Conventional wisdom suggests that efforts to improve the lives of workers within oppressive labor conditions would be viewed at least neutrally, if not positively. Recent work, such as Powell (2014), counters this assumption. Our work extends this idea, applying it to deleterious effects on employee action rather than on employee opportunity. Specifically, we look at the case of Foxconn employee suicides in the spring of 2010. We conclude with a cautionary note: that public influence is indeed a powerful tool capable of much good, but that care must be taken to prevent it from being misused, even if unintentionally. © 2018, Fayetteville State University.

AB  - In late 2017, congressional Republicans enacted a major tax bill despite voter opposition, resistance from organized interests, and considerable uncertainty about its policy consequences. Why did they do so? We argue that Republicans' concern with their party's reputation-in particular, its productivity brand-trumped negative evaluations of the legislation by citizens, interest groups, and policy experts. To support this claim, we analyze measures of legislative output, news media content, public opinion, and lawmaker sentiment. Our findings underscore the importance of party reputation in explaining legislative behavior and suggest that there may be explanatory value in distinguishing between different types of party valence brands. © E-flow Walter de Gruyter 2018.

AB  - The direct regional election of 2017 is one of the democracy parties celebrated by the people of Special Capital Region of Jakarta. As the capital of the country, this regional election brings special meaning for the people, communities, and parties participating in this election to become the highest sovereign of this region. Philosophically, it will be easier to win the next national election when a certain party becomes the sovereign of this Special Capital Region of Jakarta. In this case, news media has a very important role in providing good and useful information to the people and the community. The independence of media is expected to provide balanced, neutral information because it may greatly determine the quality of the ongoing regional election. As the opposite, there is also a possibility in which media is used as a tool to build political power. That is why there is a new phenomenon in which many media owners are involved and even actively participated in politics in Indonesia. The dynamics of the current communication technology development is started to be taken seriously by the media owners. They realize that it is not enough just to build media power that leads into conventional media only since it is no longer strategic. Therefore, they emphasize more on using online media to develop their media business. One of the advantages of using online media is that it can provide the new propaganda faster. In addition, as the media is having its power to build the public opinion, they got the power to directly lead the stakeholders to certain political interests. In this study, news report on Media Indonesia.com published in November and December was used as the object of study in order to identify the case of regional election in Jakarta. This study used a qualitative approach by developing a Critical Discourse Analysis Model of Teun A. Van Dijk Model. The objective of this study is to analyze and to describe the reporting scheme of political-related matter of regional direct election in Special Capital Region of Jakarta. The results of this study showed that in the scheme for the production of textual discourse, the cognition and the context are intervened by an ideology as its own dimension. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.

AB  - Although Similar to individuals using impression management tactics, organizational impression management (OIM) theory suggests organizations can also use communications strategies to influence public opinions of a company's image. This study examined the differences in OIM strategies regarding the rhetorical tone of Optimism, Certainty, Activity, Realism, and Commonality among different types of law firms. The analysis of nearly 10,000 Tweets initiated by The AmLaw 100 over five years reveals that higher-revenue law firms exhibited higher Certainty and Optimism than lower-revenue firms. There was a statistically significant difference in Activity among all law firms between 2011 and 2014. Introduction. © 2018 American Communication Association.

AB  - On the grounds of the theories of the use of the mass media, the authors analyse concepts and assessments of military threats. The analysis is based on the data of representative public opinion polls (conducted in spring 2016 by Vilmorus, N = 1004). The research shows that certain qualities of individual political competence strengthen the impact of the media, that the tabloid press, Russian TV and the quality press affect concepts of military threats, and that sets of factors shaping the concepts of various military threats are different. The extent of the mass media impact is influenced mostly by an individual's ethnic background, education, income, participation in elections, political education, inter-personal communication on political topics as well as a leftist-rightist self-identification. © Military Academy of Lithuania, 2018.

AB  - Este artículo pretende mostrar cómo la educación, que es la forma más importante de actividad en el marco del medio social, cambia la imagen cultural y la conciencia de los individuos, moldea y transforma su actitud política hacia las realidades cotidianas circundantes. Se utiliza un análisis de comparación para explorar un sistema de educación cívica en la formación de la identidad nacional y estatal de una persona como un derivado de una 'comunidad imaginada'. Este fenómeno debe considerarse como el resultado de diseñar los valores sociales y políticos y la internalización en la conciencia pública de los mismos. El método sociológico permite revelar la dependencia de la educación cívica de la sociedad, su relación con las diversas esferas de la vida social. Las siguientes conclusiones se han realizado en el curso del análisis de valor normativo de la condición actual (práctica y metafísica) de la educación cívica. Resultados: En primer lugar, la lealtad y el espíritu público contribuyen a la comprensión del papel y el lugar de la conciencia pública en el sistema de instituciones y reglamentos políticos existentes. En segundo lugar, se está elaborando una sumisión consciente a las normas y estándares generales adoptados en la comunidad en el curso de la educación cívica. Se puede alcanzar debido a la lealtad. En tercer lugar, un método específico de relaciones entre un individuo y las autoridades, la comunidad y el estado, cuando todos los participantes del proceso político sirven como iguales entre sí se implementará en el fenómeno de la conciencia cívica. Finalmente, un comportamiento bien informado basado en la responsabilidad personal de las fortunas de la patria de uno, la supervivencia de la cultura y la tradición histórica se reflejará en el patriotismo. Este enfoque permite optimizar el proceso de educación cívica.
This article is to show how education, which is the most important form of activity in the social medium framework, changes the cultural image and awareness of individuals, shapes and transforms their political attitude towards surrounding day-to-day realities. A comparison analysis is used to explore a system of civic education in the formation of national and state identity of a person as a derivative of an 'imagined community'. This phenomenon shall be regarded as a result of designing the social and political values and internalization in public consciousness thereof. Sociological method allows to reveal the dependence of civic education from society, its relationship with various spheres of social life. The following conclusions have been made in the course of normative value analysis of the current condition (practice and metaphysics) of civic education. Results: First of all, loyalty and public spirit contribute to understanding a role and place of public awareness in the system of existing political institutions and regulations. Secondly, a conscious submission to general rules and standards adopted in the community in the course of civic education is being elaborated. It can be reached due to loyalty. Thirdly, a specific method of relations between an individual and the authorities, community and state, when all the political process participants serve as equal to each other will be implemented in the civic consciousness phenomenon. This approach makes it possible to optimize the process of civic education. © 2018.

AB  - The usage of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, either by the public or by organizations, has been rapidly increasing. The decision-makers in the organizations use social media to engage with their customers since public users tend to express their opinions about certain products and services through this popular mechanism. Hence, this valuable data can be useful for marketing and business decisions. However, the main obstacle is obtaining meaningful information from these platforms due to the unstructured data they present. Sentiment analysis is seen as the best tool to analyze insights or opinions in this huge amount of data. In this article, we extract data on public opinion about property in order to understand the reason behind the imbalances of supply and demand currently faced by the property industry in Malaysia. In addition, we visualized the sentiment results in the form of a dashboard so that it may help property players to understand the public sentiments toward their housing or construction projects. © IJTech 2018.

AB  - In recent years, the popularity of social media services (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Plurk) has been on the rise. As users grow accustomed to posting their personal opinions on certain issues on the Internet, collecting data on the public’s opinion and attitude towards specific issues can provide the government, organizations, and corporations with a solid basis of reference for their decision-making. Thus, sentiment analysis (SA) of text messages has become a crucial research topic, while the value of research results and related application have gained more emphasis and more emphasis. This study proposes constructing an intelligent sentiment analysis classifier by integrating CCLM (Combined CKIP Language Model) with naïve Bayes classifiers, with the aim of establishing a high-accuracy sentiment classification based on Mandarin texts posted on social media platform to provide more accurate predictions towards future public opinion trends and behavior patterns. In our experiment, the used short text messages derived from a famous microblogging service – Plurk – as our subject of study to explore sentiment analysis of Mandarin sentences; the naïve Bayes classifier combined with three language models – BLM (bigram language model), CLM (CKIP language model, and CCLM – to construct sentiment analyzers. Throughout different size of data sets in the experiment, the sentiment classifier adopting CCLM achieved better accuracy. © 2018, Taiwan Ubiquitous Information. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the direct and spillover effects of media coverage on tourism growth in China. The theoretical foundation for how media affects development of regional tourism economy is deduced. An empirical analysis based on panel data from 31 Chinese provinces for the years 2003-2014 is presented through ordinary and spatial regression model. The main conclusions of the econometric analysis are that media coverage can significantly promote the development of local tourism growth by acting as an information intermediary, enhancing the image of the tourism destination, and forming public opinion pressure. Local media coverage can yield a positive impact on the economic development of neighboring tourism areas, as a result of accelerating the exchange and spillover efficiency of regional tourism information. Comparing to the geographical distance between provinces, the correlations degree of interregional tourism economy is more conducive to promote the spillover effect of media coverage on tourism growth. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.

AB  - Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and its scope, intensity, cruelty has now become one of the most acute and topical problems of global significance. The article deals with conceptual measures for strengthening the fight against terrorism and extremism financing, effective work with the private sector on providing information necessary for detection of the activity connected with terrorism and extremism financing. This work analyses the increasing level of awareness of representatives of public and private sectors and strengthening of the role of financial intelligence for the use of reconnaissance data as a dominant way of fight against terrorism and extremism. It has been determined that in such circumstances effective fight against terrorism and extremism as the exterritorial phenomenon has to have a complex character, combining efforts at universal, regional and interstate levels. As experts note, the measures taken only at the national level will have a limited effect. For safety insurance, each state needs international cooperation. It has been established that in Israel in order to prevent crises and mass protests, they use in practice the positively recommended Israel's experiment of information exchange of law enforcement and special bodies with leaders of public opinion (authoritative persons, elders), representatives of official clergy, mass media and NGO by means of WhatsApp mobile application in online mode about the events having a public response. It is established that all interested private structures and government bodies have to reach a compromise in the strategy of ensuring a reliable system of counteraction and development of countermeasures according to the solution of anti-terrorist actions. © 2018 Bekisheva et al.

AB  - Background Public opinion surveys usually report majority support for fluoridation in North America. Yet many local plebiscites produce opposite results. One possible reason is the nature of local media coverage. Analysis This article reports on a content analysis of news coverage and letters to the editor about a fluoridation plebiscite in Waterloo, Ontario. Qualitative research suggested that the groups opposed to fluoridation were more motivated and better organized than those in support. The net effect was news coverage more neutral toward fluoridation than supportive or critical, predominantly framed in terms of risks rather than benefits. Conclusion and implications The findings here emphasize the reactive nature of contemporary journalism. In local fluoridation plebiscites, champions are required to produce news coverage that better conveys the benefits to the public. © 2018 Canadian Journal of Communication Corporation.
Contexte Normalement, dans les sondages d'opinion publique en Amérique du Nord, la majorité des répondants appuient la fluorisation. Pourtant, au niveau local, plusieurs référendums obtiennent des résultats contraires. Une raison possible pour ce contraste est la couverture médiatique locale. Analyse Cet article présente une analyse de contenu effectuée sur la couverture médiatique et les tribunes libres concernant un référendum sur la fluorisation tenu à Waterloo (Ontario). Cette recherche qualitative suggère que, dans ce cas, les groupes opposés à la fluorisation étaient plus motivés et mieux organisés que ceux qui appuyaient celle-ci. En conséquence, la couverture de la fluorisation tendait à être neutre plutôt que positive ou négative, avec un accent mis sur les risques plutôt que les bienfaits. Conclusions et implications Les résultats de cette recherche soulignent le caractère réactif du journalisme contemporain. En conséquence, dans les référendums locaux, les partisans de la fluorisation auront intérêt à se mobiliser afin d'encourager des reportages plus axés sur les bienfaits de celle-ci. © 2018 Canadian Journal of Communication Corporation.

AB  - This essay addresses the relationship between communication, public opinion, and democracy, which is evident in Athenian democracy. It briefly considers the complexity of the concept of public opinion, and how it was understood as a political phenomenon accepted in general thinking and political action, as a consequence of the democratic dynamism originated by the printing press. After briefly considering some of the most relevant ideas about this relationship throughout the 19th century, this essay discusses the main attitudes that emerged in the face of public opinion after the First World War, from which the most relevant theories about the effects of media on opinion, behaviours, and action begun to be developed. The study takes into account the development of an empirical science of public opinion, linked to scientific opinion surveys. It summarises how the investigation of the effects of the media goes through a stage in which they are considered irrelevant, until some studies – especially the theories of agenda setting and the spiral of silence– recovered the idea of the powerful effects of the media. Finally, the essay addresses the new challenges posed by the disenchantment with democracy, the loss of credibility of the media, and the way of understanding communication, at a time in which digital technology has facilitated the creation of social media, causing a situation described as the post-truth era, in which the global need for information becomes more evident. The new challenges affect the political science, research on public opinion, and the science of communication, which requires a foundation of greater consistency than the current one. © 2018 Communication & Society,.

AB  - Based on recent political happenings, such as Brexit (UK) and the election of Donald Trump (USA), it has become clear that political marketing has been using 'Big Data' intensively. Information gathered from social media networks is organized into digital environments and has the power to determine the outcome of elections, plebiscites and popular consultations. New advertising and persuasion mechanisms have been created to undermine the reliability of traditional mass media communication that are familiar to the general audience. Consequently, 'fake news' and 'alternative facts' have emerged along with the notion of 'post-truth', which defines the state of affairs represented in public opinion that has been contaminated by these strategies. Based on the pragmatic-semiotic concepts developed by Peirce, such as belief, mental habits, controlled action, final opinion, truth, and reality, we argue that the 'global village', (McLuhan, 2008) may be at a dangerous fork in the road. This author's 'scientific method' was elaborated based on (1) the concatenation of hypotheses, (2) the deduction of its consequences, and (3) the design of experiences and aims to test our beliefs against our results which would be critically evaluated by communities of researchers. This fork in the road, which rapidly evolves as a dystopia built and reaffirmed by the spread of disinformation on social networks, points towards a 'post-reality' that can represent an illusory and brief comfort zone for those who live in it but may also represent a tragedy with no turning back for our entire civilization. © 2018 IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Educational technology supports meaningful learning and enables the presentation of spatial and dynamic images, which portray relationships among complex concepts. The Technology-Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) involves media-rich software for simulation and visualization in freshman Electrical Engineering carried out in a specially redesigned classroom to facilitate group interaction. These technology-based learning materials are especially useful in safety procedures in transformers in electrical engineering to help students conceptualize phenomena and processes. This study analyses the effects of the unique learning environment of the TEALon students' cognitive and affective outcomes. As part of the project, we developed pre-test and post-tests consisting of conceptual questions from standardized tests, as well as questions designed to assess the effect of visualizations and experiments. It consisted of a small and a large-scale experimental group and a control group. TEAL students improved their conceptual understanding of the subject matter to a significantly higher extent than their control group peers. Most of the students in the small-scale experiment noted that they would recommend the TEAL course to fellow students, indicating the benefits of interactivity, visualization, and hands-on experiments, which the technology helped enable also about teaching learning process for building student's confidence is discussed. In the large-scale implementation students expressed both positive and negative attitudes in the course survey and feedback is also mentioned. © 2018, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the subjective opinion within a text. And it gains a huge interest due to its several benefits in developing economy, politic, and sociology. And since twitter is considered a rich source of people's thoughts and opinions, it is urged to benefit from it to explore public opinions. Many researches have been conducted for English language, while Arabic language still got limited number of sentiment analysis studies, especially in the context of Arab dialects in social media. A lexicon-based approach is adopted to perform sentiment analysis on Arabic tweets, which rely on detecting sentiment words. These sentiment words are loaded in a sentiment lexicon where words are annotated by its sentiment polarity. One of the main issues of handling Arabic tweets is the changing nature of twitter, where new words that imply sentiment values emerged, and many slang words are evolved. In this paper, an expandable and up-to-date lexicon for Arabic (EULA) is developed to overcome the issue of inventing new words and phrases in social media. EULA rely on a pre-built lexicon of MSA sentiment words, and a set of rules to expand and enrich it with dialectical polarity words from a small amount of labelled tweets, and a large amount of unlabeled tweets. For evaluation, eight different corpuses of Arabic tweets were selected. And a pre-processing phase that includes normalization and stemming is implemented to reduce the number of unique words to be analyzed for sentiment analysis. Experiments show that EULA improved the lexicon-based approach's accuracy and F-1 score by more than 20% on average. © 2017, COMPUSOFT, An international journal of advanced computer technology.

AB  - Throughout the Spanish Civil War, visual media in the press played a special role on the side of the Republicans. Photographs of children in various situations were used to report on what was happening and also to influence the public opinion both locally and abroad. In this article, we analyse a specific subset of the enormous quantity of visual media that was published during the war: that which was created specifically for combatants in what is generally referred to as military press. More than two hundred such publications were found. Our aim is to determine what use was made of images that include children, and after compiling an inventory and choosing from among the articles and/or reports that incorporate the use of such images, we analysed the iconography that was constructed, presenting concrete examples. We found that, via iconographic resources and elements, photographs of childhood were used more for propaganda than to show any specific reality. © 2018 eum (Edizioni Università di Macerata, Italy).

AB  - Global evidence suggests that hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is endemic in Africa and perinatal transmission remains one of the most important modes of HBV transmission in this area. This cross-sectional survey examined the seroprevalence and knowledge of hepatitis B among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) in a mission hospital in Ghana. Systematic sampling technique was used to recruit 196 pregnant women. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 alpha level. The hepatitis B prevalence estimate (hepatitis B surface antigen) was 10.2% (N = 20) and all of the participants were aware of HBV infection. Majority cited media (radio) as their main source of information. Approximately 86% of the participants (N = 168) associated HBV infection with a curse and 88.8% (N = 174) indicated witches and wizards as possible causes of the infection. Those with higher level of school education had high hepatitis B knowledge score (P < 0.01). Implementation of a health education program on the route of hepatitis B transmission is required in the study setting. Also, inclusion of hepatitis B education as part of ANC activities will enable HBV-positive pregnant women to appreciate the need for hepatitis B vaccination of their newborns at birth.

AB  - Despite the obvious interest of the media to cultural industries, this specific segment of the intellectual market still remains outside the focus of sociological interest. For example, “products with subtext” deserve our close attention for they are responsible for the ideological consistency of the information society especially due to the fact that information technologies, having become part of the production chains of cultural industries, have significantly expanded the functions of education and leisure. The seemingly heterogeneous productions of ideas and meanings are quite similar and unified in the elaboration of the repertoire, creation of the cult of the hero of his time and the culture of consumption of information products. E. Morin mentioned that creative technologies possess the “ability to standardize great romantic themes, thus, transforming archetypes into stereotypes”. Under the widespread digitization of production, this process has gained unprecedented dynamics, scale, ideological orientation and material interest. The persisting dramas of the Cold War and the post-Soviet conflicts prove that the “smart power” of Russia’s opponents is quite effective. On the one hand, it consolidates the public opinion of other countries, and, on the other hand, deforms the political culture of the object of its influence by sophisticated manipulations of the world picture of the younger generations. Investors of cultural industries not only invest in the expansion of a profitable intellectual business but also serve the political reproduction of power, which, in turn, provides optimal conditions for the “dual-use products” entering foreign information fields and cultural spaces. Whether or not the Russian society is ready to neutralize and counter the new class of information threats — the authors consider this and some other debatable issues. © V.N. Davydov, A.I.

AB  - Since the creation of the European Union, anti-immigration rhetoric has traditionally been directed at non-European citizens. However, in recent decades hostility towards migrants has been extended to the rejection of EU citizens, to whom the European treaties ostensibly guarantee freedom of movement. In particular, the migration of the largest European ethnic minority, the Roma, within the EU has been accompanied by inflamed media reports and populist discourse laden with explicitly racist sentiments. Whereas the dynamics of Romani migration in the original Member States has received substantial political and academic attention, the movement of Roma people across newer Member States continues to be overlooked. An intrinsic assumption that Romani migration is a solely westward phenomenon has led to a failure to examine the role of Central and Eastern European states in generating exclusionary policies. Despite urgent calls from human rights activists about the intensifying violation of the legal rights of Romani migrants the situation has yet to be acknowledged or scrutinized by international organizations and academics. To shed analytical light on this under-researched area, the article presents an analysis of the impact of Polish immigration regime on Romani migrants and long-time residents from Romania. Drawing on data from official documents, activist reports, and semi-structured interviews the article traces the neoliberalization of Polish migration regime: one that mobilizes aggressive attitudes and behaviors towards the poorest and most marginalized European citizens. In turn, it argues that the deterrent tactics employed against migrants by the Polish State has its roots in the increasingly restrictive EU immigration policies and economic determinism of the Freedom of Movement and Residency Directive. © 2018, Intersections.

AB  - With the development and penetration of information technology, the "fourth media"-the network media is coming, and the "grievance crisis" is increasingly happening. The effective monitoring of online public opinion information becomes a problem. For each university, how to understand the sensation of teachers and students in real time in the era of informationization entering the intelligent campus has become an urgent problem for all colleges and universities. This paper first analyzes the characteristics of Weibo's communication and the process of microblogging's public opinion formation, the mechanism of communication, and so on. For the acquisition of this information, the reptile method was used to obtain the required data, which was beneficial to the real-time sensation in the smart campus. Then, based on the improved single-pass algorithm to analyze the new characteristics of microblog propagation information and the public opinion sent by college students, and compared the improved single-pass algorithm with the effect of single-pass algorithm, the improved algorithm had the recall rate was high, the false detection rate was low, and the running time was short. Finally, taking the lyrics of college teachers and students as the research object, unified modeling language modeling was used to analyze the public opinion monitoring platform of the smart campus, and the campus public opinion of several major events was monitored and analyzed. This provided a reference for the effective, intelligent, and real-time detection of Weibo public opinion in colleges and universities. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of online social networks, increasing amounts of user-generated content are posted online. While information is overwhelming a site, readers actually prefer fully reading some influential articles or information rather than glancing sequentially at every article on a forum. In this paper, we propose techniques for forecasting public responses to articles shortly after the articles are published. Our proposal identifies the important articles from two perspectives: frequent discussion and extreme acceptance or rejection by the online public. We also discuss approaches for distinguishing influential authors who are popular and receive consistently high ratings from online users. To verify our methodologies, we analyzed a popular social forum in Taiwan during three large-scale social events, a social movement and two national election campaigns. Our results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve high accuracy with significant time reduction and outperform previous methodologies in distinguishing notable articles and authors on social forums. © Institute of Information Science.

AB  - This article examines the individual, collective, and social emotions embedded in media discussions of the financial crisis. Emotional experiences toward crises and the political institutions associated with them serve as valuable tools for understanding how citizens think and feel in the public sphere. We highlight over-time links between individual, collective, and social emotionality as we analyze the content of UK media representations of the European financial crisis from 2009 to 2012. We code editorials from journalists and commentaries from experts, public figures, and opinion leaders published in four UK newspapers and identify the valence and affective tone of individual, collective, and social expressions of anger, fear, disappointment, hope, pride, and compassion. We also examine how these interlinked levels of emotional talk underpin blame attributions. This article advances the systematic understanding of the impact of the financial crisis on public opinion and considers its contribution toward European integration attitudes as Brexit was introduced in public debates during this time.

AB  - The subject of the author's interest is the media tendency to disclose a significant page of Russian history - the October Revolution. As a starting point of the research, the author has chosen a quotation of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov, recorded by Konstantin Simonov: “There are three different memories. You can remember the evil. This is the first one. You can remember experience. This is the second one. You can remember the past, thinking about the future. This is the third one”. Three types of memory serve as three concepts of analysis. In fact, the words of the commander in a brief form contain the program of the research project, in which, first of all, the operationalization of the selected concepts is carried out, and the selection of media texts is subjected to examination. Analysis of publications of 2017 in Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Literaturnaya Gazeta and Novaya Gazeta confirmed the possibility of using the evaluative research of media texts through “three different memories” parameters. In total, 239 texts were examined in the media which are typologically represented by one regional newspaper and three federal ones; two daily and two weekly media; one official media, two media loyal to the state policy and one opposition media. Russian press in 2017 is characterized by an objective-neutral approach while covering the anniversary of the historic event. This approach finds its expression, first of all, in materials of an informational character: modern cultural news, the chronicle of 1917, historical sketches (123 texts from 239 analyzed). Analytical materials also favor the position of “not forgetting experience” (79). It strengthens the characteristic of the discourse about the revolution that leans toward the “medial” position of the public opinion. However, in Literaturnaya Gazeta and Novaya Gazeta there is a maximum concentration of the expression of the authors' political positions, and the value of the “October Revolution” concept is viewed from diametrically opposite directions. Generally, for the first time in recent years, the media attitude to the October Revolution was not marked by a distinct dominance of diametrically opposite evaluative principles. The evaluation of events that occurred a hundred years ago increasingly becomes the evaluation of the past, which was not actualized in the public sphere. This statement is based on at least two points: firstly, the author believes that the mass media reflect the most important aspects of the current public moods; secondly, the dominance of “mass culture” in the society reduces the level of its civic self-awareness averaging the content of the media and spreading the philistine philosophy of consumerism. Therefore, the production of “omnibuses” (media facts that do not divide society into feuding parties and cause universal consensus) begins to dominate in the media (in the words of Pierre Bourdieu). Thus, modern media practice indicates value-based reorientation which is taking place in the society. © 2018 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cabinet scandals and minister resignations happen frequently in Japan. In recent years, political opponents and the mass media have approached such cases as occasions for pursuit of the prime minister's 'appointive responsibility'. Based on comprehensive source material since 1989 but focusing particularly on 2006-2012, this paper introduces appointive responsibility as an object of critical analysis. Emphasizing that the notion has distinct ideological implications, I pinpoint the rhetorical techniques and strategic rationale underlying appointive responsibility and show that the phenomenon operates in two logically opposed forms. The first form follows a causality principle and presents the prime minister as inappropriately ignorant. The second one operates according to a representative logic and revolves around inappropriate knowledge. Outlining and problematizing both forms, the paper analytically unravels key aspects of a new paradigm of executive leadership and responsibility in Japanese political discourse. The paper contributes to a better qualitative understanding of responsibility constructs in recent Japanese politics and delivers a focused critical examination of appointive responsibility as a key rhetorical vehicle for tapping into frustrated public expectations of political leadership. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is the most common form of violence suffered by women and constitutes a serious public health problem of global proportions. Public attitudes towards IPVAW are key to understanding the social context in which this type of violence occurs. Victim-blaming attitudes are among those that reflect public tolerance and acceptability of IPVAW and are often used to explain or justify IPVAW. In this study we develop and validate a new instrument to assess victim-blaming attitudes in cases of IPVAW. A sample of 1,800 participants was recruited through social media and a second sample of 50 IPVAW offenders was used for validation purposes. Through a cross-validation approach and by fitting an item response theory model to the data, we found that the latent structure of the instrument was one-dimensional and particularly informative for medium and high levels of victim-blaming attitudes. Differential item functioning analysis showed that item parameters did not differ by gender. We found, in addition, that (a) our measure was strongly related to acceptability and perceived severity of IPVAW, and also to ambivalent sexism, (b) men presented higher levels of victim-blaming attitudes than women, and (c) IPVAW offenders showed higher levels of victim-blaming attitudes than men from the general population. A five-item short version of the scale is also presented for use in studies with limited application time or space. Our findings confirm that this new scale is a reliable and valid measure to assess victim-blaming attitudes in cases of IPVAW. © 2018 Colegio Oficial de Psicólogos de Madrid.

AB  - This article draws on a systematic literature review of recently-published material to investigate the state of the art of research into how social network profiles are being used to manipulate public opinion on political issues. The aim of this review is to discuss how the use of these profiles impacts on constructing consensus, authority, legitimacy and representativeness of politicians, parties, hegemonic and minority groups. In total, 369 articles were obtained following a bibliographic search on four different scientific citation indexing databases. Of those, 16 were considered relevant to the research question. In order to identify general trends and specific results, the pertinent papers were subjected to descriptive and critical analysis. Five main approaches were observed: A) Usage policies and platform neutrality; B) Definition, detection and description of the manipulation agents; C) Political role of agents on social networks; D) Attempted electoral predictions via social networks; and E) Network dynamics and strategies for disseminating information. In the conclusion, the results of the literature review are discussed. © 2018 - University of Salento.

AB  - eu law on same-sex unions (ssu) expects Member States to legally recognize the family life of same-sex couples in the form of marriage, partnership, or cohabitation. The normative expectation, which in about 2010 became a principled position of the eu institutions and the European Court of Human Rights, has not been endorsed by one Western European Member State (Italy) as well as the majority of the post-Communist Member States (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia). There are a number of causes behind the failure to enact ssu laws: the legacies of the communist regimes, the prevalence of a certain interpretation of Christian doctrine, the medium level of economic affluence, and an unfavorable balance of power between the change and blocking coalitions of social, religious, and political actors. Unlike Western European countries, where the family life of same-sex unions was legally recognized primarily due to pressures from below (due to changes in public opinion and shifts in cultural values), governments and legislatures in most Central and Eastern European Member States are encouraged more from above (by the European Union and the Council of Europe). Therefore, the prospects for legal recognition of same-sex unions are slim in countries where the European normative agenda meets no significant support from domestic social values or religious and political actors. This conflict of national and eu forces is most likely to persist in Member States which are post-Soviet, culturally Orthodox, not shifted from materialist to post-materialist values, and governed by right-wing governmental coalitions. © 2018 Law in Eastern Europe.

AB  - Social media sites have become common sources of information about current affairs, and animal-activist organisations, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), use these networks as campaign tools to raise awareness against animal agriculture. The aim of the present study was to understand how an animal-welfare issue was discussed in Twitter, in Australia. Twitter Application Programing Interface data featuring keywords and hashtags were initially collected between April and May 2014 to examine tweets on animal-welfare issues in the absence of a triggering event. In July 2014, PETA released footage portraying ill-treatment of sheep in Australian shearing sheds, generating 9610 tweets in 7 days, including themes such as disgust, condemnation of the cruelty, and calls to boycott the wool industry. PETA's social-media campaign began 24 h before comment in conventional news media online, highlighting the role of social media in leading conventional media campaigning. Associated Twitter activity from the wool industry was limited. It is concluded that Twitter is not currently an effective medium for conversations between producers and the community about farm-animal welfare, despite encouragement from industry. While there are positives for producers and industry to be on Twitter, including the promotion of their business and communication within their micro-publics, Twitter as a platform may not be ideal for generating a dialogue between producers and the community. Further research into how people engage with the content, not just through the study of retweets and amount of traffic, is required to understand whether social media has potential to change attitudes towards animal production.

AB  - The relationship between political institutions and citizens has been redefined in the digital environment. The aim of this paper is to identify the main circumstances of this transformation. In this regard, individualization has been a key factor. So far, this relationship had been based on collective commitment and a global vision of society. Instead, it now depends on personal commitment and interest in individual issues. The voting process, traditionally based on affiliation, is now conditioned by voters’ opinions. Public opinion can no longer be taken for granted. In addition, persuasion as the only strategy to connect with the electorate is insufficient. Therefore, professionals of political communication have been forced to use the logic of marketing and to explore the potential of digital media, to obtain more consensus and visibility in an increasingly competitive context of communication. © 2020 Scientific Association Icono14.

AB  - For long, there has been a huge demand to develop an efficient mechanism to effectively search and extract much needed information from the social web. Manual annotation is effectively possible in information retrieval for limited number of documents, but it is impractical for large accumulation of document retrieval particularly from social media. The principle objective of this research is to comprehend the emergency news by semantically extracting entities and its relations in the posted user generated content. In order to achieve this, the two most sought process of this enablement is that key event identification of every news items and semantic element extraction from those items. These two processes paves the way for building an effective knowledge base as well as a semantic retrieval engines to augment the event level semantic filtration of news items. It has been well observed and noted at many instances that social media's prevalence is a major source of collective formation of large public opinions. Nevertheless, deriving much needed information from it is very useful because of the fact that it is fresh and above all, no one has mediated its content. It is not the news that we have pondered for, but the views of millions of people on the particular events. Hence, this research has turned to the new dimension of identifying the events which are deemed important for many levels of processes. We discover the events by clustering similar information from mainstream social media and categorize the events semantically to enrich the whole process to obtain the much sought discovery of hidden information. © MIR Labs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the social network of lesbian mothers, from the social contexts of support or restraint.
METHOD: Descriptive, exploratory study, of qualitative approach, based on the theoretical reference of Social Network, with eight lesbian mothers selected through Snowball technique, using semi-structured interview. Data analysis was performed with IRAMUTEQ software, through Similarity Analysis.
RESULTS: The social network is configured as: 1) Emotional distance and non-acceptance of motherhood by the family members - primary network elements; 2) Interference in the socio-cultural medium for the effectiveness of the mother-child bond - secondary network elements.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Social network is grounded on trivialized and negative conceptions that highlight prejudice and disrespect. The discussion of this theme contributes to a greater visibility of those new family arrangements as well as to reduce stigmas e prejudices that pervade the social network components of these women.

AB  - Data on the incidence and prevalence of hate crimes in the United States come primarily from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Although UCR data undercount most crimes, hate crimes are particularly underreported, especially for some groups. We compare 2000- 2011 UCR data in Pennsylvania to data from a state agency that came from police, media, and citizen reports. First, we find that the state-agency database is generally consistent with the UCR data, in terms of absolute counts, correlations, and predictors. Second, we find that UCR data underestimate hate crime rates by a factor of about 1.6 overall and by a factor of 2.5 for rural areas. Moreover, although UCR data on hate crimes show a decrease in the most recent 5-year period, the state agency data show that hate crime incident counts have not dropped. We suggest that using a broader index that includes both the UCR and a database like that in Pennsylvania will give a more complete picture of hate crime. © 2018 Springer Publishing Company.

AB  - Journalists tend to serialize political scandals and publish scandalous information bit by bit instead of all at once in a single news article. Disseminating scandalous information in a serialized way may affect readers’ perceptions of the scandal and the politicians involved in it independently of the information that is conveyed. To test this assumption, an experiment was conducted. All participants were exposed to identical scandalous information. However, the form of presentation—exposure to one, two, three, four, or five article(s)—was systematically manipulated. Serialization indeed indirectly increased participants’ negative attitudes about the politician via the perceived scandal’s importance, participants’ reading duration, cognitive elaboration, and intensity of negative emotions.

AB  - This explanatory concurrent mixed-methods study aimed to explore vicarious trauma (VT) among American Muslims; whether they are experiencing it, what factors may be contributing, and how they are experiencing VT. VT and religious identity were the main variables of interest for the quantitative data; qualitative questions provided greater insight into participants' personal experiences. Religious identity and ethnicity were found to be significant in the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) model and collectively explained 21% of the variance in VT scores. Phenomenological qualitative analysis of the qualitative responses revealed 9 themes, including humanity (being seen as less than human) and exposure (to trauma material). This study suggests that American Muslims are experiencing VT; in combination with qualitative responses, important policy changes can be recommended: policies addressing hate crimes should be strengthened, individuals in key professions need to be trained in Islam and Muslims, and further media guidelines and training must be conducted. © 2018 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.

AB  - This study examines the implications of messages within a fragmented media environment for public opinion about net neutrality. Drawing on media effects theory and an analysis of media messages, it argues that different forms of media use— including consumption of traditional news, partisan cable news, political satire, and streaming video services—can exert distinctive effects on public familiarity with and support for net neutrality. Moreover, it extends research on information subsidy and intertextuality to argue that political satire use can interact with other forms of media use in shaping public responses to complex policy issues such as net neutrality. Using original data from national telephone surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015, the analyses reveal that various forms of media use predicted familiarity with and support for net neutrality. The findings also suggest that exposure to political satire can shape the translation of information obtained from other sources into opinion. Copyright © 2018 (Paul R. Brewer, Dannagal G.

AB  - The political and administrative elites acting amid social, political and eco-nomic changes and facing the rising conflict potential in their countries have no choice but to tap into the full potential of symbolic politics as an important instrument of power. Indeed, their continued presence in the corridors of power depends, to a great extent, on their ability to influence public opinion; this is doubly important during election campaigns. In order to succeed, the elites have to use symbolic interactions and political myths as the most efficient instrument of brainwashing. The authors have described the technologies and practices used to construct functional political myths. The social and cultural crisis into which the country had slipped in the first post-Soviet years, economic problems, seats of ethnopolitical conflicts made the use of barely verified information practically inevitable. The authors have analyzed the sources, means and instruments used to form and adjust public opinion. In democratic countries political systems are formed by and rely on independent media, balanced editorial policies and resolute rejection of unfounded or harmful information by the public. We live in “real virtuality” (Manuel Castells): real politics is still burdened by the Soviet heritage of myths firmly rooted in people’s minds and people’s readiness to accept utopian ideas. The elites, meanwhile, are building up conspiracy theories, searching for external and internal enemies, offering simplified and irrational explanations of social and political processes unfolding in the country. New myths are created and promoted amid the country’s mounting isolation, multiplying sanctions and economic problems. The authors have identified the sources of an obvious mythologization of public space as the alienation of citizens from real politics and their inertia, as well as the specifics of the binary structure of consciousness that is rooted in the past. In their minds, people separate politics from the economy, and are more concerned about the country’s greatness and might than about the standards of living. No wonder that the citizens of Russia are proud of the country’s armed forces, space exploration, heroic history and sport achievements and are pushing mundane issues aside. As could be expected, political elites are associated with the country’s might, its international status, etc. Ideological preferences and adherence to different schools produced several debatable opinions about the role of the political elites. So far, it is more or less commonly believed that they play a negative or even a destructive role. To arrive at an unbiased conclusion, we have analyzed their resource base, algorithms of their activities, the political and governing functions and related strategies. We have concluded the article with the recommendations on lowering the level of mythologization of public consciousness by implementing at least some elements of civil society. © 2018, CA and CC Press AB.

AB  - This study was aimed at determining perception and awareness levels about climate change in three city centers located in the West Mediterranean Region of Turkey and identified differences in public perceptions and knowledge about regional climate change. The study utilized a questionnaire method to obtain data. The results found that approximately half of the participants had inadequate climate change knowledge. In particular, knowledge levels regarding climate change adaptation were comparatively low. Women were more concerned about climate changed compared to men. Additionally, primary and high school graduates and married individuals were also more concerned. Age and income were not determining variables. There were no significant differences in terms of gender, age, income and educational status apart from marital status as to whether or not adaptation to climate change will be achieved. There are varying levels of awareness among the public regarding climate change, and thus it is especially important to organize outreach programs supported by media to increase climate change adaptation knowledge levels. Institutions need to improve their ability to promote public awareness and knowledge about climate change in order to reach a larger proportion of the public. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - In February 2010, a captive killer whale (Orcinus orca), or orca, killed his trainer at SeaWorld Florida. A cascade of events followed, including successful federal enforcement action against Sea- World for employee safety violations. In 2012 and 2015, nonfiction books about SeaWorld's history with orcas were published; however, the 2013 documentary Blackfish has done the most to raise public awareness of captive orca welfare and trainer safety. It spawned a massive social media response, leading to the so-called "Blackfish Effect." SeaWorld's visitor numbers declined, business partners ended their relationships, and stock price plummeted. In 2012, Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta applied for a permit to import 18 wild-caught beluga whales from Russia; the permit was denied in 2013, the first time a public display permit had ever been denied in the history of the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 2014 and 2016, the California legislature considered bills phasing out captive orca exhibits in the state; the 2016 bill passed and became law in January 2017. In November 2015, a similar bill was introduced (and reintroduced in March 2017) in the US House of Representatives. In March 2016 SeaWorld announced it would end its orca breeding program company-wide and in January 2018 the Vancouver Aquarium announced it would no longer display cetaceans. Shifts in public perception of captive cetacean display strongly suggest policy makers should reconsider the legislative and regulatory status quo. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.

AB  - China’s growing assertiveness in dealing with maritime territorial disputes has significant ramifications for regional peace and stability. Chinese government has been increasingly responsive to public opinion when making foreign policy. Media in China may play an important role in guiding public opinion and influencing the direction of China’ foreign policy. This study uses the survey method to compare the effect of differential media exposure on Chinese college students’ attitudes toward China’s maritime claims and disputes in the South and East China Seas. We find that intentional news exposure on China’s state media, commercial media, and online news outlets exerts no effect on Chinese college students’ attitudes toward China’s foreign policy. By contrast, incidental news exposure on WeChat (a relationship-oriented social media network) plays a larger role in increasing Chinese college students’ support for the forceful resolution of maritime disputes than Weibo (a news media site), when students communicate in a homogeneous environment. Moreover, cross-cutting exposure on Weibo is conducive to the development of moderate, reasoned, and open-minded opinions on China’s foreign relations, but students cannot reap the same benefits of cross-cutting exposure on WeChat. These findings support both the selective exposure hypothesis (intentional exposure) and the large media effect model (incidental exposure). We contribute to the literature by emphasizing the importance of differentiating media exposure mode, media content, and the relationship structure of social media when studying media effects on public opinion formation. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - With the development of wireless network technology and a surge in the number of mobile phone users, the self-media network public opinion that is taking WeChat, micro-blog and other new media as the platform gradually has replaced the traditional media public opinion and has become dominant force in the field of public opinion at the same time, it has had an important influence on social stability. Based on this, in order to solve practical problems such as nonlinearity and high dimensionality of sample data in early warning evaluation of self-media network public opinion, we use cultural gene algorithm to determine the optimum projection direction and establishes a projection pursuit model of evaluation of self-media network public opinion which is based on cultural gene algorithm. Simultaneously, we apply the above model to "The event of Gansu, Lanzhou excessive benzene content in tap water" in 2014 and carries out the empirical researches. The empirical researches show that the projection pursuit model which is based on cultural genetic algorithm can effectively solve practical difficulties such as nonlinearity and high dimension of sample data, and it has good practicability. © 2018 Politechnica University of Bucharest.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Globalization, international migration and food promotion via media platforms have led to increased consumption of ethnic food. The main aim of the research is to explore the relation between attitudes and behaviour in the ethnic food consumption. An on-line survey was conducted on a sample of 230 respondents. Most respondents consume ethnic food, mostly on a weekly basis, at home and in restaurants. The largest share of respondents has neutral attitudes towards ethnic food. Respondents with positive attitudes towards ethnic food consume ethnic food more often at home, those with neutral attitudes consume such food in restaurants, while respondents who have negative attitudes about ethnic food consume ethnic food mostly at friend’s. The respondents with positive attitudes towards ethnic food give higher importance to all ethnic food attributes. Results of this research can serve producers and distributors of ethnic foods to better suit the demands of modern consumers. © 2018, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

AB  - Information is the first step to solutions towards awareness of the need for improved water management. Recognising the right information to be communicated well to the community and the public is invaluable to change behaviour and attitude for better and sustainable water quality and supply. The paper aims to develop a water communication framework that focuses on the prioritised information and the relevant communication methods that are needed to raise water information awareness among the community. The findings reveal the prioritised information that include the level of awareness, the water quality and quantity as well as the communication and information. Public television appears as one major source of information most preferred prior to internet sources. These findings had contributed to the development of the water communication framework which was adopted for a water carnival held to educate and promote water information awareness to the community.

AB  - This study aims at exploring the reasons that drive many Facebookers to share negative posts on Facebook, with a special focus on their gender and age. It also aims at identifying the negative attitudes and feelings that negative Facebook posts might evoke in Facebookers. Thus, a mixed-methods approach was adopted employing both a five-point agreement Likert scale questionnaire and semi-structured interviews which were conducted with 40 participants. Based on the participants' responses, the results show that many Facebookers write posts to satisfy different needs including receiving compliments and attention, sharing daily updates, showing off, and deliberately teasing others, all of which have been found to trigger feelings of jealousy, hatred, annoyance, demotivation, inferiority, and sadness. The study concludes with recommendations for further research. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The premise behind this paper is that, in order to reach social consensus on climate change, there must be consensus on the media first. This research study focuses on the search for consensus values in the editorial discourses of five proven influential broadsheet newspapers in their context and internationally, such as The Guardian, Le Monde, El País, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and The New York Times. These newspapers have published 535 opinion editorials on climate change over a 14-year period: from the Kyoto Summit in 1997 to the Durban Climate Change Conference in 2011. The methodology involves both frames and quantitative analyses. This research aims to detect the main actors and factors that influence editorial discourse, as politics and economic sources are most likely to be predominant (H1), and draw lines of possible consensus among the different media analysed (H2). The analysis shows how the political and economic connotations in editorial discourses were sometimes to the detriment of scientific and expert discourse, and the differences among countries. However, the research also underscores essential positions in common, such as the acceptance of climate change and its anthropogenic origin, or the criticism of the states’ inability to reach joint solutions to the problem. © 2018 Communication & Society.

AB  - Besides the traditional methods of targeting customers, social media presents its own set of opportunities. While companies look for a simple way with a large number of responses, social media platforms like Twitter can allow them to do just that. For example, by creating a hashtag and prompting followers to tweet their answers to some question they can quickly get a large number of answers about a question while simultaneously engaging their customers. Additionally, consumers share their opinions about services and products in public and with their social circles. This valuable data can be used to support business decisions. However, it is huge amounts of unstructured data that is difficult to extract meaningful information out of them. Social Media Analytics is the field which makes insights out of social media data and analyzes its sentiment rather than just reading and counting text. In this article, we used Twitter data to get insight from public opinion hidden in data. The support vector machine algorithm is used to classify sentiment of tweets whether it is positive or negative and the unigram applied as a feature extraction method. The experiments were conducted using large set of training dataset and the algorithm achieved high accuracy around 87%. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.

AB  - Exponential growth in mobile technology and mini computing devices has led to a massive increment in social media users, who are continuously posting their views and comments about certain products and services, which are in their use. These views and comments can be extremely beneficial for the companies which are interested to know about the public opinion regarding their offered products or services. This type of public opinion otherwise can be obtained via questionnaires and surveys, which is no doubt a difficult and complex task. So, the valuable information in the form of comments and posts from micro-blogging sites can be used by the companies to eliminate the flaws and to improve the products or services according to customer needs. However, extracting a general opinion out of a staggering number of users' comments manually cannot be feasible. A solution to this is to use an automatic method for sentiment mining. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the widely used classification techniques for polarity detection from textual data. This study proposes a technique to tune the SVM performance by using grid search method for sentiment analysis. In this paper, three datasets are used for the experiment and performance of proposed technique is evaluated using three information retrieval metrics: precision, recall and f-measure. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.

AB  - Nowadays the problem of introduction of resort fees in the territory of the Russian Federation is most acute and relevant. Therefore, this article is devoted to theoretical and practical issues of charging a resort fee, which has been introduced on a pilot basis from January 1, 2018 in four Russian regions. The authors have studied and systematized the results of public opinion polls on the introduction of resort fees in Russia, and analyzed the Russians' attitude towards the initiative. The main methods of studying the problem were system and retrospective analysis, expert assessments and sociological measurement based on the Internet questionnaire survey and opinion polls. In the course of the research a special attention was given to study the practices of implementing resort fees in foreign countries. The authors, basing themselves on the analysis of Russian and international experience, adduce arguments for and against the collection of resort fees. The article also substantiates existing approaches of media promotion of social and civil initiatives used in the field of tourism and resort policy. © 2018.

AB  - Making the work of security organizations known to school children is a means of mitigating feelings of insecurity provoked by the diffusion of information on terrorist attacks in communications media and through social media. Whilst there is a longer tradition of projects to educate school children on the police and the armed forces, no comparable projects have been found on the intelligence services. With the objective of filling this gap, the authors designed and produced two animated educational videos for Spanish school children on the Spanish intelligence service: The National Intelligence Center (CNI). In this paper, the impact of the videos is measured in relation to the knowledge, the stereotypes, and the attitudes of school children towards the CNI. To do so, two questionnaires were administered to 1,092 school children aged 8 and 12, before and after viewing the videos. The results of the questionnaire prior to screening the videos showed that the school children held no knowledge of the intelligence services, and expressed highly developed stereotypes, and moderately negative attitudes towards them. Student-t tests for related samples were used to confirm the responses, on the basis of which it was found that the videos modified both knowledge and stereotyping, as well as attitudes towards the CNI. Specifically, following the screenings the knowledge of the school children improved, stereotyping diminished, and positive attitudes increased. © 2018, Grupo Comunicar Ediciones.

AB  - In exploring the role of mediated noise in socio-political discourse, this paper discusses how noise as an element of the communication model with interruption as its fixed meaning needs reconsideration. Against the backdrop of criticism by the media critics and analysts about high decibel debates in broadcast media, this paper critically analyses the centrality of mediated noise in the political and public discourse in India. Noise, it argues, has emerged as a political device and a discursive weapon employed by the dominant stakeholders, capable of steering discourse and manipulating the public opinion that diverts attention from the pressing issues and emphasizes the political wrangling between the stakeholders while disrupting the discursive process. It underscores how dominant groups produce, manage, and mediate noise as a part of their discursive strategy that simulates constructed sincerity and its unquestionable existence. It is shown that meticulously crafted and stage-managed debate panels in broadcast media are aimed at creating a visual spectacle and are driven by commercial and political interests rather than the concern for informed discourse and debate. Noise, in this sense, is a sound that persuasively refers to its significance, as it creates a realm of discursive ambiguity and undermines a discursive process and its subsequent knowledge. Thus, noise is argued to be a form of discursive violence that manifests in the form of voices that distort the facts, dismiss, or deride a narrative, suppress opposing viewpoints, negate the possibility of discussion, and sabotage opportunities for discourse by creating an atmosphere of fear and violence. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Objective. To analyze the consensus and dissent of Catholics youths about HIV/AIDS prevention from their representations about sexuality. Methods. This is a quantitative and qualitative research based on the Theory of Social Representations carried out with 84 Catholics youths who answered online to the Free Word Association Test on Facebook and three questions about the influence of Catholic doctrine on the free exercise of sexuality and the adoption of practice safe sex. The techniques of Factorial Analysis of Correspondence and Semantic Content were used. Results. On sexuality, only the young women with access to higher education represented the term as a free practice that should not lead to guilt. There was a consensus on chastity, virginity, and sex within marriage as effective means of HIV prevention. It is also representational consensus of the young people that sexual practice is pleasurable, however, condemned by the church, and that AIDS is a preventable disease. Social representations have revealed dissent between men and women, while they consider that the exercise of sexuality should be restricted to marriage, they advocate sexual freedom. As for AIDS, they represent that the syndrome stems from prejudice, and they consider that vulnerability favors contagion. Conclusion. In the consensuses among the young people studied, there are sexist prejudices and stereotypes that influence HIV/AIDS prevention actions. Therefore, health professionals, especially those of Nursing should propose actions aimed at this age group in educational activities about the adoption of preventive practices on safe sex, always considering the social representations around the subject. © 2018, Facultad de Enfermeria de la Universidad de Antioquia.

AB  - The issues surrounding the importance and protection of archaeological heritage became topical in Latvia in 2012 with the amendments to the law 'On Protection of Cultural Monuments' and they still have not lost their relevance. Discussions in the media that arose before and after the amendments to the law attracted a great deal of public interest towards archaeology, at the same time surfaced a lack of understanding of the work of archaeologists, of archaeological processes, research methods and results. It also points to the need for establishing standards on ethics for archaeologists in the country. © 2018 Council for British Archaeology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in a low-/middle income country such as South Africa, where most patients are managed in the public health sector with limited resources. Poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unhealthy practices are common, highlighting the need for healthcare providers to adapt health communication strategies appropriately. The current study aimed to develop a health dialogue model by applying a multiple-methods design informed by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council's guidelines for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Guided by this framework, four separate but inter-related studies were conducted to establish the active components of health dialogue. Participants included patients with type 2 diabetes from a variety of public healthcare settings and healthcare providers who provide services to them. The findings from the four primary studies were then synthesised at a two-day workshop during which three focus areas emerged, including the community, the patient and the healthcare provider. Community awareness could be raised by delivering key messages in the native tongue of patients through combinations of traditional folk media such as drama and storytelling in the waiting rooms of health centres. Self-management of patients could be promoted by active participation of patients in tailored health communication using peer support and the use of mobile health devices. Finally, training platforms for healthcare providers should include in-service training through interactive workshops. Our culturally sensitive health dialogue model has the potential to improve adherence to treatment, leading to greater satisfaction and consequently improved health outcomes. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on the determinants of satisfaction with municipal services by local inhabitants in Lithuania. Specifically, the paper seeks to disclose the relations between the importance that citizens attribute to the objectives of a municipality, satisfaction with services, the perception of quality of life and socio-demographic characteristics of local inhabitants. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical assumptions were tested using the quantitative data of public opinion survey in Lithuania conducted in 2016. The representative sample (n=1,006) consisting respondents over the age of 18 years old was collected using the personal interview method in households from different municipalities. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to specify the constructs of the model. The structural equation modeling allowed revealing the relations between the importance of municipal objectives, satisfaction with services and infrastructure, the perception of quality of life and socio-demographic characteristics of citizens. Findings: The findings indicate that there is a weak positive relation among the importance of municipal objectives and satisfaction with municipal services and infrastructure in case of Lithuania. There is a medium positive relation between satisfaction with services and infrastructure and perception of quality of life. The authors find that citizens living in cities attribute higher importance to the objectives of a municipality. The expectations increase within the age. The authors also find that residents living in cities are less satisfied (comparing to citizens living in towns and rural areas) with municipal services. The results indicate that citizens working in the private sector are less satisfied (comparing to unemployed citizens) with municipal services. The authors also find that such variables as education, age and income has a positive influence on the perception of quality of life. Research limitations/implications: Further research may specify the connection between the importance of municipal objectives, satisfaction with services, quality of life and socio-demographic characteristics more precisely. Specifically, the construct of the importance of municipal objectives was explained best as one factor due to the selection of objectives constituting the construct in the questionnaire. More precise measurement of the construct may reveal the agenda pursued by citizens and its relation to the socio-demographic factors. Practical implications: The research reveals that satisfaction with municipal services and infrastructure is an important predictor of perceived quality of life for Lithuanians citizens on the local level. It sends an important signal to policymakers indicating that citizens that are living in cities, working in private sector feel less satisfied compared to other groups of inhabitants in rural areas. It also provides evidence that different profiles of socio-demographic characteristics should also be considered more carefully while designing responsive service provision systems in municipalities. Originality/value: The paper provides a theoretical and methodological perspective that relates importance of municipal objectives, satisfaction with municipal services, infrastructure and perceived quality of life of local inhabitants. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of socio-demographic characteristics of for municipal agenda and design of provision of public services. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Intelligent information process such as opinion mining and sentiment analysis on social media remains an ongoing challenge, and it is also useful in public opinion surveillance. Analysing micro-blog posts is often hampered by their very brief content as well as the use of misspelled or abbreviated words. This paper focuses on personality modelling and sentiment analysis on Chinese micro-blog posts. Social media data pre-processing, to identify named entities and word sense disambiguation, is essential. The proposed pre-processing includes the double-array trie based segmentation and viterbi based word sense disambiguation, together with the co-occurrence probability based processing of unknown words. The personality modelling procedure vectorises micro-blog posts into high dimension eigenvectors. As for the sentiment analysis, this paper proposes the multi-convolutional neural method to solve the sentiment tendency determination problem. The experimental results show the feasibility of the approach, and existing problems and future works are also present in the end. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Aim. The aim of this study was to investigate the public perception of mentally ill people, stigma of the mentally ill and distance towards them in Poland. Method. The study group was composed of 1,309 respondents who were interviewed using an authors’ own survey, which was spread with the use of online media. Results. The results indicate a high level of stigma of psychiatric patients in the subjective assessment of their appearance, intellect as well as respondents’ sense of superiority over the patients. The stigma of a psychiatric patient is also resolutely demonstrated in the economic aspect, which results from respondents’ unwillingness to employ, or even work with people affected by a disorder from the mental illness group. Conclusions. Undoubtedly, the fight against the phenomenon of stigma and discrimination against people affected by mental health problems is becoming one of the priorities in the field of mental health. © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to examine the early aftermath of Britain’s Referendum to leave the European Union. The study addresses three areas: British public opinion and sentiment with regard to Brexit, Britain’s economy and outlook, and migration. Design/methodology/approach: The study is exploratory in nature, examining data and information available in a variety of public sources that include government statistics, media reports and scholarly research findings. Findings: Analysis of published data and research studies suggest growing disenchantment among the public with regard to Brexit and its consequences, economic and cultural influences on the Referendum, economic uncertainty and potential deterioration, and opposition to and moderation in migration. Research limitations/implications: The study has not generated original survey data about economic and demographic variables that would make possible statistical analysis of hypothesis. Originality/value: Recent political developments in developed Western societies point to a rise in popular dismay with globalization, regional integration and multiculturalism. The present study explores and identifies some of the reasons for the trend and the potential consequences to breaking up cross-national alliances as they pertain to the United Kingdom in particular. Similar studies may alert policy makers to the causes and potential economic and political consequences of de-globalization. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Public votes and referendums on the rights of marginalized communities are utilized in 27 states and occur with some regularity. However, research has only recently begun to examine the psychological consequences of these voter referendums for members of stigmatized groups, and a number of important questions remain regarding the internal validity and generalizability of the existing evidence. The current study advances this literature by combining survey data from a large probability-based sample conducted in 2012 [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgender (LGBT) n = 939; non-LGBT n = 31,067] with media market ad-buy data in states where marriage equality was on the ballot. Television media markets cross state boundaries, ensuring that there was an unintended group of people in 12 states who were exposed to the same-sex marriage discourse but who did not live in states with the voter referendum (“media market spillovers”). We take advantage of this unique data structure by comparing LGBT people in the media market spillovers to those residing in the same state but in nonspillover markets with no ad exposure. LGBT people are emotionally affected by these campaigns, and non-LGBT people are unaffected. LGBT people in markets with a cumulative total of 400 ads have a 34.0% greater probability of reporting stress than LGBT people not exposed to ads. Additionally, while the negative ads evoked sadness, positive ads evoked enjoyment and happiness. Thus, public votes on minority rights represent both a source of minority stress and resilience. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This article aims to identify how digital public opinion was articulated on Twitter during the visit of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico City in 2016 by invitation from the Mexican government, which was preceded by the threat to construct a border wall that Mexico would pay for. Using a mixed methodology made up of computational methods such as data mining and social network analysis combined with content analysis, the authors identify conversational patterns and the structures of the networks formed, beginning with this event involving the foreign policy of both countries that share a long border. The authors study the digital media practices and emotional frameworks these social network users employed to involve themselves in the controversial visit, marked by complex political, cultural and historical relations. The analysis of 352,203 tweets in two languages (English and Spanish), those most used in the conversations, opened the door to an understanding as to how transnational public opinion is articulated in connective actions detonated by newsworthy events in distinct cultural contexts, as well as the emotional frameworks that permeated the conversation, whose palpable differences show that Twitter is not a homogeneous universe, but rather a set of universes codetermined by sociocultural context. © ISSN: 1134-3478.

AB  - Purpose: Due to the significant rise in the use of social media in recent years, the purpose of this paper is to investigate who, how and why participates in creating content at political social networking websites utilising a content analysis of posts and comments published on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia. It shows consequences of a transition from traditional to social media campaigns and the effectiveness of social media at activating and moving public opinion during the general election campaign. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a data collection through a social media website, a classification of data set items by content attributes and a statistical analysis of the classified data. Findings: Building on an empirical data set from Croatia, this study reveals that different political parties implement different election campaign strategies on social media to influence citizens who, consequently, respond differently to each of them. The results indicate that political messages with positive emotions evocate positive response from citizens, while neutral content is more likely to invoke negative comments and criticism, and support to the opponent. Another implication of the results is that two-way and tolerant communication of political actors increases citizen engagement, whereas unidirectional communication decreases it. Originality/value: This paper provides an original insight into qualitative content analysis of posts and user comments published on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - While the Internet and multimedia applications have made it easy to produce and spread media, they have also made it possible to distribute fake news to masses. With over 200 million active users in India and growing, WhatsApp’s reach and features make it a top choice to spread fake news. This not only influences public opinion in India but has also sometimes created panic and incited to violence. This paper looks into how political propaganda is peddled through the WhatsApp in the form of 'news' (fake news). It also explores what makes the WhatsApp such a powerful application in Indian context, how do people use it and how existing laws in India make it difficult to trace the origin of the fake news. © Media Watch.

AB  - Recent interest in Arab child audiences is mostly related to the penetration of digital media to the Arab region and the rise of discourses on 'counterterrorism', Islamic radicalization and Islamophobia. More often than not, audience-focused inquiry has adopted, as a starting point, the uniform default category of 'Arab/Muslim'. As these analytical categories are conflated, the implications of such teleological epistemologies cannot be missed. In this article, I dislocate these ontological and epistemological assumptions about Arab child audiences by refocusing the inquiry on children's own processes of meaning-making amid their negotiations of socioeconomic, political, migratory and media ecologies. This inquiry, conducted between 2013 and 2015, explores these spaces by zooming into the findings of ethnographic research and playful interventions with two Syrian and Palestinian children living in the two contrastive migratory settings of Beirut and London. This micro-analysis questions dominant understandings of Arab childhood and screen media use today, and discusses the potential for adopting a multifaceted approach to the inquiry. © Copyright 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - The authors have offered comparative sociological analysis of the transfor-mations underway in Chechen socie-ty in the context of an analysis of institutional confidence and trust. Social reality and political processes are treated as an object of studies, while the subject of studies and their objective are the comparative analysis of the evolution of public opinion about the structures of power and administration in the Chechen Republic, as well as the dynamics of the chosen development course. The authors relied on the materials of sociological polls conducted by the North Ossetia Center for Social Studies of the Institute of Socio-Political Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Department of Sociological Studies of SOIGSI VNTs, Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Government of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania in May-June 2003 within the project Chechnia in the Socio-Cultural Space of the Russian Federation: Ethnosociological Analysis and joint studies carried out by the North Ossetia Center for Social Studies and the Department of Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology, Chechen State Pedagogical University, in May-June 2017. The research objectives postulated the following tasks: (1) to find out how the respondents in the Chechen Republic assess the state of affairs in Russia; (2) to analyze the degree of popular confidence and trust in the structures of power and administration, in religious figures and the media. In their studies the authors relied on the quantitative questionnaire method. © 2018, CA and CC Press AB. All rights reserved.

AB  - The numerous adaptations of Pride and Prejudice or Jane Eyre, reputed examples of canonical or highbrow romance, attest to the long-lasting appeal that romance novels have had for the world of television and cinema. Academic criticism has paid duly attention to these transpositions although, comparatively speaking, it has failed to assess the audiovisual adaptations of other successful forms of romance, closer to mass culture. This is a remarkable omission, because TV and film transpositions have played a significant role in the genre’s development in the last few years. Through a case study of Nicholas Sparks’ novels, E.L. James’s Fifty Shades trilogy and Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander series, as well as their corresponding adaptations, this paper analyses the impact that these texts have had on mass-market romance fiction and its community. Usually tagged as ‘romance’ stories, these productions have raised the genre’s popularity to unprecedented levels, but this in turn has been followed by a heated debate among readers over the very essence of the romance novel. Thus, the genre is now at a pivotal stage in its development, given that the great market success of Sparks, James’ and Gabaldon’s adaptations have rediscovered and transformed the world of romance. © 2018, Sociedad Espanola de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular.

AB  - The exponential growth of the online purchases and a cyber war in the digital space among the service providers for grabbing the lion’s share in the online space requires an understanding of the effect of demographic features on the online purchase behaviour of the travellers. Such valuable information will help the service providers to understand and eventually segment their markets and implement effective marketing instruments. The empirical study was carried out amongst 450 travelers who booked their travel online through Online Travel Portals in Delhi National Capital Region out of which 400 questionnaires were found to be complete in all respects and can be used for data analysis. The data was collected from the departure lounge of Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. The study investigates the traveler`s attitude towards online purchase of travel products and investigates the factors influencing the online purchase of travel products by the travelers. The findings denote that income and age group influence the online purchase attitude of travellers. It also identifies whether a gap existed between expectation and satisfaction of online purchase of travel products using Online Travel Portals in Delhi National Capital Region. The largest positive gap (positive disconfirmation) came from reliability in financial transactions, pertinent information, flexible packages and location while completeness in terms of services, integration on social media, usefulness, accuracy, flexible payment, information quality had a negative gap (negative disconfirmation) between the higher level of importance and lower levels of satisfaction. No significant mean differences were observed between expectations and experiences of proficient Grievance redressal system and timeliness in refund. © 2018 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

AB  - Within the last decade, hashtag-based publics and various aspects of the discussions produced by them have created a rapidly growing field of interdisciplinary research linking public opinion and public sphere studies to social network analysis. Despite this growth, there is still scarce evidence that ‘Habermas is on Twitter’, due to the affective and non-dialogue nature of expression in social networks, seemingly low capacity of ad hoc discussions to create ‘opinion crossroads’, and language boundaries that prevent, i. a., cross-cultural participation of users in a given discussion and, thus, do not let the global public sphere develop. Having this in mind, we explore the spatial dimension of two affective hashtag-based publics with mutually exclusive value-loaded positions — #JeSuisCharlie and #JeNeSuisPasCharlie. We look at language distribution within the tweet collections and the expansion of the hashtagged discussion to the languages other than French. To trace the discussion outbursts, we use automated web crawling, manual coding of tweet collections, and web graph reconstruction and visual analysis. Our results suggest that, despite the differences in the volume of expression, the language structure of both hashtags was quite similar and formed echo chambers on the level of a hashtag as well as on sub-levels. Also, we see that bilingual but not multilingual users bridge the sub-level echo chambers. We argue that global compassion publics not only lift up the idea of echo chambers to a new level (since ‘national’ language-based echo chambers clearly show up on the discussion graphs) but also revive the concept of spiral of silence.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to report on the experiences, benefits, and challenges of patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) from a publicly funded early awareness and alert (EAA) system in the United Kingdom. Methods: Using email, telephone, a Web site portal, Twitter and focus groups, patients and the public were involved and engaged in the recognized stages of an EAA system: identification, filtration, prioritization, early assessment, and dissemination. Results: Approaches for PPIE were successfully integrated into all aspects of the National Institute for Health Research Horizon Scanning Research and Intelligence Centre's EAA system. Input into identification activities was not as beneficial as involvement in prioritization and early assessment. Patients gave useful insight into the Centre's Web site and engaging patients using Twitter has enabled the Centre to disseminate outputs to a wider audience. Conclusions: EAA systems should consider involving and engaging with patients and the public in identification, prioritization, and assessment of emerging health technologies where practicable. Further research is required to examine the value and impact of PPIE in EAA activities and in the early development of health technologies. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2018.

AB  - This article investigates media coverage of 19th and early 20th century river activism and its effect on federal policy to control the Mississippi River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ “levees-only” policy—which joined disparate navigation and flood control interests—is largely blamed for the Great Flood of 1927, called the largest peacetime disaster in American history. River activists organized annual conventions, and later, professional lobbies organized media campaigns up and down the Mississippi River to sway public opinion and pressure Congress to fund flood control and river navigation projects. Annual river conventions drew thousands of delegates such as plantation owners, shippers, bankers, chambers of commerce, governors, congressmen, mayors and cabinet members with interests on the Mississippi River. Public pressure on Congress successfully captured millions of federal dollars to protect property, drain swamps for development, subsidize local levee districts and influence river policy. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - Social network has become the main communication platform for public emergencies, and it has also made the public opinion influence spread more widely. How to effectively obtain public opinions from it to guide the healthy development of the society is an important issue that the government and other functional departments are concerned about. However, the interaction and evolution mechanism between the subject and the environment in the public opinion propagation is complicated, and the public and media attention and reaction to the incident are closely linked with the progress of the incident disposal. And public mining corpus has some shortcomings in the distribution of emotional classification. Only the timely update of artificial rules and emotional dictionary resources, it can handle new text data well. In fact, from the perspective of public opinion propagation, this paper built the network matrix between Internet users through the forwarding relationship, and used the social network analysis method and the emotion mining analysis technology to study the interaction and evolution mechanism between the subject and the environment in the public opinion propagation, and it studied the role of users in the emotional propagation of social networks. This paper proposed a sentiment analysis method on the micro-blog platform, which expanded the emotional dictionary and took sentence and emoticon and sentence patterns into account, which improved the accuracy of positive and negative classifications and emotional polarity analysis of the micro-blog. © 2018 CC BY-NC.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate food taste, smell, and characteristics from consumers' online reviews. Several studies in food sensory evaluation have been presented for consumer acceptance. However, these studies need taste descriptive word lexicon, and they are not suitable for analyzing large number of evaluators to predict consumer acceptance. In this paper, an automated text analysis method for food evaluation is presented to analyze and compare recently introduced two jjampong ramen types (mixed seafood noodles). To avoid building a sensory word lexicon, consumers' reviews are collected from SNS. Then, by training word embedding model with acquired reviews, words in the large amount of review text are converted into vectors. Based on these words represented as vectors, inference is performed to evaluate taste and smell of two jjampong ramen types. Finally, the reliability and merits of the proposed food evaluation method are confirmed by a comparison with the results from an actual consumer preference taste evaluation. © 2018 Augustine Yongwhi Kim et al.

AB  - Few academics who become public intellectuals have the opportunity to use their research findings to influence and direct public opinion. Sherry Turkle is a public intellectual whose work as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor of the social studies of science and technology is critically considered in this exploration of a single public presentation based on her 2015 book Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in the Digital Age. Drawing deeply on subjective observations, Turkle performs public ethnography, using her knowledge and practice as a psychologist to create what she has called "computer psychotherapy." This type of ethnographic practice operates within an agent-egoist model of performativity, which Turkle uses to establish her opposition to student use of laptops and social media in classrooms. Arguing in favor of and thereby privileging classroom conversation, Turkle misses the challenge of rendering creative pedagogical options for millennials in the context of their enriched, always-on digital lives. As a public intellectual, she fails to assist the public and educators explore collective and progressive options to technology within emerging forms of pedagogy. © 2018 (Marcus Breen).

AB  - Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is a major social and public health problem of global proportions. Public attitudes toward IPVAW shape the social environment in which such violence takes place, and attitudes of acceptability of IPVAW are considered a risk factor to actual IPVAW. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a scale measuring acceptability of IPVAW (A-IPVAW). To this end, a sample of 1,800 respondents was recruited via social media. A second sample of 50 IPVAW offenders was used for concurrent validity analyses. Following a cross-validation approach and using item response theory analyses, we found that the latent structure of the scale was one-dimensional and very informative for high and very high levels of acceptability of IPVAW. Regarding criterion-related validity, we found that (a) our measure was related to perceived severity of IPVAW and ambivalent sexism, (b) men showed higher levels of acceptability than women, and (c) IPVAW offenders reported higher levels of acceptability than men from the general population. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the A-IPVAW is a reliable and valid instrument to assess acceptability of IPVAW. © 2018 Colegio Oficial de Psicólogos de Madrid.

AB  - The media create frames to transmit information to the public, and the frames can have varying effects on public opinion depending on how they combine with people's values and deep-seated cultural narratives. This study examines the effects of media frames and values on people's choice of resolution of conflict. The results show that neither values nor exposure to frames are associated with outcome. Participants overwhelmingly chose the humanitarian intervention option regardless of frame exposure and even in contrast to their own political values, demonstrating the influence of the mainstream media's dominant, humanitarian interventionist frame on public opinion. © 2018 (Jovan Milojevich and Peter Beattie).

AB  - Previous research revealed that if individuals personally experience an unusual weather event as a result of global warming (vs no personal experience), they may hold higher belief certainty that global warming is happening and hence develop more favorable attitudes toward mitigation actions. However, much of the previous research focused on self-reported personal experience and global warming beliefs using cross-sectional surveys; reverse causality is thus possible. Based on weather records and survey data, the present research examined whether actual weather events can influence one's perceptions of unusual weather and belief certainty. Severe Typhoon Fitow 2013, but not hot summer temperatures, directly predicted the Chinese perceived experience of unusual weather and indirectly predicted their belief certainty and attitudes toward mitigation behavior. However, the effects were relatively small. Possible explanations and implications for environmental education are discussed. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - To what extent do partisan media sources shape public opinion? On its face, it would appear that the impact of partisan media is limited, given that it attracts a relatively small audience. We argue, however, that its influence may extend beyond its direct audience via a two-step communication flow. Specifically, those who watch and are impacted by partisan media outlets talk to and persuade others who did not watch. We present experimental results that demonstrate this process. We therefore show that previous studies may have significantly underestimated the effect of these outlets. We also illustrate that how the two-step communication flow works is contingent upon the precise composition of the discussion group (e.g., is it consistent of all fellow partisans or a mix of partisans?). We conclude by highlighting what our results imply about the study of media, preference formation, and partisan polarization. ©2017, Midwest Political Science Association

AB  - Background: In the recent years, social networking sites (SNSs, also called social media) have been adopted in organ donation campaigns, and recruiting opinion leaders for such campaigns has been found effective in promoting behavioral changes. Objective: The aim of this paper was to focus on the dissemination of organ donation tweets on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and to examine the opinion leadership in the retweet network of popular organ donation messages using social network analysis. It also aimed to investigate how personal and social attributes contribute to a user's opinion leadership on the topic of organ donation. Methods: All messages about organ donation posted on Weibo from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 were extracted using Python Web crawler. A retweet network with 505,047 nodes and 545,312 edges of the popular messages (n=206) was constructed and analyzed. The local and global opinion leaderships were measured using network metrics, and the roles of personal attributes, professional knowledge, and social positions in obtaining the opinion leadership were examined using general linear model. Results: The findings revealed that personal attributes, professional knowledge, and social positions predicted individual's local opinion leadership in the retweet network of popular organ donation messages. Alternatively, personal attributes and social positions, but not professional knowledge, were significantly associated with global opinion leadership. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that health campaign designers may recruit peer leaders in SNS organ donation promotions to facilitate information sharing among the target audience. Users who are unverified, active, well connected, and experienced with information and communications technology (ICT) will accelerate the sharing of organ donation messages in the global environment. Medical professionals such as organ transplant surgeons who can wield a great amount of influence on their direct connections could also effectively participate in promoting organ donation on social media.

AB  - Introduction Generating a nationally representative sample in low and middle income countries typically requires resource-intensive household level sampling with door-to-door data collection. High mobile phone penetration rates in developing countries provide new opportunities for alternative sampling and data collection methods, but there is limited information about response rates and sample biases in coverage and nonresponse using these methods. We utilized data from an interactive voice response, random-digit dial, national mobile phone survey in Ghana to calculate standardized response rates and assess representativeness of the obtained sample. Materials and methods The survey methodology was piloted in two rounds of data collection. The final survey included 18 demographic, media exposure, and health behavior questions. Call outcomes and response rates were calculated according to the American Association of Public Opinion Research guidelines. Sample characteristics, productivity, and costs per interview were calculated. Representativeness was assessed by comparing data to the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey and the National Population and Housing Census. Results The survey was fielded during a 27-day period in February-March 2017. There were 9,469 completed interviews and 3,547 partial interviews. Response, cooperation, refusal, and contact rates were 31%, 81%, 7%, and 39% respectively. Twenty-three calls were dialed to produce an eligible contact: nonresponse was substantial due to the automated calling system and dialing of many unassigned or non-working numbers. Younger, urban, better educated, and male respondents were overrepresented in the sample. Conclusions The innovative mobile phone data collection methodology yielded a large sample in a relatively short period. Response rates were comparable to other surveys, although substantial coverage bias resulted from fewer women, rural, and older residents completing the mobile phone survey in comparison to household surveys. Random digit dialing of mobile phones offers promise for future data collection in Ghana and may be suitable for other developing countries. © 2018 L’Engle et al.

AB  - Weight bias is a widespread form of prejudice that leads to the stigmatization of individuals who are perceived to have excess weight. Several psychological theories have been used to explain weight bias and to understand its negative impact on the mental and physical health of individuals with overweight and obesity. Top-down approaches are needed to reduce weight stigma and its adverse health consequences at the population-level. Potential targets for stigma-reduction policies include weight-based discrimination in the workplace, bullying and discrimination in educational settings, stigma in health care, and stereotypical media portrayals. These proposed policies have strong support from the public and stakeholders and, with further implementation and evaluation, may serve as promising structural interventions for addressing societal weight stigma. © 2018 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Grand Lake St. Marys watershed has drawn attention over the past decade as water quality issues resulting from nutrient loading have come to the forefront of public opinion, political concern, and scientific study. The objective of this study was to assess long-term changes in water quality (nutrient and sediment concentrations) following the distressed watershed rules package instituted in 2011. Since that time, a variety of rules (e.g., winter manure ban) and best management practices (cover crops, manure storage or transfers, buffers, etc.) have been implemented. We used a general linear model to assess variation in total suspended solids, particulate phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate N, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentrations from daily Chickasaw Creek (drains ~25% of watershed) samples spanning 2008 to 2016. Parameters were related to flow (higher values during high flows), timing (lower values during winter months), and the implementation of the distressed watershed rules package (lower values following implementation). Overall, reductions following the distressed designation for all parameters ranged from 5 to 35% during medium and high flow periods (with exception of SRP). Reductions were even more pronounced during winter months covered by the manure ban, where all parameters (including SRP) exhibited decreases at medium and high flows between 20 and 60%. While the reductions seen in this study are significant, concentrations are still highly elevated and continue to be a problem. We are optimistic that this study will serve to inform future management in the region and elsewhere. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - According to poll results and media reports, Britain has a significant and growing number of creationists. However, little scholarly research has been carried out to explore this phenomenon. We present results from a national survey of 6020 individuals to give a comprehensive picture of contemporary public attitudes to evolution in Britain. Furthermore, we explore the effects of religion and education on attitudes to evolution. Unique to this study, we analyse the effects of attending a religiously affiliated school (‘faith school’) on acceptance of evolutionary theory. We examine these effects in the general population, and additionally, across different Christian, Muslim and Non-Religious subpopulations. Results give strong evidence that the number of creationists has been overstated previously. We find the effect of education is complex and varies between different religious groups, but that faith school attendance is associated with more acceptance of evolution for people belonging to groups that tend to reject it. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - In international politics, the strategic narratives of different governments compete for public attention and support. The Russian government’s narrative has prompted western concern due to fears that it exerts a destabilizing effect on societies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. However, the behavior and thought processes of news consumers targeted by contradictory strategic narratives are rarely subjected to analysis. This paper examines how Ukrainian news consumers decide where to get their news and what to believe in a media environment where “propaganda” and “disinformation” are regarded as major threats to national security. Evidence comes from thirty audio-diaries and in-depth interviews conducted in 2016 among adult residents of Odesa Region. Through qualitative analysis of the diary and interview transcripts, the paper reveals how participants judged the credibility of news and narratives based on their priorities (what they considered important), not just “facts” (what they believed had happened).

AB  - The emergence of Twitter in Thailand has given millions of users a platform to express and share their opinions about products and services, among other subjects, and so Twitter is considered to be a rich source of information for companies to understand their customers by extracting and analyzing sentiment from Tweets. This offers companies a fast and effective way to monitor public opinions on their brands, products, services, etc. However, sentiment analysis performed on Thai Tweets has challenges brought about by language-related issues, such as the difference in writing systems between Thai and English, short-length messages, slang words, and word usage variation. This research paper focuses on Tweet classification and on solving data sparsity issues. We propose a mixed method of supervised learning techniques and lexicon-based techniques to filter Thai opinions and to then classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The proposed method includes a number of pre-processing steps before the text is fed to the classifier. Experimental results showed that the proposed method overcame previous limitations from other studies and was very effective in most cases. The average accuracy was 84.80 %, with 82.42 % precision, 83.88 % recall, and 82.97 % F-measure. © 2018, Walailak University. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of this article is to employ the means of critical discourse analysis to verify the contribution made by news documentaries to the discussion on the topic of migration in Italian journalism. My case studies include three documentaries screened on the national broadcaster (RAI): La neve la prima volta (Snow for the First Time) (Cataldi, 2014), Quando Youssef si mise in cammino (When Youssef Started His Walk) (Cataldi, 2015) and La lunga Marcia (The Long Route) (Ricucci, 2015). The documentaries deal with a range of issues regarding migration in the European Union, such as the construction of European external borders; policies of migrant management; human rights; prejudice towards foreigners. The article will take a closer look at lexical terms, metaphors and other rhetorical forms. Linguistic evidence has been jointly analysed with the visual construction on-screen since they both participate in the meaning-making process of the documentary as a whole. © 2018 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - The article examines emerging practices of personalization in political talk shows on Romanian television. Our interest lies in the reconfiguration of the role of critical journalist, as performed by talk show hosts on private TV channels, in the context of increasing commercialization and instrumentalization of the Romanian media in postcommunism. This development consists of the strategic use of personalization, achieved through the talk show dispositive, for the enactment of positions of journalistic interpretation, adversarialness, and intervention on behalf of the citizens. The findings indicate shifts in the symmetry/asymmetry relationships between journalists, guests, politicians, and publics, as well as new ways of constructing and understanding public issues. Two main patterns of personalization have been identified: the journalist as a fully engaged voice, effectively substituting itself for the public opinion, and the journalist as an ordinary person, who has the capacity to see through and expose dominant public discourses. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The clarification of public concerns regarding heart transplantation is important for improving low organ donation rates in Japan. In the present study, we used the Twitter data of 4986 tweets (between August 2015 and January 2016) and 1429 tweets (between April 2016 and May 2016) to analyze public discourse on heart transplantation in Japan and identify the reasons for low organ donation rates. We manually categorized all tweets relevant to heart transplantation into nine categories and counted the number of tweets in each category per month. During the study period, the most popular category of tweets was related to the media, followed by money (tweets questioning or even criticizing the high price of fundraising goals to go overseas for heart transplantations), while some tweets were misconceptions. We also conducted a sentiment analysis, which revealed that the most popular negative tweets were related to money, while the most positive tweets were related to reports on the favorable outcomes of recipients. Our results suggest that listening to concerns, providing correct information (particularly for some misconceptions), and emphasizing the outcomes of recipients will facilitate an increase in the number of people contemplating heart transplantation and organ donation. © 2017 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons

AB  - Existing literature suggests that acculturation and integration processes for immigrant youth from East Africa are complicated by family values, interaction styles, and social roles that are in conflict with those of the US host culture. The purpose of this study was to explore first-generation female Ugandan immigrant youth perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward self-development and identify factors among their social contexts that impact their development and adjustment. This study utilized dimensional analysis, an approach to the generation of grounded theory. Data collection included over 100 h of community participatory observation and 28 interviews in total. Participants included 20 English speaking Ugandan females aged 16–25 years who immigrated to the US after age of eight. Participants’ adaptations and adjustments led to an altered developmental path, including their beliefs about gender, ethnic and racial identities, and how they balanced and integrated US culture into their existing understandings and cultural awareness. Conditions that impacted the identity development process include timing of their immigration, the contexts of reception, media, the Ugandan Community, the school social setting, the perceived value of Ugandan cultural maintenance vs. the value of adopting certain American traits, and experiences of prejudice and discrimination vs. new future opportunities. The findings represent an in-depth consideration of the cultural, linguistic, religious, racial, and social attributes of the female Ugandan immigrant youth population and can therefore be seen as an important step in the direction of developing an understanding of the developmental assets and risk/protective factors that characterize this young immigrant population. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Ebola was the most widely followed news story in the United States in October 2014. Here, we ask what members of the U.S. public learned about the disease, given the often chaotic media environment. Early in 2015, we surveyed a representative sample of 3,447 U.S. residents about their Ebola-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Where possible, we elicited judgments in terms sufficiently precise to allow comparing them to scientific estimates (e.g., the death toll to date and the probability of dying once ill). Respondents’ judgments were generally consistent with one another, with scientific knowledge, and with their self-reported behavioral responses and policy preferences. Thus, by the time the threat appeared to have subsided in the United States, members of the public, as a whole, had seemingly mastered its basic contours. Moreover, they could express their beliefs in quantitative terms. Judgments of personal risk were weakly and inconsistently related to reported gender, age, education, income, or political ideology. Better educated and wealthier respondents saw population risks as lower; females saw them as higher. More politically conservative respondents saw Ebola as more transmissible and expressed less support for public health policies. In general, respondents supported providing “honest, accurate information, even if that information worried people.” These results suggest the value of proactive communications designed to inform the lay public's decisions, thoughts, and emotions, and informed by concurrent surveys of their responses and needs. © 2017 Society for Risk Analysis
