AB  - During the 1970s, the dominant position of the revisionist 'right wing' of the Labour Party began to fall apart under continuous pressure, both from within and from without. One of revisionism's most consistent internal critics was Stephen Haseler, an academic and former Labour parliamentary candidate. Haseler argued that the creed he had once supported enthusiastically was now saturated by the prejudices of the liberal-minded 'elites', and must be replaced with an alternative model of social democracy - which he dubbed 'Labourism' - that would prioritize the concerns of the party's traditional working-class electorate. In 1975 he formed the Social Democratic Alliance to assist the Cabinet minister Reg Prentice in his campaign against the hard left, but his fiercely combative style won him few admirers from among the moderates in the party. Concerned for the future of democracy, Haseler gravitated towards the new style of Conservatism then being propounded by Margaret Thatcher, and soon began informally advising her on several key aspects of policy - all while remaining a member of the Labour Party. But if his position on the political spectrum had changed, his world view had not: still suspicious of the 'liberal establishment, he converted his earlier 'Labourist' perspective, with its steadfast belief in working-class virtue, into a wider, less sectional 'populist' emphasis on representing 'ordinary people' against the Leviathan of big government. Thus Haseler's example illustrates how divisions within the Labour right could create a gateway to the world of Thatcherite politics, as he successfully managed to propagate his core ideological values in a new context.

AB  - The main goal of this study is to determine whether attitudes (prejudices and stereotypes) of domestic tourists towards South-easterners change after their travel experiences. Additionally, whether the levels of contact (the number of overnights stay, travel type, the number of arrivals at destination) with the local people have any effects on changes of attitude was determined to be sub-goals of this study. In this study, quantitative data analysis method was used. The research was designed as a non-experimental mixed pattern. The pre-holiday and post-holiday attitudes of domestic tourists arriving in Gaziantep and Sanliurfa were investigated using the questionnaire (n: 386). Additionally, data was gathered during the process of study from people who have never visited the Southeast to create a comparison group (n: 252). Factors analysis, frequency, ANOVA and t-test analyses were applied to the gathered data. As a result of analyses, the prejudices of participants who have never come to the Southeast have been higher. Also, positive changes were determined in the attitudes (prejudices, positive attitudes) of people who have undergone experiences of travel. However, it was also revealed that there are no statistically significant differences that are dependent on factors of contact variables (namely the type of travel, the number of overnights stays, and the number of arrivals at the destination). This research is important as it contributes to the gap in the tourism and social psychological area and explains the attitudes of tourists towards the local people. This research is also important in establishing whether tourism can be used as a tool for decreasing intercommunal problems.

AB  - This paper discusses the imperative for Marxist Theory <--> Praxis to develop and respond to/counter ongoing even urgent imperial efforts to develop scientific approaches to the study of the nature and evolution of human consciousness, cognition, learning, perception, susceptibility to soft and hard forms of power, propaganda and imperial social systems engineering. Specifically how do shifting socio-historical-economic-political definitions, constructs and realities of culture, tribe, nation, ethnicity, race, nationality, interpenetrate with and shape human cognition, perception, prejudices, and class consciousness as central to but not all of overall consciousness? How are these constructs used in concrete ways to foster imperial penetrations, co-optations, control and subversion? What are some emerging issues and areas in need of research as well as concrete ways that constructs like culture can be and are being used to promote false consciousness, reactionary tribalism and forms of "patriotism," exceptionalism, triumphalism and neo-Cold War posturing. What are the implications of sub-cultures within alleged broader homogenous national cultures, imperial promotion of forms of supposed exceptionalism and triumphalism trumping class-based cultures and their inherent antagonisms vs. socialist social formations intent on reducing class-based cultures and their antagonisms with no imperatives or intent for domination and hegemony?

AB  - Tolerance is a central concept for a society's democratic foundations. Many forms of populism threaten tolerance and are a growing concern for consolidated liberal democracies as well developing ones. Right-wing ideology, heightened nationalism, and xenophobic rhetoric toward minorities are threatening social cohesion, public unity, and liberal values. Turkey, subject to various destabilizing recent events, faces specific challenges amid political, social, and economic uncertainties. Using two waves of a nationally representative survey, conducted after each of two general elections in 2015, we studied changes in the behavioral indicators of intolerance in the Turkish electorate. We found that perceived threat and prejudice explain changes in public intolerance during this period. We discuss the implications of our results for the standing of democracy in Turkey.

AB  - This qualitative research was based on structured small-group work conducted with 34 undergraduate social work students. It aimed to reveal students' understandings of their personal values and modes of evaluation, their views regarding the value base of social work, and the possible influence of their personal values on professional practice. The data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire, self-reflective diaries and a semi-structured focus-group discussion. During the study, it was seen that the students had difficulties when talking about their personal values. Yet, whenever they did talk about them, they saw that their values were actually not their own, but were socially constructed by the dominant cultural and moral norms. Prejudices based on the hegemonic cultural codes and norms, hidden in the form of personal values, are the biggest handicaps in the development of a professional identity. Thus, the values of social work are extremely important because they allow social workers to work professionally with all people without exception or discrimination and to promote human rights. This study showed that educational settings must be transformed so that students may express their own values without being judged. Arts-based techniques like creative drama have a great potential to achieve this goal. Therefore, social work education should benefit from creative and critical ways to prepare students for the profession, which aims to protect the value of humans.

AB  - The underrepresentation of women in top positions has been in the spotlight of research for decades. Prejudice toward female leaders, which decreases women's chances of emerging as leaders, has been discussed as a potential reason. Aiming to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this prejudice, we focused on the question of how facial characteristics might influence women's leadership emergence. Because other research has related ascribed social competence and ascribed naivete to attractiveness and babyfacedness, respectively, we hypothesized that ascribed social competence would mediate the impact of ascribed attractiveness on leadership emergence and that ascribed naivete would mediate the impact of ascribed babyfacedness on leadership emergence. In a pilot study, we analyzed data from 101 participants of a women's leadership contest held in 2015 in Germany. We then confirmed these results in a methodologically improved main study on other women who participated in the contest in one of two other years: 2016 and 2017 (N = 195). Women applied to participate in the contest by recording their answers to several questions in a video interview. In the contest, they were assigned to teams of about ten women each and worked on several assessment-center-like tasks. After each task, each member of each team nominated the three women they believed showed the best leadership potential in their group. We operationalized women's leadership emergence as the number of nominations received. We measured participants' facial attractiveness, babyfacedness, social competence, and naivete by having raters follow a specifically developed rating manual to rate the answers the women gave in the video interviews. In both studies, the results indicated that women with higher ascribed facial attractiveness had higher ascribed social competence, which significantly predicted leadership emergence in the contest. Likewise, women with higher ascribed babyfacedness had higher ascribed naivete, which significantly, albeit only slightly, negatively predicted leadership emergence. We discuss the implications of the results for personnel selection.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to propose a novel methodology for estimating the social influence among agents interacting in a sparse social network described by the Friedkin and Johnsen model. In this classical model, n agents discuss m << n topics, which are influenced by the others' opinions, but are not completely open minded, being persistently driven by their prejudices. We reconstruct the social network topology and the strength of the interconnections starting from observations of the initial and final opinions' profile only. The intrinsic sparsity of the graph is exploited via an l(0)/l(1) minimization. Different from the techniques previously proposed in the literature, no partial knowledge of the social graph is assumed, and there is no need to optimally place external stubborn agents injecting prescribed inputs, thus changing the terminal behavior of the opinion dynamics. Under suitable assumptions, we derive theoretical conditions that guarantee the problem is well posed and sufficient requirements on the number of topics under discussion that ensure perfect recovery. Extensive simulations on synthetic and real networks corroborate theoretical results.

AB  - In an emerging field such as social enterprise, it is important for an organization to secure legitimacy to obtain resources and sustain its business. Specifically, when a government distributing subsidies does not have adequate information to decide which organization is trustworthy, it is the legitimacy-seeking activities of a social enterprise that determines who receives a subsidy; this, in turn, decides which organization will survive. One of the most effective ways to gain legitimacy is to explicitly emphasize in the public promotion that the organization devotes to its social mission. In the case of Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs), an organization emphasizes its social employment of the disadvantaged individuals. However, we argue that social enterprises' public promotion that emphasizes social employment can lower the expected wage, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment of the employees who are hired due to their disadvantaged social status. This is because such obvious promotional messages makes the employees more keenly aware of their disadvantaged status; as a result, this reinforces their self-prejudice that they are not competitive enough in the labor market. We test our hypotheses in the context of South Korean WISEs and found general support for our arguments.

AB  - The Dual Process Model (DPM) explains prejudice and political conservatism as functions of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and a Social Dominance Orientation (SDO; Duckitt, 2001). From an evolutionary perspective, such orientations may represent specific adaptations to coalitional competition in the ancestral environment (Sinn & Hayes, 2016). Supporting this view, recent research suggests the two orientations represent divergent strategies, with RWA pursuing an honest-cooperator strategy and SDO a deceptive, cooperation-mimicking strategy (Heylen & Pauwels, 2015). In two studies, we examine additional evidence for an adaptationist interpretation of DPM. Utilizing life history theory, Study 1 finds that RWA reflects the predicted "slow" strategy by endorsing planning and control, investment in family relationships, altruism, and religiosity. In contrast, SDO reflects a "fast" strategy by devaluing planning and control, secure relationships, and altruism. Utilizing rank management theory, Study 2 finds that RWA reflects a prosocial orientation, endorsing coalition building and social networking while rejecting deception and manipulation. In contrast, SDO reflects an exploitive orientation, rejecting coalition building and networking but endorsing ruthless self-advancement and deceptive tactics. These findings support an adaptationist revision of RWA to recognize its prosocial, honest-cooperator dimension and of SDO to recognize proself, "dark" tactics seeking power within groups.

AB  - There is a strong prejudice against the friendship access control mechanism in C++. People claim that friendship breaks the encapsulation, reflects bad design, and creates too strong coupling. However, friends appear even in the most carefully designed systems, and if it is used judiciously (like using the attorney-client idiom), they may be better choice than widening the public interface of the class. In this paper, we investigate how the friendship mechanism is used in C++ programs. We have made measurements on several open source projects to understand the current use of friends. Our results show various holes and errors in friend usage, like friend functions accessing only public members or not accessing members at all or the class, which declare friends has no private members at all. The results also show that friend functions actually use only a low percentage of the private members they were granted to access, which is a source of errors. These results have motivated us to propose a selective friend language construct for C++, which can restrict friendship only to well-defined members. Such a new language element may decrease the degradation of encapsulation and significantly increase the diagnostic capacity of the compiler. We have created a proof-of-concept implementation based on the LLVM/Clang compiler infrastructure to show that such constructs can be established with a minimal syntactical and compilation overhead.

AB  - Whereas research on generalized prejudice is dominated by variable-centered approaches, which focus on communalities between different types of prejudice, we propose a complementary person-centered approach, looking for subgroups of people characterized by similar patterns of prejudice. To this end, we compare the results of a variable-centered (using confirmatory factor analysis [CFA]) and a person-centered (using latent class analysis [LCA]) approach to generalized prejudice. While CFA points to a multidimensional solution with a strong overlap between prejudice dimensions, LCA distinguishes five prejudice patterns that cannot be organized along a linear continuum of more versus less prejudiced dispositions. Explanatory models for the two solutions are estimated. Results show that the two methods are largely complementary in conceptualizing generalized prejudice.

AB  - The recent wave of refugees arriving in Europe has given rise to much social debate. One important issue in this debate regards public opinions about the way political institutions should deal with existing prejudice against refugees. We examined this question in three studies. In Study 1 (N = 119), we assessed the relationship between participants' agreement with refugees' inclusion, perceived realistic and symbolic threats, and attitudes toward refugees' acculturation. In Study 2 (N = 166), we tested the effects of the existence (vs. nonexistence) of government refugee inclusion policies on participants' prejudice toward refugees. In Study 3 (N = 112), we tested the effect of governments' integrative (vs. assimilative vs. uncertainty) policies on prejudice toward refugees. Realistic and symbolic threats predicted agreement with assimilation, but realistic threat also negatively predicted integration. Moreover, the presence of inclusive policies decreased perceived threat of, and negative attitudes toward, refugees. Perceived threat and negative attitudes emerged more strongly when government policies were uncertain than when they were directed at integration or assimilation, and predicted participants' agreement with refugees' assimilation. We discuss the social and theoretical implications of these results.

AB  - The internal conflict in Syria has displaced large numbers of the population into neighbouring countries since the uprising in 2011. The large influx of displaced people into Jordan poses great challenges to the international community as well as local authorities, with increasing competition for already scarce resources and services creating rising tensions between refugee and host communities. In this context, the non-governmental organisation, Action Contre la Faim, implemented a programme aimed at improving psychosocial wellbeing, fostering resilience and promoting positive interactions between the members of both communities. Through the participation of support groups within community-based organisations, dialogue was facilitated, and interactions took place in a safe and therapeutic environment. Participants reported improved perception of well-being and self confidence, as well as improved mutual understanding and communication, reduced isolation and the extension of social support, enhanced empathy and reduce prejudice.

AB  - Faith schools in England are often regarded as ill-suited to cultivating the abilities, attitudes, and dispositions required for living together harmoniously in an ethnically and religiously diverse society. These concerns might be formulated in terms of the thesis that faith schools in England are considerably sub-optimal for the cultivation of civic virtues compared to the feasible non-faith alternatives. Focusing on one particular civic virtue, namely, tolerance, this article aims to assess this sub-optimality thesis. It identifies a range of factors that might be thought to affect whether a faith school provides an environment that is conducive to the cultivation of tolerance, and then considers the available evidence, both direct and indirect, that bears upon what effect these factors actually have. It argues that the evidence that is available gives insufficient support to the sub-optimality thesis, but it does provide a powerful case for regulating faith schools in various ways.

AB  - The Global Trust Inventory (GTI), conceptually assessing trust in others ranging from close interpersonal relationships to relationships with government and financial institutions as a whole, was administered to representative online samples in 11 democratic states (N = 11,917 from Europe, the Americas, and New Zealand). A seven-factor solution had configural, metric, and reasonable scalar invariance in multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Using latent profile analysis, individual-level measures of trust were derived that complement existing measures of social capital in their impact and implications. Western societies had proportionately more people with high propensity to trust, Catholic/European intermediate, and Latin American societies the least. A High Trust Profile had virtues associated with social capital: greater participation in political discussion, greater elaboration of political thinking, more community engagement, less prejudice, and greater participation in elections. A Low Trust Profile exhibited opposite tendencies. Demographically, high trust was associated with higher self-reported social status, home ownership, older age, and political conservatism. A more complex set of relationships differentiated two intermediate profiles, dubbed Moderate and Low Institutional Trust. Conceptually, the GTI operationalizes a holistic view of trust as a synthetic force that holds various aspects of society together, ranging from interpersonal to institutionalized relationships.

AB  - With ongoing urban revolution, Chinese cities are experiencing an influx of migrants, whose integration into urban society becomes an unprecedented challenge. Using a recent survey in Shanghai and adopting a multilevel multinomial logistic model, this paper studies perceptions of social integration, comparing local residents with migrants. While migrants and local residents have very different perceptions of social integration, both individual-level factors and community-level factors such as residential segregation shape perceptions of social integration, and they shape migrants and local residents differently. In particular, residential segregation, especially migrant population size, tends to reinforce perceptions of social exclusion, which imposes challenges on social integration.

AB  - This study analyzes the experiences and identities of Kurdish women fighting the Islamic State (IS) in northern Iraq as part of the Peshmerga Army. The case is especially interesting because these women have engaged in ground combat and because there is an empirical gap in knowledge, especially concerning Muslim women's experiences as soldiers. Wars bring great destruction but can also catalyze social change. While seeking balance between their identities as good mothers and professional soldiers, many Kurdish women see their war participation as a chance to increase their agency and improve equality in society, as combat operations create a window of opportunity to change perceptions of women's roles. Women soldiers still face prejudices and feel that they must prove their worth as fearless warriors in ground combat. However, interviewed soldiers said that they were not striving for equality but equivalency, stressing those qualities that women in particular can contribute in battle.

AB  - It is well established that individuals who engage in more positive social interactions report a broad array of benefit relative to those with fewer positive social interactions. Yet less is known about how, within individuals, naturally occurring social interactions in daily life relate to momentary indicators of health (e.g., mood, psychological, and physiological stress). The current study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine these within-person relationships, as well as complementary between-person relationships, among 115 adults (75% female; M-age = 41.21). Participants completed six EMA surveys per day for 3 days to report on whether they experienced any social interactions and whether the interactions were pleasant as well as on their mood, pain, tiredness, interest, and perceived stress; they also provided a salivary cortisol sample after each EMA survey. Multilevel modeling analyses showed that individuals felt more happiness and interest, and less sadness, tiredness, and pain, during moments when they were engaged in a social interaction versus when they were not. Individuals also reported less stress during more pleasant versus less pleasant social interactions. When examining between-person effects, we found evidence that people who gave more pleasant interactions generally reported more positive outcomes. This study presents evidence for intraindividual links between social interactions and momentary health indicators in daily life.

AB  - Background: This study is based on the contact hypothesis that contact with mental illness is the most effective anti-stigma strategy.
   Aims: This study aims to analyze which form of contact can most effectively decrease the dangerousness and social distance associated with schizophrenia, depression and alcoholism.
   Method: In total, 573 Korean adults (M-age=43.71years, standard deviation (SD)=13.41; 54.1% male, 45.9% female) were surveyed about randomly assigned vignettes of schizophrenia, depression and alcoholism. The participants were questioned on the dangerousness and social distance associated with the assigned vignette, as well as direct and indirect contact experience with the mental illness. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the main effect and interaction effect that the type of mental illness and contact experience have on the two dependent variables (dangerousness and social distance).
   Results: The findings show that the type of mental illness has a significant main effect on dangerousness and social distance, but contact type only has a significant main effect on social distance. Moreover, the two independent variables (mental illness subtype and contact experience) have an interaction effect on two dependent variables (dangerousness and social distance). Therefore, the anti-stigma effect of contact varies according to the type of mental illness.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that appropriate anti-stigma strategies are required for each type of mental illness. Considering that opportunities for direct contact with persons with mental illness are highly limited, it is necessary to actively utilize indirect contact.

AB  - Consistent with the theory of malleable ideology, research has shown that, under intergroup threat, antiegalitarian individuals will exploit the malleable character of color blindness and strategically claim to be strong supporters of it. In three studies conducted in France, we found no support for this theory when measuring color blindness but strong support when using measures of laicite, an ideology of secularism. Indeed, those who score low on social dominance orientation (SDO) were more likely to support laicite than antiegalitarian individuals. However, a situational threat (Study 1), a symbolic threat experimentally induced (Study 2), and a perceived symbolic threat (Study 3) were all related to increased support for laicite by people high in SDO, without affecting those low in SDO. Thus, laicite is a malleable ideology that can be adopted by individuals having contrasting motivations, as color blindness in the United States. Implications for the role of exact and conceptual replications in the development of a psychological science are discussed.

AB  - HIV education is an important component of the life orientation curriculum, since an intersectional understanding of HIV provides an entry point to appreciate the interrelatedness of various social injustices. Yet, our interaction with predominantly white and privileged pre-service life orientation students led us to believe that they did not perceive HIV education as something that was relevant to their personal or professional lives. Their rigid, stigmatising belief systems and "othering" attitudes prevented them from embodying the inclusive and life-enhancing values that life orientation is supposed to develop. This paper explains how we used iterative cycles of reflection and action to enable 86 student teachers of life orientation to interrogate their misconceptions about HIV education and its applicability for their professional and personal contexts. Students were able to acknowledge their prejudices and privileges, which in turn created a willingness to engage with HIV education and to embody their learning to bring about change in their daily interactions. The knowledge generated from this study indicates how a critical, participatory pedagogical approach to HIV education can develop the social literacy of students to enable them to live out the life-enhancing values that underpin the life orientation curriculum.

AB  - The main object of this research is to describe social exclusion in a comparative world perspective. Social exclusion is a main concern worldwide. Non-desirable social groups as neighbours are used as a proxy measure to answer three questions: who are the most excluded social groups, who are the excluders, and what are the main explanatory variables of social exclusion. Social exclusion, as a multidimensional phenomenon, is defined in relation to concepts such as stigma, discrimination, and prejudice. Social, economic, political and ideological-religious attitudes are used to construct the profile of the excluder. Social exclusion has been measured through three indexes of social exclusion, personal, group and total exclusion, since a main component analysis demonstrated that the degree of social exclusion varied depending on whether the excluded group was more or less based on personal decisions on one's behaviour taken by the individual. Based on theory and previous research, four main variables have been tested to explain social exclusion: social position, exposure to information, post-materialist values and perception of security. But other explanatory variables were also added to the analysis. EVS and WVS databases (from 1981 to 2014) have been used, though most of the analysis has been based on the last WVS-6th wave on 59 countries with a total of more than 85,000 interviews.

AB  - The effects of responding to social pressure (external motivation) are short-lived. Multicultural training, however, seeks to promote change in students and trainees that will be transformative and long-lasting. To this end, understanding the motivational factors that inform training is key. The present study was an investigation of the factors underlying external motivation to respond without prejudice for White individuals from the perspective of Higgins's regulatory focus (promotion and prevention) and regulatory mode (assessment and locomotion) theories. The results indicate that locomotion was negatively associated with external motivation to respond without prejudice, while assessment and prevention were positively associated with external motivation. Taken together, findings highlight the importance of cultivating locomotion (action oriented) motivation and inhibiting prevention (loss oriented) and assessment (preoccupation with finding the correct answer) motivations in multicultural training. Implications for training, effective action for justice, and future research are discussed.

AB  - Understanding the complex manifestations of sexual stigma is crucial in helping to prevent discrimination toward sexual minorities. In this research, we examined the role of heterosexism within political ideology systems and the process through which these systems promote discrimination by focusing on sexual prejudice. Across four studies, we tested the predictions that more conservative political ideologies and greater levels of sexual prejudice will be associated with more negative evaluations of an applicant with a sexual stigma, and that prejudice will mediate the link between ideology and evaluation. We employed an experimental paradigm such that participants were presented nearly identical information in an intern applicant evaluation context, however, cues to sexual stigma were either present or absent. Overall, conservative ideology negatively predicted evaluation in the stigma, but not the control, condition and greater levels of sexual prejudice more strongly negatively predicted evaluations in the stigma, relative to control, condition. Finally, whereas ideology indirectly predicted candidate evaluation through prejudice generally, the effect was stronger for the applicant with the sexual stigma. This research extends the scholarship linking ideology to sexual stigma by examining employment discrimination and testing the mediating role of prejudice linking ideology to discrimination. By examining the role of ideology, it also broadens the research on bias in employment contexts. Understanding the role of both political ideology as well as individual sexual prejudice in discrimination may facilitate efforts to dismantle discrimination.

Drawing on survey data collected from 1,272 individuals from three ethnic minority backgrounds in Australia, the present study reports findings including: (1) significant and large direct positive associations between superordinate identity and willingness to cooperate with police, (2) small-to-moderate significant associations between perceived police bias and cooperation with police (positive for Vietnamese subsample; negative for Indian and Arab subsamples), and (3) significant interaction patterns between subordinate identity, perceived police bias, and ethnicity. Findings are discussed with respect to community-engaged prevention and prejudice reduction.

AB  - Science fiction stories extend the limits of human realities. In that imagined world where things appear different, mysterious, and norm less, human measures such as sexism, prejudice, viciousness and other judicial realms are negotiated through atypical lenses. Therefore, what remains noticeable here would be the question if science fiction is an agent for social change and collective justice and decent mortalities. The main purpose of this article is to argue how Rudy Rucker's Transrealism -works as an interplay between dream and reality in which the writer shapes his/her own immediate perceptions in a fantastic way- can carry out this commitment. The selected text of analysis here will be Aldous Leonard Huxley' Brave New World (1932), which will be theoretically analyzed based on the doctrine of UN Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations (2006) published under the auspices of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat. The main elements of UN document will be the Six important areas of inequality in the distribution of goods, opportunities and rights. The implication of the present inquiry would depict the role of science fiction novels, such as Huxley's Brave New World, to challenge today's human position in the world, to call for social values for a better community to exist and to restore social justice as a milestone for a fair new world to live in.

AB  - Evaluation of the aesthetic prejudice is an important element in forensic medicine, but currently there are no objective methods to measure it. Aesthetimetric method inspired from Greffe and Hodin methods do not provide a level of framing a scar in the aesthetic prejudices, the appreciations remaining purely subjective. The authors proposal is to use the impact of psychosocial factors in order to assess how scars affect the quality of life of the affected person. We consider 12 psychosocial indices, from which 7 are minor criteria evaluated with 1 point and 5 major criteria evaluated with 3 points. We quantified aesthetic prejudices by setting a step standard of 5 points; 5 points below, signifies an individual's ability to adapt in the presence of the scar, resulting that social life is not affected; this step standard represents the psychosocial internalization of the scar.

AB  - Although research has revealed that more progressive LGB (lesbian, gay, and bisexual) rights are positively associated with more favorable attitudes toward sexual minorities, little is known about why LGB rights co-occur with positive attitudes. The present contribution fills this gap by testing whether the prevalence of intergroup contact with LGB individuals explains the relationship between more progressive LGB rights and sexual prejudice. Utilizing representative Eurobarometer data from 28 European Union Member States, we find that progressive institutional arrangements positively predict favorable attitudes toward sexual minorities by rendering intergroup contact with LGB individuals more commonplace. Importantly, this pattern of findings replicates for different measures of prejudice and LGB-related legislation. The theoretical and practical implications of the current findings are discussed.

AB  - Addiction treatment centers often fail to involve families in treatment. The aim of the present study was to explore the challenges that Greek mental health professionals encounter in their work with parents of drug and alcohol abusers. A qualitative study design was adopted, and five focus group discussions were conducted with 27 drug and alcohol professionals. The thematic analysis of their accounts revealed the key difficulties that professionals encounter in their collaboration with parents that included parental lack of involvement or over-engagement in treatment, unrealistic expectations, ambivalence or opposition to change, ethical dilemmas, and alliance issues, as well as collaboration challenges among therapists. Findings highlight the challenges of a family approach in the treatment of addiction, and underscore the value of clinical supervision in addition to specialized training, to help professionals work on their anxiety, anger, guilt, prejudices, and deception, when engaging parents in the treatment of their addicted child.

AB  - Background: The situation of lesbians and gay men (LGs) in Spain has improved significantly in recent decades. However, Spanish society still exhibits prejudice and discrimination. The current study pursues three main goals: 1) to analyse the extent to which LGs perceive blatant and subtle discrimination, 2) to explore the relationship between perceived discrimination and LGs' psychological and subjective well-being, and 3) to analyse the possible mediational role of social support in reducing the negative influence of perceived discrimination on well-being. Method: The sample comprised 237 lesbians and 232 gay men. Results: The results show higher perceived subtle than blatant discrimination, and that subtle discrimination affects LGs' well-being more negatively than blatant discrimination. Results show that social support helps to alleviate the negative effects of discrimination on well-being. Conclusions: These results are important and may contribute to the design of interventions to improve the well-being of lesbians and gay men.

AB  - This article presents the first survey conducted in Cyprus in relation to the knowledge and perceptions of social workers and social work students on issues related to human sexuality. With the use of a sample of 155 participants, the researchers attempted to identify the major areas of human sexuality that concern Cypriot social workers and social work students. A variety of closed-ended questions, which resulted from two focus groups - one with professionals and the other with students, were given to all the participants whose response was found to be of vital importance for this study, as well as for future research. The study has revealed the necessity for further training and education on human sexuality issues for professionals and students in social work. A need for more studies, especially comparative studies in order to construct a more comprehensive view on this matter in comparison to social work programmes in other countries, was also found.

AB  - Despite the vast literature on Darwinism and race, the way in which Darwin's opinions on race were received and used by non-Western circles has been little studied. In the case of the Turks, Darwin's comments have been related to British-Ottoman relations, and Darwin was blamed for stoking anti-Turkish sentiment within Europe. This allegedly resulted in the British occupation of Egypt in the 19th century, the demise of the Ottoman Empire, as well as contemporary Neo-Nazi arson attacks in Germany which targeted Turkish migrants. Consequently, Turkish anti-Darwinists perceive Darwinism to be not merely a false scientific theory, but also a political-ideological instrument of Western hegemony wielded against Turkey and the Islamic World. Turkish Darwinists who responded to those claims, on the other hand, presented Darwin as an egalitarian who could overcome the prejudices of his social class. Further scrutiny, however, proves both accounts to be over-simplistic. This paper aims to throw some light on the context within which Darwin expressed his opinions on Turks and thus contribute to the broader discussion of the relationship between Darwinism and race. More importantly, it aims to familiarise Western readers with one of the cultures of creationism which is very little known, despite its great impact on Muslim masses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ObjectiveWe conducted five studies testing whether an implicit measure of favorability toward power over universalism values predicts spontaneous prejudice and discrimination.
   MethodStudies 1 (N=192) and 2 (N=86) examined correlations between spontaneous favorability toward power (vs. universalism) values, achievement (vs. benevolence) values, and a spontaneous measure of prejudice toward ethnic minorities. Study 3 (N=159) tested whether conditioning participants to associate power values with positive adjectives and universalism values with negative adjectives (or inversely) affects spontaneous prejudice. Study 4 (N=95) tested whether decision bias toward female handball players could be predicted by spontaneous attitude toward power (vs. universalism) values. Study 5 (N=123) examined correlations between spontaneous attitude toward power (vs. universalism) values, spontaneous importance toward power (vs. universalism) values, and spontaneous prejudice toward Black African people.
   ResultsSpontaneous positivity toward power (vs. universalism) values was associated with spontaneous negativity toward minorities and predicted gender bias in a decision task, whereas the explicit measures did not.
   ConclusionsThese results indicate that the implicit assessment of evaluative responses attached to human values helps to model value-attitude-behavior relations.

AB  - Two surveys were conducted in Chile with indigenous Mapuche participants (N study 1: 573; N study 2: 198). In line with previous theorising, it was predicted that intergroup contact with the non-indigenous majority reduces prejudice. It was expected that this effect would be because of contact leading to more knowledge about the outgroup, which would then lead to less intergroup anxiety. The two studies yielded converging support for these predictions.

AB  - With the spread of social media, ethnic prejudice is becoming publicly available to widening audiences and may have serious offline consequences. This creates demand to detect prejudice and other signs of ethnic tension in usergenerated texts, and this task is absolutely different from measuring prejudice with surveys-an approach traditionally developed in psychology. In this work we use a hand coding instrument based on psychological definitions of prejudice and sociological methods of questionnaire construction. Compared to our previous research, we double our hand-coded collection that reaches 14,998 unique user texts retrieved from the Russian language social media. We then train computer classification algorithms to "guess" prejudice as detected by human coders and show significant improvement in quality compared to our earlier results. Still, as not all aspects of prejudice get detected sufficiently well, we analyze potential causes of low quality and outline directions for further improvement.

AB  - It is generally accepted that hearing homophobic language can be detrimental to the well-being of same-sex attracted young people. Writing Themselves In 3, a survey of Australian same-sex attracted young people, found that almost half of the respondents reported hearing such language on a regular basis, and considered it offensive. Less is known however about heterosexual young people's experiences. Homophobic language use is often assumed to be motivated by prejudice, but this topic has not been well studied. Using interviews and an online discussion with young people aged 16-21 years, this study explored heterosexual young people's perspectives on homophobic language use at school. Contrary to the framing often used in anti-homophobia education, the meaning of this form of language was seen to largely depend on the context in which it was employed, frequently functioning to reinforce masculine gender norms, particularly for popular male students. Furthermore, while many heterosexual participants in this study used homophobic language regularly, they did not see themselves as homophobic and viewed school policies against the use of homophobic language as largely ineffective. Findings suggest that heterosexual young people may respond more favourably to anti-homophobia education if these programmes acknowledge the variety of meanings and functions of language commonly understood to be homophobic in character.

AB  - Unlike many complex networks studied in the literature, social networks rarely exhibit unanimous behavior, or consensus. This requires a development of mathematical models that are sufficiently simple to be examined and capture, at the same time, the complex behavior of real social groups, where opinions and actions related to them may form clusters of different size. One such model, proposed by Friedkin and Johnsen, extends the idea of conventional consensus algorithm (also referred to as the iterative opinion pooling) to take into account the actors' prejudices, caused by some exogenous factors and leading to disagreement in the final opinions. In this paper, we offer a novel multidimensional extension, describing the evolution of the agents' opinions on several topics. Unlike the existing models, these topics are interdependent, and hence the opinions being formed on these topics are also mutually dependent. We rigorously examine stability properties of the proposed model, in particular, convergence of the agents' opinions. Although our model assumes synchronous communication among the agents, we show that the same final opinions may be reached "on average" via asynchronous gossip-based protocols.

AB  - The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) has been forwarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the Implicit Association Test and the evaluative-priming task for measuring attitudes such as prejudice indirectly. We investigated whether the AMP is indeed able to detect an evaluative out-group bias. In contrast to recent conclusions about the robustness of AMP effects, six out of seven pilot studies indicated that participants did not show any prejudice effects in the AMP. Yet, these pilot studies were not fully conclusive with regard to our research question because they investigated different domains of prejudice, used small sample sizes, and employed a modified AMP version. In a preregistered, high-powered AMP study, we therefore examined whether the standard AMP does reveal prejudice against Turks, the biggest minority in Germany, and found a significant, albeit very small prejudice effect. We discuss possible reasons for the AMP's weak sensitivity to evaluations in socially sensitive domains.

AB  - We investigated the racial content of perceivers' mental images of different socioeconomic categories. We selected participants who were either high or low in prejudice toward the poor. These participants saw 400 pairs of visually noisy face images. Depending on condition, participants chose the face that looked like a poor person, a middle income person, or a rich person. We averaged the faces selected to create composite images of each social class. A second group of participants rated the stereotypical Blackness of these images. They also rated the face images on a variety of psychological traits. Participants high in economic prejudice produced strongly class-differentiated mental images. They imagined the poor to be Blacker than middle income and wealthy people. They also imagined them to have less positive psychological characteristics. Participants low in economic prejudice also possessed images of the wealthy that were relatively White, but they represented poor and middle class people in a less racially differentiated way. We discuss implications for understanding the intersections of race and class in social perception.

AB  - Throughout the United States, there has been a rise in public discourse about transgender people and transgender issues. Much of this attention stems from passed and proposed anti-LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) legislation, including "bathroom bills" that would require transgender people to use public facilities corresponding with the sex designated on their birth certificates. With the recent discussion and legislation impacting school-aged children and adolescents, what does this mean for school nurses and how can they care and advocate for their transgender students? In this article, we aim to empower school nurses to join the discussion, advocate for inclusive and equitable school policies, and deliver gender-affirming care to transgender students. We will explain transgender identities; transgender-related stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and health concerns; gender-affirming approaches in caring for transgender youth; and implications for school nurses. School nurses play a key role in creating a space that is welcoming and affirming where transgender students can thrive.

AB  - Immigration is a global phenomenon, yet comparatively few psychological investigations of anti-immigrant prejudice have been conducted in East Asia, a region of high economic growth that is set to become a leading destination for international migrants. Over two studies, we examined Singaporean attitudes towards four prominent immigrant groups: Chinese, Filipino, South Asian, and Western immigrants. Each immigrant group was found to be associated with a unique attitudinal profile. Chinese immigrants, who are culturally the most closely related to most Singaporeans, were viewed the most negatively in terms of prejudice, stereotyped warmth, and realistic and symbolic threat. Westerners were viewed the most positively despite higher ratings of perceived competence, possibly due to Western cultural influence, whereas South Asians and Filipinos were viewed as being relatively unthreatening, possibly due to their occupation of undesirable social roles. Perceived threat-both realistic and symbolic-proved to be stronger predictors of anti-immigrant prejudice than stereotypes. Implications for immigration policy in the region are discussed.

AB  - Individuals with obesity in Western societies often face weight-related stigmatization and social exclusion. Recurrent exposure to prejudice and negative social feedback alters one's behavior in future social interactions. In this study, we aimed to investigate autonomic nervous system and affective responses to social interactions in individuals with obesity. Women and men with (n = 56) and without (n = 56) obesity participated in episodes of social inclusion and social exclusion using a virtual ball-tossing game. During the experiment, heart rate was measured and parasympathetic activity (overall high-frequency power and event-related cardiac slowing) was analyzed. Our results show that in novel social interactions, women with obesity, relative to the other groups, exhibited the strongest increase in parasympathetic activity. Furthermore, parasympathetic activity was related to a more negative body image in individuals with obesity, but not in lean individuals. Additionally, women with obesity reported a stronger decrease in mood after social exclusion than did the other participants. Our results demonstrate influences of objective and subjective bodily characteristics on parasympathetic cardio-regulation during social interactions. In particular, they show behavioral and physiological alterations during social interactions in women with obesity.

Method: A qualitative study was used in which 89 social work students who took part in diversity training gave permission that their manuscripts be used for documentary analysis. Content analysis was used to analyze the data in order to determine if and how the adventure-based activity contributed to the facilitation of dialogue. Results: It was found that the activity contributed to changing the attitude and knowledge of social work students. It opened up new perspectives and allowed students to discuss diversity without fear. Conclusion: The use of adventure activities is an effective strategy to facilitate dialogue between students.

AB  - Utilising a qualitative case study approach, this research study set out to understand discrimination experienced by immigrant students in their interactions with South African students and the prejudice immigrant students expressed against Black South African students. Findings reveal that the discrimination experienced by immigrant students could be clustered into four broad themes, namely categorisations and prototypes; practised stereotypes; academic and social exclusion; and work ethic. Furthermore, statements immigrant students make about South African students seem to fall into two broad categories, namely lack of value for moral integrity and lack of value for education. Educating students to value human dignity and to view each other as cosmopolitan citizens of the world could be a way to ensure social cohesion and harmony of future generations to come.

AB  - When people high in prejudice censor prejudice in one setting, they can experience a prejudice rebound effectsubsequently responding with more prejudice than otherwise. Disparagement humor fosters the release rather than suppression of prejudice. Thus, two experiments tested the hypothesis that exposure to disparagement humor attenuates rebound effects. Participants suppressed prejudice by writing fewer anti-gay thoughts about same-sex adoption (Experiment 1) or by reporting greater support for same-sex civil rights (Experiment 2) when expecting to share their responses with others (non-prejudice norm condition) but not if others first exchanged anti-gay jokes (prejudice norm condition). High-prejudice participants then exhibited prejudice rebound in the non-prejudice norm condition only. They rated a gay man more stereotypically (Experiment 1) and allocated greater budget cuts to a gay student organization (Experiment 2) in the non-prejudice norm condition.

AB  - This article presents a personal account of what socially just and inclusive education means to me, an academic in a UK university. I identify the critical elements as being the recognition of the right to claim and the duty to protect the humanity and value of all members of society. Inclusion and social justice are about belonging in the world unfettered by the disablements of poverty, illness and prejudice. They are dependent upon interdependence, community and collaborative enterprise. Here I call upon all students in education to take a stand, to work together to end the marginalisation and exclusion of the poor and the abandoned and to disavow control through privilege. Only together by and for each other can we be free.

AB  - The aim of this article was to examine how media attention affects the social exclusion of young refugees negotiating their way towards settlement in Australia. Emerging stereotypes and prejudices against young male refugees require new ways of understanding the impact of global, national and local issues on their social exclusion. The article brings together the impact of (a) the global politicisation and backlash against refugees, (b) Australians negative perception of refugees and (c) the increased reporting of young African-Australian and Pasifika-Australians as the perpetrators of youth violence. The article recognises the overlapping dimensions of social exclusion for young refugees and considers their 'spatial', 'relational' and 'socio-political' exclusion. The examination of media reporting of a landmark legal case of discrimination and racial profiling reveals a discourse of media attention that has perpetuated the social exclusion of a group of young African-Australian refugees living on a Melbourne public housing estate. The sensationalist and prejudicial media connection of the landmark legal case, youth violence and young African-Australians living on the Flemington Estate demonstrates the challenges young male refugees face in negotiating their settlement in Australia. This article makes a contribution to understanding the multidimensional nature of youth exclusion in contemporary times.

AB  - Interactive narratives allow audience members control over characters and unfolding plots. The present study tested exposure effects of an interactive narrative in which audience members adopt the perspective of an immigrant illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico. Results suggested that exposure to the interactive narrative engendered positive affect toward Mexicans in the U.S., which predicted support for social services that would benefit Mexican immigrants. Participants' enjoyment also positively predicted affect and support for social services benefiting Mexican immigrants. Results suggest interactive narratives may be effective tools in helping reduce prejudice toward marginalized social groups.

AB  - As cities of the Gulf Cooperation Council grow and integrate with global markets, questions relating to their unique social compositions continue to emerge. Abu Dhabi has been competing with other cities in the region through massive investments in infrastructure and megaprojects, including the provision of public transportation. The paper examines the issues of bus ridership in Abu Dhabi and relates it to the broader debates on social exclusion and transportation. As a globalizing city with a majority expatriate population, and with a large presence of blue-collar workers, unique rifts in the society are further complicating the usual' prejudice against buses. The paper reports on results from fieldwork including surveys and observations. It concludes that the bus system could be more effective in fostering social inclusion if a broader accessibility planning approach is used.

AB  - Virdee's essay explores the relationship between English socialists and migrant Jews amid the new unionism of the late nineteenth century: a cycle of protest characterized by sustained collective action by the unskilled and labouring poor demanding economic and social justice. Reading this labour history against the grain, with a greater attentiveness to questions of race and class, helps to make more transparent both the prevalence and structuring force of socialist antisemitism, as well as English and Jewish socialist opposition to it. In particular, the essay suggests that the dominant socialist discourse was intimately bound up with questions of national belonging and this directly contributed to a racialized politics of class that could not imagine migrant Jews as an integral component of the working class. At the same time, such socialist antisemitism was also challenged by a minority current of English Marxists whose conceptions of socialism refused to be limited by the narrow boundaries of the racialized nation-state. And they were joined in this collective action by autonomous Jewish socialist organizations who understood that the liberation of the Jewish worker was indivisible from that of the emancipation of the working class in general. With the help of Eleanor Marx and others, these latter strands entangled socialist politics with questions of combatting antisemitism, and thereby stretched existing conceptions of class to encompass the Jewish worker.

AB  - Purpose - Modern prejudice was examined as a potential predictor of overestimating proportions of minority employees in gender-typed occupations. Strength of conjunction error was considered as an indicator of distorted perceptions of these proportions. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the association between modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error was weaker for gender-untypical than for gender-typical targets.
   Design/methodology/approach - Modern prejudice was considered as a predictor of overestimations of black female employees in Study 1 (n = 183) and black female older employees in Study 2 (n = 409). Data were collected using internet-mediated questionnaires.
   Findings - In Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error when respondents were presented with gender-typical targets. In Study 2, using a sample scoring higher on modern prejudice than in Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism and modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error, irrespective of target occupation. Furthermore, there was an unexpected association between lower sexism and greater strength of conjunction error for gender-typical targets, but not for gender-untypical targets.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings lend support to the ethnic-prominence hypothesis in that modern racism, but not modern sexism or modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that target non-prototypicality can dilute the effect of modern prejudice on strength of conjunction error.
   Originality/value - This is one of the rare studies examining attitudes and conjunction error in a work-relevant context, thereby bridging the gap between social cognition and applied psychology.

AB  - This mixed-methods study examined whether heterosexual social workers define same-sex relationships within the concept of family. A sample of 490 Israeli social workers completed a survey that assessed their definition of same-sex relationships as family, their personal values, level of acquaintance with same-sex relationships, and demographics. The qualitative portion included an open-ended question on the way participants perceived social and professional changes concerning families.
   Findings Results revealed that religiosity, gender, age, the values of universalism, benevolence and tradition, and level of acquaintance with same-sex relationships were direct predictors of the respondents' definition of same-sex relationships as family. Level of acquaintance mediated the relationships between most demographic and value variables examined and respondents' definition of same-sex relationships as family. Qualitative analysis endorsed the quantitative analysis.
   Applications Theoretical and practice implications are discussed, underlining the central role that personal acquaintance with same-sex families has in reducing heterosexism, and the need to improve knowledge about same-sex families in social work education.

AB  - Through a critical engagement with Merleau-Ponty's discussion of the concepts of nature, life, and behavior, and with contemporary accounts of animal groups, this article argues that animal groups exhibit sociality and that sociality is a fundamental ontological condition. I situate my account in relation to the superorganism and selfish individual accounts of animal groups in recent biology and zoology. I argue that both accounts are inadequate. I propose an alternative account of animal groups and animal sociality through a Merleau-Pontian inspired definition of behavior. I criticize Merleau-Ponty's individualistic prejudice, but show that his philosophy contains the resources necessary to overcome this bias. I define behavior as a holistic, ongoing, meaningful and Umwelt-oriented intrinsically configured expression of living forms of existence. By looking at cases of animal groups drawn from contemporary studies in zoology and behavioral ecology, I show that animal groups, in the fact that they behave, manifest themselves to be a fundamental form of existence, namely, the social form of existence.

AB  - The present survey study examined the attitudes of U.S. adults toward transgender children and adolescents, as well as their behavioral intentions, in two hypothetical scenarios involving gender variant youth. Participants recruited online (N=281) reported generally favorable attitudes toward transgender minors, but expressed some hesitation to allow a transgender child to use the restroom aligned with their gender as opposed to their birth sex or to share a room with same gender peers on a school trip, possibly due to conflating gender identity with sexual orientation in these situations. Attitudes were less positive in respondents who reported a religious affiliation, conservative social political views, and stronger conformity to certain traditional gender norms-particularly in men. Even after controlling for these factors, stronger belief in environmental versus biological causes of transgender identity was linked to more negative attitudes. Participants' behavioral intentions were driven partly by their attitudes and causal attributions, but also by their age and, at least for women, personal connections to the transgender community. We discuss implications for the discourse surrounding transgender youth and the need for educating the public on the development of gender identity as well as the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.

AB  - Many studies have investigated heterosexuals' prejudices toward nonheterosexuals, yet LGB's prejudices toward heterosexuals remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we sought to determine the threats and opportunities (i.e., affordances) LGB perceive heterosexuals to pose and whether those affordances explain their sexual prejudices toward heterosexuals. Study 1 analyzed LGB's reasons for liking and disliking heterosexuals, which determined whether the threats predicted to be salient for LGB mirrored the affordances they generated. Study 2 measured these perceived affordances and examined the extent to which they drove LGB's prejudices toward heterosexuals. Generally, perceptions of discrimination and unreciprocated sexual interest threats drove anger, physical safety and sexual autonomy threats drove fear, and values threats drove moral disgust toward heterosexuals, although results varied slightly by perceiver and target groups. Goals to alleviate the tensions between heterosexuals and LGB require an understanding of the dynamics between these groups. This research provides preliminary insights into understanding those dynamics.

AB  - A plethora of research indicates that viewing media can reduce prejudice. Emerging work on computer gaming shows that games can also influence social attitudes. The present studies investigated the influence of an interactive computer game about living in poverty on attitudes and beliefs about the poor. Playing the poverty game was compared to playing a control game and merely observing the poverty game. In Study 1, playing an interactive poverty game did not influence attitudes while watching someone else play the game increased positive attitudes, empathic concern, and support for government-funded anti-poverty policies. In Study 2, meritocracy beliefs moderated the influence of the game; people lower in meritocracy showed less positive attitudes toward the poor after playing the poverty game. This effect was mediated by an increase in the belief that poverty is personally controllable. Future directions for and implications of studying the unique intergroup effects of games are discussed.

AB  - In two studies, we examined the novel hypothesis that empathy is a mechanism through which the relationship between attachment patterns and prejudice can be explained. Study 1 examined primed attachment security (vs. neutral prime), empathy, and prejudice towards immigrants. Study 2 examined primed attachment patterns (secure, avoidant, anxious), empathy subscales (perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress), and prejudice towards Muslims. Across both studies, empathy mediated the relationship between primed attachment security and low prejudice levels. The findings suggest that enhancing felt security and empathic skills in individuals high in attachment-avoidance may lead to reduced prejudice.

AB  - Previous research has shown that discriminated women blame themselves more than they blame discrimination when meritocracy values are salient. In two studies, we examined whether meritocracy values also influence female observers when they judge a female victim of sexism. Such values were expected to lead them to judge more positively a victim incriminating herself than a victim claiming discrimination. Conversely, social equality values should lead them to judge more positively a victim claiming discrimination. Women who were either feminists or non-feminists (Study 1) or who were exposed to either social equality values or personal merit values (Study 2) had to judge a female victim of sexism who ascribed what happened to discrimination or to her ability. Feminist women and women exposed to social equality judged the female victim more positively when she reported discrimination than when she incriminated herself. The reverse pattern of judgement was observed for non-feminist women and women exposed to meritocracy values. The importance of values is discussed to improve the image of women claiming sexism.

AB  - Hermeneutic uncertainty is an inherent part of the art of translation, and its consequences are ineluctable features of translation products. In this article I support the claim that the teaching and practice of translation do not escape the social responsibility which resides in clearly declaring and acknowledging the existence of hermeneutic uncertainty. Investigating how Heideggerian hermeneutics led to Gadamer's development of the concept of hermeneutic prejudice. I will show that the philosophical description of how this prejudice functions can be a useful part of the pedagogical materials presented by translation teachers, and can help students to approach ambiguous or difficult source text elements more confidently. Such hermeneutic consciousness-raising can also be applied to published translations, where it can be tested to reveal how translators have dealt with specific instances of hermeneutic uncertainty. The case studied here is a pair of terms occurring in Walter Benjamin's Die Aufgabe des Ubersetzers, chosen mainly for its ubiquitous presence in the field of translation studies. The story of how French and English translations differ in their understanding of this specific hermeneutic difficulty will be used to investigate the extent to which translators acknowledge (or ignore) the existence of hermeneutic uncertainty by allowing it to enter their translations or by discarding it from them.

AB  - Empirical evidence and social commentary demonstrate favoring of Whites over Blacks in attitudes, social judgment, and social behavior. In 6 studies (N > 4,000), we provide evidence for a pro-Black bias in academic decision making. When making multiple admissions decisions for an academic honor society, participants from undergraduate and online samples had a more relaxed acceptance criterion for Black than White candidates, even though participants possessed implicit and explicit preferences for Whites over Blacks. This pro-Black criterion bias persisted among subsamples that wanted to be unbiased and believed they were unbiased. It also persisted even when participants were given warning of the bias-or incentives to perform accurately. These results suggest opportunity for theoretical and empirical innovation on the conditions under which biases in social judgment favor and disfavor different social groups, and how those biases manifest outside of awareness or control.

AB  - Allport's intergroup contact theory has been used to explain how contact between members of different groups influences the level of acceptance that members of those groups hold towards members of other groups, and to guide the design of programs to increase tolerance. In this study, we examined intergroup contact and social distance data provided by ethnic Hungarians and ethnic Romanians in Romania with respect to each other and the Roma (Gypsy) minority. Hungarians and Romanians reported more contact with members of each other's groups than with Roma. Hungarians and Romanians also reported greater social distance from Roma than from each other's groups. These results are interpreted in terms of intergroup contact theory, with recommendations for increasing tolerance towards the Roma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate an instrument designed to assess health promotion in the school environment.
   METHODS: A questionnaire, based on guidelines from the World Health Organization and in line with the Brazilian school health context, was developed to validate the research instrument. There were 60 items in the instrument that included 40 questions for the school manager and 20 items with direct observations made by the interviewer. The items' content validation was performed using the Delphi technique, with the instrument being applied in 53 schools from two medium-sized cities in the South region of Brazil. Reliability (Cronbach's alpha and split-half) and validity (principal component analysis) analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: The final instrument remained composed of 28 items, distributed into three dimensions: pedagogical, structural and relational. The resulting components showed good factorial loads (>0.4) and acceptable reliability (>0.6) for most items. The pedagogical dimension identifies educational activities regarding drugs and sexuality, violence and prejudice, auto care and peace and quality of life. The structural dimension is comprised of access, sanitary structure, and conservation and equipment. The relational dimension includes relationships within the school and with the community.
   CONCLUSIONS: The proposed instrument presents satisfactory validity and reliability values, which include aspects relevant to promote health in schools. Its use allows the description of the health promotion conditions to which students from each educational institution are exposed. Because this instrument includes items directly observed by the investigator, it should only be used during periods when there are full and regular activities at the school in question.

AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Peer review of journal articles is an important step in the research process. Editors rely on the expertise of peer reviewers to properly assess submissions. Yet, peer review quality varies widely and few receive training or guidance in how to approach the task.
   This paper describes some of the main steps that peer reviewers in general and, in particular, those performing reviewes of randomised controlled trials (RCT), can use when carrying out a review. It can be helpful to begin with a brief read to acquaint yourself with the study, followed by a detailed read and a careful check for flaws. These can be divided into 'major' (problems that must be resolved before publication can be considered) and 'minor' (suggested improvements that are discretionary) flaws. Being aware of the appropriate reporting checklist for the study being reviewed (such as CONSORT and its extensions for RCTs) can also be valuable.
   Competing interests or prejudices might corrode the review, so ensuring transparency about them is important. Finally, ensuring that the paper's strengths are acknowledged along with a dissection of the weaknesses provides balance and perspective to both authors and editors. Helpful reviews are constructive and improve the quality of the paper. The proper conduct of a peer review is the responsibility of all who accept the role.

AB  - The power of social networking sites increases in direct proportion with their functionalities so that the popularity and sweep of these sites greatly affect the users' prejudice and thoughts towards them. It is clear that social networking and social media have a large influence on the way people think and behave. In particular, Facebook has a broad participation all over the Internet. Through the years, the interface and functionality of Facebook have changed and transformed from a university-only communication tool to one of the most well known websites online. Educational institutions are increasingly using Facebook to connect with registered students and to grasp the potential one. This paper aims to demonstrate how the use of Facebook has changed over a time. That is to say, the purpose is to examine how the university students' opinions and usage of Facebook in education changed from the year 2009 to 2013. This research involves 382 students from two different universities in North Cyprus. The "Facebook Usage Ouestionnaire" was used to collect data. The result of this research indicated that perceptions and usage of Facebook have changed and expanded over the years and also Facebook has become an important tool for education.

AB  - The claim that ethnic diversity within the living environment would hamper bonding and bridging social capital has been studied extensively, producing highly inconsistent findings. We studied whether ethnic diversity effects depend on the geographic scale at which ethnic diversity is measured. We examined ethnic diversity effects on intra- and inter-ethnic contacts in the neighborhood, respectively on opposition to ethnic in- and out-group neighbors. Hypotheses were derived from Blau's meeting opportunities thesis and contact theory, ethnic competition theory, and constrict theory. Using information about 2545 Dutch respondents with their locality defined as egohoods and administrative units, we found that ethnic diversity effects vary with the geographic scale. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is positively associated with bridging social capital. At larger scales, the findings are mixed: ethnic diversity is positively related to inter-ethnic contacts and opposition to out-group neighbors. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is negatively related to bonding social capital. In contrast to often-made claims that diversity within the local context would matter most, estimates of diversity effects are not always stronger when diversity measures are aggregated to smaller geographic areas.

AB  - Level of formal education is an important divide in contemporary societies; it is positively related to health, well-being, and social attitudes such as tolerance for minorities and interest in politics. We investigated whether education-based identification is a common underlying factor of these education effects. Indeed, education-based identification was stronger among the higher educated, especially for identification aspects that encompass education-based group esteem (i.e., the belief that one's educational group is worthy and that others think so, too). Furthermore, while group esteem had beneficial effects across educational levels, aspects of identification that were unrelated to group esteem had positive effects for the higher educated but not for the less educated. Thus, the less educated do not benefit from the psychologically nourishing effect of identification that exists for other groups. The stigma and responsibility related to low education could be a common explanation for a wide range of outcomes.

AB  - This paper focuses on the neglected issue of encounters with difference within the context of family life at a moment in time when families are increasingly characterised by dissimilarity as a product of mobility and individualisation. The study upon which this paper is based involved both a survey of social attitudes (survey n = 3021) and qualitative multi-stage research (n = 60). The evidence of the findings is that intra-familial diversity does produce more positive attitudes in public life towards the specific social group that an individual family member is perceived to represent. However, such positive attitudes are not translated beyond this specific difference' to challenge wider prejudices towards other groups. As such, this research contributes to literatures on geographies of encounter and the geographies of family life by exposing the limits of intimate contact with difference in changing the way social relationships are lived in the wider world.

AB  - Objective: To determine the levels of oxidant, antioxidant and serum enzymes in thalassaemic children receiving multiple blood transfusions.
   Methods: The case-control study was done from February to August 2012, and comprised thalassaemic children receiving multiple blood transfusions at Allied Hospital, Ali Zeb Foundation, and the Thalassaemia Centre in Hilal-e-Ahmar Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Healthy subjects were also screened for any related disease condition that could prejudice the results. Blood samples were analysed for the values of total oxidant status, total antioxidant capacity, serum malondialdehyde, catalase, paraoxonase, arylesterase, glutathione peroxidase and ceruloplasmin.
   Results: There were 180 children in the study; 90(50%) cases and 90(50%) controls. Of the cases, 48(53.3%) were under-weight while the weight of 42(46.7%) was in the normal range. The values of total oxidant status and total antioxidant capacity were significantly (p<0.01) higher in thalassaemic children compared to normal values. Serum malondialdehyde and catalase levels were also considerably elevated (p<0.05), suggesting the increased activity of these enzymes. However, the concentrations of serum paraoxonase, arylesterase, glutathione peroxidase were significantly (p<0.01) lower in cases than the controls, displaying diminished activities during multiple blood transfusions in these patients.
   Conclusion: Multiple blood transfusions disconcert the levels of oxidants, antioxidants and serum enzymes of thalassaemic children. Oxidative damage is seen because of the increased iron overload in these patients. Hence, regular evaluation of oxidant and antioxidant status should bemonitored in thalassaemic patients during initial few years of life.

AB  - We argue that residential exposure to ethnic diversity reduces social trust. Previous within-country analyses of the relationship between contextual ethnic diversity and trust have been conducted at higher levels of aggregation, thus ignoring substantial variation in actual exposure to ethnic diversity. In contrast, we analyze how ethnic diversity of the immediate micro-contextwhere interethnic exposure is inevitableaffects trust. We do this using Danish survey data linked with register-based data, which enables us to obtain precise measures of the ethnic diversity of each individual's residential surroundings. We focus on contextual diversity within a radius of 80 meters of a given individual, but we also compare the effect in the micro-context to the impact of diversity in more aggregate contexts. Our results show that ethnic diversity in the micro-context affects trust negatively, whereas the effect vanishes in larger contextual units. This supports the conjecture that interethnic exposure underlies the negative relationship between ethnic diversity in residential contexts and social trust.

AB  - Jokes have been recognized as ways in which negative attitudes and prejudice can be communicated and enacted in hidden ways (e. g., Allport 1954; Freud 2004 [1905]). In this paper, we review the existing literature on the functions and effects of sexist humor, using Martineau's (1972) model on the social functions of humor as well as Tajfel and Turner's (2004 [1986]) Social Identity Theory (SIT) and Turner et al.'s (1987) Self Categorization Theory. Within these frameworks, we particularly focus on sex as an intergroup context and on the way sexist humor functions to a) enhance male in-group cohesion (sexist humor as a predictor) b) serves as a form of sexual harassment (sexist humor as an outcome) and c) amplifies self-reported rape proclivity and victim blame (sexist humor as a moderator). The paper concludes by highlighting gaps in the existing literature and providing directions for future research.

AB  - Background: Youth with disabilities experience greater levels of peer victimization and psychosocial distress than non-disabled youth. However, the extent to which exposure to peer victimization mediates the relationship between disability status and psychosocial distress is unknown.
   Objective: To determine whether the relationship between disability status and psychological distress was mediated by exposure to peer victimization, and if so, whether the mediation effects of peer victimization on psychosocial distress was moderated by sex.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study involved a series of regressions to test for mediation and moderated mediation using complex survey data from 6664 Oregon 11th graders.
   Results: Peer victimization partially mediated the relationship between disability status and psychosocial distress. Sex, however, did not significantly moderate the mediating effects of peer victimization on psychosocial distress.
   Conclusion: Exposure to peer victimization mediated the relationship between disability status and psychosocial distress; there was little support for sex as a moderator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Is East Asian religious tolerance, as opposed to Western monotheistic prejudice, a stereotype or a reality? Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, we hypothesized low prejudice as a function of East Asian religiosity. We examined whether this holds true for interreligious, anti-atheist, ethnic, and anti-gay prejudice. In Study 1, analysis of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2008 data from Eastern religious and Christian samples in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (total N = 3,555) showed, contrarily to Christians, high interreligious tolerance and weaker if no anti-gay prejudice as a function of Eastern religiosity. In Study 2, Eastern religiosity among Taiwanese (n = 222) was negatively related to prejudice against various religious outgroups (except atheists), especially among those low in authoritarianism. In Study 3, Eastern religiosity among Taiwanese (n = 102) was negatively related to implicit interreligious (Muslims) and ethnic (Africans) prejudice; prosociality partially mediated the former association. Eastern religious tolerance seems to be true, but not unlimited.

AB  - The results of four studies suggest that contamination concerns involved in prejudice towards male homosexuals may be expressed in the increased need for physical cleansing after an imagined contact with a homosexual man. Participants in Study 1 completed word fragments according to the theme of cleansing, and in Study 2, they chose a cleansing wipe more often after imagining using a mobile phone of a homosexual (vs. heterosexual) man. The need for cleansing was specific to the body parts engaged in the contact In Study 3, participants evaluated hand and mouth cleansing products as more desirable after imagining using a mobile phone of a homosexual (vs. heterosexual) man. The specific need for cleansing, but not the accessibility of cleansing related words, was more pronounced among political conservatives (Study 4). The results are discussed with reference to the behavioral immune system hypothesis, research on moral disgust, and the embodiment literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on ideological attitudes has identified two main dimensions that refer to two fundamental features of group organization: social solidarity and social control. In response to prior research that has studied their relationship mainly from a correlational perspective, this paper introduces a social reality model based on psychological functionality of ideological attitudes. Social position variables (education, income and material vulnerability) and insecurity variables (fear of crime and distrust) are used to predict the interplay between ideological attitudes towards social solidarity and social control. Using K-means cluster analysis, a typology with four patterns of support for solidarity and control (socials', repressives', minimalists' and social-repressives') was created, on the basis of representative survey data for the UK, France and Germany (N=7034). Results from logistic regression analyses show that the proposed social reality model explains membership in typology categories, with similar results across the three countries. Overall, the model underscores the social origins of ideological attitudes as functional responses to perceived social reality. The paper illustrates how the social psychological study of ideological attitudes may be enriched by a typological approach that examines patterns of attitudes rather than single dimensions.

AB  - The present research investigated whether having out-group friends serves as a buffer for feeling misunderstood in interracial interactions. Across three experience sampling studies, we found that among ethnic minorities who have few White friends or are not interacting with White friends, daily interracial interactions are associated with feeling less understood. By contrast, we found that among ethnic minorities who have more White friends or are interacting with White friends, the relationship between daily interracial interactions and feeling understood is not significant. We did not find similar results for Whites; that is, having ethnic minority friends did not play a role in the relationship between daily interracial interactions and feeling understood. Together, these studies demonstrate the beneficial effects of intergroup friendships for ethnic minorities.

AB  - Disgust is linked to social evaluation. People with higher disgust sensitivity exhibit more sexual prejudice, and inducing disgust increases sexual prejudice. We tested whether inducing moral elevation, the theoretical opposite of disgust, would reduce sexual prejudice. In four studies (N = 3622), we induced elevation with inspiring videos and then measured sexual prejudice with implicit and explicit measures. Compared to control videos that elicited no particular affective state, we found that elevation reduced implicit and explicit sexual prejudice, albeit very slightly. No effect was observed when the target of social evaluation was changed to race (Black-White). Inducing amusement, another positive emotion, did not significantly affect sexual prejudice. We conclude that elevation weakly but reliably reduces prejudice towards gay men.

AB  - Social psychology instructors from five distinct state universities in California examined the effect of incorporating the implicit association test (IAT) in a teaching module on students' perceived knowledge of implicit biases and motivation to control prejudice. Students (N - 258) completed a knowledge survey on prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination and a motivation to control prejudice scale before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) a teaching module on implicit and explicit prejudice that included taking the IAT. Results showed that students' perceived knowledge of implicit biases increased after completing the teaching module. In addition, the more students displayed an implicit bias against African Americans (relative to European Americans), the more they reported mastering course material about implicit biases and the more they indicated being internally motivated to control prejudice (at Time 2). These findings suggest that using the IAT as a teaching tool might be a beneficial learning experience, in particular for individuals who display relatively pronounced implicit biases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To comprehend the perception of body image in adolescence.
   METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with eight focus groups with 96 students of both sexes attending four public elementary school institutions in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil, in 2013. An interview guide with questions about the adolescents' feelings in relation to: their bodies, standards of idealized beauty, practice of physical exercise and sociocultural influences on self-image. In the data analysis we sought to understand and interpret the meanings and contradictions of narratives, understanding the subjects' context and reasons and the internal logic of the group.
   RESULTS: Three thematic categories were identified. The influence of media on body image showed the difficulty of achieving the perfect body and is viewed with suspicion in face of standards of beauty broadcast; the importance of a healthy body was observed as standards of beauty and good looks were closely linked to good physical condition and result from having a healthy body; the relationship between the standard of beauty and prejudice, as people who are not considered attractive, having small physical imperfections, are discriminated against and can be rejected or even excluded from society.
   CONCLUSIONS: The standard of perfect body propagated by media influences adolescents' self-image and, consequently, self-esteem and is considered an unattainable goal, corresponding to a standard of beauty described as artificial and unreal. However, it causes great suffering and discrimination against those who do not feel they are attractive, which can lead to health problems resulting from low self-esteem.

AB  - You can trust your friends. You should trust your friends. Not all of your friends all of the time: you can reasonably trust different friends to different degrees, and in different domains. Still, we often trust our friends, and it is often reasonable to do so. Why is this? In this paper I explore how and whether friendship gives us reasons to trust our friends, reasons which may outstrip or conflict with our epistemic reasons. In the final section, I will sketch some related questions concerning trust based on the trustee's race, gender, or other social identity.

AB  - Many economic environments exhibit payoff discontinuity and indeterminacy, particularly those involving factors that are not under the deliberate control of players, such as prejudicial bias and trust. Simon and Zame (1990) introduce the concept of sharing rules as a means for endogenously resolving such indeterminacy when the player set is finite. We extend the Simon and Zame methodology to environments including large players whose individual actions may be felt economy-wide as well as infinitesimal players whose actions impact others only through the aggregate behavior of the demographic groups to which they belong. In effect, our analysis endogenizes the equilibrium actions of economic agents as well as the social conventions and personal beliefs that prevail. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social representations of addiction and the resulting stigmatization have been widely described and studied in the literature, but their effects are no less problematic. These representations, which also occur in care settings, generate a climate of distrust which damages the therapeutic relationship, and its ethical quality. This article, combining clinical experience and an ethical stance, offers an original, innovating approach to the existence of distrust in care relationships in the area of addiction. Pragmatic approaches deriving from the human sciences and analytical philosophy provide an invitation to escape from the demanding climate of mistrust, and to take the gamble on trust so as to improve the quality of interactions between protagonists in care. In complementary fashion, a sociology of action can combat the disquiet generated by distrust through a new commitment to innovating forms of action. This "poetic" mode of action is legitimized by the reflection that backs it up, and by its presentation to peers qualified to approve it. Finally, continental moral philosophy underlines the importance of a carefully weighed commitment on the part of caregivers and addicted patients towards promises aiming to support a sincere care relationship, without damaging the therapeutic dynamic or the ethical quality by providing too many safety nets. This reflection is intended to achieve better identification of the clinical and ethical issues raised by mistrust, and inclusion of these aspects in the training of personnel and in care provision planning.

AB  - Exclusion triggers a desire to re-capture connections with others. To facilitate this goal, excluded individuals typically process social information especially carefully. One implication of this is that exclusion may foster judgments of others that are reliant on a careful consideration of their idiosyncratic behaviors rather than on more superficial features. We predicted, therefore, that excluded individuals should individuate more and stereotype less than non-excluded individuals and that such effects should be in service of identifying appropriate re-affiliation candidates. In 3 replications of Experiment 1, excluded (compared to non-excluded) individuals rendered less stereotypic judgments of occupational and racial group members described with mildly or ambiguously counter-stereotypic information. Confirming such processes aid with re-affiliation, Experiments 2 and 3 showed that these effects occurred for social targets that represented reasonable sources of re-affiliation, but not for offensive social targets (i.e., Skinheads) or non-social agents. Experiment 4 underscored that excluded participants process presented social information more carefully (individuate), showing greater differentiation in judgments of highly stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent targets. Implications for the social exclusion literature are discussed.

AB  - In the present study, participants administered painful electric shocks to an unseen male opponent who was either explicitly labeled as gay or stereotypically implied to be gay. Identifying the opponent with a gay-stereotypic attribute produced a situation in which the target's group status was privately inferred but plausibly deniable to others. To test the plausible deniability hypothesis, we examined aggression levels as a function of internal (personal) and external (social) motivation to respond without prejudice. Whether plausible deniability was present or absent, participants high in internal motivation aggressed at low levels, and participants low in both internal and external motivation aggressed at high levels. The behavior of participants low in internal and high in external motivation, however, depended on experimental condition. They aggressed at low levels when observers could plausibly attribute their behavior to prejudice and aggressed at high levels when the situation granted plausible deniability. This work has implications for both obstacles to and potential avenues for prejudice-reduction efforts.

AB  - Background: The literature has rarely paid attention to the differential influence of intergroup contact on subtle and blatant prejudice. In this study, we hypothesized that the influence of intergroup contact on subtle prejudice will be smaller than its influence on blatant prejudice. Method: This hypothesis was tested with data from a cross-sectional design on 1,655 school-aged native Spanish adolescents. Prejudice was measured with a shortened version of the Meertens and Pettigrew scale of blatant and subtle prejudice adapted to Spanish adolescent population. Results: Results from multivariate multilevel analyses for correlated outcome variables supported the hypothesis. Students tended to score higher on the subtle prejudice scale; contact with the outgroup was statistically related both to levels of blatant and subtle prejudice; and, the negative relationship of contact with the outgroup and prejudice is greater for blatant prejudice as compared to subtle prejudice. Conclusions: Overall, results provide statistical evidence supporting the greater resistance to change of subtle forms of prejudice.

AB  - This paper explores the issue of territorial stigmatisation through tenant-driven research chronicling the experiences of social housing tenants as they examined and reflected upon the Australian television series Housos. The television series aired on an independent, part publicly funded, television station in 2011 and depicts the lifestyles of fictional tenant characters on an imaginary social housing estate. The series presents satirical and exaggerated parodies about everyday life on the estate, drawing on a range of stereotypes of social housing tenants. Tenants are portrayed as feckless and antisocial individuals who engage in a range of irresponsible and sometimes criminal behaviour in order to avoid work and whose family and other relationships are dysfunctional. Public tenants are far from passive victims of stigmatisation and conducted the analysis presented in this study. They reveal a sophisticated understanding of how stigma operates through the media, various agencies, and the nonresident community. While economic and political forces, and changing modes for governing poverty, have resulted in geographical confinement of residents on estates, tenants reflected on their own 'real-life' experiences and provide accounts of deliberate and self-conscious use of 'negative' social status to produce positive collective identities. Alternatively, nontenant participants repeated common prejudices about public housing, and reflected on their belief that the system was not effectively preventing welfare cheats and 'bludgers' from loafing at their (taxpayers') expense.

AB  - Thai females injecting drugs are ensnared in a web of problems arising from forms of prejudice that magnify their vulnerability. They are vulnerable, at risk, and exposed to a high degree of social suffering. This paper aims to elucidate how social production and structural violence combine to shape the lives of these women. Using a qualitative methodology, two focus groups with 5 key informants and in-depth interviews involving a total of 35 women injecting drugs were conducted in Bangkok. The findings reveal that the structural environment that directly impacts upon these women's lives becomes the reason for their suffering. The structural environment puts these women at risk of violence in numerous social settings in which these women engage as well as generating tension at a subjective level (i.e. the habitus) of these women. Thai female injecting drug users are trapped in a difficult tension between the demands for being Thai women seeking to exist in the masculine world of drug use but at the same time meeting Thai society's expectations of womanhood. Unequal gender relations are manifest in the everyday violence that women face in the drug community, culminating in the essential nature of women being questioned, undermined and threatened. Living in the drug community, women are subjected to violence and harassment, and-gendered brutality by intimate partners. In conclusion, the social suffering that Thai female injecting drug users find themselves confronting is confined to dilemmas cause by tensions between drug use and the overriding gender habitus.

AB  - Though the distant Other, the faceless stranger becomes ever closer and more accessible through various technological mediations and social networks, we seem to grow increasingly disconnected from any possibility of what Levinas calls 'proximity'. 'Proximity' - the face-to-face encounter with the other person - signals a traumatising indictment of the gravitational pull of our egoism rooted in what Spinoza referred to as our conatus essendi. Rather than individualistic self-actualisation, Levinas sees brotherhood as the fundamental presupposition of our shared humanity and as the foundation of freedom and equality. While rather unethical than immoral, it is our very conatus that seems to open the door to indifference, prejudice and hate. On the other hand, the possibility of ethical action, of a humane society, is something that Levinas attempts to account for by the help of a responsibility more fundamental than our ontological blueprint.

Socially constructed representations directly affect lack of success in the treatment process, frustration and lack of faith on the part of the health care professionals and the frequent relapses and re-hospitalizations of patients, especially crack users. Besides playing reproducing an obsolete prohibitionist policy obsolete, they reinforce prejudices, and lead to discriminatory enforcement measures result, rejecting passing over citizens'hip rights.

AB  - Recent years have seen increasing attention to E. M. Forster's approach to issues of race and ethnicity, including how Forster's oeuvre advances problematic views of foreign cultures. Nevertheless, the criticism on Forster's Italian novels has lagged behind, with readers continuing to emphasize how Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905) and A Room with a View (1908) valorize Italian culture and undermine prejudiced assumptions of English cultural superiority. This article considers the portrayal of English social non-conformists in Forster's Italy, individuals whose interactions with Italian people and landscapes inspire them to develop new ways of approaching class and gender as well as nation and ethnicity. I reveal that while the Italian novels use this trope of the non-conformist to stress a foreign culture's power to generate reform at home, they also overemphasize the cultural difference that separates Italy from England, indulging in primitivist, patronizing depictions of Italian spaces and people. The novels also exhibit a problematic narrative impulse to sacrifice their Italian characters for the benefit of their Englishmen and Englishwomen, imagining the lives and especially the deaths of Italians as a tool for enlightening the English tourist. This discontinuity in Forster exemplifies the persistent essentialization of Italy in twentieth-century Anglo-American fiction.

AB  - Recent developments in feminism, charted in Gender, Place and Culture over the past 21 years, have stressed the relational, differentiated and contested nature of gender. This has led to the rejection of the unified category women, and with this the right for feminism to make claims on behalf of all women. This paper argues that an unintended consequence of this development in ways of thinking about gender is that patriarchy as a form of power relations has become relatively neglected. It draws on research from a European Research Council project (including biographical interviews and case studies of a gym and workplace) to demonstrate that while the development of equality legislation has contained the public expression of the most blatant forms of gender prejudice, sexism persists and is manifest in subtle ways. As a consequence, it can be difficult to name and challenge with the effect that patriarchy as a power structure which systematically (re) produces gender inequalities, is obscured by its ordinariness. Rather, sexism appears only to be 'seen' when it affords the instantiation of other forms of prejudice, such as Islamophobia. As such, we argue that Gender, Place and Culture has a responsibility going forward to make sexism as a particular form of prejudice more visible, while also exposing the complexity and fluidity of its intersectional relationship to other forms of oppression and social categories.

AB  - Background: For persons with mental illness, stigma diminishes employment and independent living opportunities as well as participation in psychiatric care. Public stigma interventions have sought to ameliorate these consequences.
   Aims: Evaluation of anti-stigma programs' impact is typically accomplished with self-report questionnaires. However, cultural mores encourage endorsement of answers that are socially preferred rather than one's true belief. This problem, social desirability, has been circumvented through development of faux Knowledge Tests (KTs) (i.e. Error-Choice Tests); written to assess prejudice.
   Method: Our KT uses error-choice test methodology to assess stigmatizing attitudes. Test content was derived from review of typical KTs for facade reinforcement. Answer endorsement suggests bias or stigma; such determinations were based on the empirical literature.
   Results: KT psychometrics were examined in samples of college students, community members and mental health providers and consumers. Test-retest reliability ranged from fair (0.50) to good (0.70). Construct validity analyses of public stigma indicated a positive relationship with the Attribution Questionnaire and inverse relationships with Self-Determination and Empowerment Scales. No significant relationships were observed with self-stigma measures (recovery, empowerment).
   Conclusions: This psychometric evaluation study suggests that a self-administered questionnaire may circumvent social desirability and have merit as a stigma measurement tool.

AB  - Prejudice against obese people has been widely confirmed in scientific papers. Therefore, recent studies have increasingly focused on investigating the individual and cultural factors related to attitudes towards obesity. Since there have been no comparative studies involving Gypsy people, our present research aimed at exploring the possible discrepancies in children's attitudes towards obese children between Gypsy and Hungarian cultures. Our survey included 247 children aged 9-16 (108 boys and 139 girls), of which 136 considered themselves Hungarian (55.1 %), while 111 children (44.9 %) claimed themselves as Gypsy. The subjects were asked to rank six male and six female figure drawings according to their preference. Each sequence of figure drawings included a healthy child, an obese child, and four drawings depicted children with disabilities. According to our results, the drawings portraying the healthy child figure were rated most preferable and those portraying the obese child figure the least preferable amongst the subjects regardless of gender and origin. However, the obese girl figures and boy figures were rated significantly more positively by Gypsy children than Hungarian children. Our results suggest that there is a difference in attitude towards obesity among Gypsy and Hungarian children. Therefore, it is worthwhile to further explore this phenomenon.

AB  - System justification theory (SJT) posits that members of low-status groups are more likely to see their social systems as legitimate than members of high-status groups because members of low-status groups experience a sense of dissonance between system motivations and self/group motivations (Jost, Pelham, Sheldon, & Sullivan, 2003). The author examined the status-legitimacy hypothesis using data from 3 representative sets of data from the United States (American National Election Studies and General Social Surveys) and throughout the world (World Values Survey; total N across studies = 151,794). Multilevel models revealed that the average effect across years in the United States and countries throughout the world was most often directly contrary to the status-legitimacy hypothesis or was practically zero. In short, the status-legitimacy effect is not a robust phenomenon. Two theoretically relevant moderator variables (inequality and civil liberties) were also tested, revealing weak evidence, null evidence, or contrary evidence to the dissonance-inspired status-legitimacy hypothesis. In sum, the status-legitimacy effect is not robust and is unlikely to be the result of dissonance. These results are used to discuss future directions for research, the current state of SJT, and the interpretation of theoretically relevant but contrary and null results.

AB  - School-based psychological interventions which require students and pupils to think of counter-stereotypic individuals (e.g., a female mechanic, a Black President) have been shown to reduce stereotyping and prejudice. But while these interventions are increasingly popular, no one has tested whether tasks like this can have benefits beyond promoting tolerance, particularly with respect to the way individuals think and solve problems. We looked at one such intervention and asked whether this task could, in addition to decreasing propensities to stereotype others, contribute to more flexible and original performance. We expected that because exposure to people who disconfirm stereotypes compels students to think "out of the box", they will subsequently not only rely less on stereotypes, but in more general thinking rely less on easily accessible knowledge structures and be more flexible and creative. As predicted, being encouraged to think counter-stereotypically not only decreased stereotyping, but also, on a divergent creativity task, lead to the generation of more creative ideas - but only for individuals who initially reported a lower personal need for structure (PNS).

AB  - This paper draws on empirical research conducted as part of a study funded by the European Research Council to explore how individuals understand and live processes of social differentiation. Specifically, it draws on a case-study-life story narrative to examine how social identifications unfold across biographical time, examining the spatiotemporal complexity of experiences of differentiation, and the marginalization of self and/or others. In doing so, it contributes to the geographies of encounter literature by exploring the implications of insights from an individual's narrative of lived experiences of difference for group politics and the management of prejudicial social relations.

AB  - Although the study of intergroup bias has attracted substantial empirical interest within personality and social psychology, distinctions among types of bias, primarily prejudice and stereotyping, are often not fully considered. However, stereotyping and prejudice are conceptually and empirically distinct phenomena. We investigated how individual-difference variables distinctively predict stereotyping and prejudice, and examined the differential antecedents, dynamics, and consequences of these forms of intergroup bias. Personal Need for Structure predicted stereotyping, and Right-Wing Authoritarianism and intergroup contact predicted prejudice. In addition, stereotyping and prejudice had divergent dynamics with perceptions of out-groups' entitativity (i.e., out-groups' perceived unity, coherence, and internal organization). Specifically, entitativity mediated the relationship between Personal Need for Structure and stereotyping. In contrast, prejudice mediated the relationships of both Right-Wing Authoritarianism and intergroup contact with entitativity. Implications for theory and research on the predictors and dynamics of intergroup bias are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When individuals grow up with autonomy-thwarting parents, they may be prevented from exploring internally endorsed values and identities and as a result shut out aspects of the self perceived to be unacceptable. Given the stigmatization of homosexuality, individuals perceiving low autonomy support from parents may be especially motivated to conceal same-sex sexual attraction, leading to defensive processes such as reaction formation. Four studies tested a model wherein perceived parental autonomy support is associated with lower discrepancies between self-reported sexual orientation and implicit sexual orientation (assessed with a reaction time task). These indices interacted to predict anti-gay responding indicative of reaction formation. Studies 2-4 showed that an implicit/explicit discrepancy was particularly pronounced in participants who experienced their fathers as both low in autonomy support and homophobic, though results were inconsistent for mothers. Findings of Study 3 suggested contingent self-esteem as a link between parenting styles and discrepancies in sexual orientation measures.

AB  - Prejudice against individuals with mental illness stems from multiple factors, including the personality traits of those harboring the prejudiced attitudes. However, little is known about the personality processes (as opposed to static correlates) leading to negative attitudes and discrimination toward individuals with mental illness. The present research tested a mediational model in which negative attitudes against such people and resulting intentions to discriminate are distally rooted in just-world beliefs, which predispose people toward higher social dominance orientation, a well-known proximal personality predictor of general prejudice. Participants completed measures of behavioral intentions, attitudes toward individuals with mental illness, social dominance orientation, and belief in a just world. The proposed mediational model was supported, and an alternative causal model was not. These results illuminate the personality-process antecedents of attitudes toward individuals with mental illness and provide a foundation for research targeting interventions intended to reduce prejudice and discrimination against this population.

AB  - Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations of prejudice. We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U. S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models.

AB  - It is widely recognized that refugee integration occurs most effectively within communities that are rich in inter-cultural social capital. This paper explores the dangers associated with intensely bonded and disconnected communities and the relationship between refugee marginalization and the presence of youth gangs. Drawing upon a small-scale qualitative study with young refugees in Glasgow, it seeks to explore the extent to and ways in which these young people experience social bonding and bridging and participate in gang culture. The findings suggest that excessive bonding social capital often limits opportunities for inter-cultural integration in Glasgow. Gang membership, although driven primarily by territorial issues, provides one site for ethnic solidarity and racial prejudice. The paper considers the potential for community initiatives to build inter-cultural cohesion, and ends by calling for changes to dispersal policy and for further research to explore the most effective vehicles for building social capital in multi-ethnic urban communities.

AB  - A little-recognized fact is that social psychology and rehabilitation psychology share a common theoretical ancestry in the situation perspective of Kurt Lewin. Theory and research in both fields assumes that situational influences often override the impact of personal factors, including dispositions. Situational analyses led to the development of a variety of cognitive explanations capturing people's phenomenal accounts for the causes of behavior and concomitant interpretation of social problems. Teachers can explore reasons why, despite the fields' having a shared theoretical perspective and topics of common interest (e.g., attitudes, prejudice, discrimination), little scholarly intradisciplinary contact currently occurs between them.

AB  - In recent decades, narrative research has gained increasing prominence in social and health sciences. However, the role that narrative research has played in social policy-making efforts has been small compared to that of quantitative research. This paper highlights the ways in which theoretical stances, questions, methods, and findings from narrative research can be useful in social policy-making arenas. Particular attention is paid to research conducted in the narrative study of lives tradition in psychology, gerontology, and related social sciences. Narrative research that seeks to understand individual lives in all their complexity and in the contexts in which they are lived can be particularly useful in informing sexuality-related policy concerns given the complex nature of sexuality. By focusing on the current policy concern of same-sex relationship recognition, this paper demonstrates that (a) narrative research offers much to the study of social policy and social justice via its ability to illuminate the complex interplay between everyday lived experience and social structures and (b) there is a need to redefine what counts as research evidence in policy-making efforts to be more inclusive of narrative work. In making these arguments, examples of recent narrative research are highlighted regarding their direct relevance to sexuality-related social policy. The paper concludes with suggestions by which researchers and policy makers can productively incorporate narrative research into their work by focusing on the complimentary potential for findings from quantitative and narrative research.

AB  - Could simply imagining positive interactions promote tolerance between different social groups? This imagined contact hypothesis (Crisp & Turner, 2009) is just one example of a range of psychological interventions that capitalize on people's capacity for mental simulation. The approach is controversial, perhaps because imagery appears somewhat insubstantial when set against the visceral realities of war, deep-rooted prejudices, or extreme acts of genocide. We counter that mental simulation is an essential element of the human experience and, as such, a correspondingly critical component of behavioral change strategies. This argument is supported by considering imagery's central role in advances spanning the breadth of psychological science-from studies of the biological correlates of motor control, mimicry, and theory of mind to the cognitions and emotions that characterize reasoning, self-regulation, planning, and goal pursuit. Mental simulation is not merely a proxy for real experience: It is a critical cognition that precedes and precipitates the full spectrum of human behavior. Thus, while imagery techniques may appear trivial next to pervasive problems like prejudice, this should not distract us from the power and potential they offer as tools for transforming social policy.

AB  - This paper reviews the seminal theories of social psychology which have guided scholarship on inter-group conflicts and describes how these theories have been used by conflict resolution practitioners to design Track Two diplomacy initiatives among citizens in conflict zones. The authors hope that such a review will provide scholars of conflict resolution and international politics with a better understanding of how complex social theories are adapted for use in the applied world, and how gaps between theory and practice can be identified and addressed. The paper begins with an overview of three of the main theoretical contributions of social psychology to the problem of inter-group conflict: social identity theory, stereotyping and prejudice, and contact theory. We then review how these theories have been applied by conflict resolution specialists in international and ethnic conflicts as they have sought to moderate intergroup hostilities in conflict zones. The paper concludes with an analysis of the gaps between theory and practice, namely: theory of change gap, transfer strategies gap, and unit of analysis gap. Finally, based on the reviewed social psychology research, the article makes policy recommendations about how these gaps between theory and practice can be narrowed.

AB  - In this study we focus on the relationship between ethnic diversity and informal social capital. As this refers to rather strong social ties in the intimate domain, it is a strict test of Putnam's claim that ethnic diversity would decrease social capital. In order to explain these relationships, we derived mediating mechanisms from conflict and contact theory. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002/2003), we applied multilevel analyses considering three levels: individuals, regions and countries. Our results revealed a direct positive effect of ethnic diversity at the country level on informal helping, yet no indirect effect via the mediating variables. At the regional level, we only found an indirect effect of ethnic diversity. Here, ethnic diversity increases the likelihood of intergroup contact that in turn is positively related to both informal social meeting and helping. Perceived ethnic threat turned out to have a negative effect on informal social meeting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to assess the determinants of homophobia among Belgian adolescents, a shortened version of the Homophobia scale (Wright et al., 1999) was included in a representative survey among Belgian adolescents (n = 4,870). Principal component analysis demonstrated that the scale was one-dimensional and internally coherent. The results showed that homophobia is still widespread among Belgian adolescents, despite various legal reforms in the country aiming to combat discrimination of gay women and men. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that boys, ethnic minorities, individuals with high levels of ethnocentrism and an instrumental worldview, Muslim minorities, and those with low levels of associational involvement scored significantly higher on the scale. While among boys an extensive friendship network was associated with higher levels of homophobia, the opposite phenomenon was found among girls. We discuss the possible relation between notions of masculinity within predominantly male adolescent friendship networks and social support for homophobia.

AB  - This qualitative descriptive study, guided by the Social Representations Theory, aimed to describe the content of the social representations regarding the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for seropositive individuals in outpatient monitoring of the public health network and to analyze the interface of the social representations of AIDS with the quotidian of the individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), especially in the adherence to treatment process Interviews were conducted with 30 seropositive individuals and the manual content analysis technique was used. From the analysis, six categories emerged that re-translated the quotidian of seropositive people permeated by the stigma, prejudice, struggle for life and the need for the continuous use of antiretrovirals. AIDS was assimilated to chronic diseases such as diabetes, showing a trend of transformation of the social representation of AIDS, substituting the idea of death, with life. It is concluded that people living with HIV are more optimistic due to effective treatments for the control of the disease.

AB  - Objective: Inhibiting the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) appears to have deleterious effects on people's semantic conceptualization, and left ATL damage is associated with semantic dementia. However, little research has investigated whether rTMS can inhibit conceptual schemata that have potentially negative consequences. Our aim was to investigate whether rTMS to the ATLs could reduce scores on a standard measure of prejudice (implicit association test, IAT). Method: Forty (17 female; mean age 20.6) neurologically normal, right-handed undergraduates participated. Participants were randomly allocated into one of four rTMS stimulation conditions left ATL, right ATL. control site (motor cortex, Cz), and sham stimulation. All participants completed a modified IAT, where "good" and "bad" words were replaced with "terrorist" and "law-abider" words, and. "Black" and "White" were replaced with "Arab" and "Non-Arab" words. Participants were then given 15 min of rTMS stimulation. Afterward, participants completed a parallel form of the IAT. Results: To investigate the effects of rTMS on IAT scores, a one-way ANOVA on the difference between pre- and postscores was carried out revealing that there were significant between group differences (F3,36 = 3.57; p = 02). Planned contrasts revealed that both left and right ATL stimulation significantly reduced IAT scores poststimulation, indicating lower prejudice. Conclusion: We show that prejudice scores can be significantly reduced by inhibitory rTMS delivered to the bilateral ATLs. This may implicate this area in conceptual associations that lead to overgeneralization and stereotyping of social groups.

AB  - The social justice paradigm, developed in philosophy by John Rawls and others, reaches limits when confronted with diverse populations, unsound governments, and global markets. Its parameters are further limited by a traditional utilitarian approach to both industrial actors and consumer behaviors. Finally, by focusing too exclusively on poverty, as manifested in insufficient incomes or resources, the paradigm overlooks the oppressive role that gender, race, and religious prejudice play in keeping the poor subordinated. The authors suggest three ways in which marketing researchers could bring their unique expertise to the question of social justice in a global economy: by (1) reinventing the theoretical foundation laid down by thinkers such as Rawls, (2) documenting and evaluating emergent "feasible fixes" to achieve justice (e.g., the global resource dividend, cause-related marketing, Fair Trade, philanthrocapitalism), and (3) exploring the parameters of the consumption basket that would be minimally required to achieve human capabilities.

AB  - Do Third Country Nationals in Slovenia Face Prejudice and Discrimination?
   Abstract: This article presents the results of a study on Third Country Nationals [TCNs] who live in Slovenia. The article focuses on discrimination on ethnic and racial grounds and explores whether TCNs experience discrimination on these grounds in five areas of their lives: housing, schooling, health care, the labour market and in contacts with public administration. The author identifies three factors that at least partially explain the different experiences and degrees of discrimination reported by interviewees.

AB  - In Turkey, one of the major challenges that university education faces is the indifference of young people towards social issues. The aim of this article is to contribute to the practice of critical pedagogy by proposing that showing movies is an important critical teaching method with the power both to give pleasure to the students and to develop their interest in crucial social issues. To support our argument, we showed three movies to students taking Sociology and Social Psychology courses in three successive academic terms on the topics 'the death penalty', 'gender equality' and 'prejudice'. Analysing the essays which the students were asked to write on these movies, we observed growing interest and an increase in critical thinking on the issues in question. We then conducted a survey to test this change quantitatively. The results indicate that showing movies is very influential in helping students to develop an interest and critical perspective.

AB  - 'Once you get here, you realize that thinking Foucault was writing for you was terribly naive, since in reality I did not exist as a subject for anyone like Foucault, or if I did it was only as an object of study', recalls one of the protagonists in this essay, a collage of fragments of interviews with foreign immigrants from impoverished countries who have settled in Barcelona and other Catalan towns in recent years. Widespread prejudice in the host society dictates that these people are generalized as being on a lower cultural level, anonymous members of the growing mass of immigrants prepared to work at any price. The prejudice seems to be confirmed by the fact that the great majority of them do low-skilled or unskilled work in sectors such as the building trade, hotels and restaurants and domestic service. The reality, however, is very different. The average level of formal education of these immigrants is similar to that of the host population. It is the precariousness of their legal status or the often insurmountable barriers preventing recognition of their academic and/or professional qualifications, or simply cultural prejudice, that condemn them to accept jobs well below their personal potential. Thus, the host society wastes social and cultural capital of the first order, and lays foundations for a permanent division between 'us' and 'them'. This essay offers a modest but revealing sample of the quality and diversity of the ideas and viewpoints of the immigrants themselves, an asset we continue to at best underestimate or more often ignore altogether.
   Resume
   'Une fois sur place, on realise combien il etait terriblement naif de penser que Foucault ecrivait pour nous car, en fait, pour quelqu'un comme lui, je n'existais pas en tant que sujet, si ce n'est que comme sujet d'etude', se souvient l'une des protagonistes de ce travail compose d'extraits d'entretiens avec des immigrants etrangers venus de pays pauvres pour s'installer a Barcelone et dans d'autres villes catalanes au cours de ces dernieres annees. Dans la societe d'accueil, un prejuge courant veut que ces personnes soient d'un niveau culturel inferieur, membres anonymes de la masse croissante d'immigrants prets a travailler a n'importe quel prix. L'apriori est apparemment confirme par le fait que la tres grande majorite d'entre eux occupent des postes peu ou pas qualifies dans des secteurs tels que le batiment, le menage dans les hotels et le travail domestique. Toutefois, la realite est tres differente. Le niveau moyen de formation de ces immigrants equivaut a celui de la population d'accueil. Ce sont la precarite de leur statut legal et les obstacles souvent insurmontables empechant la reconnaissance de leurs diplomes et/ou qualifications professionnelles, ou simplement les prejuges culturels, qui les condamnent a accepter des emplois bien inferieurs a leur potentiel personnel. Ainsi, la societe d'accueil gache un capital social et culturel de premier ordre, en etablissant les bases d'une division permanente entre 'nous' et 'eux'. Cet essai est un exemple, modeste mais revelateur, de la qualite et de la diversite des idees et points de vue des immigrants eux-memes, une ressource que nous persistons a sous-estimer, voire plus souvent, a ignorer completement.

AB  - This study concerns the lawsuit, and subsequent discharge, of the French weekly newspaper "Charlie Hebdo", which was sued for having published the caricatures of Mohammed (2006). Following Kelman's findings (1958, 2001), we predicted that the legitimate and authoritative nature of a court ruling may help to bring about the unmasking of counter-normative beliefs included in a representational field in this study, the social representation of the Muslim community We expected the public broadcasting of the court's ruling that discharged the weekly newspaper to legitimise and unmask counter-normative beliefs about the Muslim community', i.e., to cancel the differences usually found between the conditions where, on the one hand, the subjects are asked to express an opinion in their own name (masking hypothesis), and, on the other hand, they are asked to express an opinion on behalf of a substitute other (unmasking hypothesis). As expected, the results showed a difference between the "normal" and "substitution" conditions when the subjects were questioned before the lawsuit, and an absence of such a difference when they were questioned afterwards an absence that pointed to the unmasking of the counter-normative aspects. These findings are discussed in connection with the conditions under which the expression of the counter-normative aspects of a social representation becomes legitimate and socially acceptable.

AB  - Prior research suggests that people expect to be perceived negatively in interracial interactions but positively in intraracial interactions. The present research demonstrates that an interaction partner's racial network of friends can moderate these expectations in interracial interactions but not intraracial interactions. Across two experiments, we led Black and White college students to believe they would have conversation with a White student on campus. The results revealed that Black students expected to be perceived more positively and anticipated a less challenging conversation, when their interaction partner had a racially diverse network of friends compared to a racially homogeneous network of friends. In contrast, White students expected to be perceived positively and anticipated few challenges in the conversation, regardless of their interaction partner's racial network of friends. The implications of racial friendship diversity are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given the field's interest in humor-relevant individual differences in general, we explored the extent to which humor styles and temperament are correlated with individual difference predictors of prejudice. Participants (n = 136) completed the humor styles questionnaire, the state-trait cheerfulness inventory-(traits), and measures of social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), personal need for structure (PNS), and anti-Black prejudice. Contrary to preferences for positive humor use among participants generally (i.e., collapsing across individual differences), those higher in SDO or anti-Black prejudice reported increased use of aggressive humor. Those with prejudicial tendencies theoretically rooted in uncertainty avoidance and low openness (RWA, PNS), however, demonstrated no preference (or even some distaste) for socially-oriented humor use. Whereas SDO, RWA, and anti-Black prejudice were unrelated to possessing a "good sense of humor". PNS was associated with a poor sense of humor. Overall, distinct and theoretically meaningful relations between the prejudice-prone variables and humor-relevant individual differences emerged, with aggressive uses of humor endorsed only by prejudiced and dominance- (vs. security-) oriented persons, contrary to preferences for affiliative and self-regulatory humor styles among people generally.

AB  - Social mobility is the movement of individuals, families and groups from one social position to another. Researchers indicate that people with psychiatric disabilities tend to come from lower socioeconomic status groups, and that the causal relationship between lower socioeconomic status and mental illness occurs through social mobility process. The purpose of this study was to examine the occupational social mobility process of a sample of self-identified psychiatrically disabled individuals who have been active members of the labor force for most of their adult lives. A total of 200 participants were recruited from the customers of a One-Stop Career Center in Gloucester County, New Jersey. The social mobility pattern of persons with psychiatric disabilities was compared to that of persons without psychiatric disabilities (n = 100 for each group). That is, the social selection and the social causation hypotheses were applied to the social mobility patterns of people with psychiatric disabilities. It was revealed that the social class distribution for fathers of people with psychiatric disabilities was not different from that of people without psychiatric disabilities and also there was no significant social mobility difference between the two groups. These findings do not support the social causation and the social selection hypotheses. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that occupational capabilities and skills of people with psychiatric disabilities have been stabilized and are similar to those of people without psychiatric disabilities. Furthermore, these results may dispute several biases and prejudices with regard to social mobility process of persons with psychiatric disabilities.

AB  - The goal of the present paper was to demonstrate the influence of general evaluations and stereotype associations on emotion recognition Earlier research has shown that evaluative connotations between social category members and emotional expression predict whether recognition of positive or negative emotional expressions will be facilitated (e g Hugenberg, 2005) In the cui rent paper we tested the hypothesis that stereotype associations influence emotion recognition processes, especially when the difference between valences of emotional expressions does not conic into play in line with this notion, when participants in the present two studies were asked to classify positive versus negative emotional expressions (i e. happy versus anger. or happy versus sadness), valence congruency effects were found Importantly, however, in a comparative context without differences in valence in which participants were asked to classify two distinct negative emotions (i e anger versus sadness) we found that recognition facilitation occurred for stereotypically associated disci ere emotional expressions With this, the cui rent results indicate that a distinction between general evaluative and cognitive routes can be made in emotion recognition processes (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All lights reserved

AB  - Research on intergroup prejudice has generally adopted a model of social change that is based around the psychological rehabilitation of members of advantaged groups in order to foster intergroup harmony. Recent studies of prejudice-reduction interventions among members of disadvantaged groups, however, have complicated psychologists' understanding of the consequences of inducing harmonious relations in historically unequal societies. Interventions encouraging disadvantaged-group members to like advantaged-group members may also prompt the disadvantaged to underestimate the injustice suffered by their group and to become less motivated to support action to challenge social inequality. Thus, psychologists' tendency to equate intergroup harmony with "good relations'' and conflict with "bad relations'' is limited.

AB  - This study reviews the current state of multicultural education for migrant children in South Korea and calls for a critical reorientation of multicultural education for all. Racism was deepened during the colonial period in Korea, and continues to this day. Thus I argue that the ambivalent, dualistic ethnic prejudice distorted by colonialism can be resolved only through a decolonization of thinking. Currently South Korea is moving from being a homogeneous and mono-cultural community into a heterogeneous and multicultural society. In this context, immigrants are subject to discrimination and excluded from ethnocentric Korean society, and abused in terms of universal human rights. This is the environment for the urgently needed multicultural education. Multicultural education is one of the avenues through which we are able to confront racism today throughout the world. Multicultural education in Korea needs to be reconsidered in accordance with the rights to education for all children and in keeping with global justice.

AB  - This article describes the possible impact of emotional intelligence on identity negotiation of a racial minority group in a majority school context. The study investigated the adjustment and functioning of racial minority groups in majority school contexts, as well as the identity negotiation associated with it, and determined whether there is a correlation between the former and the Emotional Intelligence (El) of the participants. Participants were 16 black and 21 white learners attending two schools where they were in the minority (mean age = 16.23 years; SD = 1.49 years). The learners attended Grades 9-12. Data were first organised, after which themes and patterns were identified, and the data appraised and categorised (Creswell, 2007), after which a comparison was drawn between the identified categories of existing knowledge. Findings suggest that racial integration in both high schools actually occurred in name only; most participants chose to mingle within their own racial groups and the black participants in particular were exposed to racism, discrimination and prejudice on a regular basis. Despite the necessary steps taken and implemented by government in order to oppose racism in the country and promote racial integration in schools, it seems that the consequences of apartheid remain for the foreseeable future.

AB  - Background The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed.

AB  - The John R. Borchert Map Library was the ideal incubator for an experiment that has changed how a wide range of people are thinking about structural racism and the history of race in American urban environments. Mapping Prejudice used a cartographic visualization of racial covenants as the intellectual nexus of a project that transcended disciplinary boundaries and invited community members into cutting-edge research work. The Map Library provided the physical space, resources, and geospatial expertise necessary for community-driven mapping work. It also served as an intersectional hub necessary for this transformative research initiative, illustrating the synergies between map librarianship and other disciplines. The work depended on the unique contributions of the map librarian: project management; experience networking with researchers, campus departments, and community groups; and knowledge of best practices surrounding data management, curation, and reuse. This article explains how Mapping Prejudice changed academic scholarship and public understandings by engaging volunteers in meaningful research. It concludes by providing a description of future directions for this project and calls on librarians to lead more work of this kind. The example of Mapping Prejudice suggests ways that map librarians can be leading new modes of inclusive, equitable and community-responsive research.

AB  - The assessment of students by the social work academy measures their performances on standardized tests. Accusations of racial bias and other prejudices have long challenged the legitimacy of such tests, which may be unofficially used as indicators of an applicant's intellectual and scholastic potential. When combined with GPA, the highest integrity is assumed. GPA is an acronym for a student's grade point average. Most commonly, GPAs are used to give account of academic achievement. Thus, GPAs may be more valued by students than their standardized test score or subject matter, given the institutional weight placed upon such information. GRE is an acronym that stands for Graduate Record Examination, which, in social work, often contrasts with GPA. It is a standardized test designed to predict how well a student applicant might perform in postsecondary education. The significance of GPA to students cannot be overstated. Subsequently, student evaluations of faculty teaching empower students to cultivate instructors for inflated grades. In the aftermath, this poses a challenge to the academy: how much authority capital is it willing to assign to investigation? This is an investment in maintaining prestige of the social work profession commensurate with the future of its ethical ideals.

AB  - In this article, I explore my academic privileges through using the autoethnographic method while working in an alternative school and with interns hired for an agricultural internship. Academic privilege is contextualized as those factors in an education setting that benefit some and not all; with consideration of various personal and social factors including, but not limited to, skin color, aspects of identity, economic disparity, resource availability, social relationships, social settings, etcetera. Data collection involved observations within the school and when working with the interns. There were also informal conversations. The observations and informal conversations were documented as field notes to use for personal audio recordings. The personal audio recordings were transcribed and thematically coded. The three themes were: (1) At the Alternative School, (2) Criminalization and Prejudice, and (3) Future Opportunities for The Interns. This article allows the reader to journey with me to a place of introspection, reflexivity, and contemplation.

The present study assessed whether pro-White racial bias is also early emerging in a homogenous Black community that has little exposure to modern media and where children presumably experience less overt discrimination than in past samples. Black African children (N = 214) between 5- and 12-years-old living in rural Uganda exhibited substantial pro-White racial bias, preferring White over Black children 78% of the time. Ugandan children also judged White children as higher status than Black children, and these status judgments predicted their degree of pro-White bias. Our results indicate that pro-White racial biases can emerge even in a homogenous Black community and that, in some contexts, minimal status cues can be sufficient for the early development of racial prejudice.

AB  - Families in the United States are rapidly changing, and the normative familial model of two married, monogamous, heterosexual parents with children no longer reflects the majority of U.S. families. Nonetheless, state incentive-based policies and discriminatory family laws continue to enforce heteronormative monogamy. Recent changes to the U.S. legal landscape have produced limited formal recognition and protections for same-sex couples and LGBTQ parents, and even these narrow rights are withheld from other diverse familial configurations including families with polyamorous parents. This article uses the concept of sexual citizenship to frame the analysis of U.S. family courts' normative construction of family, identifying striking parallels between family courts' historical and contemporary prejudicial treatment of LGBTQ parents and the institution's similar delegitimization and denigration of polyamorous parents today. This paper reviews polyamorous parents' efforts towards achieving legal and societal legitimatization, finding significant parallels with legal strategies LGBTQ parents utilized to seek legal recognition and protection prior to federal recognition of same-sex marriage. This paper highlights the inadequacies of such a formal sexual citizenship approach, finding that a limited strategy of accumulating specific sexual rights fails to address non-monogamy's more radical cultural presence as well as the (non-legal) informal aspects of belonging needed to improve the livability of polyamorous parents' and their children's lives. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving the treatment of non-traditional families including LGBTQ, polyamorous, and other blended families, both within and outside the legal institution.

AB  - In the United States, prospective adoptive parents often express preferences related to race. In two studies, we examined whether implicit racial bias against Black people may contribute to disparities in much less willingness to adopt Black children. The first study (N = 510) assessed individuals' implicit racial bias and their willingness to adopt a Black child. The second study (N = 2,001,652) used U.S. state-level implicit racial bias to predict adoption rates of Black foster children in each U.S. state. Greater implicit racial bias predicted less willingness to adopt Black children and less frequent adoptions of Black foster children. Implicit bias contributed to these disparities above and beyond explicit bias, with implicit bias having a 43% larger effect size than explicit bias on willingness to adopt a Black child. These are the first findings to demonstrate the role implicit bias plays in explaining large disparities between Americans' willingness to adopt Black and White children.

AB  - Controversial issues characterise life in democratic societies and they often arise unexpectedly in the classroom, without being planned for by the teacher. However, controversial issues are rarely addressed beyond a mandatory curriculum and are often avoided. The aim of this exploratory study is to investigate what teachers identify and address as unplanned controversial issues in the classroom and the content of such issues. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 12 teachers from primary, secondary and upper-secondary schools across Europe. Unplanned controversial issues identified fell into three categories (1) mainstream controversy, (2) teacher-initiated controversy and (3) controversial pedagogy. Mainstream controversies follow mainstream definitions of controversial issues. In teacher-initiated controversies, teachers reacted to statements made by students, taking a stand against examples of prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination. Controversial pedagogy refers to instances in which the teachers' behaviour was deemed controversial by the teachers themselves. The content of the unplanned controversial issues that teachers identified and addressed is multi-faceted and draws upon personal, current, cultural and historical dimensions. The findings suggest that more attention needs to be paid, among other things, to the political dimension of education, teacher vulnerability, and who the person in teaching is.

AB  - Because they involve important decisions, should actual trials involve less or more discrimination than trial simulations? Does discrimination occur when defendant and juror both belong to underprivileged groups? In two experiments employing a 2 (decision importance) X 2 (defendant ingroup/outgroup status) design, Black and Hispanic (and some White) college students read a robbery/murder trial transcript. The defendant belonged to participants' racial/ethnic group or one of the others. Low-decision-importance instructions asked mock-jurors to consider the case carefully. High-decision-importance instructions emphasized the study was a government-sponsored assessment of jurors' reasoning about a real trial with known guilt/innocence. In Experiment 1 (n = 118), outgroup discrimination - judging outgroup defendants more likely guilty - was evident only under high importance. In Experiment 2 (n = 135), which presented weaker prosecution of the trial and included processing-motivation measures, outgroup discrimination occurred regardless of importance. Black and Hispanic mock-jurors discriminated against defendants of the other group. Greater identity-related processing motivation was reported under high importance. High importance may reduce bias associated with heuristic processing, but promote bias through processing infused with evaluative associations involving social identity and race/ethnicity. The defendant outgroup discrimination regardless of importance suggests prejudice observed in trial simulations may generalize to actual trials.

AB  - Inspired by the well-documented relationship between authoritarianism and prejudices, we tested whether a massive influx of immigrants can constitute social threats - direct (crimes, riots, violence) and normative (different norms, customs, values) - that increase ingroup authoritarian attitudes. Across two experimental studies (n(1)=251 and n(2)=230), we were able to show that both direct and normative threat to social order, originating from immigrants, lead to an increase in ingroup authoritarianism attitudes (Cohen's d = 0.45-0.57), but do not impact the right-wing authoritarianism and cultural conservatism. The effect of threat on the rise of authoritarian attitudes was only partially and in a small degree mediated by collective security motivation. Implications for the authoritarianism-prejudices relationship and the functions of authoritarianism are discussed.

AB  - China started market-oriented reforms in the late 1970s, and a fundamental social change in post-reform China has been massive migration. The primary purpose of this research is to examine the effect of migrant inflows on online expressions of regional prejudice, which is defined as expressions of antipathy toward migrants. In particular, we examine the dynamics of expressions of regional prejudice on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media site in China. Furthermore, we explain online expressions of regional prejudice through the lens of the group-threat and contact theories, and seek potential conditions that facilitate the development of a positive relationship between local residents and migrants. Our findings lend strong support to the group-contact argument that migrant inflows reduce online expressions of regional prejudice in China. The contact effect is larger when migrant inflows are measured in terms of migrant labor and interprovince migrants, who represent China's typical migrants. Furthermore, the contact effect is only observed in relatively small cities, while a small threat effect is observed in mega and super-mega cities where the population-control system is strictly maintained.

AB  - How do mass publics react to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) advocacy efforts in socially conservative societies? We consider how the first-ever LGBT+ Pride in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina influences ordinary citizens' attitudes and behavior regarding LGBT+ support. Using nationwide and local panel surveys, we find that support for LGBT+ activism increased locally after the Pride but did not diffuse nationwide, signaling how proximity mechanisms reinforce Pride effects. In survey experiments, we show that subjects are responsive to both mobilization and counter-mobilization appeals by local activists. We also find evidence from a behavioral experiment that the Pride had a positive effect on shifting the allocation of financial resources toward local pro-LGBT+ activists and away from opposition groups. Finally, in-depth interviews with local LGBT+ activists underscore the challenges facing LGBT+ activism in socially conservative societies but also point to the substantial possibilities of collective action on behalf of minorities at risk.

AB  - The national inferiority complex was described in 1958 by the Brazilian journalist Nelson Rodrigues as "how Brazilians voluntarily place themselves in a position of inferiority in comparison to the rest of the world." In three experimental studies, we tested the hypothesis of a "national inferiority effect" on the behavior of Brazilian participants awarding compensation to a victim of police violence. Study 1 varied the skin color (Black vs. White) and cultural origin (Brazilian vs. African vs. European) of a target and demonstrated the presence of a selective national inferiority effect: participants awarded less compensation to the Brazilian victim than to the European, but higher compensation to the Brazilian victim than to the African, particularly when the victim was White. Study 2 replicated this effect, showing that the victim's skin color is a key factor in the emergence of the national inferiority complex. Study 3 went further and showed that the perceived injustice of an arrest mediates the national inferiority effect. The discussion suggests that the national inferiority complex could represent a compromise between positive distinctiveness and system justification motivations.

AB  - This paper, which is authored by members of the Japanese Association of Family Therapy (JAFT), describes the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan from a family systems perspective. The authors are active members of JAFT and include current and past presidents and officers. We describe the course of the pandemic and the ways in which government policies to mitigate the pandemic have affected Japanese families. Challenges that affect Japanese families include the inability to participate in family and social rituals, prescribed gender roles that specifically affect women, high suicide rates, and prejudice against those who are at risk of spreading the infection. The need to shelter in place has also forced family homes to function as a workplace for parents, classrooms for children, and day care services for frail elders, which has resulted in psychological distress among individuals and conflicts among families. We discuss ways that therapists have worked with Japanese families using online therapy.

AB  - The present investigation used ERPs to detect the activation of implicit stereotypical representations associated to different ethnic groups, by means of an implicit paradigm. 285 sentences were presented to 20 Italian Caucasian participants while EEG signals were recorded from 128 scalp sites. Sentences could either violate (Incongruent condition), non-violate (Congruent condition) or be neutral (Neutral condition) with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning non-Caucasian ethnic groups (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabs). No awareness or judgment about stereotypes was required. Participants were engaged in a fictitious task, ignoring the overall study?s purpose. The results showed that Incongruent terminal words elicited a greater anterior N400 response (300?500 ms) compared to Congruent and Neutral words, reflecting a difficulty in integrating the information incongruent with pre-existing stereotypical knowledge. The participant?s individual amplitude values of the N400-Difference Wave (Incongruent ? Congruent), showed a direct correlation with the individual racism scores obtained at the Subtle and Blatant Prejudice Scale, administered at the end of the experimental session. Intra-cortical sources explaining the N400 involved areas of the social cognition network such as the medial frontal cortex (BA10) and the inferior temporal gyrus (BA20) which are known to support processing of information about other people and impression formation. Moreover, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500?600 ms) compared to the other conditions, possibly reflecting the merging of incoming inputs with anticipated semantic information. A late post-N400 frontal positivity (650?800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences concerning other-race characters (ether congruent or incongruent) compared to sentences involving own-race characters (neutral). The study corroborated the effectiveness of neurophysiological measures to assess implicit complex semantic representations and circumventing social desirability-related problems.

AB  - Background People with intellectual disability (ID) are often socially isolated, and many experience stigma and discrimination. Increased contact with the general public is thought to overcome prejudices. This large-scale international study had three main aims: to determine the type and frequency of contact that the general public has with people with ID; to identify the personal characteristics of those who have greater contact; and to examine the public's level of comfort at the prospect of having contact with people with ID.
   Method Self-completed online questionnaires were administered to nationally representative panels of respondents in 17 countries; totally 24 504 persons. Multivariate analyses were used to identify respondents more likely to have had frequent personal contact with persons with ID from those with infrequent or no contact and those respondents who were most comfortable at meeting a person with ID.
   Results Internationally around one in four of the general population reports having frequent personal contact with people who have an ID although this varied from 7% in Japan to 46% in Panama. The principal forms of contact were through friendships, neighbours or extended family members. Over all countries, volunteering and engagement with Special Olympics were the two main predictors of frequent personal contact followed by employment in the education, health or social care field, being a parent of children under 18 years, playing sports and being employed. People who reported frequent personal contact were also more comfortable at meeting a person with ID.
   Conclusions This international dataset provides a baseline against which public contact can be compared across countries and changes monitored over time. The findings suggest ways in which greater contact can be promoted and making the public more comfortable at meeting people with ID.

AB  - Previous research concerned with British Muslim women has explored a range of important issues. However, what is missing is research exploring the lived everyday social experiences, including the unique nature of identity formation in British Muslims. This qualitative study tried to address this gap. Five female British Muslims were interviewed, and their interviews analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Three key themes emerged from the data: Constructing identity, Experiencing prejudice in interactions, and Educating oneself and others. The findings demonstrate the complex nature of being a British Muslim woman, the impact of discrimination from various sources and the gendered nature of these experiences. It also highlights the active nature of identity formation, which occurs within and relates to a particular setting and particular experiences. Implications and future research are discussed.

AB  - The early emergence of racial biases points to the urgent need to understand how interpersonal experiences might shape them. We examined whether interpersonal movement shapes racial biases among 4- to 6-year-old Chinese children who had no prior contact with Black people. In Experiment 1 (N = 134), children played a musical game, moving either in or out of synchrony with a Chinese or Black adult. In Experiment 2 (N = 30), children were merely exposed to a Black adult. Across the two experiments, we found that synchronous movement increased children's feeling of social closeness toward their movement partner to a greater extent than asynchronous movement regardless of the partner's race. After moving in or out of synchrony with the Chinese adult, synchrony selectively increased children's explicit positive pro-ownrace bias. However, after moving in or out of synchrony with the Black adult, both movement styles reduced explicit anti-other-race bias. Experiment 2 ruled out mere exposure to an other-race person as a driving factor for these effects. Our results suggest that musical engagement may be a promising intervention for reducing negative intergroup biases. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Aim To our knowledge, no case-control study has investigated the relationships between stealing, clinical implications, and psychiatric diagnosis among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with or without a history of stealing. Thus, the associations between child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and a history of stealing remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationships between stealing, clinical implications, and psychiatric diagnosis among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with or without a history of stealing. Methods In this retrospective case-control study, the proportions of clinical implications among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with and without a history of stealing were compared. Data regarding age, sex, primary diagnosis, junior high school student or not, both father and mother are the caregivers or not, family history, abuse history, school refusal, depressive state, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were retrieved from medical records. Participants consisted of Japanese junior high school students and younger patients (maximum age, 15 years) at the first consultation. All patients were examined and diagnosed by psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, or the Fifth Edition. Stealing was reported by the patients or caregivers to the psychiatrist, or the psychiatrist had inquired about a history of stealing at the first consultation. Results Among 1972 patients who consulted the clinic, at the first consultation, 56 (2.84%) had a history of stealing (cases), and 1916 (97.16%) did not (controls). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the proportions of males, junior high school students, abuse history, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and conduct disorder were significantly higher, and the proportions of adjustment disorders and school refusal were significantly lower in cases than in controls. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio increased further when the two factors were considered together, such as ASD with abuse history and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with abuse history. Conclusions Children with a history of stealing were more likely to be diagnosed with ASD or ADHD with abuse history. Child and adolescent psychiatric outpatients with a history of stealing were more likely to be older and male. Our study should be understood without prejudice because this study is reporting associations, not causality. Therefore, a prospective study to investigate causality among ADHD, ASD, abuse history, and stealing is needed. If ADHD and ASD with abuse history can be correlated to a history of stealing, interventions can be more effective by understanding the mechanisms underlying these connections.

AB  - This paper explores the interface between the fields of Education and Communication with respect to developing narratives that can identify leadership among women who live daily with social inequalities and violence. These studies, debates, and research took place at the AFRODIaSPORAS Research Center on Black Women, Audiovisual Culture, and Educommunication in Urban Peripheries at the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) School of Education from Baixada Fluminense (FEBF), Duque de Caxias city, RJ, Brazil. Two studies were chosen as examples of the specific leadership developed by black women using concepts from Education, Communication, Intersectionality, and a daily struggle against prejudice and racism. The first study reports the experiences of a black deaf woman who teaches sign language alongside the history and culture of black deaf people. The second introduces a young black filmmaker who produces new portrayals of the Baixada Fluminense (BF) region. Findings: Both studies show the authorship of the interviewees, demonstrating that education and black consciousness empower people to become leaders who respond to social exclusion. Non-formal education has been employed as a method to propagate narratives refuting stereotypes and colonial beliefs that still appear on the curriculum of formal education and in hegemonic media. These two young black women are protagonists, educommunicators, social activists, and leaders.

AB  - While public acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals and same-sex relations has grown over the past few decades, there is still opposition to LGB civil rights in the U.S. Previous literature has found links between political ideology and sexual prejudice, while empathy has been linked to both political ideology and sexual prejudice. However, no study has examined the interrelationships between these three variables. For this study, an online survey was administered to a diverse sample of college students in exchange for course credit, and those who self-identified as heterosexual were retained for analyses (N = 1143; 66.1% female; 45.5% White). Mediation analyses were performed to examine whether two subfacets of empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) mediated the relationship between political ideology and sexual prejudice. Due to gender differences in sexual prejudice and empathy, gender was included in the model as a moderator. The results of moderated mediation analyses indicated both empathic concern and perspective taking were mediators for women, while perspective taking was the only mediator for men. These results suggest that interventions for sexual prejudice may be more effective when using approaches that promote taking the perspective of LGB individuals. Specifically, interventions that utilize empathy training or direct contact with LGB individuals may result in a decrease in sexual prejudice.

AB  - The study utilized African theories, literatures, framework and a qualitative method with 11 heterosexual Nigerian undergraduate university students to explore their perceptions and attitudes towards homosexuality and LGB persons. The data analysis identified six categories: (a) higher tolerance observed for lesbians than gay men among heterosexual men; (b) possibility of biological causation of homosexuality; (c) assumptions of social and environmental factors as influencing homosexuality; (d) assumption that gays are sexual abusers and the fear of gay men and lesbians; (e) positive perceptions about LGB persons; and (f) suggestions on conversion therapy for LGB persons. This study identifies perceptions, attitudes and microaggressions of heterosexual students towards LGB persons and the implications on safe schools and the well-being of LGB students. The study recommends how to address heterosexism and homophobia in our schools and campuses. Findings are discussed with findings on attitudes towards homosexuality in schools and universities in some African countries.

AB  - Using data from 69 countries, Hassler et al. show that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups, but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups.
   Guided by the early findings of social scientists, practitioners have long advocated for greater contact between groups to reduce prejudice and increase social cohesion. Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size-and at times, direction-of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change-willingness to work in solidarity- that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.

AB  - Objective: To know the experiences of family members of children with cystic fibrosis under the light of the theory of Callista Roy. Method: Qualitative research that used the adaptation theoretical framework of Callista Roy for inductive content analysis. Fifteen family members, in a university hospital, between 23 and 63 years old, participated in the study, from September to October 2018. Results: Two categories were elaborated: "Evaluation of stimuli" and" Evaluation of behaviors". The first has three subcategories: "focal", "contextual" and "residual". And the second, four subcategories: "physiological domain", "self-concept","role function" and "interdependence". Final Considerations: During the evaluation of stimuli, work overload and stress were identified as focal stimuli. Regarding contextual stimuli, it was noticed that the social life of caregivers was prejudiced. As for residual stimuli, the fear of loss is constant, and it appears that the emotional aspect of family members is the most affected comparing with physical exhaustion.

AB  - Digiculturality expresses an integrating reality of key competences in order to be able to speak of intercultural learning in virtual environments, which can be accessed from school (Priegue and Leiva, 2012). At present, these competencies have acquired a social and educational relevance that makes them essential tools to face equality of opportunities and social inclusion, while constituting a specific ecological environment for the development of interculturality from school contexts (Hernandez and Iglesias, 2017).
   Starting from this reflection, this work aims to develop a map of digital resources on interculturality that serves as a support tool in the teaching-learning process of intercultural competence. It also seeks to value information and knowledge as resources against discrimination, racism, prejudice and stereotypes of various kinds.
   To this end, relevant sources of information will be identified and selected, a classification according to their characteristics and purpose will be proposed, and their main benefits will be described.
   The existence or not of specialized resources in the subject matter of study will make it possible to verify the relevance given to interculturality in a globalized society.

AB  - A growing body of research shows that older adults, Black women, and other groups often encounter stigmatization that manifests not as negative prejudice, but as indifference and inattention-that is, interpersonal invisibility. We propose an affordance-management theory to explain who is interpersonally invisible, to whom, and with what consequences. A social affordance-management perspective suggests that people seek to detect and strategically engage with those who facilitate or obstruct achievement of important goals. We argue that invisibility emerges from the perception that another person neither helps nor hurts one's ability to achieve chronically or acutely active goals. We thus distinguish among phenomena commonly subsumed under the term stigmatization: invisibility-based stigmatization of those perceived to be irrelevant, and threat-based stigmatization of those perceived to obstruct one's goals. Invisibility and threat-based stigmatization are theorized to differ in origin. manifestation, and impact. Furthermore, rather than being a static property of particular target groups, interpersonal invisibility dynamically emerges from perceiver goals, target cues, and situational features. Nonetheless, some perceivers, targets, situations, and goals are more likely to lead to invisibility than others. This affordance-based theory of invisibility helps to organize the heterogeneous field of stigma research; unifies a diverse array of social, cognitive, motivational, and affective phenomena; and suggests numerous novel directions for future stigma research from both perceiver and target perspectives.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss how social psychology might go about studying social hostility in public life that goes beyond mere disagreement on political matters. The paper addresses the case of online misogyny against women active in public life. In the context of a profound coarsening of political debate in Britain and elsewhere, women who are active in public life come regularly up against a barrage of abuse and intimidation online. The paper argues that manifestations of misogyny cross ideological lines and takes an array of forms. Misogyny is a specific class of prejudice that harms the dignity of women by calling into question women's (human) rights to participation in public life, freedom of expression, and personal safety. In order to fully understand the intricacies of online misogyny, social psychologists need to draw upon more directly on communications and media theories of mediated communication and connective action.

AB  - Prejudices still surround the issue of sexuality of persons with intellectual disability (ID), both in families and in the professional community. To assess attitudes of parents, professionals and the general population towards the sexuality of persons with ID, so that appropriate sexual education could be introduced and implemented with persons with ID. We used Attitudes to Sexuality QuestionnaireIndividuals with an Intellectual Disability, with a questionnaire on general demographic data. Attitudes of professionals on the sexuality of persons with ID mainly show conservative viewpoints; parents feel unprepared to educate their children on the subject of sexuality. Attitudes on sexuality of persons with ID are important to consider since they can provide valuable clues as to the direction in which educational programs should be moving in order to have an effect on achieving a better quality of life for persons with ID.

AB  - Background: Although sexuality is a ubiquitous human need, recent empirical research has shown that people without disabilities attribute fewer sexual rights and perceive sexual healthcare to benefit fewer people with disabilities, compared to non-disabled people. Within a global context, such misperceptions have tangible, deleterious consequences for people with disabilities (e.g., exclusion from sexual healthcare), creating an urgent need for effective strategies to change misperceptions. Methods: To lay the groundwork for developing such strategies, we examined predictors of the recognition of sexual rights of people with physical disabilities within the South African context, derived from three key social psychological literatures (prejudice, social dominance orientation and intergroup contact), as well as the relationship between sexual rights and beliefs about sexual healthcare. Data were obtained through a cross-sectional survey, given to non-disabled South Africans (N = 1989). Results: Findings indicated that lack of recognition of the sexual rights for physically disabled people predicted less positive beliefs about the benefits of sexual healthcare. In turn, high levels of prejudice (both cognitive and affective) toward disabled sexuality predicted less recognition of their sexual rights, while prejudice (both forms) was predicted by prior contact with disabled people and possessing a social dominance orientation (cognitive prejudice only). Evidence was also obtained for an indirect relationship of contact and social dominance orientation on sexual healthcare beliefs through prejudice, although these effects were extremely small. Conclusion: Results are discussed in terms of their implications for rehabilitation, as well as national-level strategies to tackle negative perceptions of disabled sexuality, particularly in contexts affected by HIV.

AB  - Research indicates that mental health and medical professionals often hold negative views of overweight or obese people. Little is known about weight prejudice among social work students. In order to address this gap in the literature, this study examines the attitudes of Bachelor of social work and Master of social work students (n = 250) toward persons who are overweight and/or obese. Consistent with the literature, findings indicate generally those with higher body mass index scores are more likely to believe that obesity is beyond their control. Further, although age was correlated with Beliefs About Obese People scores, it was not a significant predictor. Implications for social work social justice and cultural competency curriculum are discussed.

KW  - PROGRESS
AB  - Background: The use of non-conventional methods of measurement is a long-established practice in most societies.
   Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of non-conventional methods of measurement in the placement of children in schools in general and the 'clutch-the-ear' and get enrolled age measurement practice in particular. To expose the shortfalls of a classroom setup in which age-for-grade enrolment is distorted.
   Setting: Zimbabwe.
   Methods: Literature review and researchers experiences.
   Results: The use of non-conventional methods has both pros and cons. The practice can be hailed for showing the indigenous knowledge systems as giving, to an extent, transparent and accurate maturity prediction ways that require preservation. However, it works perfectly for people of average height while prejudicing the outliers. The immediate conspicuous consequence is the late enrolment of the affected. In the case of the 'clutch-the-ear' and get enrolled measure, findings are discussed below.
   Conclusion: The use of non-conventional methods of age measurement unobtrusively upsets education quality through facilitating stereotyping, discrimination and age-heterogeneous classes. Researchers propose a 'backward-integration-enrolment' strategy; getting into communities to enrol not to wait for the community to bring children to school.

KW  - Critical Education

KW  - Discourse Analysis
AB  - In times of several criticisms of free public schooling and resistance to social and authorial transformation of teacher and teaching education, a dialogical and critical perspective towards teacher education has become of paramount relevance. By looking at student-teacher memoirs of formation, the researchers examine transformative movements of becoming, in student-teacher narratives in apprenticeship, in public schools of Rio de Janeiro. By aligning critical pedagogy to a socio interactional perspective to narrative discourse of formation, we examine how student-teachers, in process of becoming teachers, view their transformative experiences in public schools during their apprenticeship. Although students depict resistance and difficulty in understanding their own roles, the place of teaching practice, as well as the role of the public schooling in Rio de Janeiro, our data demonstrates the transformation of their prejudice and pre-conceived notions of public schooling and teaching into a proactive and transformative understanding of students' social role as teachers to be. Another key element which we can draw from our discursive analysis, as part of student-teacher reflection and evaluation, is the demonstration of the significance of the institutional roles of public school as a means of providing equal access to free education. Finally, the results indicate that the development of critical knowledge by all students can be considered as an equal civil right and a State obligation as reflected through the narratives analyzed in this paper.

AB  - The goal of this contribution is to bring to light some systemic applications of organizational power that occur within the child protection system in Iceland. The specific focus is on the ways in which notifications are made to the child protection system concerning allegations of parental neglect on the part of parents with disabilities and a criticism of some specific mechanisms by which these notifications may contribute to unjust custody deprivation proceedings. We suggest that accusations of bias or prejudice within the child protection system need to be grounded upon the demonstration of concrete mechanisms which illustrate this bias in practice. In this contribution, we chose to focus on the power of notifications and to explore the institutional logic and practices that can result in unjust custody deprivation decisions. A critical analysis of the knowledge production of custody deprivation is required to fully understand these process as systematic applications of power and to recognize the problematic nature of child protection work that weighs heavily against marginalized parents.

AB  - Background/Context: As a result of migration processes, schools in Flanders (the Dutch- speaking region of Belgium) are notably ethnically diverse. This evolution has coincided with an increasing number of studies focusing on ethnic-minority pupils' experiences of ethnic prejudice from their ethnic majority counterparts.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Taking into consideration the lack of research on the importance of cultural school features to students' ethnic prejudice, this study investigates the association between a multicultural teacher culture and the ethnic prejudice of Flemish secondary school pupils. In addition, the analysis tests the mediating role of pupils' perceptions of the multicultural educational practices of teachers and controls for individual and school characteristics that have been shown to be related to ethnic prejudice.
   Population/Participants/Subject/Research Design: Multilevel analyses were carried out on data from 2,083 Flemish pupils and 636 teachers in 40 secondary schools, collected by means of a written questionnaire.
   Findings/Results: The main finding of this study is that a more multicultural teacher culture is associated with reduced ethnic prejudice among Flemish pupils. However, the association between a multicultural teacher culture and pupils' ethnic prejudice is mediated by pupils' perceptions of multicultural teaching.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: These findings highlight the importance of including macro factors, individual variables, and their interdependence when explaining ethnic prejudice. The findings also show that what matters most for reducing prejudice among pupils is not what teachers claim they do in terms of multicultural teaching, but pupils' perceptions of what their teachers do in practice.

AB  - We explored how political beliefs and attitudes predict support for anti-Muslim policies and extremist behavior in the United States following the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. A large sample completed measures of authoritarianism, social dominance orientation (SDO), generalized prejudice, identification with all humanity (IWAH), perceptions of Muslim threat, and support for anti-Muslim policies and behaviors. These measures accounted for 73% of the variance in moderate anti-Muslim policies and 55% of the variance in extreme anti-Muslim policies. Authoritarianism and SDO directly and indirectly predicted support for anti-Muslim policies, with their effects partially mediated by generalized prejudice, IWAH, and perceptions of Muslims as threatening. Threat both mediated and moderated the relationship between authoritarianism and anti-Muslim policies. A negative interaction between authoritarianism and perceptions of Muslims as threatening predicted moderate anti-Muslim policies, but a positive interaction predicted extreme anti-Muslim policies. A tentative explanation is offered. Perceptions of Muslim threat was consistently a powerful predictor of anti-Muslim policies and willingness to engage in extremist behaviors targeting Muslims. Programs to combat anti-Muslim prejudice should consider the role of threat-related stereotypes in expressions of anti-Muslim prejudice.

AB  - Caring is a positive social act, but can it result in negative attitudes towards those cared for, and towards others from their wider social group? Based on intergroup contact theory, we tested whether care workers' (CWs) positive and negative contact with old-age care home residents (CHRs) predicts prejudiced attitudes towards that group, and whether this generalises to other older people. Fifty-six CWs were surveyed about their positive and negative contact with CHRs and their blatant and subtle attitudes (humanness attributions) towards CHRs and older adults. We tested indirect paths from contact with CHRs to attitudes towards older adults via attitudes towards CHRs. Results showed that neither positive nor negative contact generalised blatant ageism. However, the effect of negative, but not positive, contact on the denial of humanness to CHRs generalised to subtle ageism towards older adults. This evidence has practical implications for management of CWs' work experiences and theoretical implications, suggesting that negative contact with a subgroup generalises the attribution of humanness to superordinate groups. Because it is difficult to identify and challenge subtle prejudices such as dehumanisation, it may be especially important to reduce negative contact. (c) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction. The difference which nature has placed between one man and another is so wide. Also, the difference which comes by religion, cultural habits and similar elements in the human life can be further enlarged by education. During the last ten years, interethnic relations in Macedonian educational system become central topic for the activity of educational policy makers. In that line, the novelty of this research lies in the designing of student practicum by making cross-cultural contacts in the sphere of education.
   Methods. Macedonian government's programs and legal framework promote interethnic communication, but implementation of principles as respect, tolerance, and acceptance in the school life still is reduced only on using different languages of ethnic communities in teaching process. At the same time, appears the need to enhancing teachers' capacities for work in a multicultural environment and ensuring all children receive a high-quality education.
   Results. The results of the research show that informal education activities can encourage a thinking process as intellectual instrument for extermination prejudices related interethnic communication through the closer contact and interaction between the students, teachers and parents in the school environment.
   Discussion. It is certainly very difficult to set balancing between variety of behaviours, dictated by the presumed needs of specific cultures, religions and beliefs, but the classroom should be common home for all students and the teacher should know to manage such relationship.

AB  - Following a mortality salience or control prime, Black, Hispanic, and White college students read a murder/carjacking or auto theft trial transcript in which the defendant belonged to their racial/ethnic group or one of the others. Black and Hispanic, but not White, mock-jurors discriminated, more frequently judging outgroup defendants guilty. Mortality salience affected judgments about outgroup, but not ingroup, defendants, heightening perceptions of guilt in the murder case and decreasing guilty verdict preferences in the theft case. Mortality salience may compel derogation of outgroup defendants who threaten the cultural worldview, but not of less threatening ingroup defendants. The effect, however, seems restricted to crimes like murder that can sustain death-related anxiety.

AB  - The present study aimed to compare attitudes toward lesbians and gay men across three generations in Turkey. Participants were 112 young people, 169 parents, and 125 grandparents. A total of 406 men and women were involved. The short form of Herek's (1998) the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale was used. MANOVAs and ANOVAs were used to analyze the data. Results showed the attitudinal differences toward gay and lesbian people across generations. Grandparents have the most negative attitudes, whereas parents have more negative attitudes than their children. When comparing attitudes of each generation across sex, we found that young women have more liberal attitudes toward gay men compared to all other groups. Discussion focuses on understanding the results within the unique cultural context of Turkey.

The present article analyzes the construct deindividuation theory from its conceptualization by Le Bon to the most recent theoretical model, the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects. The aim of this study is to compare theories about deindividuation and to highlight its advances, identify theoretical questions that remain and suggest future directions for the study of this issue. Recent research conducted on deindividuation may promote prosocial behavior, prevent social disturbance and prevent the development of prejudice among children. Furthermore, it may provide a feasible way to comprehend and intervene in contemporary social issues. Recent scientific techniques, such as neuroimaging and predictive mathematical models, may improve comprehension of the construct in terms of its definition and prospective effects.

AB  - Background: Research on mental health stigma in adolescents is hampered by a lack of empirical investigation into the theoretical conceptualisation of stigma, as well as by the lack of validated stigma measures. This research aims to develop a model of public stigma toward depression in adolescents and to use this model to empirically. examine whether stigma is composed of three separate dimensions (Stereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination), as is theoretically proposed.
   Method: Adolescents completed self-report measures assessing their stigmatising responses toward a fictional peer with depression. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA; N=-332) was carried out on 58-items, which proposed to measure aspects of stigma. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; N=236) was then carried out to evaluate the validity of the observed stigma model. Finally, higher-order CFAs were conducted in order to assess whether the observed model supported the tripartite conceptualisation of stigma.
   Results: The EFA returned a seven-factor model of stigma. These factors were designated as Dangerousness, Warmth & Competency, Responsibility, Negative Attributes, Prejudice, Classroom Discrimination and Friendship Discrimination. The CFA supported the goodness-of-fit of this seven-factor model. The higher-order CFAs indicated that these seven factors represented the latent constructs of, Stereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination, which in turn represented Stigma.
   Conclusions: Overall, results support the tripartite conceptualisation of stigma and suggest that measurements of mental health stigma in adolescents should include assessments of all three dimensions. These results also highlight the importance of establishing valid and reliable measures for assessing stigma in adolescents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Northern Ireland has seen a rise in racially motivated crimes and incidents reported to police in recent years and, although this has been accompanied by intensified media coverage, this phenomenon has been the subject of relatively little research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically three theories that have been proposed to explain prejudice towards ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland; economic self-interest, social contact, and 'sectarianism as racism'. Using the 2013 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, which contains new questions on contact with ethnic minorities, this study looks at attitudes towards Eastern Europeans, Muslims and a third category of 'other ethnic groups'. Results from multivariate linear regression provide evidence for all three theories but also show that the strength and significance of predictive variables for prejudice vary across the minority groups. The findings that there are different motivations for prejudice towards different groups can inform policies to tackle racism in Northern Ireland.

AB  - In two national samples, we examined the influence of interracial exposure in one's local environment on the dynamic process underlying race perception and its evaluative consequences. Using a mouse-tracking paradigm, we found in Study 1 that White individuals with low interracial exposure exhibited a unique effect of abrupt, unstable White-Black category shifting during real-time perception of mixed-race faces, consistent with predictions from a neural-dynamic model of social categorization and computational simulations. In Study 2, this shifting effect was replicated and shown to predict a trust bias against mixed-race individuals and to mediate the effect of low interracial exposure on that trust bias. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that interracial exposure shapes the dynamics through which racial categories activate and resolve during real-time perceptions, and these initial perceptual dynamics, in turn, may help drive evaluative biases against mixed-race individuals. Thus, lower-level perceptual aspects of encounters with racial ambiguity may serve as a foundation for mixed-race prejudice.

AB  - This article examines the structural conditions and cultural narratives underlying the high frequency and intensity of anti-mosque campaigns in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Drawing on Blumer's theory of prejudice as a sense of group position, as it has been elaborated and extended to multi-ethnic settings by subsequent scholarship, I contend that local reactions to mosques in Catalonia have been shaped by context-specific configurations of identity and urban space. I show how longstanding socio-economic and cultural divisions within Catalonia's native population, as well as the inscription of these divisions within the spatial ordering of the region, have heightened feelings of threat elicited by the large-scale arrival of Muslim immigrants to working-class neighborhoods in recent years. In advancing this argument, I build on the insights of geographers and urban sociologists to develop a spatially sensitive understanding of social position and perceived group threat that considers the importance of place identities and the interaction between distinct registers of territorial belonging.

AB  - From the very first efforts to analyze children and adolescents to the present day, child and adolescent analysis has been denigrated in the analytic community. It has been viewed as "women's work" and regarded as clinically inferior to the analysis of adults. It has been seen as less important for understanding the psyche and in the training of psychoanalysts. This attitude is rationalized by observations that children and adolescents engage psychological material differently than adults do, so that, it is claimed, child and adolescent analysis is severely limited compared to adult analysis with regard to the material available for analysis. Beliefs that children require socialization lead some child analysts to indoctrinate children and sacrifice a respectful exploratory and uncovering approach. The situation of child analysis reflects larger social phenomenona, namely childism and sexism, the prejudices against children and women, as these prejudices are elaborated in our culture. Like others, child analysts respond to being the objects of prejudice by both isolating ourselves, reacting against the prejudice, and internalizing the prejudice. This paper includes clinical and institutional illustrations of these prejudices in action.

AB  - The experiences of Irish sons and daughters born into heterosexually-organised parental partnerships/unions whose parents have separated and one has come out as Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual (LGB) were explored through a grounded theory approach. 15 adult children (over the age of 18 years), who varied in age when their parents separated and one disclosed as LGB, were interviewed. The primary concern that emerged centred on participants having to adjust to their parents' being separated, as opposed to their parent being LGB. This involved engaging with the tension that arose from the loss of the parental union, which involved changes to the home environment and adapting to new parental partners and family units. Heightened reflection on sexual orientation and an increased sensitivity to societal LGB prejudice were specifically associated with a parent coming out as LGB. How parents negotiated disclosing the changes to others, the level of support available to parents, and how capable parents were at maintaining the parent-child relationship had an impact on the tension experienced by sons and daughters. Participants moved from initially avoiding and resisting the family changes that were occurring to gradual consonance with their altered family environments. Concluding directions for research and clinical considerations are suggested.

AB  - Although creativity provides a considerable number of advantages, many teachers have direct and indirect prejudices against creative students since they may display distracting and disruptive behaviors toward teachers and classmates. To determine how teachers' creativity affects their students' creative development, 90 preschool and elementary school teachers and 90 pupils were assessed for creative thinking. The children's sex was not correlated with creativity scores. There were small, significant relationships between various measures of preschool teachers' and students' creativity.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe aim of this study was to assess the beliefs and attitudes of preservice health and physical education (HPE) specialist and nonspecialist schoolteachers toward obese children.
   METHODSA total of 177 nonspecialist and 62 HPE specialist trainee teachers completed a series of pen-and-paper validated measures of attitudes and beliefs toward obese children.
   RESULTSBoth groups of preservice teachers reported strong implicit and moderate explicit anti-fat bias. Enrollment in the HPE specialist degree was found to be a significant predictor of both implicit bad/good anti-fat bias (=3.97, p=.002) and implicit bias on the stupid/smart scale (=2.983, p=.016) of the IAT. Beliefs that obese children were less healthy, more self-conscious, and less satisfied with themselves were strongly endorsed by the majority of participants. HPE specialists were found to have significantly lower expectations for obese children in regard to reasoning (mean difference=0.21, p=.0107) and cooperation skills (mean difference=0.25, p=.0354) compared to nonspecialist trainees.
   CONCLUSIONSThis study is the first to document the strong anti-fat bias of both preservice nonspecialist and HPE specialist teachers. It is also the first to find that preservice HPE specialist teachers have stronger anti-fat biases and differential expectations regarding particular abilities of obese children, compared to nonspecialists.

AB  - Prejudices legitimize the discrimination against groups by declaring them to be of unequal, especially of less, worth. This legitimizing power is highly relevant in social conflicts of modern societies that are governed by market-oriented value systems. However, prejudice research has yet to be linked to sociological discourses on the marketization of society. We argue that Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), a theory originally developed to explain crime rates, offers a fruitful macro-sociological framework for a better understanding of micro-social prejudices that emerge along with processes of marketization. Extending IAT to explain prejudices in a German study based on survey data offers a first attempt to underpin our theoretical hypotheses with empirical data. Although the results need to be interpreted with due caution, they suggest that the extended IAT model can be usefully applied to explain how a marketized mentality is related to different forms of institutional integration, and how it is conducive to specific prejudices that emerge in market-dominated societies against purported economically burdening social groups.

AB  - Background: Front line providers of care are frequently lacking in knowledge on and sensitivity to social and structural determinants of underprivileged patients' health. Developing and evaluating approaches to raising health professional awareness and capacity to respond to social determinants is a crucial step in addressing this issue. McGill University, in partnership with Universite de Montreal, Quebec dental regulatory authorities, and the Quebec anti-poverty coalition, co-developed a continuing education (CE) intervention that aims to transfer knowledge and improve the practices of oral health professionals with people living on welfare. Through the use of original educational tools integrating patient narratives and a short film, the onsite course aims to elicit affective learning and critical reflection on practices, as well as provide staff coaching.
   Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted, in Montreal Canada, among members of a dental team who participated in this innovative CE course over a period of four months. Data collection consisted in a series of semi-structured individual interviews conducted with 15 members of the dental team throughout the training, digitally recorded group discussions linked to the CE activities, clinic administrative documents and researcher-trainer field notes and journal. In line with adult transformative learning theory, interpretive analysis aimed to reveal learning processes, perceived outcomes and collective perspectives that constrain individual and organizational change.
   Results: The findings presented in this article consist in four interactive themes, reflective of clinic culture and context, that act as barriers to humanizing patient care: 1) belief in the "ineluctable" commoditization of dentistry; 2) "equal treatment", a belief constraining concern for equity and the recognition of discriminatory practices; 3) a predominantly biomedical orientation to care; and 4) stereotypical categorization of publically insured patients into "deserving" vs. "non-deserving" poor. We discuss implications for oral health policy, orientations for dental education, as well as the role dental regulatory authorities should play in addressing discrimination and prejudice.
   Conclusion: Humanizing care and developing oral health practitioners' capacity to respond to social determinants of health, are challenged by significant ideological roadblocks. These require multi-level and multi-sectorial action if gains in social equity in oral health are to be made.

AB  - This article examines attitudes among 14-year-old native students in 14 Western countries to assess how out-group size, as measured by the proportion of first-and second-generation migrant children in a class, is related to inclusive views on immigrants. It develops three competing hypotheses: (i) higher proportions of immigrants contribute to inclusive views everywhere; (ii) higher proportions have a negative effect on inclusive views everywhere; (iii) the effect of out-group size depends on the ratio of first-to second-generation migrant children: the higher this ratio, the weaker the effect. It discovers that out-group size is positively related to inclusive views on immigrants in countries where second-generation outnumber first-generation migrant children (i.e., the old immigration states), and that there is no significant link with such views in countries where the reverse is the case (i.e., the new immigration states). The same regularity applies at the classroom level: in classes with more second than first generation students, out-group size enhances inclusive views while it shows no relationship to such views in classes with more first than second generation students. The results thus support the third hypothesis. The non-relation in contexts with many first generation students may well be a temporary phenomenon, however. Once immigrant communities have become more settled and integrated in the destination countries, positive effects of ethnic mixing could well emerge everywhere.

AB  - The formative influence of colonial art education on modern art movements in Africa has not attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. Yet, European art teachers in the Gold Coast challenged colonial prejudice that Africans were incapable of mastering European aesthetic forms. This article analyses the art education provided at the Teacher Training College at Achimota School where pupils learned both to revalue African art forms and to draw and paint in European, representational art styles. Modern artists built on and reshaped what they had learned at Achimota in order to respond to changing social and political conditions. The last section of this article explores the impact of colonial art education on the work of two of the earliest modern artists in Ghana: Kofi Antubam and Vincent Kofi.

KW  - DETERMINANTS
AB  - Objective: To identify which physician and patient characteristics are associated with physicians' estimation of their patient social status.
   Design: Cross-sectional multicentric survey.
   Setting: Fourty-seven primary care private offices in Western Switzerland.
   Participants: Random sample of 2030 patients >= 16, who encountered a general practitioner (GP) between September 2010 and February 2011.
   Main measures: Primary outcome: patient social status perceived by GPs, using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, ranging from the bottom (0) to the top (10) of the social scale. Secondary outcome: Difference between GP's evaluation and patient's own evaluation of their social status. Potential patient correlates: material and social deprivation using the DiPCare-Q, health status using the EQ-5D, sources of income, and level of education. GP characteristics: opinion regarding patients' deprivation and its influence on health and care.
   Results: To evaluate patient social status, GPs considered the material, social, and health aspects of deprivation, along with education level, and amount and type of income. GPs declaring a frequent reflexive consideration of their own prejudice towards deprived patients, gave a higher estimation of patients' social status (+1.0, p = 0.002). Choosing a less costly treatment for deprived patients was associated with a lower estimation (-0.7, p = 0.002). GP's evaluation of patient social status was 0.5 point higher than the patient's own estimate (p<0.0001).
   Conclusions: GPs can perceive the various dimensions of patient social status, although heterogeneously, according partly to their own characteristics. Compared to patients' own evaluation, GPs overestimate patient social status.

AB  - Conspiracy theories explain complex world events with reference to secret plots hatched by powerful groups. Belief in such theories is largely determined by a general propensity towards conspirational thinking. Such a conspiracy mentality can be understood as a generalised political attitude, distinct from established generalised political attitudes such as right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) (Study 1a, N=497) that is temporally relatively stable (Study 1b and 1c, total N=196). Three further studies (combined N=854) show that in contrast to RWA and SDO, conspiracy mentality is related to prejudice against high-power groups that are perceived as less likeable and more threatening than low-power groups, whereas SDO and RWA are associated with an opposite reaction to perceptions of power. Study 5 (N=1852) investigates the relationship of conspiracy mentality with political behavioural intentions in a specific catastrophic scenario (i.e. the damage to the Fukushima nuclear reactor after the 2011 tsunami in Japan) revealing a hitherto neglected role of conspiracy mentality in motivating social action aimed at changing the status quo.

AB  - This paper offers an examination of gay-straight alliance (GSA) members' engagement with sex education, sexual health, and prejudice and discrimination in Canadian public high schools. It explores how five students' (four straight and one gay-identifying) participation in GSAs served as a springboard for learning about and challenging stereotypes; prejudice; and discrimination directed at lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) people. Queer theory provided the theoretical underpinnings of the study, offering a lens through which to examine the heteronormative underpinnings of education, and a means to interpret how homophobic discourses circulate in school and society. Empirical data were obtained via observational notes from visits to nine GSAs and semi-structured interviews with the five GSA members. Findings suggest that straight allies can use their heterosexual privilege to address LGBTQ issues with their peers. Through GSA involvement, participants learned to interrogate and combat stereotypes about LGBTQ people and HIV-related myths, as well as to engage in queer discussion and political action.

AB  - Since 2001, various Western countries have accorded legal recognition to same-sex marriages, but thus far, we lack information on how this legislation is related to trends in public opinion. In most of the literature, declining levels of prejudice toward homosexuality are found to result from structural social processes (rising education, secularization, and detraditionalization), which should occur in all industrialized societies, with or without same-sex marriage. In this article, we analyze data of the five waves of the European Social Survey for the period 2002-2010. Results show that levels of prejudice are significantly lower in countries that recognize same-sex marriage, while levels are only slightly lower in countries with some form of registered partnership for gay and lesbian couples. Therefore, we can assume that same-sex marriage is indeed an issue affecting public opinion and public policy.

AB  - The aim of the article is to analyse the impact of the self-evaluated ethnic composition of the place of residence on interethnic contacts and attitudes through the comparison of four Nordic countries. Data come from the European Social Survey 2002. Compared with ethnically homogeneous neighbourhoods, interethnic relationships are more common in ethnically mixed neighbourhoods with some self-reported ethnic minorities. However, living in an area with many perceived ethnic minorities does not necessarily increase the probability of having interethnic friends in all four countries. As contact theory suggests that, having interethnic friendship ties in combination with living in an ethnically mixed or ethnic neighbourhood is associated with the probability of having more tolerant attitudes towards immigrants in all four countries. Perceived ethnic threat, however, is generally at its lowest level in areas with only some ethnic minorities, which may leave some room for conflict or competition theories as well.

AB  - The 2008 presidential election presented a unique opportunity to examine children's attention to racial issues in politics. We conducted interviews with 6- to 11-year-old children (70 boys, 60 girls; 29 African Americans, 58 European Americans, 43 Latinos) within 3 weeks prior to and after the election. Interview questions concerned knowledge, preferences, and perceptions of others' attitudes concerning the election, views of the implications of the election for race relations, and personal aspirations to become president. Results indicated that children were highly knowledgeable about Obama's status as the first African American president. Most children felt positively about the presence of an African American candidate for president, although a few children showed clear racial prejudice. Overall, children expected others to show racial ingroup preferences but simultaneously endorsed the optimistic view that Obama's race was a slight asset in his bid for the presidency. Older children were somewhat more likely to view Obama's race as negatively impacting his chances of being elected than younger children. African American and Latino children were more interested in becoming president than European American children; aspiration rates did not change from pre- to post-election.

TI  - The Danish School of Interior Architecture: A Visionary Functionalist, a Visionary Aesthete, and their Women Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - Recently there has been a growing international interest in the history of interior design. Danish design owes much of its international renown to a few prominent architects and their iconic products. One of them was Finn Juhl, who earned an international reputation mainly through his elegant furniture design. However, an important aspect of his work has received virtually no attention: his seminal work as a visionary teacher and leader at the school for professional interior design in Copenhagen in the 1940s and 1950s. Harald Willerup, architect as well, and Juhl's equally visionary predecessor, had initiated this work in 1934, but has remained largely unknown. This article offers a historiographical mapping of the professional education of Danish interior designers in the period from 1934 to 1955a subject, which has so far remained unexposed. Despite the fact that the leading figures and pioneers of the education of interior design were men, the students were almost exclusively women. The article seeks to explain this and to explain the consequences for the general image of the profession. The research into the development of interior design education in Denmark shows how the change of leadership from Willerup to Juhl resulted in a shift in the educational focus from functional and social issues toward a greater focus on aesthetics. The fact remains, however, that this work was informed by prevalent functionalist ideas at the time. A particularly fascinating aspect of the Danish history of interior design education is the hard struggle its pioneers had to fight cultural prejudice and conventional thinking.

AB  - Social scientists have long emphasised the importance of personal inter-ethnic contact for overcoming prejudices and enhancing social cohesion in mixed societies. But why do some people have more contact with their neighbours of other ethnicity? Using new data from a large-scale German survey, I analyse the brokering roles of children and inter-ethnic partners in explaining inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances. Even on a contextual level, my results suggest that people living in regions with larger shares of children have more inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances, which expands earlier findings on the general integrating function of children. However, I also argue that we should recognise brokering to be context-specific and exemplify this by showing how the brokering role of inter-ethnic partners is evident particularly in interaction with inter-ethnic encounters at local bars and restaurants, while that of children is evident particularly given their frequent inter-ethnic encounters in public parks and playgrounds. On a theoretical level, my results demonstrate the importance of studying the interaction of mechanisms in explaining personal (inter-ethnic) contact.

This article demonstrates the ongoing existence and impact of exclusion in impeding recovery and explores the mechanisms underpinning inclusion for both individuals and their communities. The significance of tackling lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and rejecting behavior are described and approaches to decrease these are discussed. Future directions are considered with recommendations for changes in the educational messages used, the facilitation of contact in community settings, the measurement of outcomes in terms of positive social achievements and reference to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Disabled People, the UK Equality Act and the forthcoming UK Disability Strategy.

AB  - This study examines how Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Party For Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, justifies discriminatory measures for Muslim citizens. Wilders' contributions to four parliamentary debates and newspaper articles are analysed. The analysis shows that Wilders consistently makes a distinction between Islam as a belief system and Muslims as a group of people. Islam is defined as external to the West and as a major threat to the virtuous nature of the in-group. Defending and preserving Western liberal values against Islam is construed as a moral imperative. It is further shown how the distinction between Islam and Muslims functions to ward off accusations of prejudice and discrimination. It is concluded that social psychologists studying prejudice and discrimination should pay more attention to the distinction between person categories and ideological categories, and to political leadership.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its existence and treatment, is a contentious matter. The dominant view in medicine considers that ADHD is a psychiatric disorder. My position is to challenge this from a social relational orientation. I explore here a critique of the psychiatric disease model of causation and treatment, particularly the use of medication. A series of prejudices based on a political and social constructionist orientation are offered to address the ethics, politics and practice implications of the practitioner critical of the biomedical model of diagnosis and treatment especially the use of medication. This device is employed in order to invite critical reflection and further debate in a field dominated by the medical and genetic arguments in support of ADHD as a psychiatric disease. The implications of more open debate are explored, together with directions for more politically and ethically informed practice with children and their families.

AB  - Findings on stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia have been inconsistent in comparisons between mental health professionals and members of the general public. In this regard, it is important to obtain data from understudied sociocultural settings, and to examine how attitudes toward mental illness vary in such settings. Nationwide samples of 1015 general population individuals and 1414 psychiatrists from Brazil were recruited between 2009 and 2010. Respondents from the general population were asked to identify an unlabeled schizophrenia case vignette. Psychiatrists were instructed to consider "someone with stabilized schizophrenia". Stereotypes, perceived prejudice and social distance were assessed. For the general population, stigma determinants replicated findings from the literature. The level of the vignette's identification constituted an important correlate. For psychiatrists, determinants correlated in the opposite direction. When both samples were compared, psychiatrists showed the highest scores in stereotypes and perceived prejudice; for the general population, the better they recognized the vignette, the higher they scored in those dimensions. Psychiatrists reported the lowest social distance scores compared with members of the general population. Knowledge about schizophrenia thus constituted an important determinant of stigma; consequently, factors influencing stigma should be further investigated in the general population and in psychiatrists as well.

AB  - Reflecting on his wartime government service, Walter Lippmann (1922) developed a theory of policy formulation and error. Introducing the constructs of stereotype, mental model, blind spots, and the process of manufacturing consent, his theory prescribed interdisciplinary social science as a tool for enhancing policy making in business and government. Lippmann used his influence with the Rockefeller foundations, business leaders, Harvard and the University of Chicago to gain support for this program. Citation analysis of references to "stereotype" and Lippmann reveals the rapid spread of the concept across the social sciences and in public discourse paralleled by obliteration by incorporation of the wider theory in behavioral science. "Stereotype" is increasingly invoked in anthropology, economics, and sociology though Lippmann and his wider theory ceased being cited decades ago. In psychology, citations are increasing but content analysis revealed blind spots and misconceptions about the theory and prescription. Studies of heuristics, biases, and organizational decision substantiate Lippmann's theory of judgment and choice. But his model for social science failed to consider the bounded rationality and blind spots of its practitioners. Policy formulation today is supported by research from narrow disciplinary silos not interdisciplinary science that reflects an awareness of history. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In drawing from Herek's (2007, 2009) sexual stigma and prejudice theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among prejudice toward sexual minority coaches, religious fundamentalism, sexism, and sexual prejudice and to determine whether race affected these relationships. The authors collected data from 238 parents. Results indicated that Asians expressed greater sexual prejudice than Latinos and Whites, while African Americans expressed more religious fundamentalism than did Whites. There were also differences in the associations among the variables. For African Americans, sexism held the strongest association with prejudice toward sexual minority coaches. While for Asians and Whites, religious fundamentalism held the strongest association, contact with lesbian and gay friends was a significant predictor of prejudice for Asians, but not for the other groups. For Latinos, both religious fundamentalism and sexism were associated with sexual prejudice.

AB  - The Inbar and Lammers (2012, this issue) survey revealed potentially disturbing pockets of ideological intolerance among social psychologists. Their findings raise a mix of procedural-justice questions bearing on fair treatment of colleagues and epistemological questions bearing on the opportunity costs of research programs that were either never conceived or smothered in infancy. An appropriately self-critical disciplinary response is to conduct identity-substitution thought experiments that explore (a) how we would collectively react to differential treatment in counterfactual worlds in which minority-majority faction roles were reversed, (b) how ideological bias may have suppressed research with the potential to undermine liberal policy positions (e.g., affirmative action, income redistribution, "dove-ish" security policies), and (c) how ideological bias may have led to attaching labels to conservative policy positions that moderates and conservatives consider tendentious (e.g., system justification, symbolic racism).

AB  - Societal variation in xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices is frequently explained by the economic background and political history of different countries. This article expands these explanations by considering the influence of world societal factors on individual attitudes. The empirical analysis is based on survey data collected within the World Value Survey and European Values Study framework between 1989 and 2010. Data are combined to a three-wave cross-sectional design including about 130,000 respondents from 32 countries. Results show that xenophobia and homophobia are influenced by the national political history, societal affluence, and the presence of international organizations. Global forces, however, are of particular importance for homophobia.

AB  - Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities.

AB  - Background: Using our research findings, we explore Harm Reduction and Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) using an intersectional lens to provide a more complex understanding of Harm Reduction and MMT, particularly how Harm Reduction and MMT are experienced differently by people dependent on how they are positioned. Using the lens of intersectionality, we refine the notion of Harm Reduction by specifying the conditions in which both harm and benefit arise and how experiences of harm are continuous with wider experiences of domination and oppression;
   Methods: A qualitative design that uses ethnographic methods of in-depth individual and focus group interviews and naturalistic observation was conducted in a large city in Canada. Participants included Aboriginal clients accessing mainstream mental health and addictions care and primary health care settings and healthcare providers;
   Results: All client-participants had profound histories of abuse and violence, most often connected to the legacy of colonialism (e. g., residential schooling) and ongoing colonial practices (e. g., stigma & everyday racism). Participants lived with co-occurring illness (e. g., HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, PTSD, depression, diabetes and substance use) and most lived in poverty. Many participants expressed mistrust with the healthcare system due to everyday experiences both within and outside the system that further marginalize them. In this paper, we focus on three intersecting issues that impact access to MMT: stigma and prejudice, social and structural constraints influencing enactment of peoples' agency, and homelessness;
   Conclusions: Harm reduction must move beyond a narrow concern with the harms directly related to drugs and drug use practices to address the harms associated with the determinants of drug use and drug and health policy. An intersectional lens elucidates the need for harm reduction approaches that reflect an understanding of and commitment to addressing the historical, socio-cultural and political forces that shape responses to mental illness/health, addictions, including harm reduction and methadone maintenance treatment.

AB  - Now that the doors of historically white schools have officially been opened to Black learners, this paper presents a critical analysis of discourses of domination transmitted behind the doors of learning in a History classroom. While the official History curriculum (NCS, 2002) advocates multi-perspectival epistemological approaches, this paper illustrates the subordination of epistemic goals to racist and sexist ideological goals through the transmission of racist and sexist discourses. A teacher 's lessons were observed, audio-taped, transcribed and analysed according to critical discourse theory The conventional Grade 10 topic, The conquest of the Aztecs by the Spanish, was mediated through racist and sexist formal and informal discursive strategies such as the use of teacher power to silence contestation of inaccurate statements; the use of metaphor, simile, and binary oppositions to convey prejudicial meanings, derogation, inferiorisation, ridicule, jokes, disclaimers, and stereotyping that subsumed the historical topic being taught. The analysis exposes the informal yet effective workings of power for the perpetuation of discourses of domination in the History lesson. Such discourses subjected learners to a form of symbolic violence which may lead students to ontological misrecognition of self and race.

AB  - The present research investigates how people's general epistemic motives may inspire essentialist beliefs about racial groups and racism. In three studies, we focus particularly on essentialist entitativity (EE, referring to beliefs about the uniformity, informativeness, and inherent core of racial groups), probing into its relationships with epistemic need for closure (NFC) and prejudice. In Study I, we develop an EE scale, empirically distinguish it from the naturalness component of essentialism and non-EE beliefs, and establish its predictive utility for explaining racial prejudice. Study 2 provides experimental evidence for the causal effect of NFC on EE beliefs. Study 3 demonstrates in three different samples that EE beliefs mediate the relationship between dispositional NFC and racial prejudice. It is argued that EE beliefs about racial groups are an expression of motivated social cognition, serving people's seizing needs for quick and easy social judgment.

AB  - This article aims to explore how children of immigrants enrolled in higher secondary schools in Milan conceive and speak about citizenship. It illustrates how the formal, participatory and identity dimensions of citizenship come to be articulated in a complex and changeable way in relation to discourses and contexts. In particular, it attempts to look more closely at the transformations of belonging, which today seems to be composed of different layers that underline different aspects: admittance stresses the universalistic claim to be equal, to not be excluded on the basis of discrimination or prejudice; identification conserves a particularistic and essentialist meaning, it stresses the importance and the 'unavoidableness' of difference; involvement regards lifestyles, everyday relations, it confers importance on the possibility to participate on behalf of a specific interest and have a stake in a community's life and future. Therefore, citizenship assumes different meanings when discourses shift from one layer to another.

AB  - Four studies are presented that examined the automatic activation of valence toward different social groups using an evaluative priming paradigm. In the first two studies, pictures of Turks and Germans (Study 1) and old and young persons (Study 2) were used as primes; positive and negative adjectives conveying either other-relevant valence or possessor-relevant valence were used as targets in an evaluation task. Results revealed that automatically activated prejudices can be differentiated according to their type of relative negativity: Whereas picture primes of Turks conveyed relative negativity of the other-relevant type, picture primes of older persons conveyed relative negativity of the possessor-relevant type. Study 3, using picture primes of homeless persons (versus students) demonstrated that automatically activated prejudice toward homeless people convey both types of negativity. Finally, Study 4 provided support that these results were not due to the activation of stereotypes. These studies provide evidence that prejudice in terms of automatic evaluations of social stimuli can be more fine-grained beyond a mere uni-dimensional positive-negative differentiation.

Undergraduates (n = 199) completed measures of religious fundamentalism, homophobia, modern racism, hostile and benevolent sexism, need for cognition, need for structure, preference for consistency, and fear of invalidity. Need for cognition partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and benevolent sexism. Preference for consistency partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and hostile sexism. The indirect effect of religious fundamentalism on modern racism through preference for consistency approached statistical significance. The interaction between need for structure and fear of invalidity partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and hostile sexism, with individuals high in need for structure and low in fear of invalidity having higher religious fundamentalism and prejudice.

AB  - This article aims to describe how xenophobia is experienced by a small selection of immigrant participants in five inner city schools in Johannesburg. The May 2008 xenophobic violence prompted the investigation. Theoretically, the article is also concerned with ways to combat xenophobia in schools with a view to bringing about fundamental social change aimed at deconstructing 'anti-xenophobia education'. as the term has been coined. The methodology for the qualitative inquiry took the form of a triple-layered case study: the layers consist of the various groups of participants: immigrant learners. South African learners and educators. Sixteen semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted and the main method of data analysis was content analysis using Tesch's (Creswell, 1994: 155) method of sorting the content of communications. The findings support the need for anti-xenophobia education in the schools under scrutiny The immigrant participants reported very little compassion. rather humiliation and degradation in the form of unjust stereotyping, prejudice, bias and discrimination. Although cosmopolitanism featured, 'otherness is far from being incorporated into an all-embracing 'us'. Distrust between immigrant and South African learners emerged and both groups stereotyped the other as violent, although lack of trust and fear as pervasive issues seemed to underlie the stereotyping.

AB  - OBJECTIVES This study (a post-intervention assessment) was designed to assess the effectiveness of peer-assisted learning (PAL) using student-teachers (STs) with limited training to teach complicated technical skills for interpreting ultrasound images of the shoulder.
   METHODS Students in Years 3 and 4 of medical school were randomly assigned to two groups. In the PAL group (PG), teaching was delivered by a group of nine STs from Years 3 and 4, who undertook a 30-minute general training and 1 week of self-teaching. In the staff-led group (SG), students were taught by a group of three ultrasound-experienced doctors. Exposure took place in two separate lessons (each of 120 minutes) and introduced eight standard sectional planes (EULAR) using a 10-MHz Nemio (TM) XG system (Toshiba Medical Systems GmbH). The theoretical and practical learning outcomes were tested using a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Qualitative differences were evaluated using Likert scale-based items.
   RESULTS Evaluation of differences between the PG (n = 75) and SG (n = 76) in the theoretical (MCQ score; P = 0.644) and practical (total OSCE score; P = 0.133) outcomes showed no difference between the two groups. However, the STs themselves showed significantly better results overall (P < 0.05). Staff members were rated more highly than STs, especially on items relating to competence (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS Complicated technical skills can be adequately taught to students using the PAL system by STs with limited training. Self-teaching learning strategies are successful in contexts of limited teacher training. However, despite positive objective results, STs still face prejudice from students with regard to competency.

AB  - Introduction. Limited research has been conducted on factors that may increase children's likelihood of developing negative attitudes or stereotypes about obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of children's obesity stereotypes. Methods and procedures. A nationally representative sample of 10-year-old children (N=3 000), and their parents were requested to respond to a questionnaire in 2005. Obesity stereotypes were assessed by asking children to attribute positive and negative adjectives to boy and girl silhouette figures with average, thin and obese body sizes. Children's body esteem was also assessed, as well as parents' belief in the controllability of body weight. Additional data were collected on parents' and children's current body size and socio-demographic variables. Results. The study included 1 383 parent and child pairs. Children assigned on average 3.9 (standard deviation, SD=3.5) more stereotypes to a boy figure with obesity and 3.7 (SD=3.4) more stereotypes to a girl figure with obesity than to thin and average figures. Predictors of obesity stereotypes were parental body size and parents' beliefs concerning controllability of weight. Children's body esteem was inversely associated with boy obesity stereotypes, while only boy's body esteem showed an inverse association with girl obesity stereotypes. Discussion. Obesity stereotyping was a more salient feature among 10-year-olds having leaner parents and/or parents holding stronger beliefs about personal control over body weight. Children's perception of own body size rather than actual body size seem to be important in forming obesity stereotypes.</.

AB  - Objective: Questionnaire-based ADHD screening tests may not always be objective or accurate, owing to both subjectivity and prejudice. Despite attempts to develop objective measures to characterize ADHD, no widely applicable index currently exists. The principal aim of this study was to develop a decision support model for ADHD screening by monitoring children's school activities using a 3-axial actigraph.
   Methods: Actigraphs were placed on the non-dominant wrists of 153 children for 3 hours, while they were at school. Children who scored high on the questionnaires were clinically examined by child psychiatrists, who then confirmed ADHD. Mean, variance, and ratios of low-level (0.5-1.0G) and high-level (1.6-3.2G) activity were extracted as activity features from 142 children (10 ADHD, 132 non-ADHD). Two decision-tree models were constructed using the C5.0 algorithm: [A] from whole hours (class + playtime) and [B] during classes. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated. PPV, NPV, likelihood ratio, and AUC were also calculated for evaluation.
   Results: [Model A] One child without ADHD was misclassified, resulting in an accuracy score of 99.30%. Sensitivity and NPV were 1.0000. Specificity and PPV were 0.992 and 0.803-0.909, respectively. [Model B] Two children without ADHD were misclassified, resulting in an accuracy score of 98.59%. Specificity and PPV were scored at 0.985 and 0.671-0.832, respectively.
   Conclusion: The selected features were consistent with the findings of previous studies. Objective screening of latent patients with ADHD can be accomplished with a simple watch-like sensor, which is worn for just a few hours while the child attends school. The model proposed herein can be applied to a great many children without heavy cost in time and manpower cost, and would generate valuable results from a public health perspective.

AB  - Our research centers the underexamined perspective of Black Americans regarding allyship behaviors and investigates their perceptions and experience of a White ally who confronts a White perpetrator of prejudice. In two experimental studies (N = 1176), we found that Black participants reported higher levels of self-esteem after a White ally confronted a White perpetrator of racial prejudice compared to no confrontation. Additionally, we found that White ally confrontations that signaled intrinsic motivations (i.e., driven by personal values) were perceived as less suspicious in motive than those that signaled extrinsic motivations (i.e., driven by image concerns), which related to more target self-esteem. We discuss implications for research on allyship and confrontation as well as practical considerations. Our results strongly suggest that advantaged group members cannot allow overt prejudice to stand unchecked and should consider the motivations they convey in their actions.

AB  - How does the self-relevance of a social movement shape individuals' engagement with it? We examined the decision-making processes that underlie support for Black Lives Matter (BLM) among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White Americans. We find significant between-group differences in levels of support for BLM, both in terms of past behavior (Study 1) and in terms of future intentions to support the movement (Study 2). These differences notwithstanding, thinking about how one's decisions impact others - which we label impact mindset - explains support for BLM across racial groups, cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally (over 8 months later). Our findings underscore the equivalence of the impact mindset construct across racial groups and its predictive power in the context of BLM. We conclude that, although the struggle for racial justice has different meanings for different racial groups, the same mindset underlies both in-group advocacy and allyship in the context of BLM.

AB  - The current study examined whether aversive and modern racists would convict Black defendants differently based on theoretical differences: aversive racists are egalitarian and discriminate when not reminded of their values, whereas modern racists do not espouse egalitarian values and discriminate when a non-racial reason exists to justify their behavior. Participants read a criminal trial where defendant race (Black vs. White), race salience (present vs. absent), and justification (weak vs. strong evidence) were manipulated. Results showed that aversive and modern racists convicted the Black defendant at similar rates, but aversive racists were more likely to convict the White than the Black defendant. Aversive racists were also more egalitarian and less socially conservative. The finding that aversive racists convict Black and White defendants differently, but modern racists did not, suggests the importance of distinguishing aversive and modern racists to obtain a more complete picture of racial discrimination in juror decision making.

AB  - Recently, interest in aggregate and population-level implicit and explicit attitudes has opened inquiry into how attitudes relate to sociopolitical phenomenon. This creates an opportunity to examine social movements as dynamic forces with the potential to generate widespread, lasting attitude change. Although collective action remains underexplored as a means of reducing bias, we advance historical and theoretical justifications for doing so. We review recent studies of aggregate attitudes through the lens of social movement theory, proposing movements as a parsimonious explanation for observed patterns. We outline a model for conceptualizing causal pathways between social movements and implicit and explicit attitudes among participants, supporters, bystanders, and opponents. We identify six categories of mechanisms through which movements may transform attitudes: changing society; media representations; intergroup contact and affiliation; empathy, perspective-taking, and reduced intergroup anxiety; social recategorization; and social identification and self-efficacy processes. Generative questions, testable hypotheses, and promising methods for future work are discussed.

AB  - Adults perceive the youth of the present as being worse than from when they were young. This phenomenon has been shown to be a product of a memory bias, adults are unable to accurately recall what children were like in the past so they impose their current selves onto their memories. In two studies using American adults (N = 2,764), we seek to connect this finding to age, implicit theories of change, and extend the beliefs in the decline of the youth to new domains. Here we show as people age, they hold harsher beliefs about present children. Those who believe a trait does not change throughout the lifespan exhibit more forgiving attitudes toward the youth of today, believing they may not be in such decline on that trait. Finally, people who are low in a negative trait believe strongly that children are becoming more deficient in that particular trait (e.g., those who are not narcissistic believe the youth are becoming more narcissistic).

AB  - This qualitative study examines the experiences of 22 newly qualified teachers of Ethiopian origin who tried to integrate into the formal educational system in Israel after completing their graduation. Despite the revolutionary change in Ethiopian educators' inclusion since the 2000s, their number remains low and the difficulty of integrating graduates belonging to this community are routinely reported. The study pointed out that the graduates still encountered manifestations of racism, expressed in a paternalistic and even arrogant attitude towards them, by representatives of the local authorities, school staff members, and students' parents. Yet, the study identified the universal challenges that every education graduate is facing as well as the ones that are unique to the graduates' ethnic origin. Parallel to the essential changes required in the field of multicultural education and in eradicating prejudice and racism, the study proposes several ways for immediate improvement.

AB  - The study integrates social-psychological and educational research to examine the relations between preservice teachers' race-related perceptions of Black students and the instructional approaches they endorse. Based on survey and race Implicit Association Test data from preservice teachers (N = 258; White = 82%) in the United States, we predicted that the association between motivation to be unprejudiced and motivation to appear unprejudiced would predict endorsement of culturally and motivationally supportive instructional practices via implicit and explicit biases about Black students. Path analyses revealed significant mediated associations among motivation to be unprejudiced and endorsed instructional approaches and practices via explicit bias, contingent on the motivation to appear unprejudiced. Furthermore, it is troubling to note that White preservice teachers, in contrast to their ethnic minority counterparts, displayed significant implicit preference for White over Black students. Implications of these findings for preparing a culturally responsive and motivational supportive teaching task-force are discussed.

AB  - Behavioral adaptability is the ability to adapt one's interpersonal behavior to the expectations of the social interaction partners. In this paper, we investigated two factors that impact the extent to which people express behavioral adaptability. First, we investigated whether behavioral adaptability depends on the interaction partners' social categories (in-group vs. out-group). Second, we tested whether social dominance orientation (SDO) is related to behavioral adaptability and whether this relationship depends on the interaction partners' belonging to the in- or out-group. To do so, we conducted 2 studies in which we manipulated whether the interaction partners belong to the in- or to the out-group and in which we assessed participants SDO. In both studies, participants were in the role of a leader who had to give separate pep talks to 2 subordinates who differed in terms of preferred leadership style and we operationalized behavioral adaptability by coding to what extent participants adapted (Study 1) or reported that they would adapt (Study 2) their leadership style according to their subordinates' individual preferences. Study 1 used immersive virtual reality and included White/Caucasian male participants (N = 173). Study 2 was a vignette study including men and women who were either White/Caucasian or Black/African American (N = 741). Results showed that the subordinates' social category did not impact the extent to which participants express behavioral adaptability. However, SDO was differently related to behavioral adaptability depending both on participants social categories (e.g., ethnicity and sex) and subordinates' belonging to the in- or out-group.

AB  - Preliminary studies indicate that ideologies and worldviews are key in understanding the motivation behind corruption. Yet, there is no model seeking to explain corrupt intention that incorporates ideology and worldviews as predictors. Our objective was to propose a model integrating ideological factors (social dominance orientation [SDO] and right-wing authoritarianism [RWA]) and their underlying worldviews (competitive worldview beliefs [CWB] and dangerous worldview beliefs [DWB]) as predictors of corrupt intention and attitudes toward corrupt people and examine the model in the high corruption context of Brazil. For that purpose, preregistered hypotheses were tested across six studies. Results confirmed that corrupt intention is predicted by SDO but not RWA, while attitudes toward corrupt people are predicted by RWA but not SDO (Studies 1, 2, and 4). Replicating these findings cross-culturally, World Values Survey data (Study 3) indicated that corrupt intention is predicted by a proxy SDO index but not by a proxy RWA index. Experimentally increasing DWB amplified corrupt intention, but attitudes toward corrupt people remained unaffected (Study 5). Study 6 further confirmed the independence of corrupt intention and attitudes toward corrupt people, with corrupt intention primarily predicted by CWB and attitudes toward corrupt people primarily predicted by RWA. Hence, the first social psychological model that seeks to explain corruption integrating ideologies and worldviews was successfully proposed with implications for future research.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to look at levels of perceived discrimination in school among students of different races and to assess whether there are significant short- or long-term effects as they develop. This study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which is a multi-stage nationally representative study of individuals who were in 7th-12th grade during the 1994-1995 school year. Responses on teacher discrimination items showed that Black students reported the highest levels of perceived teacher discrimination. Educational expectations were lowest for Hispanic students. At wave three, participants who identified their race/ethnicity as Hispanic or other reported the worst overall health, whereas at wave four, White participants had significantly better overall health than the other three groups. Teacher discrimination was found to be a significant predictor for educational expectations, income expectations, and overall health eight and 15 years later. When stratified by race, higher teacher discrimination predicted lower educational expectations and poorer overall health eight years later for Black, Hispanic, and White students.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations and various countries committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The 17 goals revolve around 3 main axes: eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring peace and prosperity for all people by 2030. These goals are integrated so that interventions in one area inevitably affect the others. Undoubtedly, this application involves developing competencies related to Prejudice, conflict resolution, and empowerment. Our research aims to analyse the knowledge and competency of university students undergoing specific training to facilitate the application of UNESCO's objectives in their work performance, while incorporating human rights as a basis for all future actions. A total of 241 students from the University of Salamanca participated. The average age of the sample was 21.13 years; 76.8% were female, and 23.2% were male (22.41 +/- 7.17 years old). The data collection protocol included questions related to knowledge of the Sustainable Development Goals and involving SDGs in their personal life and future profession, which were assessed using the empowerment Scale, the Conflictalk Scale, and the Subtle and Overt Bias Scale. Significant differences were found between SDGs knowledge and involvement with academic courses. There was a direct relationship between this knowledge and involvement with the control, esteem, and activism dimensions of the Empowerment Scale, cooperative from the Conflictalk Scale, and positive emotions had inverse relationships with threat-rejection, and traditional values from the prejudice scale. Our study found that students who are more engaged with the SDGs resolve conflicts cooperatively, foster community activism, and experience positive emotions, whereas students with aggressive conflict resolution are more Prejudiced.

AB  - This research examined the association of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) with the evaluations of the government's anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) policies and performance. In Study 1 (N = 261), we found that SDO and RWA were positively associated with resistance to criticism about the government's anti-COVID-19 measures. In addition, SDO was positively associated with favorable evaluations of the government's performance in handling the crisis. Support for lockdown policies mediated these attitudes. In Study 2 (N = 438), the results show that SDO and RWA had indirect associations with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system through three mediation variables. Evaluations of the US government's performance in handling the COVID-19 pandemic were negatively associated with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system, and there was a negative relationship between evaluations of the Chinese and US governments' performances.

AB  - The present studies examined the conditions under which low subjective socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater racial/ethnic prejudice among White Americans. Using theories of intergroup threat and inclusive victim consciousness, we predicted that describing racial/ethnic minorities as disadvantaged (vs. as competitive or in neutral terms) would increase empathy and reduce prejudice among White Americans who consider themselves low in SES. Study 1 provided correlational evidence that White Americans who perceived themselves as low-SES (but not high-SES) were less prejudiced against racial/ethnic minorities the more they perceived minorities as disadvantaged. In Study 2, portraying the target outgroup (Arab immigrants) as disadvantaged increased outgroup empathy, and in turn reduced prejudice, among participants induced to think of themselves as low-SES. Study 3 conceptually replicated these results using a different outgroup (Mexican Americans) and a behavioral measure of prejudice. Implications for reducing prejudice among White Americans of different socioeconomic backgrounds are discussed.

AB  - Several studies demonstrated that a high need for closure (NEC) is associated with higher prejudice toward the out-group. This study aims to investigate how this effect can be moderated by attributions of morality to the in-group and the out-group. A questionnaire was administered to 725 participants. The results showed a positive relationship between NFC and prejudice when the in-group was evaluated as more moral than the out-group. This relationship was weaker when the out-group was evaluated as more moral than the in-group. These findings implicated that it is possible to reduce prejudice in individuals with high NFC by manipulating perceptions of in-group and out-group morality.

AB  - The problem of inequality presents an important opportunity for positive psychology. We review the many ways that marginalization (including stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination) affects the well-being of minoritized people and suggest that positive psychologists turn their attention to the ways their research interests can be harnessed to remedy this situation - by focusing on the links between positive psychological characteristics and experiences as predictors of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination among perpetrators (not simply victims) of bias. We review the limited evidence that exists for such links and for the potential for positive psychology interventions to reduce prejudice. We suggest that incorporating prejudice in positive psychological scholarship can help to resolve controversies in the field. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations for future research practice that will address the goal of a positive psychology that promises fulfillment for all people in a diverse world.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Our findings suggest that-despite the widespread perception that GRPs are harmless fun-parents who engage with GRPs, relative to parents who do not, endorse more prejudiced and essentialist views regarding gender. These findings point to the necessity of intervening upon prejudiced ideologies to prevent their leakage into cultural celebrations, and of educating parents and parents-to-be about the potential for early gendered socialization to limit their child's gender expression later in development.
   Gender-reveal parties (GRPs)-parties designed to celebrate the revelation of fetal gender-are a relatively new phenomenon, which is highly visible and popular online. This phenomenon has been criticized for reinforcing rigid gender role beliefs and stereotypes and perpetuating binary conceptualizations of two genders. The present study examines ideological and individual factors predicting involvement in GRPs. We hypothesized that endorsement of traditional gender roles, as well as endorsement of transphobia, would predict involvement in GRPs. In a sample of 217 current parents and expectant parents, we found that parents who engaged with GRPs endorsed less egalitarian gender role beliefs and more transphobic attitudes than did those who did not engage with GRPs when controlling for social media usage. These findings lend justification to criticisms of GRPs as reflecting problematic ideologies of gender.

AB  - Similarities are foundational to building and maintaining friendships, but for cross-race friends, differences in experiences related to race are also inevitable. Little is known about how friends approach talking about race-related experiences. We suggest that these conversations are a threatening opportunity. Across five studies, we show that they can enhance closeness and intergroup learning among Black and White friends but that these benefits can be accompanied, and sometimes prevented by identity threat. In Study 1, Black (N = 57) and White (N = 59) adults anticipated both benefits and risks of such conversations, though more benefits than risks. In Study 2A (N = 143) and Study 2B (N = 149), Black participants reported less willingness to disclose race-related experiences to extant White friends than Black friends and anticipated feeling less comfortable doing so, controlling for closeness. However, they also desired to be understood by Black and White friends equally. In Study 3 (N = 147) and Study 4 (N = 172), White participants also felt less comfortable when an imagined Black friend disclosed race-related versus nonrace-related experiences to them. However, they felt closer to their friend after the racerelated disclosure. Additionally, they felt more comfortable hearing about race-related experiences from a friend than through a third party and they reported learning more when the race-related experience was a friend's than a stranger's. Taken together, the studies highlight the benefits as well as the risks of conversations about race for cross-race friends and the need for future studies that track real-time conversations and test strategies to help friends engage in these conversations productively.

AB  - Prejudice against sexual and gender minorities (e.g., LGBT people) is quite prevalent and is harmful. We examined an existing-and often-used-contact intervention in pre-existing groups in an educational setting and assessed its effectiveness in reducing different forms of LGBT negativity. We focused particularly on modern LGBT negativity: a relatively subtle form of prejudice, involving ambivalence, denial, and/or the belief that there is too much attention for LGBT prejudice. We used a mixed design in which condition (experimental vs. control group) was the between-participants factor, which was randomized at the group level, and time (pretest vs. posttest vs. follow-up) was the within-participants factor (N = 117). Interventions were video recorded and the behavior of LGBT educators and participants was coded. Participants responded positively to the intervention, especially to the LGBT educator's "coming-out story." Exploratory analysis of the video data indicated that the perceived effectiveness of the intervention was higher in groups where participants were more engaged, although caution is necessary in interpreting this finding. The most important measure indicated that modern LGBT negativity decreased in the intervention groups directly after the intervention, but returned to baseline levels one week later. However, in the control condition, modern LGBT negativity had increased over time. Taken together, this suggests that an actual reduction in modern LGBT negativity was short-lived (i.e., the intervention effect disappeared within 7 days).

AB  - Democratic values are widely endorsed principles including commitments to protect individual freedoms. Paradoxically, the widespread normativity of these ideas can be used to justify prejudice. With two nationally representative U.S. samples, we find that prejudiced respondents defend another's prejudiced speech, using democratic values as justification. This vicarious defense occurs primarily among those who share the prejudice and only when the relevant prejudice is expressed. Several different democratic values (e.g., due process, double jeopardy) can serve as justifications-the issue is more about when something can be used as a justification for prejudice and less about what can be used as one. Endorsing democratic values can be a common rhetorical device to expand what is acceptable and protect what is otherwise unacceptable to express in public.

AB  - The United Nations Refugee Agency currently has registered approximately 178,990 asylum seekers, and refugees within Malaysia (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Figures at a glance in Malaysia, 2020b). Interestingly, while Malaysia allows for the registration of asylum seekers and refugees, it is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. As a result, refugees in Malaysia are not considered conceptually different from illegal immigrants, and therefore have precarious lifestyles while they await resettlement to a third country. Importantly, refugee children are barred from accessing the local education system in Malaysia, despite documented evidence surrounding the importance of education in the promotion of well-being and successful resettlement in refugee children. These children often end up relying on various volunteer-run schools that have been set up across the country. In order to better understand the barriers and facilitators of refugee education, this study employed the use of semistructured interviews with 10 volunteer teachers who teach Chin refugee children in Malaysia. A qualitative analysis was conducted using a grounded theoretical framework. Five major themes emerged from the analysis of the data: Language, Resources, Cultural Differences, Legal Status, and Experiences of Prejudice. The findings from this study contribute to an important, and growing body of research that aims to understand both the barriers and facilitators of refugee education. It is hoped that these findings provide future educators with confidence and skills in the provision of effective education to their students from refugee backgrounds.

AB  - In every society, refugees face social and economic exclusion. In particular, social distance towards refugees may be seen remarkably in cities where host people and refugees live together intensely. This study examined essential predictors of social distance towards refugees: religiosity, socioeconomic status (SES), satisfaction with life, and threat perception towards refugees. A quantitative research strategy was used to collect cross-sectional data from 1453 individuals via an online questionnaire in Turkey. Confirmatory factor, correlation, regression, and mediation analyses were conducted. In this study, the effect of religiosity and socioeconomic status on social distance towards refugees and the serial mediation effects of satisfaction with life and threat perception towards refugees on this relationship were analyzed. Questions related to age, gender, marital status, education level, and having refugee neighbors or not were used as control variables. It was found that religiosity and SES were associated with social distance towards refugees. Furthermore, in the effect of religiosity and SES on social distance towards refugees, the serial mediating roles of satisfaction with life and threat perception towards refugees, respectively, were identified.

AB  - Support for Gay Conversion Therapy may be motivated by homophobic prejudice driven by conservative groups. We propose that Support for Gay Conversion Therapy (SGCT) is motivated by conservatism and that this relationship is mediated by prejudice against gay individuals. We tested these hypotheses in three studies. In Study 1 (N = 249), we found that conservative values predict SGCT, and that this effect is partly mediated by prejudice. In Study 2 (N = 247), we replicated this mediation and found that ethical-religious and psychological essentialist beliefs differently moderated it. Study 3 (N = 210) went further by experimentally showing the political consequences of SGCT. We showed that more conservative individuals tend to absolve psychologists who practice sexual conversion, and that both prejudice and conservative-motivated SGCT mediated this effect. We discussed these results by emphasizing the psychosocial process that motivates SGCT.

AB  - Although system-justifying beliefs often mitigate perceptions of discrimination, status-based asymmetries in the ideological motivators of perceived discrimination are unknown. Because the content and societal implications of discrimination claims are status-dependant, social dominance orientation (SDO) should motivate perceptions of (reverse) discrimination among members of high-status groups, whereas system justification should motivate the minimization of perceived discrimination among the disadvantaged. We tested these hypotheses using multilevel regressions among a nationwide random sample of New Zealand Europeans (n = 29,169) and ethnic minorities (n = 5,118). As hypothesized, group-based dominance correlated positively with perceived (reverse) discrimination among ethnic-majority group members, whereas system justification correlated negatively with perceived discrimination among the disadvantaged. Furthermore, the proportion of minorities within the region strengthened the victimizing effects of SDO-Dominance, but not SDO-Egalitarianism, among the advantaged. Together, these results reveal status-based asymmetries in the motives underlying perceptions of discrimination and identify a key contextual moderator of this association.

AB  - What mitigates prejudice against migrants in situations of uncertainty? Addressing this question, we explored how individuals with greater COVID-19 concern perceive migrants as a greater threat and show prejudice against them, indirectly through the mechanism of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations. This study was conducted in two European countries: Malta and Italy. Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472). Results from this study showed that the need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations mediate the relationship between COVID-19 concern and prejudice against migrants in both countries. When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor. The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants.

AB  - Background Previous studies have found that a school climate of more heteronormativity is associated with adverse effects on the mental health of LGB students. Accordingly, our aim was to assess the association between lower LGB prevalence in schools and unhealthy weight-control behaviors among LGB youth. Methods A cross-sectional, multilevel study based in public high schools in the city of Olinda, Northeast Brazil. A multilevel logistic regression was performed, including 2500 adolescents enrolled in 27 schools. The contextual variable was the prevalence of LGB youth in each school (as a proxy for heteronormativity in schools), while the outcome was unhealthy weight-control behaviors (fasting, purging, and taking diet pills). We controlled for socioeconomic characteristics (age, sex, receiving a family allowance), obesity, and self-reported happiness. Results Lower LGB prevalence in schools was associated with higher odds of engaging in unhealthy weight-control behaviors (OR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0, 2.2) among all youth, regardless of sexual orientation. No cross-level interactions between school context and individual characteristics were statistically significant. Conclusion Lower LGB prevalence in schools was associated with a higher risk of unhealthy weight-control behaviors in youth regardless of sexual orientation, which may reflect either the contextual influence of school climate, or may be due to residual confounding.

AB  - With a person-centered approach, the constellations of internal motivation and external motivation to respond without prejudice within individuals are examined, and how these relate to directly and indirectly reported levels of prejudice. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four subgroups of motivated individuals among large national samples of majority members in Germany (N = 1745) and in the Netherlands (N = 1645). With one exception, these subgroups differed in the proportion of prejudiced individuals as well as the average level of self-reported prejudice. Our findings make a contribution to the literature by highlighting the importance of considering how internal and external motivations are organized within individuals for understanding their prejudicial responses.

AB  - The aim of this study is to uncover effects of selection and socialization on the perceived need for punishment within the police force. Punitiveness and authoritarianism of police officers can be relatively stable attitudes that can already appear when individuals choose the police profession in terms of a selection effect. Two effects of institutional socialization are examined. Firstly, the effect of the time already spent at the university within the police sample. Secondly, the effect due to increasing age and work experience. The analyses are based on data from police students with and without prior police work experience (n = 274) and a representative sample of the general population (n = 892).
   The results indicate that there are hardly any selection effects. The duration of the police studies has a reducing effect on punitiveness and authoritarianism. Police students with prior work experience as police officers are less punitive and authoritarian with increasing age. The cause of this age effect, which is not directly related to work experience, is discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to analyze whether the social class of the aggressor and the degree of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance influence the blaming of the victim in a case of rape suffered by a woman. Participating in the study was a sample of 216 university students (82 men and 136 women). The participants read a rape scenario in which the aggressor's social class was manipulated (high social class vs. low social class) and responded to a questionnaire about the blame of the victim, a questionnaire about right-wing authoritarianism, and a questionnaire about social dominance. The results show that the victim was blamed more when the aggressor was from a low social class and when the participants had high scores in right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance. They also reflect an interaction between the social class of the aggressor and social dominance: Participants who scored high in social dominance blamed the victim more when the aggressor was from a low social class.

AB  - This study explored the relationship between the ability to talk to others in more than one language and ethnic prejudice, considering the quality and quantity of intergroup contact. A structural equation model analysis was carried out on a sample of 631 Italian citizens. The results showed that multilingualism led to an increase of acceptance of intergroup differences and positive attitudes toward Moroccans and that the quality (but not quantity) of intergroup contact-mediated those relationships. The mediating role of the quality of intergroup contact extends previous results on the relationship between multilingualism and positive attitudes toward ethnic out-groups. These findings are important from a scientific point of view, as they enrich the conditions of the intergroup contact hypothesis.

AB  - This study explores the effects of intergroup vicarious ostracism on individual prejudicial attributions and aggressive intentions. It takes Tibetan and Hui college students in northwestern China as participants. Study 1 and Study 2 explore the difference in observers' prejudicial attributions and aggressive intentions, respectively, when the group members who experienced ostracism (Tibetan college students) observed an in-group member being ostracized by out-group members versus an in-group member being ostracized by in-group members. Results show that those in-group participants, i.e., the Tibetan college students, who observed an in-group member being ostracized by out-group members, showed much higher prejudicial attributions, F(1, 106) = 19.65, p < .001, eta p(2) = .156, and aggressive intentions, F(1, 108) = 10.51, p = .002, eta p(2) = .089, toward ostracizers than those who observed an in-group member being ostracized by in-group members. In Study 3, Hui college students were recruited as participants to further test the results of Study 1 and Study 2. In addition, we also found that under the out-group conditions, prejudicial attribution mediates the effects of inclusionary status on aggressive intentions (95% bias-corrected confidence interval did not include zero; 95% CI [0.15, 0.69]). This study shows that ostracizers' group membership could affect observers' prejudicial attributions and their aggressive intentions toward the ostracizers.

AB  - Grounded in social representation theory and its empirical investigation into the 'social arena', inspired by the 'modelling paradigmatic approach', the research presented in this article is part of a larger project aimed at reconstructing the 'multivoice', and 'multi-agent' discourse about (im)migration. Specifically, this contribution's focus is on the exploration of shaping and sharing social representations about (im)migrants through communication via the social medium 'Twitter'. A total of 1,958 tweets (967 Italian and 991 English tweets) were analysed through Systeme Portable Pour L'Analyse Des Donnees Textuelles [Portable System for Textual Data Analysis]SPAD in two lexical correspondence analyses. The results show a dichotomous discourse organising a semantic space structured around five different factors for the two distinct Twitter corpora: both clearly show polarised social representations of 'immigrants-migrants', leading to exclusion-inclusion policies depending on the discursive agent's ideological affiliation in the Italian and the international political frame. Used as a propaganda tool, Twitter echoes the related pro- and anti-immigration polemical representations of opposite political leaders in posts that are positioned differently in relation to the progressive/conservative ideology.

AB  - Coordinating competing interests can be difficult. Because law regulates human behavior, it is a candidate mechanism for creating coordination in the face of societal disagreement. We argue that findings from moral psychology are necessary to understand why law can effectively resolve co-occurring conflicts related to punishment and group membership. First, we discuss heterogeneity in punitive thought, focusing on punishment within the United States legal system. Though the law exerts a weak influence on punitive ideologies before punishment occurs, we argue that it effectively coordinates perceptions of individuals who have already been punished. Next, we discuss intergroup conflict, which often co-occurs with disagreements related to punishment and represents a related domain where coordination can be difficult to achieve. Here, we underscore how insights from moral psychology can promote equality via the law. These examples demonstrate how contributions from moral psychology are necessary to understand the connection between social cognition and law.

KW  - Benevolent gender prejudice
KW  - Rational thinking ability
KW  - Gender difference
KW  - Critical thinking
KW  - Education
AB  - Benevolent gender prejudice, which is often implicit and might even seem goodwilled, has been attributed to perceived gender-based differences in rational thinking ability. Specifically, men have been perceived as having stronger rational thinking ability than women. Critical thinking, which is strongly associated with both creative thinking and creative research ability, is a significant aspect of rational thinking. Using the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), the present study measured a random sample of 1075 male and female undergraduates in China. The results indicated that females' critical thinking disposition was slightly higher than that of males. It follows, then, that benevolent gender prejudice in education is based on ill-founded judgments about gender difference. These findings provide support for eradicating stereotypes about the relationship between gender and rational thinking, which can help to reduce gender prejudice in education and thereby promote healthy personal and professional development.

AB  - While young South Koreans' (SKs') views on North Korean (NK) refugees, North Korea and Korean reunification have become increasingly negative or callous, less is understood about viable interventions to address their aggravating attitudes. Through the lens of Allport's intergroup contact theory, the current study explored how SK college students' friendships with NK refugees influence their perspectives on (a) attitudes towards NK refugees; (b) interest in North Korea; and (c) views about Korean reunification. We used a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design that integrates quantitative data via a survey and qualitative data via in-depth interviews. Survey data drawn from 276 SK college students revealed that those with NK refugee friends showed more favourable attitudes towards the NK refugee population, greater interest in North Korea-related issues and NK society, and more positive perspectives on Korean reunification. A cross-analysis of in-depth interviews with 11 SK college students who developed friendships with NK refugees yielded five primary domains: (a) initial occasion on which they met the NK refugee friend(s); (b) feelings and thoughts about friendships with NK refugee(s); (c) friendship-induced changes in perceptions of the NK refugee population; (d) friendship-induced changes in perceptions of North Korea; and (e) friendship-induced changes in perceptions of Korean reunification. Based on the intergroup friendship's promising effects that our findings suggest, we discussed the benefits of employing educational practices that could promote intergroup contacts and understandings of North Korea and the refugee population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Recent studies and theorizing (SD-HARM model) suggested that social dominance orientation (SDO) constitutes the ideological foundation of negative attitude towards animals and acceptance of their exploitation. At the same time, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) is expected to predict speciesist beliefs only when they are perceived as part of societal tradition. The present studies investigated these predictions with moral condemnation of harm done to animals by humans as an indicator of speciesism.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   400 and 324 people, aged 18-87, took part in two cross-sectional studies. They reported their levels of SDO and RWA and made moral judgments of harm done to animals.
   RESULTS
   In both studies, SDO, but not RWA, negatively predicted moral condemnation of harming animals.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The results offer additional support for the SD-HARM model. The more people accept SDO beliefs, the less they morally condemn harm done to animals by humans.

AB  - The present research aimed to replicate and extend findings by Murrar and Brauer (2018), who demonstrated that an entertainment education intervention (a music video) effectively reduced US residents' anti-Muslim prejudice. Using a German sample (N = 203), we confirmed that watching the video significantly reduced recipients' prejudice toward Muslims compared to a control condition and two alternative interventions. Unlike in Murrar and Brauer, however, the intervention's advantageous effect was driven by recipients' feelings of intergroup anxiety and perceptions of outgroup malleability rather than their identification with Muslims. Extending Murrar and Brauer's findings, our results also suggest for whom entertainment education interventions may work best, namely for recipients high in right-wing authoritarianism. The findings' theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the views of teachers, foreign and Turkish students, and their parents regarding students' common experiences and future expectations in schools in Turkey.
   Method: Using mixed-methods research in line with this aim, qualitative data were collected in 2019 from 26 students from different school types in Istanbul's Pendik District and their parents; qualitative data were collected from 535 teachers using the Attitudes Toward Foreigners Scale and a semi-structured in-depth interview form.
   Findings: The findings obtained from the interviews in the research's qualitative phase were analyzed under four thematic headings: (1) View Toward Foreigners, (2) Prejudices, (3) Future Plans and Expectations, and (4) Concerns. The evaluations show Turkish students' and parents' negative views toward foreigners. The research's quantitative phase found teachers to generally have similar negative attitudes toward foreigners. Implications for Research and Practice: All these data show the need to provide appropriate conditions for contact through competent authorities by bringing Turkish and foreign students together in equal status, especially in schools, to reduce prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - This study contributes to social trust research by examining the extent to which cross-group interaction provokes exclusionary reactions among trusters. Specifically, we examine whether unpleasant contact with ethnic outgroup members constrains the relationship between social trust and ethnic exclusionism among majority members. The analysis shows that: (a) social trust relates negatively to ethnic exclusionism, (b) unpleasant contact experiences relate positively to ethnic exclusionism, and (c) social trust is almost unrelated to ethnic exclusionism when contact experiences have been unpleasant. Inconsistent with "moralistic" perspectives, social trusters' views of ethnic outgroup members are remarkably experience-based. To understand the "experiential effect", we develop a tentative interpretation emphasizing the joint capacity of negative emotions and group membership salience to enhance the implications of unpleasant encounters among contacted trusters. The analysis is based on the 2014-European Social Survey, including 27,796 individuals and 21 countries. The concluding section discusses how our affect-salience interpretation adds to the experiential understanding of social trust and interethnic relations in contemporary nations.

AB  - To examine the contribution of background variables, threat variables, and personal and community resources to participants' perceived social distance toward unauthorized migrants. Study participants were 168 Israeli citizens/longtime residents of three disadvantaged neighborhoods in Israel, who filled out self-report questionnaires. We applied a hierarchical regression model and also examined the direct and indirect contribution of the abovementioned variables to the social distance of these longtime residents toward unauthorized migrants in Israel. All participants reported high levels of social distance, irrespective of their physical proximity to the migrants. Cultural disparity was perceived as a major threat. Residents who lived in close proximity to migrants particularly expressed concern about harm to their economic well-being. Although political preference had no statistically significant direct effect on social distance, the mediation analysis revealed a complete indirect mechanism of the effect of political preference on social distance through threat perceptions. The research broadened our understanding of longtime neighborhood residents' perceived social distance toward migrants.It migrants. It also contributes to the development of knowledge, which will form the basis for intervention programs in the community

AB  - The ways in which people respond to stigma can have important consequences for health outcomes, yet there is no measure that assesses responses to stigma that can be used across groups stigmatized for different reasons. The aims of this study were to develop and psychometrically evaluate a new stigma responses questionnaire that can be used by individuals with different types of stigmatized characteristics: the Discrimination and Prejudice Responses Scale (DAPR). On the basis of qualitative interviews with 20 people with lived experience of stigma, 96 items were developed. A principal components analysis (n = 966) identified 11 factors containing a total of 44 items: Preparation. Enjoyable Activity, Raise Awareness, Group Attachment, Rumination, Blame, Preparation, Self-Reliance, Avoidance, Distancing, and Secrecy. Each factor was found to have good reliability (alpha = .67 to 0.94) and acceptability. Confirmatory factor analysis (n = 592) confirmed the 11-factor model and provided validity for the measure. Each subscale of the DAPR was found to be significantly associated with related questionnaires in the expected directions, providing evidence for concurrent validity (n = 546). One-week test-retest reliability (n = 154) was examined, with weighted Cohen's kappa values ranging from 0.41-0.61 for each scale. Overall, the DAPR displayed sound psychometric properties with regard to factor structure, reliability, acceptability, and validity. In conclusion, the DAPR is a reliable and valid measure of responding to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination which can be used across a variety of marginalized groups.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to adapt and validate the Prejudice Against Immigrants Scale (PAIS) in the Italian context, based on the Prejudice Against Asylum Seekers Scale byAnderson (2018). The validity, reliability, and measurement invariance across gender, age, and educational levels of the scale were assessed through three sources, which involved 306 Italian individuals (N-men= 151, 49.3%) between 18 and 60 years old. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) confirmed the two-factor solution of the original instrument by excluding two items, which were present in the previous validation study. The first factor isclassical prejudice against immigrants, which maps onto theoretical derivations of classical and old-fashioned prejudices, whereas the second factor isconditional prejudice against immigrants, which maps onto theoretical derivations of subtle and modern prejudices. Findings of the multigroup CFAs demonstrated full configural and metric invariance and partial scalar invariance of the scale across gender, age, and educational level. The analyses confirmed that PAIS has high levels of reliability and criterion and construct validity, showing findings that are comparable to those ofAnderson (2018). These results suggest that PAIS presents very good psychometric properties and could be considered a valid and reliable instrument to measure prejudice against immigrants, by enabling Italian researchers to detect both covert and more subtle forms of prejudice against immigrants. Limitations and further directions are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between residential segregation and social trust of immigrants and natives in the Netherlands. Building on previous studies that have found evidence for a negative segregation-trust link, we present a nuanced narrative by (i) distinguishing between an ethnic minority and majority perspective, (ii) elaborating theoretical foundations on the moderating role of individual exposure in the form of ethnic minority concentration in the neighborhood, and (iii) taking income segregation into account. In addition to the refined theoretical framework, our study employs a rigorous empirical approach. Using two waves (2009 and 2013) of the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study-a geocoded panel study with an oversampling of Moroccan and Turkish immigrants-we are able to study the influence of (changes in) municipality-level segregation patterns for both natives and immigrants, and consider the roles of both neighborhood ethnic minority concentration, as well as income-based segregation. Results from four-level multilevel models show that ethnic segregation is negatively related to the social trust of immigrants. At the same time, this negative relationship is particularly strong in neighborhoods with a low level of minority population concentration, which provides support for the so-called integration paradox where negative intergroup interactions reduce social trust. For respondents of Dutch origin, we find no evidence that their social trust is sensitive to ethnic segregation or that this relationship is conditional on minority concentration at the neighborhood level.

AB  - Language provides an ever-present context for our cognitions and has the ability to shape them. Languages across the world can be gendered (language in which the form of noun, verb, or pronoun is presented as female or male) versus genderless. In an ongoing debate, one stream of research suggests that gendered languages are more likely to display gender prejudice than genderless languages. However, another stream of research suggests that language does not have the ability to shape gender prejudice. In this research, we contribute to the debate by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) method which captures the meaning of a word from the context in which it occurs. Using text data from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project (that contains text from billions of publicly facing websites) across 45 world languages, covering the majority of the world's population, we test for gender prejudice in gendered and genderless languages. We find that gender prejudice occurs more in gendered rather than genderless languages. Moreover, we examine whether genderedness of language influences the stereotypic dimensions of warmth and competence utilizing the same NLP method.

AB  - This paper presents the Sensory Interactive Table (SIT): an instrumented, interactive dining table. Through the use of load cells and LEDs that are embedded in the table surface, SIT allows us to study: (1) the eating behaviors of people in a social setting, (2) the social interactions around the eating behaviors of people in a social setting, and (3) the continuous cycle of feedback through LEDs on people's eating behavior and their response to this feedback in real time, to ultimately create an effective dietary support system. This paper presents the hard- and software specifications of the system, and it shows the potential of the system to capture mass-related dimensions in real time and with high accuracy and spatial resolution.

AB  - As the technology for ectogenesis continues to advance, the ethical implications of such developments should be thoroughly and proactively explored. The possibility of full ectogenesis remains hypothetical at present, and myriad concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the technology must be evaluated and addressed, while pressing moral considerations should be fully deliberated. However, it is conceivable that the technology may become sufficiently well established in the future and that eventually full ectogenesis might be deemed ethically acceptable as a reproductive alternative to gestation within a human womb under certain circumstances. If the safety and efficacy of full ectogenesis are established, if ethical dilemmas are sufficiently well addressed, and if the technology is offered as a reproductive option to cisgender heterosexual individuals or couples desiring to become parents, there is a moral obligation grounded in social justice to ensure that full ectogenesis be made available to individuals or couples identifying as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups who likewise seek to pursue parenthood. We examine the history of access to current family-building options, including assisted reproductive technology, surrogacy and adoption, for these populations and conclude that in the absence of robust empirical evidence suggesting an increased risk of harm to children of individuals and couples who identify as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups, equitable access to ectogenesis as a pathway to parenthood for sexual and gender minorities must be assured as a matter of reproductive justice.

AB  - Even though economic globalization and foreign trade are major topics in the political discourse of most societies and negative attitudes toward international trade are prevalent, there is a lack of research investigating the ideological roots of protectionist preferences from a psychological perspective. In the present research, we examined the implications of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) for trade attitudes. Using data from two nationally representative samples from the United States (Study 1) and Germany (Study 2), we found that RWA predicted protectionist attitudes above and beyond economic self-interest. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between RWA and opposition to international trade was moderated by political involvement. The association of SDO with protectionist attitudes was inconsistent across the two studies and was not moderated by political involvement. Taken together, these results emphasize the importance of basic ideological orientations and the psychological dispositions they reflect in explaining public attitudes toward international trade.

AB  - Weight bias comprises a multitude of stereotypes about individuals with large bodies, as well as negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors. In a culture of normative discontent that emphasizes thinness as a social ideal, many counselors will inevitably work with clients who seek assistance with weight loss. Although weight loss may be a client's identified treatment goal, counselors must consider the potential for harm working toward such a goal in therapy. In this article, we utilize justice motive theory to discuss the potential unintended harm to clients in counseling when weight bias is not considered as part of a case conceptualization. Through the examination of three common social messages related to body weight (i.e., the controllability of body weight, the morality of weight, the social acceptability of weight bias), the justice motive is used to illustrate a case example and the implications for counseling. Considerations for socially just practices in counseling are discussed, as well as future research directions.

AB  - The present study investigated whether the associations of positive and negative intergroup contact with behavioral intentions (intentions to have contact with the outgroup in the future) are moderated by social dominance orientation (SDO), by considering the perspective of both majority and minority group members in China. Participants were 325 Han (majority) and 373 Uyghur (minority) members, who completed a self-report questionnaire. Results indicated that positive contact was associated with more positive behavioral intentions among high-SDO majority group members, whereas SDO did not moderate the association between positive contact and behavioral intentions among minority group members. In addition, negative contact was associated with lower behavioral intentions among high-SDO majority group members, and among low-SDO minority group members. This study suggests that attention should be placed simultaneously on positive and negative contact and on individual difference variables relevant to social ideologies, such as SDO.

AB  - Although there have been many empirical studies of terrorism within the psychology literature, relatively few studies have theorized terrorism from the perspective of collective action theory. The present study aimed to understand factors that predict support for Islamist terrorism by using the Encapsulate Model of Social Identity in Collective Action (EMSICA) perspective. To extend previous studies, we added perception of threat and intergroup contact to the model. A correlational study using 66 terrorism detainees in Indonesia as participants found solid support for our expanded EMSICA. The models extending EMSICA with perception of threat and quantity of contact as predictors had improved fit indices and explained more variance in the dependent variable support for Islamist terrorism, as compared to the standard model. Social identity had a significant direct effect on support for Islamist terrorism and mediated the effect of intergroup contact, perception of threat, perceived injustice, and group efficacy on support for Islamist terrorism.

AB  - Social media is an important transmitter of anti-immigration political rhetoric. In this study, we examine the discussions posted in a Finnish online forum provoked by an MP's anti-multiculturalist Facebook post. We draw upon frame analysis and discursive social psychology to analyse the communicative processes that challenge and normalise anti-immigration political rhetoric. Using frame analysis, we study how forum users entered heated societal discussion on multiculturalism by framing the MP's anti-multiculturalist address as either hate speech or - more dominantly - as normal political conduct. Using discursive social psychology, we examine constructions of multiculturalism in these discussions. We demonstrate how anti-immigration political communication was normalised, multiculturalism was constructed as a threat and the proponents of multiculturalism were discredited. We argue that to understand the rise of anti-immigration political movements, it is important to examine everyday political deliberation online as part of a wider discursive landscape.

AB  - The course Social Work With Sexual and Gender Minorities was offered as a summer social work elective in the Master of Social Work (MSW) program at a Midwestern university over two consecutive years. The purpose of the course was to provide students with a broad overview of the needs facing sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations and to prepare them for social work roles ranging from research, practice, and advocacy. One-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to test for changes in students' self-reported levels of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) clinical skill development and general knowledge regarding practice with SGM populations. Results show significant increases in self-reported levels of LGBT clinical skill development and also in general knowledge related to practice with SGM populations. A content analysis of students' responses on course evaluations revealed five themes: satisfaction with the course, recommending others take the course, acquisition of new information, importance of the information to practice, and the usefulness of the simulation assignment.

AB  - Despite an increase in research relating to racial disparities in policing-particularly in the area of deadly force-there have been comparatively few attempts to theorize which factors predict disparate policing. We fill this gap by combining routine activity theory from criminology with situationist approaches to discrimination from social psychology. We propose that disparate policing is most likely to occur when officers who are vulnerable to situational risk factors for bias encounter citizens who are members of vulnerable out-groups. We argue that situational risk factors for bias and aggression among police provoke feelings of threat and motivate self-protection and/or feelings of disgust and out-group derogation. We present social psychological laboratory research and, where available, field research specific to policing as a way of exploring and bolstering the proposed framework. This work supports an agenda for future scientific research that may assist practitioners in identifying likely opportunities for reform even as we await further field research that tests these hypothesized parameters.

AB  - In this article, we test if national identification is associated with legitimation of the national social systems based on the main tenets of social identity theory. Specifically, we distinguish between patriotism and nationalism to argue that the strongest predictor should be nationalism because it entails a sense of superiority over other countries. In addition, we test if this association is more pronounced in high-status groups considering that national identity is hierarchically constructed. In two studies conducted in Chile and Peru, we found partial support for these hypotheses. Specifically, nationalism was a significant predictor of system justification and perception of meritocracy after accounting for different theoretically relevant covariates, and this association was stronger among high-status groups.

AB  - This study confronted the classical idea that generalized prejudice is rooted in a cognitive tendency to sort reality into rigid and simple categories with the more recent idea that prejudice is shaped by moral intuitions. In a diverse Swedish sample (N = 430), moral absolutism was more strongly associated with generalized prejudice against derogated and dissident (but not dangerous) groups than were other aspects of intolerance of ambiguity. But there was little direct association between any aspect of intolerance of ambiguity and generalized prejudice once indirect relations through binding moral intuitions (which elevated prejudice) and individualizing moral intuitions (which decreased prejudice) had been taken into account. These findings suggest that intolerance of ambiguity is associated with generalized prejudice mainly insofar as it leads to a distinctly moral dichotomization of persons into categories such as insiders and outsiders, law-abiding citizens and deviants, and the righteous and the impure.

AB  - Although human values and value dissimilarity play pivotal roles in the prejudice literature, there remain important gaps in our understanding. To address these gaps, we recruited three British samples (N = 350) and presented Muslim immigrants, refugees, and economic migrants as target groups. Using polynomial regression analyses, we simultaneously tested effects of individuals' own values, their perceptions of immigrant values, and self-immigrant value dissimilarities on prejudice. Results indicated that favorability toward immigrants is higher when individuals hold higher self-transcendence values (e.g., equality) and lower self-enhancement values (e.g., power), and when they perceive immigrants to hold higher self-transcendence values and lower self-enhancement values. In addition, prejudice toward immigrants is higher when individuals who hold higher conservation values (e.g., security) perceive immigrants to value openness (e.g., freedom) more, suggesting a value dissimilarity effect. No value dissimilarity effects emerged when immigrants were perceived to be higher in conservation, self-transcendence, or self-enhancement values. Overall, these results showed that effects of values and value dissimilarity differ depending on which value dimension is considered. Additionally, the results revealed support for a novel mechanism with the motivation to be nonprejudiced underpinning the links between individuals' values and prejudice. Our discussion highlights the multifaceted manner in which values are linked to prejudice.

AB  - We examined Turkish participants' mindreading accuracy toward ingroup versus outgroup targets. Three hundred and fifty-four Turkish participants were randomly assigned to one of three target groups: Turkish, Syrian, or Norwegian. The mindreading accuracy for these targets was measured along with the perceived cultural similarity of the target to the ingroup, as well as prejudice and threat perception. Participants evidenced higher mindreading accuracy toward Turkish targets compared with Syrian and Norwegian targets. Mindreading accuracy for the Syrian and Norwegian targets did not differ, but lower perceived similarity to the Turkish ingroup significantly predicted lower mentalizing for Syrian and Norwegians. In the Syrian target group, lower perceived similarity interacted with lower education and higher prejudice, resulting in a further reduction in mindreading. For Norwegian targets, lower similarity impaired mindreading through an interaction with higher threat perception. Results indicate that even when mentalizing capacity is mature, intergroup factors are linked with the deployment of mindreading.

AB  - Much research on Brexit has studied whether the vote to leave the EU is a marker of growing prejudice. In this article, we study instead how the relationship between support for Brexit and prejudice is constructed, negotiated and contested in lay discourse. Our analysis of focus groups (N = 12) conducted prior to and following the EU referendum shows that support for Brexit was predominantly constructed as based on nationalism and anti-immigration prejudice, especially in Remain-supporting accounts. This prompted identity management strategies and counter-arguments by Leave supporters, such as providing alternative constructions of prejudice and racism; relating Brexit with "progressive" values; and presenting it as rational and economically sound. In our discussion, we draw attention to the "ideological creativity" that underpins these accounts and also reflect on the possibilities and constraints of developing alternative political narratives under conditions of political polarisation.

AB  - Meta-analyses show that low levels of Openness and Agreeableness correlate with generalized prejudice. However, previous studies narrowly assessed prejudice toward low-status, disadvantaged groups. Using a broad operationalization of generalized prejudice toward a heterogeneous array of targets, we sought to answer two questions: (a) Are some types of people prejudiced against most types of groups? and (b) Are some types of people prejudiced against certain types of groups? Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to broad generalized prejudice, r = -.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-.07, -.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with broad generalized prejudice, r = -.23, 95% CI [-.31, -.16]. When target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice, they implied that perceiver-target dissimilarity on personality traits explains prejudice. Importantly, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups, suggesting it is the personality trait orienting people toward (dis)liking of others.

AB  - Autochthony is the belief that a place belongs to those who were born there and that they are more entitled. Autochthony and local identification can foster sensitivity to any source of disorder that threatens local stability. The aims of this study were to determine whether: (a) local identification is associated with a higher level of sensitivity to urban disorder and a higher level of prejudice toward immigrants; (b) higher city identifiers use autochthony (entitlement for first comers) as a justification for both of these attitudes. A self-report questionnaire was administered to 254 adult residents of Turin, Italy. Local identification was found related to autochthony and to urban disorder sensitivity, autochthony was positively associated with both urban disorder sensitivity and prejudice toward immigrants and it mediated the relationship between local identification and prejudice.

AB  - Previous attempts to identify personality traits that enhance inclination to social anxiety (SA) have been limited by a tendency to focus on selected traits in isolation, rather than examining their interactions. Additional research is needed to better understand whether and how these dimensions are linked to SA. In a prospective study, it was examined how interactions between the Big Five personality factors predict SA symptoms. A total of 135 individuals, aged 18-50years, were recruited. Personality traits were measured at baseline, and SA symptoms were assessed one month later. Results showed that low emotional stability was an independent predictor of higher levels of SA. Additionally, two significant interactions emerged: the interactions between extraversion and openness, and between openness and agreeableness predicted SA symptoms. At high openness, higher extraversion was associated with significantly lower levels of SA, suggesting that the interaction provides incrementally greater protection against SA. Thus, extraverts are likely to be protected against social anxiety symptoms, but more so the more open they are. Moreover, at high levels of agreeableness, low openness has been shown to be uniquely predictive for higher levels of SA symptoms, indicating that the combined effect of openness with agreeableness may be more important to SA than either trait in isolation. These findings highlight the importance of testing interaction effects of personality traits on psychopathology.

AB  - Objective: We explored the desire to be a parent, attachment avoidance and their associations in a sample of gay men and lesbians and their heterosexual counterparts. Background: Previous research suggested a link between minority stress and higher attachment avoidance. However, the association between attachment avoidance and parenthood desires as a function of sexual orientation was not studied. Methods: The sample was composed of 883 community-dwelling participants (51.1% women, 30.57% identified as gay men and 14.15% as lesbians) that were recruited through convenience sampling. Results: Gay men and lesbians reported less desire to be parents than their heterosexual counterparts and higher attachment avoidance. However, the association between attachment avoidance and less desire for parenthood was moderated by sexual orientation, such that the correlation between attachment avoidance and lesser desire for parenthood was only found for heterosexual men and women. Conclusion: These findings pinpoint the potential vulnerability of gay men and lesbians to develop greater attachment avoidance and the impact of sexual orientation on the association between attachment avoidance and the desire to be a parent. The moderation effect is discussed in terms of the specific reproductive alternatives available to gay men and lesbians vs. the heterosexual population.

AB  - This article provides experimental empirical evidence on the penalization of a father of high professional status who decides to use a family friendly measure (FFM) offered by his company. A cross-cultural sample of university students (in the field of Business Administration and Economics) from Ghana and Spain was used to evaluate a hypothetical male employee who after the birth of their child either used a reduction of the working day or worked traditional hours. We compared the results with those obtained for an identical female employee. We considered several variables that mediated the effect of using the FFM on the behavior proxy items. We also considered the participants' (explicit and implicit) attitudes towards fathers caring for their babies. We obtained strong empirical evidence on the penalization of a father who uses a reduction of the working day. However, and contrary to expectations, in Spain this penalty experienced by the father was similar to that experienced by the mother, while in Ghana it was greater.

AB  - Affective interethnic ties are highly effective for improving out-group attitudes, especially during adolescence. Yet, young people face several obstacles to developing such ties in society. One potential means of fostering greater interethnic connectivity is through youth engagement: that is, formal, organized social participation in groups, clubs, or activities. However, little is still known about its effectiveness; especially for overcoming structural obstacles to contact in society, such as residential segregation. This study has two aims: to robustly examine whether youth engagement can build positive interethnic contact among young people; and, to perform the first systematic test of whether sites of engagement can act as Associational Bridges, providing greater opportunities for contact among youth from more segregated environments. To pursue these aims, the study exploited a unique data opportunity to perform a quasi-experimental analysis of a large-scale, nationally-implemented youth engagement scheme in the United Kingdom. The study uses pre-test/post-test data on N=1371 participants (M-age=16.7; 63% Female; 36% non-White) and N=1946 propensity-score matched controls (M-age=16.7; 62% Female; 36% non-White). Applying a (matched) difference-in-difference approach, the findings demonstrate that participation led to an increase in affective interethnic ties, which were evident at least 4-6 months after involvement had ended. Participation also had a stronger positive impact on youth from more residentially segregated areas: although joining the scheme with fewer interethnic ties, post-participation they reported just as many ties as their peers from less segregated areas. However, participation had no difference in effects for youth from more or less ethnically diverse areas. Youth engagement may thus be an effective tool for fostering positive contact; particularly among those from more segregated environments. However, attention should be paid to the design and recruitment practices of engagement programs to understand which structural barriers to contact in society they can overcome.

AB  - Studies of immigration attitudes have typically taken the majority perspective, focusing on views of majority rather than minority groups. However, as modern societies have grown in diversity and more people within society have migration histories, this approach has become more partial. This article uses European Social Survey Round 7 to explore attitudes towards immigration from the perspective of Muslim Europeans. Muslim attitudes are compared to Christian and secular majority populations in eight European countries with large/moderate Muslim populations. We show that income has a weaker effect on Muslim attitudes compared to the secular majority and that Muslims hold more favourable attitudes towards migrants from poorer countries. We argue that European Muslim attitudes towards immigration fit better with Social Identity Theory and are less a consequence of competition. We propose an additional model for understanding immigration attitudes, whereby people's personal histories and experiences create empathy with others across national borders.

AB  - The present study examines the relationship between self-reported friendships with Blacks and implicit preferences for Whites relative to Blacks. There is considerable evidence that friendships relate to more favorable attitudes toward outgroups, however, the bulk of this evidence comes from explicit self-report measures. Using a sample of 123,445 participants that completed a Black-White IAT on the Project Implicit website, results indicate that participants reporting either childhood or post-childhood friendships with Blacks demonstrated weaker implicit preferences for Whites over Blacks. The size of this relationship was substantially smaller than found for explicit evaluations of Blacks.

AB  - In the context of our work, we want to point out how religion has multiple social functions and as such, under certain circumstances, can serve as a fertile soil for distance and closeness. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of religious self-identification and church attendance on social distance toward Muslims. We applied a questionnaire to students of the University of Split, the city which is geographically in vicinity of the complex of ethnic and religious context of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results showed that religious self-identification and church attendance significantly influence the level of social distance toward Muslims. Believers showed a significantly higher level of social distance, in comparison to respondents who belong but not believe, and others. Respondents who attend church daily or once a week have also a higher level of social distance in comparison to respondents who attend church monthly or rarely and those who never attend church. We have tried to explain the reasons for such research findings, relying on various national, cultural, religious and psychological factors that have been present in the last twenty years after the war in this region.

AB  - In this study, it was hypothesized that experimentally manipulated levels of power would moderate the association of dispositional social dominance orientation (SDO) with preferences for harsh punishment. In particular, we expected to detect a stronger effect for dispositional SDO in the low-power condition, relying on the notion that low power enhances sensitivity to threats to the status quo, and that high SDO individuals are particularly motivated to enforce hierarchy-enhancing measures as punishment. SDO scores were measured two months prior to the experiment, and then immediately after the experimental session. As expected, preexperimental SDO interacted with the power manipulation. We found stronger preexperimental SDO effects on punishment among low-power participants. We also anticipated and found that individuals high in SDO increased further their postexperimental SDO scores if assigned to a high-power condition. The discussion focuses on the importance of SDO effects among low-status groups and on how situational roles shape dispositional self-descriptions.

AB  - One recurring criticism of immigrant groups is their alleged failure to be employed and contribute to the host society. Here we examine how speakers mobilise a criticism that has attracted less research attention: that through their economic activity immigrant groups usurp others' employment entitlements. Discourse analysis of data from seven focus group discussions about pre-Brexit Polish immigration into the UK, involving 31 UK nationals, shows that participants accomplish exclusionary outcomes in two divergent ways. The first attributes qualities to Polish workers but also makes explicit the consequences of these attributions for UK nationals, rendering speakers' investment in such claims visible. The second relies on the production of category pairs, within which claims can be made for the category that excludes Polish workers. This use of categories comprises 'safe prejudice', a form of prejudice not previously identified but which is less open to challenge than other forms of prejudiced talk.

AB  - We extended recent experimental research on the consequences of social movements' use of strategic nonviolence versus violence to a new situational and cultural context. In the context of the Iranian Green movement, whose use of nonviolence in 2009 was rather unsuccessful, 122 Iranians (mostly Reformists) imagined the same movement reemerging in the future and using either violent or nonviolent strategies. Consistent with our hypotheses. participants were more willing to support the nonviolent movement and had more positive attitudes toward joining it as compared to the violent movement. The mechanism underlying these effects relies on attributions of greater mental capacity and morality to nonviolent movements. Implications for research on collective action, social movements. and social change are discussed.

AB  - Despite reports that there has been a positive trend in perception and treatment of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals in recent years (Griffin, 2012; Loftus, 2001), sport, in general, is still an uncertain, and sometimes even hostile, environment for LGB athletes (Anderson, 2005; Waldron & Krane, 2005). To gain more information on coach understanding and perceptions of the team environment, 10 high school head coaches in the United States were interviewed to explore their experiences coaching openly LGB athletes. Qualitative analyses revealed four primary themes associated with coach experiences: team environment dogmas and observations, fundamental beliefs contributing to perceptions of LGB athletes, types and timing of sexual orientation disclosure, and differential LGB athlete characteristics. Future research should examine these primary themes in more detail through interviews with LGB athletes, as well as high school coaches in more traditionally masculine sports, such as football, men's basketball, and wrestling.

AB  - With the aim of understanding the relationship between the presence of immigrants and prejudice toward them, we tested two competing predictions drawn from the outgroup threat theory and the contact hypothesis. We also tested whether such relationship differed depending on individual political ideology. The results of a multilevel analysis conducted on longitudinal data from an Italian sample (N = 3,871, nested in 103 Italian counties) revealed that, in line with the group threat theory, the association between the immigrants' group size and prejudice was positive only among right-wingers. Strengths, limitations, and possible developments of this research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Previous research has consistently reported high rates of mental health symptomatology and lower social support in young treatment seeking transgender individuals. However, these studies have failed to distinguish between transgender people who identify within the gender binary and those who identify as non-binary.
   Aims: This study aimed to compare levels of mental health symptomatology (anxiety, depression, and non-suicidal self-injury behavior) and social support of treatment seeking non-binary transgender young individuals with those self-identified as binary transgender young individuals. All participants attended a national transgender health service in the UK during a 2-year period.
   Measures: Age and gender identity descriptors were collected, as well as clinical measures of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-esteem (The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), non-suicidal self-injury (Non-Suicidal Self-Injury: Treatment Related), and social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support).
   Results: A total of 388 young people, aged 16-25 years, agreed participation; 331 (85.3%) identified as binary and 57 (14.7%) as non-binary. Analysis of the data showed the non-binary group experienced significantly more anxiety and depression and had significantly lower self-esteem than the binary group. There were no significant differences between groups in the likelihood of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury behavior or levels of social support.
   Conclusions: Non-binary identifying treatment seeking transgender youth are at increased risk of developing anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem compared to binary transgender youth. This may reflect the even greater barriers and feelings of discrimination that may be faced by those whose identity does not fit the notion of binary gender that is pervasive in how society views both cis- and transgender populations.

AB  - This experiment tested whether interacting with a peer who holds explicitly anti-fat attitudes leads to cognitive performance deficits and poorer psychological and cardiovascular outcomes among higher body weight women by increasing anticipated rejection. One hundred and forty six higher body weight women were randomly assigned to interact in a non-romantic context with a same-sex peer who endorsed explicit anti-fat or unbiased attitudes. All women showed greater heart rate reactivity and anger when interacting with an anti-fat peer. The heavier women were, and the more they thought they were overweight, the more they anticipated rejection when interacting with an anti-fat peer. This anticipated rejection was in turn associated with poorer cognitive performance, lower state self-esteem, and increased negative emotions, rumination, compensatory efforts, and thoughts related to anxiety and evaluation. These effects were not observed among women in our sample categorized as slightly "overweight" or who perceived themselves as only slightly overweight. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - People like their own groups, producing ingroup favoritism, a hallmark finding of social identity theory. However, as predicted by system justification or cultural learning perspectives, outgroup favoritism among non dominant groups is occasionally observed, particularly implicitly. The present research found that non-dominant group members displayed simultaneous ingroup and dominant group implicit favoritism. On indirect measures focusing on positive valence, members of non-dominant racial (Studies 1 and 4), religious (Study 2), and sexual (Study 3) groups showed ingroup favoritism. On indirect measures focusing on negative valence, members of non-dominant groups showed diminished ingroup favoritism, and sometimes favoritism towards the culturally dominant group. These results may indicate that positive self-regard forms associations between the ingroup and positive, whereas cultural learning and system justification form associations between non-dominant groups and negative. A cross-cultural design (Study 5) also found results compatible with these assumptions.

AB  - Objective: Using data from the 2015 National Crime Victimization Survey School Crime Supplement, this study examines differential outcomes for youth who report nonbias-based bullying, bias-based bullying on the basis of one social identity, and bias-based bullying on more than one social identity. Method: Data were gathered from youth aged 12 to 18 who reported experiences of bullying (N = 678, 44.2% male). The study tested outcomes regarding (a) rates of afterschool activity participation, (b) participants' self-reported fear, and (c) self-reported school avoidance and the relative impact of mediators (the negative effects of bullying, participants' perceptions of school safety, social support, and school fairness) across three types of bullying experiences. Results: Results demonstrate that perceptions of school safety, social support, and school fairness generally buffer youth from the negative effects of bullying but that these relationships differ depending on whether the victim experiences nonbias-based bullying or bias-based bullying and depending on if they are targeted because of one or multiple facets of their social identity. Further, results indicate that youth who experience bias-based bullying based on multiple social identities report more negative outcomes of bullying and higher levels of school avoidance and fear than those students who only report one type of bias-based bullying and those who experience non-bias-based bullying. Conclusion: The findings have implications for how schools should implement interventions that address bias and prejudice in bullying and should tailor interventions to the unique experiences of youth who report bias-based and nonbias-based bullying.

AB  - The rise of right-wing populist parties has been widely discussed across the social sciences during the last decade. Taking a social representational approach, we analyse organising principles and anchoring of right-wing populist thinking across four European countries (France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). Using European Social Survey data (Round 7), we compare political attitudes and self-appraisals of citizens identifying with right-wing populist, conservative right-wing, and traditional left-wing parties. The findings converge across the four countries to show that right-wing populist identifiers diverge from both left- and right-wing identifiers on vertical (between the "people" and the "elite") and horizontal (between nationals and immigrants) dimensions of differentiation. Depending on the context, right-wing populist identification was fuelled by material and physical insecurity, low political efficacy, and distrust of fellow citizens. We conclude that right-wing populism requires multiple strategies of differentiation within and between groups to justify and sustain itself.

AB  - Medicalizing beliefs about schizophrenia (biogenetic causes and psychiatric labels) are connected to the belief that people with schizophrenia are dangerous and to discriminating intentions towards them. In this research, we draw on the Social Dominance theory and we examine these beliefs as legitimizing myths that are connected to the individuals' social dominance orientation (SDO) and that legitimize discrimination. In total, 238 Humanities students participated in the current research (Mage = 20.4; SD = 3.03; 107 male and 131 female). A vignette presenting a person with schizophrenia symptoms that offered no labels or explanations about the depicted person's condition was presented to research participants. A structural equation modeling analysis was carried out, in order to confirm our hypotheses in accordance with social dominance theory. Participants' social dominance orientation (SDO) was associated with higher endorsement of medicalizing ( = .16, p < .01) and dangerousness beliefs ( = .22, p < .001). In turn, medicalizing beliefs were connected to dangerousness ( = .21, p < .001) and higher discriminating intentions, both for desired social distance ( = .15, p < .05) and for deprivation of sociopolitical rights ( = .14, p < .05). Dangerousness was highly associated with both these measures ( = .28, p < .001 and = 43, p < .001 respectively) while SDO was not significantly associated with discriminating intentions. Our model showed good fit to the data. This study confirms the role of SDO in schizophrenia stigma and the fact that ideological and power factors underpin the stigma of schizophrenia.

AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between out-group entitativity and prejudice. A quantitative analysis of 85 effect sizes from 33 independent samples showed a significant positive relationship between entitativity and prejudice (Fisher's z=.414, 95% CI [0.272, 0.557], p<.0001). Three possible moderators of the relationship between entitativity and prejudice were tested: conceptualization of the entitativity (essence-based entitativity scale, agency-based entitativity scale, common entitativity scale), the target of the prejudice, and the measures of prejudice (attitudes, emotions, behaviour towards out-group). Results demonstrated that out-group entitativity correlated with prejudice only when entitativity was conceptualized as an essence-based or common-based scale, and prejudice was measured as the attitude to the out-group. The target of prejudice does not moderate the relationship between entitativity and prejudice.

AB  - We aim to clarify a puzzling paradox: while shares of highly educated and non-religious individuals-who generally hold less prejudice-have increased in the Netherlands, levels of prejudice against ethnic minorities have yet risen over time. To solve the paradox, we use cross-sectional data from 1985 to 2011 in counterfactual analyses. In these analyses we simulate that levels of ethnic prejudice within categories of education, church membership, and church attendance are kept constant at the 1985 level and a new simulated trend in prejudice is estimated for the 1985-2011 period. Our findings show that changing levels of prejudice within categories of education are partly responsible for the trend. We conclude that the increasing share of highly educated individuals has not resulted in a decline of prejudice in the Netherlands over time, because all Dutch have become more prejudiced over the years and in particular the higher educated.

AB  - Although discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is prohibited by law in many countries, negative prejudices against Lesbian and Gay (LG) people, as a stigmatized minority, might be internalized by co-workers, being a source of a modern and subtle form of discrimination. Results from 39 in-depth semi-structured interviews with LG employees show that they are victims of workplace incivility which is manifested through jokes, use of language, stereotypes, and intrusive behaviors. Such acts are barely recognizable as a form of discrimination, due to the absence of any reference to sexual orientation, and for this reason it is more difficult to act against them at an organizational level. This is the first study that demonstrates how workplace incivility toward LG employees can be an expression of a subtle form of discrimination. It shows that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation has not disappeared; it has simply changed its manifestations. Contributions and implications of the study are discussed from a theoretical and a practical perspective.

AB  - This research aims to: (1) understand the various forms of stigma and social exclusion toward the wives of those convicted of terrorism, (2) understand the psychological impact of stigma and social exclusion toward the wives, (3) understand the coping mechanism of the wives toward stigma and social exclusion. The all Muslim participants were 24 wives of terror convicts or former convicts who lived in East Java, Central Java, and West Java. The data were collected through interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD), whereas interpretative psychological analysis were used to explore the participants' experience. Results of the study show that participants were stigmatized as "terrorist," and "ISIS." As a result, they received verbal abuse both directly and indirectly as well as threats of physical violence. The psychological impact felt by participants were a deep sense of shame and trauma. Three participants often still regret the situation although their husbands' arrest happened 3 to 12 years ago. The way participants deal with the stigma is through ignorance, hiding the real condition, and resettling at a different place.

AB  - This research investigated whether multicultural experiences impact identification with humanity within a broader prejudice-reduction framework. Results suggest two components of multicultural experiences - experiences with cultural elements and contact with cultural members - were negatively associated with ethnic (Study 1) and immigrant prejudice (Studies 2 and 3) through stronger identification with humanity. When controlling for their overlapping variance, overall findings suggest experiences with cultural elements and contact with cultural members both uniquely predicted less prejudice through identification with humanity. In Study 3, frequent, positive intercultural contact predicted less prejudice and greater concern for human rights through identification with humanity. Meta-analytic evidence suggests the negative association between experiences with cultural elements and prejudice (r = -.30) was stronger than for contact (r = -.20).

AB  - Fears, phobias, and dislikes about minorities should be strong determinants of whether Americans support policies protecting such minorities. Studies suggest that discussions and information about transgender people can reduce transphobia. However, these studies also indicate that experimental treatments do not necessarily affect individual attitudes on policies concerning transgender rights. Scholars contend that durably reducing prejudice should increase public support for minority rights. In this study, we examine this causal mechanism utilizing an experiment. We find that reducing transphobia is a reliable mechanism to increase public support for transgender rights. These results are robust to causal identification assumptions, suggesting that this mechanism provides a clear avenue for stigmatized groups to increase public support of rights for those groups.

AB  - Across two studies, we find evidence for our prediction that experimentally increasing feelings of physical safety increases conservatives' socially progressive attitudes. Specifically, Republican and conservative participants who imagined being endowed with a superpower that made them invulnerable to physical harm (vs. the ability to fly) were more socially (but not economically) liberal (Study 1) and less resistant to social change (Study 2). Results suggest that socially (but not economically) conservative attitudes are driven, at least in part, by needs for safety and security.

AB  - Those who are high in external motivation to respond without prejudice (EMS) tend to focus on non-racial attributes when describing others. This fMRI study examined the neural processing of race and an alternative yet stereotypically relevant attribute (viz., socioeconomic status: SES) as a function of the perceiver's EMS. Sixty-one White participants privately formed impressions of Black and White faces ascribed with high or low SES. Analyses focused on regions supporting race- and status-based reward/salience (NAcc), evaluation (VMPFC) and threat/relevance (amygdala). Consistent with previous findings from the literature on status-based evaluation, we observed greater neural responses to high-status (vs low-status) targets in all regions of interest when participants were relatively low in EMS. In contrast, we observed the opposite pattern when participants were relatively high in EMS. Notably, all effects were independent of target race. In summary, White perceivers' race-related motivations similarly altered their neural responses to the SES of Black and White targets. Specifically, the findings suggest that EMS may attenuate the positive value and/or salience of high status in a mixed-race context. Findings are discussed in the context of the stereotypic relationship between race and SES.

AB  - We demonstrate that pedagogic interventions utilising mediated contact and the parasocial contact hypothesis provide an effective means of instantiating both an immediate and long-term reduction in prejudice towards transgender people. Through application of the parasocial contact hypothesis, our quasi-experiment demonstrates that exposure to the combined intervention of a panel presentation and a trans-themed film resulted in a significant reduction of self-reported prejudice immediately after exposure and this effect persisted up to 6weeks later in a sample of 66 female university students. In addition to testing this effect, we also assess the relationship between prejudice towards transgender people and other forms of prejudice, including old-fashioned and modern prejudice towards gay men and lesbian women. In doing so we demonstrate that prejudice towards trans people appears to be conceptually related to prejudice towards gay men and not lesbian women. Limitations and directions for future research are explored.

AB  - While some research argues that religious pluralism in the United States dampens conflict by promoting tolerance, other work documents persistent prejudice toward religious out-groups. We address this ambiguity by identifying a distinct cultural style that structures Americans' attitudes toward religious others: support for public religious expression (PRE). Using data from a recent nationally representative survey, we find a strong and consistent relationship between high support for PRE, negative attitudes toward religious out-groups, and generalized intolerance. Addressing the previously overlooked public aspects of religion and cultural membership in the United States has important implications for studies of civic inclusion.

AB  - The present twin study combined self- and peer assessments of twins' general homophobia targeting gay men in order to replicate previous behavior genetic findings across different rater perspectives and to disentangle self-rater-specific variance from common variance in self- and peer-reported homophobia (i.e., rater-consistent variance). We hypothesized rater-consistent variance in homophobia to be attributable to genetic and nonshared environmental effects, and self-rater-specific variance to be partially accounted for by genetic influences. A sample of 869 twins and 1329 peer raters completed a seven item scale containing cognitive, affective, and discriminatory homophobic tendencies. After correction for age and sex differences, we found most of the genetic contributions (62%) and significant nonshared environmental contributions (16%) to individual differences in self-reports on homophobia to be also reflected in peer-reported homophobia. A significant genetic component, however, was self-report-specific (38%), suggesting that self-assessments alone produce inflated heritability estimates to some degree. Different explanations are discussed.

AB  - Public debates about socio-scientific issues (e.g. climate change or violent video games) are often accompanied by attacks on the reputation of the involved scientists. Drawing on the social identity approach, we report a minimal group experiment investigating the conditions under which scientists are perceived as non-prototypical, non-reputable, and incompetent. Results show that in-group affirming and threatening scientific findings (compared to a control condition) both alter laypersons' evaluations of the study: in-group affirming findings lead to more positive and in-group threatening findings to more negative evaluations. However, only in-group threatening findings alter laypersons' perceptions of the scientists who published the study: scientists were perceived as less prototypical, less reputable, and less competent when their research results imply a threat to participants' social identity compared to a non-threat condition. Our findings add to the literature on science reception research and have implications for understanding the public engagement with science.

AB  - To improve our understanding of where to target interventions, the study examined the extent to which school discipline disproportionality between African American and White students was attributable to racial disparities in teachers' discretionary versus nondiscretionary decisions. The sample consisted of office discipline referral (ODR) records for 1,154,686 students enrolled in 1,824 U.S. schools. Analyses compared the relative contributions of disproportionality in ODRs for subjectively and objectively defined behaviors to overall disproportionality, controlling for relevant school characteristics. Results showed that disproportionality in subjective ODRs explained the vast majority of variance in total disproportionality. These findings suggest that providing educators with strategies to neutralize the effects of implicit bias, which is known to influence discretionary decisions and interpretations of ambiguous behaviors, may be a promising avenue for achieving equity in school discipline.

AB  - Using a dual-process model (DPM) framework, this research examined whether right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) are differentially associated with adolescent delinquency. In Study 1 (N = 847; M-age = 15.96) and Study 2 (N = 340; M-age = 16.64), adolescents completed measures of RWA, SDO, and engagement in different forms of delinquency. In Study 2, adolescents also reported their beliefs about obeying different laws. Across both studies, adolescents who endorsed greater RWA engaged in lower levels of delinquency and those who endorsed greater SDO engaged in higher levels of delinquency. Findings from Study 2 suggest that these associations are contingent on the domain-specific purpose of the law being violated and are also present with adolescents' beliefs about their obligation to obey laws. These results extend the DPM, demonstrating that RWA and SDO are differentially linked with youth delinquency.

AB  - Since the now classic work of Newcomb (Personality and social change, Holt, New York, 1943), there has been an increasing body of research focusing on the process of academic socialisation but, as far as we know, no studies have specifically dealt with students' consumer behaviour and, more specifically, sustainable consumption. Five hundred and five participants (432 psychology students and 73 members of the administrative, technical and supervisory staff) in two French universities (one campus-based and one multisite) completed a questionnaire measuring behaviour towards potentially recyclable objects (EMCOR) developed by Rioux and Scrima (Modes de consommation durable et attitudes envers le recyclage. Etude auprSs d'une population estudiantine. Workshop Pratiques durables et responsabilit, soci,tale de l'universit,. Les comportements favorables A la seconde vie des objets de consommation [Sustainable consumption and attitudes to recycling. A study with a student population. Workshop: "Sustainable practices and social responsibility at university. Giving new life to old objects"], 2015). This tool is composed of 20 items covering four dimensions: (1) disposing of objects, (2) not reusing objects, (3) finding new uses for objects, and (4) acquiring objects. The results suggest that there was a socialisation process encouraging students to adopt sustainable consumer behaviour in the campus, but not in the multisite university. This raises questions about the current debate concerning campus-based versus town-based universities.

AB  - An age-stereotype paradox has developed in the United States due to factors that would suggest age stereotypes should be increasing in positivity over time; whereas, recent evidence shows they are becoming more negative. Reasons for predicting an increase in positivity are presented, followed by reasons that help to explain why the reverse is occurring. To illustrate the age-stereotype paradox, four domains that help to shape the status of older individuals were selected: health, intergenerational contact, legislation, and social climate. Two proposals are then made for eliminating the paradox by reversing the age-stereotypes negativity trend: establishment of an anti-aging czar and the launching of an aging-rights movement.

AB  - Although universal, the motivation to affiliate can vary as a function of individual differences and of the characteristics of the target. Three studies explored the extent to which religious beliefs and identity are related to social affiliation motivation. Because most religions advocate affiliation and provide opportunities for frequent experiences of affiliation, we reasoned that religious people might show greater affiliation motivation in everyday attitudes and behaviors. We found that religiosity was positively related to implicit and behavioral measures of general social affiliation (Studies 1 and 2). However, manipulating the identity of the affiliation target revealed that when affiliating might not lead to positive outcomes, the relation between religiosity and social affiliation disappeared (but did not reverse). In Studies 2 and 3, when the target of the affiliation was explicitly identified as a member of a threatening out-group (atheist), religiosity did not predict affiliation behaviors. We discuss the mechanisms by which religiosity motivates and constrains social affiliation and the potential implications for social influence and intergroup processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anti-atheist prejudice is pervasive worldwide. Past research indicates that this is driven by perceptions of atheist immorality, yet such perceptions have not been explored in detail. Using Moral Foundations Theory and samples of U.S. Christians, we investigated whether anti-atheist prejudice is explained by atheists' perceived adherence to certain foundational moral values more than others. Study 1 participants completed measures of moral value endorsements from the perspective of a typical atheist. Study 2 participants read that either atheists or people in general strongly endorse one of five moral foundations. Anti-atheist prejudice was consistently explained best by perceived atheist concern for values of caring/compassion rather than fairness/justice, loyalty, deferential respect, or purity/decency. Findings suggest that efforts to reduce anti-atheist prejudice should emphasize atheists' capacity for kindness and caring.

AB  - Less racially prototypic faces elicit more category competition during race categorization. Top-down factors (e.g. stereotypes), however, affect categorizations, suggesting racial prototypicality may enhance category competition in certain perceivers. Here, we examined how prejudice affects race category competition and stabilization when perceiving faces varying in racial prototypicality. Prototypically low vs high Black relative to White faces elicited more category competition and slower response latencies during categorization (Experiment 1), suggesting a pronounced racial prototypicality effect on minority race categorization. However, prejudice predicted the extent of category competition between prototypically low vs high Black faces. Suggesting more response conflict toward less prototypic Black vs White faces, anterior cingulate cortex activity increased toward Black vs White faces as they decreased in racial prototypicality, with prejudice positively predicting this difference (Experiment 2). These findings extend the literature on racial prototypicality and categorization by showing that relative prejudice tempers the extent of category competition and response conflict engaged when initially perceiving faces.

AB  - This contribution investigates the social distance of immigrants from Poland in four Western European cities - London, Birmingham, Berlin and Munich - particularly Polish immigrants' distance towards members of ethnic, religious and sexual minorities in their various social roles. Presenting unique data from the first wave of a longitudinal qualitative study, we first discuss the differential levels of social distance that Polish immigrants place between themselves and members of minority groups in each city. We find that respondents' socio-demographic characteristics impact their social distance, but their education and occupation may have less of an effect than their place of origin in Poland or current place of residence and work. Moreover, these factors work differentially across the four cities. After analysing social distance with respect to three dimensions of difference - ethnicity, religion and sexuality - we find several different social-distancing mechanisms. Ultimately, we argue that social science needs to consider regional and local contexts in which social attitudes towards minorities are acquired and exercised. Similarly, we need to reflect on the group's presumed homogeneity and on the unifying visions of the host society' as a site of migrants' incorporation.

AB  - Past work suggested that dual identity was effective to reduce prejudice. This study extended research on dual identity and prejudice by identifying a boundary condition in this relationship, that is, group permeability. In Study 1, we replicated previous studies with Chinese individuals and found that inducing dual identity (emphasizing subgroup differences and a common nation identity), compared to the control condition, decreased the urban residents' prejudice against rural-to-urban migrants. In Study 2, we manipulated the group boundary permeability using the Hukou system reform, and found that when the group boundary was permeable, dual identity was effective in reducing prejudice against rural-to-urban migrants. However, this effect vanished in the condition where the group boundary was impermeable. These results point to the importance of inducing dual identity under specific conditions for research on decreasing prejudice. Some practical implications of the findings for urbanization and immigration are discussed.

AB  - Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) is a relationship in which individuals agree that romantic or sexual relationships with others are permissible or desirable (e.g. polyamory or open relationships). Although anti-CNM prejudice is prevalent, it is not well understood. We propose that one of the bases of anti-CNM prejudice is zero-sum thinking about love - the perception that one person's love gained is another's love lost. We outline our theory and then present three studies that test our predictions. In these studies, participants read a vignette that depicted characters who were in a CNM or monogamous relationship, and then judged aspects of the characters and their relationship. In Study 1, participants who read the CNM vignette judged the protagonist's love for their initial romantic partner before and after they became involved with a second partner. Zero-sum thinking was operationally defined as the within-subject change in love ratings. In Studies 2 and 3, participants rated their agreement with items from a new preliminary measure of zero-sum romantic beliefs. We measured CNM devaluation by asking for ratings of the relationships and of individuals in the relationships. Supporting our predictions, in all three studies we found that zero-sum thinking about love was associated with increased CNM devaluation. We end by briefly discussing the implications of our findings.

AB  - This study (N=124) tested the main and interactive effects of alcohol consumption, egalitarianism, and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) in relation to prejudice suppression in the natural environment of a British Public House (pub). Employing a quasi-experimental between-subjects design, participants who had consumed alcohol were worse at suppressing their prejudice than participants with no alcohol consumption. Further, the more participants endorsed egalitarian values, the more they were able to suppress their prejudice. This tendency was resistant to the effects of alcohol. By contrast, the stronger participants held RWA beliefs, the less they were able to suppress their prejudice. In addition, this tendency was accentuated by alcohol consumption. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Antisemitism in the Dutch labour movement has not been studied sufficiently. This is certainly true with regard to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis and the early socialist movement of the nineteenth century. However, anti-Jewish propaganda needs to be taken into account in order to understand why the Jewish proletariat joined the socialist ranks at such a late stage, that is, only after the reformist wing split from Domela Nieuwenhuis's Social Democratic League (SDB) into the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP) in 1894. Stutje aims to address this lacuna, and demonstrates that Domela Nieuwenhuis had been using antisemitic stereotyping against the parliament-orientated reformists because the latter's main rival, P. J. Troelstra, was dependent on a modest group of Jewish diamond workers in Amsterdam. Once that conflict was over antisemitism faded into the background again.

AB  - When asked to pick a typical human, people are more likely to pick a man than a woman, a phenomenon reflecting androcentrism. Social media websites provide a relevant context in which to study androcentrism since many websites aim to provide users with an ostensibly gender-neutral icon if users do not upload one of their own images. In our first study, 50 male and female online participants (M-age = 35.70) rated whether actual avatar icons from highly trafficked social media websites are perceived as gender-neutral. Using bi-polar scales from woman to man participants reported that overall the icons appeared to be more male-typed than gender neutral. In Study 2, we investigated whether adding more female-typed icons would discourage or promote androcentric thinking. An online sample of 608 male and female participants (M-age = 33.76) viewed either 12 avatar icons that reflected the over-representation of male-typed icons or 12 that included an equal number of male and female-typed icons. Participants were then asked to produce an example of a typical person. Finally, we measured political ideology on two liberal-conservative scales. We found evidence that exposure to an equal number of male-typed and female-typed avatar icons generated reactance among political conservatives, and thus may have constituted an ideological threat. Conservatives who saw an equal number of male-typed and female-typed icons were twice as likely to come up with a man as a typical person compared to conservatives who saw an over-representation of male-typed avatar icons. Consistent with system justification theory, these findings show how male-centric thinking is also evident in a seemingly gender-neutral online context.

AB  - Previous research finds that lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice. We test two unresolved questions about this association using a heterogeneous set of target groups and data from a representative sample of the United States (N = 5,914). First, we test who are the targets of prejudice? We replicate prior negative associations between cognitive ability and prejudice for groups who are perceived as liberal, unconventional, and having lower levels of choice over group membership. We find the opposite (i.e., positive associations), however, for groups perceived as conservative, conventional, and having higher levels of choice over group membership. Second, we test who shows intergroup bias? and find that people with both relatively higher and lower levels of cognitive ability show approximately equal levels of intergroup bias but toward different sets of groups.

AB  - Social tolerance, i.e. the tolerance for the intrinsic diversity of large social groups, can be viewed as a synergic effect of the features of both individuals and socio-economic environment. This paper proposes a twofold contribution to the literature. First, it advances a conceptual framework in which tolerance at individual levels is explained by social polarization-in the form of income distribution-and the perceived quality of the social relationships and structures. Second, the regression analysis-involving micro-data from World Values Survey covering a time span between 2010 and 2014, for 48 countries-provides robust evidences for a non-linear impact of income distribution on social tolerance. This impact appears to be U-shaped and displays a pronounced degree of asymmetry. Also, labour market position, education, class self-identification, gender, age, marital status, levels of individuals' personal security and sharing of post-materialist values matter in explaining social tolerance. The same main determinants contribute to the formation of both social tolerance and social capital. The differences are related to the amplitude as well as to the degree of symmetry for the corresponding non-linear transmission channels.

AB  - It has long been suggested that even after baseball's color line was broken in 1947, Black players had to be better than White ones to be given an opportunity to play in the major leagues. The present article provides empirical support for that claim, using data from the point at which all major league teams were integrated and five subsequent major league seasons, sampled at equal time intervals through 1999. Average annual wins above replacement (Win Above Replacement or WAR, an overall measure of a player's value) were significantly higher for non-Latino Black players than White players promoted to the majors at least until the mid-1970s. As discussed, the bias suggested by these data could be due to a combination of explicit (conscious) and implicit prejudice.

AB  - The present study investigated whether and to what extent ideological attitudes relate to moral reasoning. Specifically, in three studies we tested if Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) are associated with a general tendency to make either utilitarian (outcome-based) or deontological (principle-based) decisions in classic trolley-type moral dilemmas. The first study uncovered that both high RWA and high SDO individuals made more utilitarian versus deontological judgments in trolley dilemmas. A second study, using a process dissociation approach, revealed that this increased relative proportion of utilitarian judgments among high RWA and SDO scorers was guided by a decreased preference for the deontological option, rather than an increased preference for the utilitarian option. Finally, a third study using the RWA3D scale showed that especially the 'Authoritarian Aggression' facet scale is related to the decreased preference for the de ontological option in high RWA individuals. Overall, these studies provide convergent evidence for substantial differences in moral reasoning tendencies based on ideological attitudes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Burnout among service providers working with vulnerable populations can lead to a deterioration in well-being, high turnover of workers and a decrease in levels of services. The current study proposes a new threat-benefit theory (TBT) as predicting experiences of burnout and personal accomplishment among social workers working with immigrants. Based on the theory of human values (Schwartz et al., 2012) and extending Integrative Threat Theory (Stephan & Stephan, 2000), TBT suggests that the local population perceives immigrants not only as threatening but also as beneficial for the receiving society and that this threat/benefit appraisal is related to personal values held by the individual. In a study carried out among 358 social workers in Israel, findings supported a conceptual model in which threat appraisal, toward immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and Ethiopia, predicted higher levels of burnout and benefit appraisal predicted greater feelings of personal accomplishment and lower levels of burnout. In addition, findings showed that (1) immigrant groups were appraised as both threats and benefits to the receiving society; (2) appraisal of threat was predicted by lower levels of values of universalism, benevolence, self-direction and higher levels of power, tradition and conformity; (3) appraisal of benefit was predicted by lower levels of values of self-direction and power (Ethiopian immigrants) and higher levels of conformity and tradition (FSU immigrants).

AB  - An experiment was conducted to test for the presence of prejudice towards obesity and whether weight controllability beliefs information reduces this prejudice and impacts on a person's own healthy eating self-efficacy. The experiment randomly allocated 346 participants (49 males) into one of three conditions: controllable contributors toward obesity condition (e.g., information about personal control about diet and exercise); uncontrollable contributors toward obesity condition (e.g., information about genes, factors in society); and a control condition with no information given. Prejudice was present in 81% of the sample. High prejudice was predicted by low self-efficacy for exercise and weight. Weight controllability beliefs information had no significant effect on prejudice levels or exercise or healthy eating self-efficacy levels. Future research directions are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines how perceived pervasiveness of prejudice differentially affects high and low status group members' support for a low status group member who confronts. In Experiment 1 (N=228), men and women read a text describing sexism as rare or as pervasive and subsequently indicated their support for a woman who confronted or did not confront a sexist remark. Experiment 2 (N=324) specified the underlying process using a self-affirmation manipulation. Results show that men were more supportive of confrontation when sexism was perceived to be rare than when it was pervasive. By contrast, women tended to prefer confrontation when sexism was pervasive relative to when it was rare. Personal self-affirmation decreased men's and increased women's support for confrontation when prejudice was rare, suggesting that men's and women's support for confrontation when prejudice is rare is driven by personal impression management considerations. Implications for understanding how members of low and high status groups respond to prejudice are discussed.

AB  - The present research investigated whether self-threat biases memory via retrieval-induced forgetting. Results show that people under self-threat whose goal is to restore their self-worth by making prejudicial judgments that deprecate others are more likely to exhibit an enhanced RIF effect for positive items and a reduced RIF for negative items ascribed to a stereotyped target (i.e., homosexual). Overall, the present findings are consistent with the view that motivation can affect the magnitude of RIF effects in person memory and that, in turn, they can serve as mechanisms for justifying desired conclusions.

AB  - Major terrorist events, such as the recent attacks in Ankara, Sinai, and Paris, can have profound effects on a nation's values, attitudes, and prejudices. Yet psychological evidence testing the impact of such events via data collected immediately before and after an attack is understandably rare. In the present research, we tested the independent and joint effects of threat (the July 7, 2005, London bombings) and political ideology on endorsement of moral foundations and prejudices among two nationally representative samples (combined N = 2,031) about 6 weeks before and 1 month after the London bombings. After the bombings, there was greater endorsement of the in-group foundation, lower endorsement of the fairness-reciprocity foundation, and stronger prejudices toward Muslims and immigrants. The differences in both the endorsement of the foundations and the prejudices were larger among people with a liberal orientation than among those with a conservative orientation. Furthermore, the changes in endorsement of moral foundations among liberals explained their increases in prejudice. The results highlight the value of psychological theory and research for understanding societal changes in attitudes and prejudices after major terrorist events.

AB  - Based on Pettigrew and Meertens' Blatant and Subtle Prejudice Scale (1995), a new scale for assessing the expression of prejudice is proposed in this article. The original scale has been changed in three ways: (a) items were rewritten to avoid double assertions, (b) three new items were considered to adequately measure the 'denial of positive emotions' component, and (c) biased wording of the 'cultural differences' domain items measuring perceived cultural differences rather than prejudices was removed. We used a representative sample of 500 participants living in Antofagasta, in Chile. Confirmatory factor and a hierarchical regression analyses support the proposed new scale. This instrument provides two measures: one general measure related to the intensity of prejudice expression and a second measure indicating the presence or absence of prejudice for each component type (Rejection, Intimacy, Values, Emotions, and Culture). The scale was confirmed for both genders; 45.2% of the participants scored a medium-high to extremely high expression of prejudice towards Bolivians immigrants.

AB  - Across the United States there has been a spate of legislative bills and initiatives that blatantly stigmatize and discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. This study was a cross-sectional, exploratory survey designed to measure the attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors of Tennessee social workers and future social workers toward the LGBT population and toward proposed discriminatory legislation. A 3-way factorial ANOVA investigated the effects of political affiliation, religious affiliation, and social contact on the dependent measures. Significant main effects were found. Self-reported political affiliation was found to be the most important factor predicting LGBT acceptance and LGBT respect among this sample.

AB  - In this article, I explore how attitudes towards difference in terms of ethnicity, religion, sexuality and gender travel between Polish migrants to the UK and their significant others in Poland. In doing so, I bring together and critically engage with two disparate literatureson social remittances and family and peer transmission of attitudes. I demonstrate that what occurs between Polish migrants and their non-migrant significant others is a complex process in which favourable and prejudiced attitudes are passed on, challenged, rejected or negotiated. While I stress that both migrants and non-migrants influence each other's perceptions of difference, I show that non-migrants are more likely to assume the correctness' of migrant's attitudes due to the construction of migrants as trusted experts. Acknowledging the multidimensionality and simultaneity of such mutual influences, in the article, I call for the use of the term circulation' to describe the mobility of ideas, values and attitudes between people and places.

AB  - This research examined the hypothesis that heterosexual men's motivation to differentiate themselves from gay men mediates the relationship between the antifemininity norm of masculinity and antigay prejudice. We assessed masculinity through three concepts: status, thoughness, and antifemininity. Participants then reported their perceived similarity with gay men and their antigay prejudice. The results showed that antifemininity was the best predictor of both perceived similarity and antigay prejudice: The more people endorsed the antifemininity norm, the more they perceived themselves as dissimilar from gay men and showed antigay prejudice. More important, perceived similarity mediated the effect of antifemininity on antigay prejudice. These findings provide direct evidence for the link between masculinity and the motivation to differentiate oneself from gay men, and they suggest that antigay prejudice accomplishes the identity function of maintaining unambiguous gender boundaries.

AB  - The ability to form shared task representations is considered a keystone of social cognition. It remains, however, contentious if, and to what extent, social categorization impacts on shared representations. In the present study, we address the possibility of the modulation of action co-representation by social categorization, such as group membership and social status, as indexed by the social Simon effect. Italian participants were requested to perform a social Simon task, along with either an Italian (high-status in-group) or an Albanian (low-status out-group) participant. Results show that Italian participants co-represented the action of their partner when paired with a high-status in-group participant. Conversely, this effect was absent when they performed the task with a low-status out-group participant. Furthermore, the Albanian participants co-represented the action of their partner when paired with an Italian participant. These results suggest that group membership modulates action co-representation through the varying of the groups' relative status. The impact of this issue is boundless given the increasing multicultural nature of our society. Indeed, if multiculturalism fails, modern society does likewise.

AB  - Critical realism has not been taken up readily within social work research and this may be due to the difficulty of the language and lack of practice examples of its applicability. This paper outlines the basic precepts of critical realism, the implications of these for methodology, and then offers a practical example of its application to social work research in the area of intellectual disability using some of the techniques of more familiar qualitative research methodologies. In response to the increased influence of poststructuralist ideas within social work along with the somewhat contradictory call for evidence-based practice, this paper suggests critical realism as a way of developing empirically based knowledge about the effects of interventions while at the same time accounting for the complexity involved in social work practice.

AB  - Imagining oneself in a stereotyped role may not only increase women's endorsement of stereotypes about women and science, but also stifle broader concerns about social change. In the experiment, 81 women imagined themselves on a stereotypical or a counter-stereotypical career path (vs. a control condition). Participants in the stereotypical imagery condition endorsed to a higher extent the stereotypes about women and science, and crucially, were more resistant to social change in general. Stereotype endorsement mediated the relationship between exposure to stereotypes and resistance to social change. Results imply that tackling occupational gender stereotypes is crucial not only because they exclude women from male-dominated careers, but also because of a potentially pervasive negative impact on broader egalitarian concerns.

AB  - In two comprehensive and fully incentivized studies, we investigate the development of ingroup favoritism as one of two aspects of parochial altruism in repeated social dilemmas. Specifically, we test whether ingroup favoritism is a fixed phenomenon that can be observed from the very beginning and remains stable over time, or whether it develops (increases vs. decreases) during repeated contact. lngroup favoritism is assessed through cooperation behavior in a repeated continuous prisoner's dilemma where participants sequentially interact with 10 members of the ingroup (own city and university) and subsequently with 10 members of the outgroup (other city and university), or vice versa. In none of the experiments do we observe initial differences in cooperation behavior for interaction partners from the ingroup, as compared to outgroup, and we only observe small differences in expectations regarding the interaction partners' cooperation behavior. After repeated interaction, however, including a change of groups, clear ingroup favoritism can be observed. Instead of being due to gradual and potentially biased updating of expectations, we found that these emerging differences were mainly driven by the change of interaction partners' group membership that occurred after round 10. This indicates that in social dilemma settings ingroup favoritism is to some degree dynamic in that it is enhanced and sometimes only observable if group membership is activated by thinking about both the interaction with the ingroup and the outgroup.

AB  - Previous research on political stereotypes has focused on the perceived moral values or political attitudes of conservatives and liberals. The current studies examined whether laypeople hold stereotypes about the psychological traits of Republicans and Democrats and whether those stereotypes represent exaggerations of actual political differences. Participants completed measures of epistemic (Study 1), existential (Study 2), and ideological (Study 2) motives. Participants also completed these measures based on how they thought the average Republican and average Democrat would respond. Consistent with previous research, Republicans scored higher on these measures of motivated social cognition than Democrats. Critically, political stereotypes about Democrats and Republicans mirrored, but exaggerated, the actual differences. Despite an overall tendency of participants to engage in stereotype exaggeration, Democrats engaged in greater stereotype exaggeration compared to Republicans, and partisans (individuals who strongly identified with either party) engaged in greater stereotype exaggeration compared to more moderate party members.

AB  - We employed a theoretical model of dehumanization to identify the factors influencing attitudes toward asylum seekers within an Australian context. Specifically, we hypothesized that Australians high in social dominance orientation (SDO) would be more likely than those low in SDO to dehumanize asylum seekers. Participants (N = 311) completed an online survey designed to assess SDO, their attitudes and emotions toward asylum seekers, and their tendency to engage in dehumanization. Results indicated that the model can be successfully applied to an Australian context and that dehumanization played a significant role in influencing our participants' attitudes toward asylum seekers. Findings are discussed in terms of future research as well as policy implications for Australian immigration issues.

AB  - Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) predicts support for unsustainable environmental exploitation, but the mechanism driving this effect remains unclear. Here we propose and test a novel Hierarchy Enforcement Hypothesis of Environmental Exploitation. Two experiments analysed using Bayesian moderated regression showed that SDO predicted support for a new mining operation expected to generate further profits to high-status groups in society, but not when profits were expected to equally benefit all members of the community. SDO predicts environmental exploitation to the extent that doing so helps sustain and widen the gap between dominant and disadvantaged groups through the disproportionate allocation of resources. This research identifies a dominance motive that may explain why some people support environmental exploitation more than others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Scholars have recently stressed two important avenues for the study of cultural diversity and social capital: the role of political integration regimes as well as alternative indicators to generalised trust. This article addresses both. Focusing on Germany, it provides the first study of the relationship between cultural diversity and social capital in a country implementing an assimilationist' model of integration. As a further innovation, the article contrasts social trust with an alternative, yet often neglected form of social capital, namely norms of reciprocity. Results based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and using multi-level analyses of 97 German regions suggest a negative relationship between cultural diversity and social trust in Germany. Assimilationist policies have not (yet) led to efficient integration of minority groups and a value convergence that could bridge cultural divides. Nevertheless, cultural diversity does not erode the commitment to norms of reciprocity, which may therefore be regarded as an alternative foundation of social cohesion in culturally diverse societies.

AB  - Results of the present survey (n = 888) suggest that having strong social ties (or bonding social capital) fosters generalized trust, in support of conflict theory. There was no link between bridging social capital, or one's more diverse ties, and trust. Facebook use was found to have an indirect but positive influence on trust through levels of bonding social capital. Civic engagement was also positively related to trust through the same measure of bonding social capital, allowing like-minded members of civic groups to connect, which spilled over to trust. Neither Facebook use nor civic engagement directly influenced generalized trust. This study suggests the viability of both physical (civic) and digital (Facebook) modes of reengaging trust in an ever-diversifying society. The "virtuous circle," in which social trust and civic engagement prop one another up in a reciprocal fashion, instead looks like a figure eight here. Each measure indirectly boosted the other by first growing bonding social capital. When considered alongside divergent findings from Canada, this appears to be an American response to the increasing size of racial minority groups. Hispanic citizens make up the same portion of the American population as do all minority groups in Canada combined. These findings then represent a White reaction to an increasing Hispanic presence in America. Bounded solidarity in the form of strong, homogenous ties is shown as the path to trust in this setting.

AB  - We contrast 3 theoretical viewpoints concerning the factors affecting social categorization by race: (a) the classical theory of social categorization highlighting the role of a priori accessibility and situational factors, (b) the classical theory augmented by a principle of competitive category use, and (c) competition between race (but not gender) and coalition with race (but not gender) encoded only as a proxy to coalition. Study 1 documents a confound that renders important portions of previous research difficult to interpret. In Studies 2 and 3, race categorization was stronger than categorization by more weakly accessible categories when situational support in terms of topic relevance was comparable across categories. A situational focus on race further increased race categorization. Race categorization was reduced in the presence of strongly cued cross-cutting coalitions. Race categorization also was depressed when situational factors promoted comparative processing of cross-cutting categories while cues to potential coalitional divisions were held constant (Study 4). Accessibility, topic relevance, and cuing cross-cutting coalitions had the same effects on gender categorization as found for race categorization (Study 5). Taken together, the results suggest that classical theories of social categorization have to be augmented by a principle of competitive category use that is not limited to a competition between race and coalition.

AB  - The question of whether and how ethnic diversity affects the social cohesion of communities has become an increasingly prominent and contested topic of academic and political debate. In this paper we focus on a single city: London. As possibly the most ethnically diverse conurbation on the planet, London serves as a particularly suitable test-bed for theories about the effects of ethnic heterogeneity on prosocial attitudes. We find neighbourhood ethnic diversity in London to be positively related to the perceived social cohesion of neighbourhood residents, once the level of economic deprivation is accounted for. Ethnic segregation within neighbourhoods, on the other hand, is associated with lower levels of perceived social cohesion. Both effects are strongly moderated by the age of individual residents: diversity has a positive effect on social cohesion for young people but this effect dissipates in older age groups; the reverse pattern is found for ethnic segregation.

AB  - Genetic essentialism suggests that beliefs in genetic causes of mental illness will inflate a desire for social distance from affected individuals, regardless of specific disorder. However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous.
   To assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders.
   Undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions.
   When provided with genetic attributions, participants' desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition.
   Consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders. These effects are partially accounted for by desired social distance from people with schizophrenia.

AB  - We hypothesized that perceivers high in sexual prejudice would fail to unitize romantically involved men into a single mental representation, instead of perceiving the men as separate individuals. Two studies provided support for our hypothesis. In Study 1, sexual prejudice predicted perceptions of compatibility, intimacy, emotional satisfaction, and temporal stability for couples described as same-sex male but not for couples described as opposite sex. In Study 2, participants completed a modified who-said-what task in which men of two different same-sex couples presented facts about their relationships. Those low, versus high, in sexual prejudice committed significantly more within-couple relative to between-couple errors in their ascriptions, indicating that prejudice negatively predicted categorization along the dimension of couple. These results have important implications for how those high in sexual prejudice form impressions of same-sex couples and, ultimately, for how prejudiced attitudes affect mental representations of romantic couples.

AB  - The purposes of this study were (a) to examine themes in heterosexuals' responses when responding to LGBT prejudice, and (b) to explore the potential influence of educational information about LGBT topics on these themes of responses. Heterosexual undergraduate students (N = 225) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: participants received information about LGBT topics, or they did not. Then participants were asked to speak out in a written format against LGBT prejudicial statements they read in a blog taken directly from the Internet. Using content analysis, 16 codes were generated from the literature on the confrontation of prejudice and from participants' responses. The 16 codes were then grouped conceptually into four themes with the following percent representations in participants' responses: values (38.9 %), knowledge promotion (36.2 %), attack (16.7 %), and personal participation (8.4 %). No differences between conditions emerged in the prevalence of these themes. Implications for ally interventions, multicultural education, and future research are discussed.

AB  - A growing body of research shows that perceived community disorder is not solely driven by crime, but is influenced by the community's social cohesion and ethnic composition. Drawing on two waves of survey data from 2509 and 2651 individuals in Wave 1 and Wave 2 respectively, living in 71 communities in Brisbane Australia, we examine changes in ethnic composition over two time periods and how these changes influence perceived neighbourhood disorder. We also test whether or not social cohesion mediates these associations. Our findings indicate that high proportions of Indigenous residents and high levels of reported crime averaged across time are associated with greater perceived disorder. Whereas increases in household income over time are associated with lower perceived disorder. We also find that social cohesion is strongly associated with perceived disorder over time, but does not mediate the relationship between the racial and ethnic composition of the community and disorder. Yet when a community's social cohesion is considered, the effect of increasing household income becomes non-significant.

AB  - The literature on the relationship between religiosity and prejudice has shown inconsistent findings. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between different types of religiosity and that its relationship with prejudice is mediated by different values. Results of two studies conducted in Italy show that identified religiosity and introjected religiosity predict different levels of prejudice toward Muslim immigrants. Moreover, the negative relationship between identified religiosity and prejudice was mediated by prosocial values, whereas valuing conformity mediated the positive relationship between introjected religiosity and prejudice. The results show that it is possible to better understand the relationship between religiosity and prejudice by disentangling the different ways of being religious.

AB  - This article examines the efforts of post-Soviet Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to promote social cohesion by addressing the ethnic and linguistic cleavages that are part of the legacy of Soviet rule. In examining the particular situation of each Baltic state and the response to international pressure for integration and social inclusion policy, Muiznieks, Rozenvalds and Birka note the roles of threat-perception, the historic context, the linguistic and citizenship policy, as well as socio-economic inequality, in facilitating Russian-speakers' sense of belonging to their respective Baltic state. While ostensibly aimed at fostering a sense of belonging to the national state, Baltic integration and social inclusion policy has often had a contradictory effect, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the emphasis on the majority language and culture as a prerequisite for access to citizenship and formal membership has enhanced the threat-perceptions of minorities, and led to their alienation or identification with the external homeland of Russia. In Lithuania, early inclusion of minorities into the polity has had a beneficial long-term impact in terms of their identification with their country of residence, demonstrated by the fact that Russian-speakers express a greater sense of belonging to Lithuania. A review of the available survey data on the Baltic states suggests that the same cannot be said for Estonia and Latvia, where minorities express a weak sense of belonging to the state. This suggests a challenging road ahead for Estonia and Latvia in achieving social cohesion, understood by minorities as a sense of membership in the community and feelings of mutual recognition. Furthermore, all three Baltic states, Latvia in particular, have yet to address growing socio-economic inequality, which threatens to cause long-term difficulties for social cohesion.

AB  - This article evaluates the validity of'theories of change' of anti-polarisation and anti-radicalisation interventions.Assumptions of four dominant social policies are confronted with the literature. In addition, epistemological issues are discussed. Notions of'what works and why', do not equate to straightforward application.Also, the potential of the four policy approaches depends in great measure on their conceptualisation of 'polarisation' or 'radicalisation'. A focus on interventions could be dismissed as naive, when no account is offered of wider sociopolitical factors fuelling radicalisation or ethnic tensions.The interaction between these two notions is a relevant topic for future research.

AB  - We studied the influence of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) on the relationship between a multicultural ideology and attitudes about ethnic diversity and immigrants. We hypothesized that a multicultural ideology poses a threat to authoritarian individuals, which leads to a decrease in positive diversity beliefs and an increase in prejudice toward immigrants. On the basis of representative survey-data from 23 European countries, we showed that the negative relationship between RWA and positive diversity beliefs was stronger the more a country engages in multiculturalism (Study 1). In addition, in two experiments we demonstrated that RWA moderated the relationship between a video promoting multiculturalism (Study 2) or a picture showing a multicultural group (Study 3) and attitudes toward immigrants and diversity. As expected, for high-RWAs, both stimuli led to an increase in prejudice. In Study 3, perceived threat mediated the relationship between a multicultural norm and prejudice for people high in RWA.

AB  - Whites' nonprejudiced behavior toward racial/ethnic minorities can be attributionally ambiguous for perceivers, who may wonder whether the behavior was motivated by a genuine internal commitment to egalitarianism or was externally motivated by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced to others. This article reports the development of a scale that measures perceptions of Whites' internal and external motives for avoiding prejudice (Perceived Internal Motivation Scale/Perceived External Motivation Scale [PIMS/PEMS]) and tests of its internal, test-retest, discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity among ethnic minority perceivers. Minorities perceived Whites as having internal and external motives for nonprejudiced behavior that were theoretically consistent with but distinct from established measures of minority-group members' concerns in interracial interactions. Tests of the predictive validity of PIMS/PEMS showed that when a White evaluator praised the mediocre essay of a minority target, minorities who were high PEMS and low PIMS were most likely to regard the feedback as inauthentic and derogate the quality of the essay.

AB  - This article builds on the insights of the contact hypothesis and political socialization literatures to go beyond recent findings that racial and ethnic diversity have overwhelmingly negative effects on social capital, particularly generalized trust. Using the Canadian General Social Survey (2003), our results show that despite a negative relationship among adults, younger Canadians with racial and ethnic diversity in their social networks show higher levels of generalized trust. The results seem to confirm that youth socialization experiences with rising diversity and the normalization of diversity in a multicultural environment contribute to beneficial (instead of detrimental) effects of diverse social networks.

AB  - A study with British participants (N=90) tested a potential mediator of the effect of essentialist beliefs about the national ingroup on prejudice against immigrants. Essentialist beliefs were defined as beliefs in genetic determinism, a basic assumption that group membership is written in the blood and that the groups' boundaries and characteristics are determined by genetic and/or biological factors. Essentialist beliefs were expected to play an important role in the formation of prejudice. They were predicted to be associated with a reduction in the perceived possibility of immigrants' adopting the mainstream culture. Further, it was expected that essentialist beliefs would be positively associated with perceptions of intergroup threat, which in turn would be associated with a stronger demand for immigrants adopting the mainstream culture. Taken together, essentialist beliefs were predicted to be associated with a greater discrepancy between the demand for and perceived feasibility of culture adoption. This discrepancy was hypothesized to mediate the effect of essentialist beliefs on prejudice against immigrants. Structural equation modeling analysis and mediation analysis supported the hypotheses, showing that essentialism attributed to the national ingroup results in people demanding something seemingly impossible from immigrants, and that this situation in which immigrants have little chance of fulfilling majority members' expectations results in prejudice against them. Thus, results show that perceptions of the ingroup are associated with attitudes to the outgroup, and they outline an explanatory mechanism for the positive correlation between essentialism and prejudice which has been found in previous research. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

AB  - Contact researchers have largely overlooked the potential for negative intergroup contact to increase prejudice. In Study 1, we tested the interaction between contact quantity and valence on prejudice toward Black Australians (n = 1,476), Muslim Australians (n = 173), and asylum seekers (n = 293). In all cases, the association between contact quantity and prejudice was moderated by its valence, with negative contact emerging as a stronger and more consistent predictor than positive contact. In Study 2, White Americans (n = 441) indicated how much positive and negative contact they had with Black Americans on separate measures. Although both quantity of positive and negative contact predicted racism and avoidance, negative contact was the stronger predictor. Furthermore, negative (but not positive) contact independently predicted suspicion about Barack Obama's birthplace. These results extend the contact hypothesis by issuing an important caveat: Negative contact may be more strongly associated with increased racism and discrimination than positive contact is with its reduction.

AB  - The idea of prejudice as a tendency that can be generalized from one target to another and the personality-prejudice relationship have been widely examined using explicit measures. However, less is known about this tendency and its relation to personality for implicit prejudice measures, like the implicit association test (IAT). Three studies including explicit and corresponding implicit prejudice measures toward various target groups confirmed a generalized factor for both types of measures with a stronger common component for the explicit factor. Personality was significantly related to the explicit measures only. Also, the personality and prejudice measures were unrelated to explicit and implicit attitudes toward an irrelevant target which rules out potential method confound. These results indicate that explicit and implicit prejudice measures tap different psychological constructs relating differently to the individual's self-reported personality. The findings have implications for the debate on whether IAT scores reflect personally endorsed attitudes.

AB  - Head nodding and shaking are bodily signals of approval and disapproval, respectively. Previous research has shown that these movements can be used to shape attitudes by means of evaluative conditioning. In the present experiment, the authors studied the conditions under which evaluative conditioning with head movements can alter social attitudes. Specifically, the authors investigated whether the evaluative conditioning effect depends on the order in which the target stimulus and the head movement are presented. The results showed that repeated coupling of head nodding with out-group names reduced negative implicit associations with this out-group only when the head nodding movement followed the target name. No effects were found when the movement preceded the name in the conditioning procedure. The authors conclude that embodied evaluative conditioning effects are constrained to a sequence of the target stimulus and head movement that corresponds to the natural temporal script in which the stimulus precedes the evaluative embodied reaction.

In two heterogeneous adult samples (Study 1: N?=?179 and Study 2: N?=?222), it was revealed that gender itself was only a minor predictor of sexist attitudes compared with the substantial impact of individual differences in general motivated cognition (i.e., need for closure). Analyses further showed that the relationship between need for closure and sexism was mediated by social attitudes (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), which were differently related to benevolent and hostile forms of sexism. In the discussion, it is argued that sexism primarily stems from individual differences in motivated cognitive style, which relates to peoples' perspective on the social world, rather than from group differences between men and women.

AB  - Not all biases are equivalent, and not all biases are uniformly negative. Two fundamental dimensions differentiate stereotyped groups in cultures across the globe: status predicts perceived competence, and cooperation predicts perceived warmth. Crossing the competence and warmth dimensions, two combinations produce ambivalent prejudices: pitied groups (often traditional women or older people) appear warm but incompetent, and envied groups (often nontraditional women or outsider entrepreneurs) appear competent but cold. Case studies in ambivalent sexism, heterosexism, racism, anti-immigrant biases, ageism, and classism illustrate both the dynamics and the management of these complex but knowable prejudices.

AB  - Purpose - In a multicultural context, this study aims to investigate the effect of ingroup versus outgroup categorization and stereotypes on residents' emotional and behavioral reactions in neighbor-to-neighbor conflicts. Based on the literature on the "black sheep effect", the authors predicted that residents would actually be more irritated by ingroup than outgroup antagonists. Secondly, they predicted that reactions to deviant behavior by an outgroup antagonist would be shaped by the valence of stereotypes about the respective groups.
   Design/methodology/approach - Residents with either a native-Dutch or a Turkish background (n = 529) completed a questionnaire on outgroup stereotypes, and responded to a conflict situation in which the ethnicity of an antagonist was manipulated between subjects.
   Findings - Supporting the black sheep effect, results reveal that both native-Dutch and Turkish residents reported more negative emotions towards an ingroup than an outgroup antagonist. In addition, when confronting an outgroup antagonist, stereotype negativity was related to more negative emotions and intentions for destructive conflict behavior.
   Social implications - The current study demonstrates that residents may actually get irritated more easily by ingroup than outgroup antagonists. Reactions to outgroup antagonists are further moderated by stereotype valence; negative outgroup stereotypes may lead to less tolerance towards outgroup antagonists and higher chances for conflict escalation.
   Originality/value - This is the first paper in which evidence for the black sheep effect is obtained in a field study and simultaneously for majority and minority members. In addition, evidence is presented that emotions may mediate the influence of the antagonist's group membership on conflict behavior.

AB  - By nature, stereotypes require processes of categorization or semantic association, including social information about groups of people. There is empirical evidence that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) processes domain-general semantic information, and supports social knowledge. A recent study showed that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the ATL reduced racial stereotypes on an implicit association test (IAT). However, it was not determined whether this was caused by changes to specific social, or general semantic processing, or both. The current study addresses these theoretical issues. The design investigated the effect of rTMS to the left or right ATL, or a sham stimulation, on a social IAT (gender stereotypes), a non-social IAT (living versus non-living associations), and a non-semantic control (Stroop) task. The results showed that low-frequency rTMS to both left and right ATL significantly reduced D-scores on the gender IAT compared to the sham group; however, there were no differences on the non-social IAT or the Stroop. The findings show the ATL has a role in mediating stereotypes, and the decrease of bias after stimulation could be due to weakening of social stereotypical associations either within the ATL or via a network of brain regions connected with the ATL.

AB  - In the long history of psychological research on prejudice, Allport's (1954) book The Nature of Prejudice is undoubtedly the foundational work, advancing ideas that remain highly influential and relevant to this day. Guided by the seminal ideas of this leading scholar, we illustrate how contemporary psychological research has accumulated evidence for a basic, motivated cognitive style underlying prejudice in its different forms. Specifically, we demonstrate that Allport's classic conception of this basic cognitive style is exceptionally well captured by the contemporary construct of need for cognitive closure (NFC), and we review the recent evidence for NFC effects on racism and sexism. Integrating Allport's writings with contemporary research, we also show that the effects of motivated cognition on prejudice are explained (i.e., mediated) by essentialist thinking and authoritarian ideology. Finally, we discuss recent evidence indicating that, in contrast to Allport's pessimistic predictions, intergroup contact is especially effective in reducing prejudice among people high in NFC. It is concluded that recent research on NFC provides a solid empirical basis for Allport's hypothesis that a general motivated cognitive style lies at the basis of prejudice.

AB  - This cross-sectional study tested the idea that personality is indirectly related to outgroup prejudice through religiosity and through outgroup contact. A total of 2,756 White adolescents from Northern England completed a questionnaire that included measures of outgroup prejudice, extraversion, tough-mindedness, religiosity and outgroup contact. Correlation and path analysis indicated that extraversion had no direct effect on outgroup prejudice, but was associated with greater outgroup contact, which in turn was associated with lower prejudice. Psychoticism was associated directly with higher levels of prejudice, and indirectly via religiosity because high psychoticism was associated with low religiosity, and low religiosity was associated with high prejudice. There was no direct relationship between age and prejudice but a decline in religiosity between early and midadolescence was associated with an increase in prejudice. Implications of the findings for the study of prejudice in adolescents and adults are discussed.

AB  - Fifty years ago, Serge Moscovici first outlined a theory of social representations. In this article, we attempt to discuss and to contextualize research that has been inspired by this original impetus from the particular angle of its relevance to political psychology. We argue that four defining components of social representations need to be taken into account, and that these elements need to be articulated with insights from the social identity tradition about the centrality of self and group constructions in order to develop original insights into political psychological phenomena. First, social representations are shared knowledge, and the way interpretations of the world are collectively elaborated is critical to the way people are able to act within the world. Second, social representations are meta-knowledge, which implies that what people assume relevant others know, think, or value is part of their own interpretative grid, and that collective behavior can often be influenced more powerfully at the level of meta-representations than of intimate beliefs. Third, social representations are enacted communication, which means that social influence is exerted by the factors that constrain social practices as much as by the discourse that interprets these practices. Fourth, social representations are world-making assumptions: collective understandings do not only reflect existing realities but often bring social reality into being. Put together, these four components provide a distinctive theoretical perspective on power, resistance and conflict. The added conceptual value of this perspective is illustrated by showing how it allows revisiting ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. We conclude with implications for research practices and discuss how the proposed model of social representations invites us to define new priorities and challenges for the methods used to study political psychological phenomena.

AB  - Inferences about emotions in children are limited by studies that rely on only one research method. Convergence across methods provides a stronger basis for inference by identifying method variance. This multimethod study of 116 children (mean age = 8.21 years) examined emotional displays during social exchange. Each child received a desirable gift and later an undesirable gift after performing tasks, with or without mother present. Children's reactions were observed and coded. Children displayed more positive affect with mother present than with mother absent. Independent ratings of children by adults revealed that children lower in the personality dimension of Agreeableness displayed more negative emotion than their peers following the receipt of an undesirable gift. A curvilinear interaction between Agreeableness and mother condition predicted negative affect displays. Emotional assessment is discussed in terms of links to social exchange and the development of expressive behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined whether increasing individuals' perceived variability of an out-group reduces prejudice and discrimination toward its members. In a series of 4 laboratory and field experiments, we attracted participants' attention to either the homogeneity or the heterogeneity of members of an out-group, and then measured their attitudes or behaviors. Perceived variability was manipulated by making subgroups salient, by portraying the out-group members as having diverse opinions, by making salient that out-group members have different characteristics, or by asking participants to think about differences among out-group members. Prejudice and discrimination were measured in terms of self-reported attitudes, distribution of rewards, helping an out-group confederate, and evaluation of an out-group candidate in a simulated hiring decision. In all experiments, perceived variability decreased prejudice and discrimination. This effect may be due to the fact that perceived variability decreases the role of group membership in the production of attitudes and behaviors toward other individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although prejudice is typically positively related to relative outgroup size, four studies found converging evidence that perceived atheist prevalence reduces anti-atheist prejudice. Study 1 demonstrated that anti-atheist prejudice among religious believers is reduced in countries in which atheists are especially prevalent. Study 2 demonstrated that perceived atheist prevalence is negatively associated with anti-atheist prejudice. Study 3 demonstrated a causal relationship: Reminders of atheist prevalence reduced explicit distrust of atheists. These results appeared distinct from intergroup contact effects. Study 4 demonstrated that prevalence information decreased implicit atheist distrust. The latter two experiments provide the first evidence that mere prevalence information can reduce prejudice against any outgroup. These findings offer insights about anti-atheist prejudice, a poorly understood phenomenon. Furthermore, they suggest both novel directions for future prejudice research and potential interventions that could reduce a variety of prejudices.

AB  - Past research suggests that members of devalued groups recognize their groups are discriminated against. Do the implicit responses of members of these groups demonstrate the same pattern? We argue that they do not and that this is due to a motivated protection of members of devalued groups' social identity. Study 1 demonstrates that, at an explicit level African-Canadians recognize that their group is discriminated against, but at an implicit level African-Canadians think that most people like their group to a greater extent than do European-Canadians. Study 2 replicates this implicit finding with Muslim participants while demonstrating that, when affirmed, this group difference disappears. Study 3 demonstrates that implicit normative regard can predict collective action over and above implicit attitudes and explicit normative regard. The implications for changing the status quo are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on intergroup contact has recently begun to examine how individual differences moderate the reduction of prejudice. We extend this work by examining the moderating role of diversity beliefs, i.e., the strength of individuals' beliefs that society benefits from ethnic diversity. Results of a survey among 255 university students in the United States show that the relationship between contact and reduced prejudice is stronger for individuals holding less favorable diversity beliefs compared to those with more positive diversity beliefs. Likewise, the relationship between contact and perceived importance of contact is stronger for people with less favorable diversity beliefs. Together with previously reported moderator effects, these results suggest that contact especially benefits people who are the most predisposed to being prejudiced.

AB  - In an investigation of students' prejudicial biases against instructors who smoke, 61 female and 16 male undergraduates watched and listened to a 20-min lecture about parasomnias, completed a survey asking for instructor evaluation ratings and ratings of perceived learning, and completed a lecture-retention test with multiple-choice questions to assess actual learning. In a between-subjects design, the lecture was given by either a man or woman, who was portrayed as a smoker or nonsmoker. The instructors' sex and smoking status did not affect the students' perceived or actual learning (all p's > .05). However, a significant interaction on the instructor evaluation ratings revealed that students rated the female instructors equivalently (p = .78), but rated the smoker male instructor significantly lower than the nonsmoker male instructor (p = .01). These findings suggest that students hold prejudicial biases against male instructors who smoke, but that these biases do not affect student learning.

AB  - The present research used validated cardiovascular measures to examine threat reactions among members of stigmatized groups when interacting with members of nonstigmatized groups who were, or were not, prejudiced against their group. The authors hypothesized that people's beliefs about the fairness of the status system would moderate their experience of threat during intergroup interactions. The authors predicted that for members of stigmatized groups who believe the status system is fair, interacting with a prejudiced partner, compared with interacting with an unprejudiced partner, would disconfirm their worldview and result in greater threat. In contrast, the authors predicted that for members of stigmatized groups who believe the system is unfair, interacting with a prejudiced partner, compared with interacting with an unprejudiced partner, would confirm their worldview and result in less threat. The authors examined these predictions among Latinas interacting with a White female confederate (Study 1) and White females interacting with a White male confederate (Study 2). As predicted, people's beliefs about the fairness of the status system moderated their experiences of threat during intergroup interactions, indicated both by cardiovascular responses and nonverbal behavior. The specific pattern of the moderation differed across the 2 studies.

AB  - The present research examines the effectiveness of intergroup contact between 167 Italian hospital workers and foreign patients in reducing prejudice towards immigrants in general. The outcomes of contact at work were analysed controlling for the influence of contact outside the workplace and through mass media, and taking into account the role of empathy, anxiety and group membership salience. Results indicate that the beneficial effects of contact at work were partially mediated by increased empathy and reduced anxiety, experienced both in the work environment and towards immigrants in general. Finally, high levels of group membership salience facilitated the influence of contact on intergroup emotions. These findings show that contact at work can be a powerful means to reduce prejudice, thanks to its capacity to evoke changes in affective responses. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Prediction error, the difference between an expected and an actual outcome, serves as a learning signal that interacts with reward and punishment value to direct future behavior during reinforcement learning. We hypothesized that similar learning and valuation signals may underlie social expectancy violations. Here, we explore the neural correlates of social expectancy violation signals along the universal person-perception dimensions trait warmth and competence. In this context, social learning may result from expectancy violations that occur when a target is inconsistent with an a priori schema. Expectancy violation may activate neural regions normally implicated in prediction error and valuation during appetitive and aversive conditioning. Using fMRI, we first gave perceivers high warmth or competence behavioral information that led to dispositional or situational attributions for the behavior. Participants then saw pictures of people responsible for the behavior; they represented social groups either inconsistent (rated low on either warmth or competence) or consistent (rated high on either warmth or competence) with the behavior information. Warmth and competence expectancy violations activate striatal regions that represent evaluative and prediction error signals. Social cognition regions underlie consistent expectations. These findings suggest that regions underlying reinforcement learning may work in concert with social cognition regions in warmth and competence social expectancy. This study illustrates the neural overlap between neuroeconomics and social neuroscience.

AB  - Globally, education of children with disabilities increasingly occurs in inclusive school settings, requiring specialised teacher education. Scholars emphasise relational and instrumental skills, to overcome prejudice and exclusion. Visual impairment (VI) is emotionally evocative, presenting particular challenges to inclusion. Using data from in-service teacher education for VI inclusion in South Africa, this theoretical paper explores the personal and emotional barriers which teachers must negotiate surrounding the 'new reality' of VI in their classrooms if successful inclusion is to be achieved, and how teacher education may support this. We set qualitative data from an in-service short course for teachers of VI learners against ideas from disability studies, critical psychoanalysis and anthropology, conceptualising relational issues arising from VI in the classroom. Due to VI's evocation of unconscious anxieties in the observer, we argue that the experiences and needs of children with VI may be felt as 'matter out of place' in the classroom, confounding inclusion. Teacher anxiety threatens the capacity for containment and creativity, undermining the secure relationship which is elemental to successful learning. To manage the experiences, feelings and needs of VI learners, teachers require education which facilitates processing of their own emotions surrounding this evocative form of disability.

AB  - One critical role counseling psychologists can play in dismantling anti-Blackness and eradicating systemic racism is to build on the field's strength in understanding individual-level processes (i.e., systems are created and maintained by individual actors). Drawing on antiracism scholarship, we aimed to better understand how colorblind racial ideology (CBRI), or the denial and minimization of race and racism, may serve as a barrier to engaging in antiracist praxis. Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine if color evasion (ignoring race) and power evasion (denying structural racism) CBRI were differentially associated with anti-Blackness and processes linked to antiracism. Findings based on 375 effects drawn from 83 studies with more than 25,000 individuals suggest different effects based on CBRI type. As hypothesized, we found that power evasion CBRI was related to increased endorsement of anti-Black prejudice (r = .33) and legitimizing ideologies (r = .24), and negatively associated with a range of other variables associated with antiracism, including social justice behaviors (r = -.31), multicultural practice competencies (r = -.16), diversity openness (r = -.28), and racial/ethnocultural empathy (r = -.35). Consistent with theory, color evasion CBRI was related to increased diversity openness (r = .12). We discuss limitations of our study, as well as outline future directions for research and practice to focus on the role of CBRI in sustaining and perpetuating anti-Blackness and systemic racism. Thus, this meta-analysis has implications for pushing the field of counseling psychology to build the bridge between individual ideologies and creating structural change.
   Public Significance Statement In this article, we synthesized results from 83 studies that examined colorblind racial ideology (i.e., denying and minimizing the importance of race and racism). We found that endorsing colorblind racial ideology, particularly power evasion (denying racism) rather than color evasion (ignoring race), was associated with higher anti-Black prejudice, lower racial/ethnocultural empathy, and lower multicultural competencies.

AB  - Purpose: Biased perceptions of individuals who are not part of one's in-groups tend to be negative and habitual. Because health care professionals are no less susceptible to biases than are others, the adverse impact of biases on marginalized populations in health care warrants continued attention and amelioration.Method: Two characters, a Syrian refugee with limited English proficiency and a black pregnant woman with a history of opioid use disorder, were developed for an online training simulation that includes an interactive life course experience focused on social determinants of health, and a clinical encounter in a community health center utilizing virtual reality immersion. Pre- and post-survey data were obtained from 158 health professionals who completed the simulation.Results: Post-simulation data indicated increased feelings of compassion toward the patient and decreased expectations about how difficult future encounters with the patient would be. With respect to attribution, after the simulation participants were less inclined to view the patient as primarily responsible for their situation, suggesting less impact of the fundamental attribution error.Conclusion: This training simulation aimed to utilize components of evidence-based prejudice habit breaking interventions, such as learning more about an individual's life experience to help minimize filling in gaps with stereotyped assumptions. Although training simulations cannot fully replicate or replace the advantages that come with real-world experience, they can heighten awareness in the increase of increasing the cultural sensitivity of clinicians in health care professions for improving health equity.

AB  - Are anti-prejudice norms against immigrants shared worldwide? Although previous studies found that prejudice against immigrants is considered socially undesirable, these studies were conducted exclusively in Western societies and we have little knowledge of the awareness of antiprejudice norms against immigrants outside of these societies. We use the case of Japan, where people tend to believe that the society is ethnically homogeneous, expecting that this contextspecific notion mitigates the awareness of anti-prejudice norms. We conducted two list experiments using online surveys and compared the answers to those of list experiments and direct questions about attitudes towards immigrants to reveal Japanese citizens' perceptions of norms. The results show that Japanese citizens attempt to show more negative attitudes upon direct questions than in list experiments, indicating that it is normative to express prejudice against immigrants rather than suppressing it. These results suggest anti-prejudice norms against immigrants are context-dependent and not universally shared.

AB  - The present study aims to shed light on the mechanisms of ethnic discrimination in teacher assessments in Hungarian primary schools. For this purpose, we use data collected among Roma minority and non-Roma majority students. First, we identify a considerable ethnic difference in non-blind school grades, which is beyond the ethnic difference in blind standardized test scores. Then, we derive and empirically test predictions from different theories of discrimination that might explain the ethnic difference in grades. We find that stereotype-based theories of discrimination do not explain why minority students receive lower grades than majority students. We do not exclude the possibility that taste-based discrimination exists among teachers against Roma students. A considerable part of ethnic discrimination, however, is explained by teachers' indirectly discriminatory grading practices: Roma students' school behaviour is evaluated more negatively by teachers than that of non-Roma students and school behaviour seems to be taken into account in grading without legitimate justification. This practice does not only disadvantage Roma students, but boys and low status students as well.

AB  - In three studies (N-1 = 160, N-2 = 100, N-3 = 135), the effects of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) on the social judgment of working women (i.e., perceived warmth and competence) were examined. In each study, type of job (traditional vs. nontraditional job background) as well as the job-related success (Studies 1a and 1b) or political success (Study 2) of women was manipulated. Across studies, we found that RWA and SDO affected liking for a target who violated shared expectations (woman with a nontraditional job background without job-related/political success) in contrasting ways-with RMA predicting increased liking and SDO predicting decreased liking. Perceptions of stereotypic targets (e.g., the woman with a traditional job background without success, the woman with a nontraditional job background with success) were not consistently related to ideological attitudes. Theoretic implications as well as consequences for working women are discussed.

AB  - Overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors, including diet, have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However, as shown by numerous studies, and in clinical practice, it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of 'one-size-fits-all' nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation, the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life, nutrition, ICT, design, behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology. P&P focuses on the development and integration of innovative technological techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, conversational agents, behavior change theory and personalized coaching to improve current practices and establish lasting dietary behavior change.

AB  - Atheists are among the most disliked groups in America, which has been explained in a variety of ways, one of which is that atheists are hostile towards religion and that anti-atheist prejudice is therefore reactive. We tested this hypothesis by using the 2018 American General Social Survey by investigating attitudes towards atheists, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and Muslims. We initially used a general sample of Americans, but then identified and isolated individuals who were atheists, theists, nonreligious atheists, religious theists, and/or theistic Christians. Logically, if atheists were inordinately hostile towards religion, we would expect to see a greater degree of in-group favouritism in the atheist group and a greater degree of out-group dislike. Results indicated several notable findings: 1). Atheists were significantly more disliked than any other religious group. 2). Atheists rated Christians, Buddhists, Jews, and Hindus as favourably as they rated their own atheist in-group, but rated Muslims less positively (although this effect was small). 3). Christian theists showed pronounced in-group favouritism and a strong dislike towards atheists. No evidence could be found to support the contention that atheists are hostile towards religious groups in general, and towards Christians specifically, although this may have been a Type II error. If atheist groups do dislike religious groups, then this hypothetical dislike would be significantly smaller in magnitude than the dislike directed toward atheists by Christians.

AB  - Hate crimes against members of the Jewish community have increased dramatically over the past few years. According to federal data, the number of hate crimes directed at Jews now appears to exceed those directed at many, if not most, minority groups. Yet, despite the number of hate crimes aimed at Jews, little recent scholarship has considered the issue of anti-Semitism. To address this gap in the profession's literature, this article examines the issue of anti-Semitism in the United States. Toward that end, the Jewish population is described and data on anti-Semitism are reviewed along with factors that contribute to this prejudice. The article concludes by discussing strategies that social work educators, practitioners, and researchers might pursue to help create a more socially just society for the Jewish community in the United States and elsewhere. For instance, social workers might seek to address spiritual microaggressions aimed at members of the Jewish community. As part of this process, social workers might help create a culture that respects religious freedom, a fundamental human right, and advocate for equitable portrayals of Jewish people and perspectives in diverse media. Particular attention should be paid to Orthodox Jews, who are often targets of anti-Semitism.

AB  - Discrimination and prejudice against overweight people is common in Western societies. In this article we aim to understand whether these attitudes reverberate into the school setting, by investigating whether teachers grade overweight students more severely than comparable normal weight students. By relying on the Attribution-Value Model of Prejudice (AVMP) and previous studies, we test a series of hypotheses using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS SC3) on a sample of students enrolled in the 7(th) grade (lower secondary education). We used hierarchical ordered logit regression to assess whether overweight and obese students receive systematically lower grades by their teachers in German and mathematics, adjusting for subject-specific competences measured with a standardized test, and a rich set of socio-demographic and socio-psychological students' characteristics (e.g. the "big five"). Results suggested that overweight and obese students were more severely graded in both subjects. The penalty for overweight students, and especially for obese students, was slightly larger in German and in the lowest part of the grade distribution. There was also indication of heterogeneous penalties by gender, with overweight male students being especially penalized in math. Possible ways to help teachers in assigning grades in a fairer way are discussed at the end.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to explore the factors impacting information poverty in western China and investigate to what extent these determinants contribute to information poverty in these areas.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to analyze 232 valid responses collected from a survey to examine the research model and hypotheses in this study.
   Findings
   The results indicate that information literacy, information supply and information and communication technologies (ICTs) positively and significantly affect information poverty, while social prejudice and information orientation had no significant effects on information poverty.
   Practical implications
   Public libraries, government departments and other institutions should pay attention to the significant impact of information literacy, information supply and ICTs on information poverty and formulate corresponding systems and policies to alleviate or reduce information poverty.
   Originality/values
   In the past, few studies have focused on information poverty in western China and most of the existing research on information poverty adopts qualitative research methods, such as interview, systematic literature review and so on, while quantitative research is rare. In addition, the focus of these research studies was on one or two aspects, and a few of them can systematically study the influencing factors of information poverty. Inspired by the theories of information literacy, social prejudice and information poverty, this study comprehensively used a questionnaire survey and SEM to investigate the influences of information literacy, social prejudice, information supply, information orientation and ICTs on information poverty.

KW  - PARTICIPATION
KW  - REFLECTION
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore athletes' perceptions of how coaches shaped their experiences in disability sport throughout development. Athletes with physical disabilities (N = 21) participated in life history interviews. Participants outlined their sport history and responded to questions targeting the roles that coaches played in their development, which laid the foundation for broader conversations about how coaches shaped the disability sport experience. Using thematic analysis, patterns in coach knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors were captured in 4 themes. Three themes were discussed in relation to positive experiences in disability sport (consideration, collaboration, professionalism), and 1 theme was related to negative disability sport experiences (prejudice). The findings of this work are analyzed through the lens of the social-relational model of disability, thus challenging the dominant discourse that underpins understandings of (dis)ability in the sport context. Practical recommendations for disability sport coaches include reflective practice and introspective examination of implicit biases and assumptions, as well as a focus on interpersonal skills that assist coaches in collaborating with athletes-thus encouraging the integration of sport- and disability-specific knowledge.
   Lay Summary Athletes with physical disabilities were interviewed about how coaches shaped their experiences in sport over time. Differences in how coaches created positive experiences were identified at each stage of development, reflecting varied combinations of knowledge and behaviors. Negative experiences stemmed from perceptions of unfair treatment and inequality.

AB  - The psychological concept of "microaggression" has refocused interest on what counts as prejudicial action. It redirects attention from standard socio-cognitive explanations of overt prejudice among social groups toward recipients' perspectives of largely unwitting and subtle everyday racism. Microaggression studies define common implicit identity challenges faced by minority groups, including kinship carers. However, criticisms of the "microaggressions program" raise difficulties inherent in establishing prejudicial action from accounts of necessarily ambiguous actions, and contend that reliance on self-reporting inevitably lacks validity. This conversation analytic (CA) study offers a complementary approach: from videos of ten kinship carer support groups it shows how participants construct accountabilities for prejudicial actions in their retrospective reports of questions, challenges and suspicions in ways that build these actions as microaggressive. It addresses methodological shortcomings in microaggression studies, and extends CA research on accountability in offense construction, and on prejudicial social actions that are contested and difficult to analyze.

AB  - Modern psychological theories postulate that individual differences in prejudice are determined by social and ideological attitudes instead of personality. For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture theauthoritarian-conservatism motivationand thedominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N-1= 3,132;N-2= 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world.

AB  - Background: Research examining attitudes toward autistic adults has relied on explicit self-report measures, which may be susceptible to socially desirable responding. Because implicit attitudes predict behavioral rejection, understanding both implicit and explicit attitudes toward autistic adults is important. Furthermore, previous research has almost exclusively examined attitudes toward autistic children and has not investigated attitudes toward autistic adults who may also experience prejudice from their peers.
   Methods: We created an implicit association test (IAT) to examine implicit attitudes toward autistic adults. In Study 1, we examined 94 neurotypical adults' (mean [M](age) = 31.37 years) implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes toward autistic adults as well as autistic behaviors. In Study 2 (n = 137; M-age = 33.43 years), we assessed the same variables using an IAT with descriptive rather than stereotypical words.
   Results: Participants from both studies demonstrated negative implicit attitudes but positive explicit attitudes toward autistic adults. In Study 2, analyses examining self-reported traits related to autism revealed that more autistic behaviors were associated with less implicit bias.
   Conclusions: These findings may help explain why autistic adults report discrimination from their peers. The results suggest that there may be benefits in modifying interventions that reduce implicit bias toward other marginalized groups for use with implicit bias against autistic adults.

AB  - Background: Developmental enamel defects (DDE) exert significant effects both on esthetics and occlusal function and prevention should be the general clinical approach to DDE. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was, therefore, to detect, within a pediatric sample, any significant association between DDE and children's psychosocial attitudes towards home oral hygiene, as well as potential associations between primary preventive procedures and DDE. Methods: 394 schoolchildren (197 males and 197 females, 8.9 +/- 1.4 years) underwent an intra-oral examination; they were then interviewed with a brief questionnaire. Results: 5-6% and 12-14% of participants had, respectively at least one molar and one incisor affected by DDE. In general, no associations were observed in the examined clinical categories (caries and other oral health indices). A strong relationship was found between the presence of molar DDE and children's positive vs. negative psychosocial attitudes towards home oral hygiene. Conclusions: The probability of finding DDE in our sample of examined children was approximately more than doubled for children with negative psychosocial attitudes towards home oral hygiene, than for children with positive attitudes towards home oral hygiene.

AB  - Pathogen threat can translate into a willingness to distance oneself from others on a psychological level. Building on this notion, we predicted that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic can affect attitudes toward foreign nationalities. We explored the intergroup consequences of the current epidemiological situation in two studies involving a total of 652 participants. In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the United Kingdom (UK) and in Poland, and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about coronavirus through the increase in anxiety, but this effect was not observed when a generalized measure of prejudice was considered. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice and anxiety are sensitive to the current epidemiological situation, and our findings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most affected by the pandemic.

AB  - A study in the U.S.-Mexican intergroup context examined how collective relative gratification (RG) versus deprivation affects the relationship between intergroup contact and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice towards an out-group. Participants were Mexican university students in Mexico (N = 239) and non-Mexican students in California (N = 90). As predicted, Mexicans experienced less gratification/higher relative deprivation (RD), and low quality intergroup contact and expressed lower interpersonal closeness and higher subtle prejudice than U.S. Americans. Differences between countries were larger amongst participants reporting higher RD. Second-stage moderated mediation analysis showed that the mediating effects of contact between country and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice, respectively, were larger amongst participants who felt relatively gratified than those who felt relatively deprived. These findings underline the importance of recognizing the moderating effect of differences in the RG versus RD levels of minority and majority groups when anticipating the potential benefits of intergroup contact for prejudice reduction.

AB  - Ideological attitudes supporting group-based dominance (i.e., social dominance orientation, SDO) and in-group authority (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism, RWA) are well-established dual antecedents of prejudice. We extend classic perspectives of prejudice as an attitudinal outcome by testing this dual-antecedent model with prejudice operationalized as inclusive behavioral intentions in a nationally-representative Australian community sample (N = 2,632). An exploratory structural equation model simultaneously derived three domains of behavioral intentions in the data: small, interpersonal gestures (e.g., saying hello to people from other groups), volunteering to help the disadvantaged (e.g., mentoring people from disadvantaged groups), and political action (e.g., organizing a demonstration). There was evidence for a dual-motivational basis of inclusive behavior intentions, with SDO negatively predicting all three categories of behaviors, particularly interpersonal gestures, while RWA showed a small negative relation only with political action. The findings suggest that motivations for group-based dominance are the primary barrier against behavioral intentions toward social inclusion, which can inform the design of public interventions for reducing prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - We present a youth development intervention program and its evaluation. Deriving from the theories of agentic self and positive youth development, we adopted a holistic perspective that focused on social agency with growth mindset and self-efficacy conceptualized as its motivators. The intervention consisted of 14 weekly sessions with 508 sixth graders in four public schools in Turkey (M-age = 11.8, 49% female). A comparable group with 417 sixth graders in five public schools served as the control group (M-age = 11.7, 47% female). All students came from families of low to middle socioeconomic status. The evaluation had an experimental design with pretest, posttest (4 months after pretest), and follow-up (11 months after posttest) assessments. Findings indicated beneficial effects of the intervention on mindset, self-efficacy, and some indicators of social agency, some of which were sustained through the follow-up. In concordance with previous research on early adolescents, a general decline in positive adaptation was observed in the control group between pre- and posttests.

AB  - This research focuses on the implementation of a series of actions and training workshops with families of a school located in a socially excluded area in the city of Cordoba, Spain. The study explores how the participants perceived the experience and the educational and social benefits of this formative process. The research methodology was based on a participatory action research approach, which involved successive cycles of research and action in different phases: planning and analysis of the problem, action, observation and reflection. Five key informants, selected according to the criterion of structural heterogeneity, participated in the research. Semi-structured interviews and field journals were used as research instruments and content analysis was the technique of choice to analyses the information. The results reveal that the participants found the workshops to be highly beneficial both personally and in terms of the image they project to their children. They also faced challenges regarding their continuity in the activity, such as prejudices or different communication codes. The discussion underlines the importance of conducting training activities with families in contexts of poverty as an educational action that can increase their interest and motivation towards the school and hence enhance their participation in school life.

AB  - Background: We are at a historical juncture that is punctuated by the rise of white nationalism, an exacerbation of racial divisions and tensions, an uptick in hate crimes, and bullying increasingly targeting immigrant youth, all of which, in the current political and cultural climate, have often been legitimized through a recourse to "alternative facts." However, the current historical moment in the United States is also marked by a postmodern ethos, which is often taken up by the public in a fragmentary manner, highlighted by a general sense of incredulity regarding any form of knowledge. At the same time, the fuller, ethical context of post-modernism complicates how educators may pedagogically address and respond to the tensions and conflict that filter over into the university classroom from the social strife and injustices evident in the society at large. The ethical context of postmodernism warns against changing hearts and minds with a proliferation of the "right' . "facts assumed to be devoid of attachments of value. It also warns us to be vigilant against the foreclosures, reductions, and exclusions that occur when one draws on metanarratives and universals to mobilize against injustice.
   Purpose: We explore what it means pedagogically, for teacher educators in predominantly white institutions, to be situated at a historical juncture that calls out for some form. of social advocacy on their part to combat the rise in the politicization of truth and xenophobic and racist sentiment, but are simultaneously compelled to keep in mind the ethical lessons of postmodernism.
   Research Design: We utilize critical phenomenological analysis intertwined with a narrative accounting of both authors' classroom. experiences as they attempt to engage college students at a predominantly white university with issues of racism, white privilege, and marginalization. We analyze and reflect on the mixed reactions of our students to a presentation on teaching in a diverse world, given by one of the authors to the other author's class of pre-service teachers.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: For teaching that may facilitate white students' ability to become reflective of their positionality as structured through whiteness and its attendant privilegrs, it is important to envision pedagogical work taking place within environments that can address not only students' cognitive capacities but also the white body schema, which operates at a pre-reflective level. Educators may refrain from reducing white students to reified categories of whiteness by cultivating a disposition of wonder that may allow them to understand whiteness through the lens of emergent realities rather than substantive, ontological forces.

AB  - This study expands research on how intergroup contact makes ethnic minority members less prejudiced toward the majority group. Specifically, we propose that perceived group discrimination may serve as an essential boundary condition of the friendship-prejudice relationship. Accordingly, analyses show that: (a) cross-group friendship predicts less prejudice, (b) perceived group discrimination relates to greater prejudice only among noncontacted ethnic minority members, and (c) greater perceived group discrimination enhances the ability of cross-group friendship to predict reduced prejudice toward majority members. The enhancing effect is inconsistent with previous research. Moreover, we show that perceived personal discrimination does not moderate the friendship-prejudice relationship. Finally, analyses confirm the unique qualities of cross-group friendship, as perceived group discrimination does not predict greater prejudice when this type of contact is most intense. Analyses are performed on an unusually rich, national probability sample of ethnic minority members fielded in 2017 including 1211 respondents from Denmark. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our findings.

AB  - In this study, we built upon prejudice reduction interventions research (primarily in social psychology) and ally development investigations (primarily in applied psychology). We aimed to develop an intervention to foster knowledge and attitude change identified in both areas as central to reducing prejudice and increasing intentions to promote racial justice. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether online imaginal and psychoeducational interventions could contribute to White people's needed understandings to engage in racial justice work. Additionally. if some interventions were successful, we aimed to determine which components were most effective. We used three intervention components, two of which were created for this study: imaginal contact with a person of color, learning and reflecting about racism and its impact on people of color, and increasing awareness of White privilege and positionality. We randomized participants to different combinations of the intervention components and control components to not only evaluate combined components but also dismantle the intervention, determining whether specific aspects of the intervention were more effective. Participants completed outcome measures about their attitudes and understandings prior to the intervention, immediately postintervention, and 3 weeks after completing the intervention. Findings demonstrated that the intervention and its components positively impacted outcomes of interest, with increasingly complicated learning requiring more comprehensive intervention to change.

AB  - The affordance-management approach conceptualizes stereotyping, stereotype content, prejudices, and discriminatory inclinations as interlinked cognitive, affective, and behavioral tools used to manage the social opportunities and threats afforded by other people. Presenting research from our labs, we show how the affordance management approach enhances understanding of why people are especially likely to categorize others using certain features (rather than alternative features), what the specific contents of our stereotypes are likely to be (and why this content is more nuanced than typically revealed by existing research), and how and why these stereotypes elicit similarly nuanced and functionally-linked prejudices and discrimination. We focus this discussion of stereotypes and stereotyping on the features of sex, age, home ecology, race, sexual orientation, and body size/shape, and we present novel concepts such as "directed" and "within-group" stereotypes. Then, elaborating on the specific, functional links between stereotypes and prejudices/discrimination, we present a novel distinction between "base" and "affordance" stereotypes, and we highlight the implications of the framework for better understanding sexual prejudices and "invisibility" stigma. We then briefly discuss the implications of our approach for stereotype accuracy and the psychology of those targeted by stereotypes, stereotyping, prejudices, and discrimination. In all, the affordance management approach to stereotyping and stereotypes generates a large number of novel predictions and findings, some of which pose significant challenges to popular traditional approaches to stereotype content, stereotyping, and prejudice.

AB  - This article uses ethnographic methods to explore how peer support and community involvement influence the mental health and well-being of transgender (or, trans) people in the southeastern United States. The study builds on existing research that suggests that trans community involvement and peer support among trans people enhance mental health experiences and moderate the effects of stigma and discrimination on health outcomes. Through qualitative analysis of 158 hours of participant observation and 33 in-depth interviews with members of a trans community organization in the U.S. Southeast, this paper identifies three key processes through which peer support and community involvement enhance the mental health and well-being of trans people: (1) the normalization of trans identities and experiences; (2) the creation of a social support network; and (3) the empowerment of trans people.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between individual parent stressors (financial, legal, career, relationships, home safety, community safety, medical, housing, authority, and prejudice) and adolescent obesity in African American adolescents. Methods. Data were from a cross section convenience sample of 273 African American parent-child dyads (ages 11-19) from Washtenaw County, Michigan. A subset of 122 dyads who completed parent and child questionnaires were included in this analysis. Parent stressors were assessed using the Crisis in Family Systems Revised (CRISYS-R) questionnaire. Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured by trained staff; height and weight were converted to BMI. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the relationships between individual parent stressors and adolescent BMI and waist circumference. Results. Parental exposure to stressors related to safety in the community was positively associated with adolescent BMI (beta = 1.20(0.47), p=0.01) and waist circumference (beta = 2.86(1.18), p=0.02). Parental appraisal of stressors related to safety in the community as "difficult to get through" was positively associated with adolescent BMI (beta = 0.39(0.14), p=0.006) and waist circumference (beta = 1.00(0.35), p=0.005). These relationships remained significant when adjusting for behavioral and psychosocial covariates. There were no significant relationships observed between other parent stressors and adolescent BMI or waist circumference. Conclusion. These findings suggest parents' exposure and appraisal of stressors related to community safety are associated with increased adolescent obesity in African American youth. Longitudinal, larger-scale studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms by which community safety may increase obesity risk in this ethnic minority pediatric population.

AB  - Although attitudes towards gay men are becoming increasingly inclusive, negative attitudes are still experienced by this socially marginalised group. Prejudice research often uses the Dual Process Model of Prejudice (DPM; comprised of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation) to understand negative social attitudes, and recently researchers have begun exploring the role of personality in addition to this theoretical framework. In this paper, we explored the predictive potential of the DPM (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) and the dark tetrad model of personality (D4: narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, everyday sadism) in explaining implicit and explicit attitudes towards gay men. The sample (N = 182; M-age = 39.15 years, SD = 10.65) was recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Variance in explicit negative attitudes towards gay men was predicted by the ideological variables in the DPM, and further variance was predicted with the addition of the D4 traits (narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism each contributed unique variance, while sadism did not). Variance in implicit attitudes towards gay men was not predicted by any individual difference factors. The current study offers theoretical and empirical contributions to the ongoing debate surrounding the utility of the D4 in explaining antisocial cognitions.

AB  - This research aims to examine transprejudice in the Turkish cultural context and identify its socio-political and morality-based correlates. To that end, we report two studies. In Study 1, we manipulate the gender identity of a hypothetical victim in a violent criminal scenario. We find that people (N = 116) put greater social distance towards a transwoman compared to a ciswoman victim, yet do not distinguish between the two in terms of responsibility attributions. In Study 2 (N = 175), we explore the socio-political and moral underpinnings of transprejudice by focusing on the role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) in different forms of transprejudice through the mediating functionof moral foundations. RWA predicts greater social distance and less positive affect towards transwomen through the purity foundation; while SDO predicts lower positive affect through the care foundation. The findings show that transprejudice does exist to some extent and that RWA seems to be a potent socio-political predictor of transprejudice in Turkey. The moral foundations, on the other hand, do not seem to play the mediator role that has been shown for other prejudice domains and different cultural contexts.

AB  - Previous studies have identified myriad negative consequences of internalized homophobia, or self-directed antigay prejudice, but few can speak to its developmental antecedents. This work explored whether parenting styles might affect the development of internalized homophobia and negative psychological health outcomes in sexual minority individuals. Specifically, we expected that perceiving parents as autonomy supportive during childhood would link to lower internalized homophobia and better psychological health, and that lower levels of shame would help to explain this effect. We tested this in a cross-sectional survey with 484 lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults. Results supported the hypothesized model: Those who described their parents as being more autonomy supportive during childhood reported lower internalized homophobia, anxiety, and depression, and greater self-esteem. These relations were mediated by a tendency to experience shame, whereby autonomy support from mothers (but not fathers) related to lower shame, which in turn linked to lower internalized homophobia and better psychological health. This work underscores the importance of autonomy-supportive interventions with families, as it suggests that autonomy-supportive parents may promote resilience against the development of internalized homophobia, a potent risk factor for mental health problems and self-harm.

AB  - Over six decades since the Supreme Court ruled that all American children have the right to a high quality education, the academic achievement gap remains an important social problem in the United States. Researchers interested in understanding the achievement gap generally seek to find the mechanisms that can explain why Black students continue to achieve at lower levels than their White counterparts. This research has shown that differences in socioeconomic status, family cultural resources, school quality and racial composition, and bias and prejudice in schools all act as mechanisms that link race to academic achievement. In this paper, we review studies from the past 10 years on the academic achievement gap. We argue that while all of the factors identified in the literature can add insight to how race structures educational achievement, the fundamental cause of the achievement gap is structural racism, a system of social organization that privileges White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color. We argue that acknowledging structural racism as the fundamental cause of the achievement gap can provide a unifying framework for interpreting findings from studies of specific mechanisms link race to academic outcomes.

AB  - Despite gains in equality for lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGB), these couples still face discrimination in adoption scenarios. Guided by the normative window of prejudice and the justification-suppression model, participants read about a suitable or unsuitable couple applying to adopt a child. Participants indicated whether the couple should be allowed to adopt the child and how committed the couple is to being parents. Heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to LGB parents; sexual orientation was not related to adoption decisions. There was a significant interaction between sexual orientation and suitability for perceptions of commitment to parenting: in the suitable condition, heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to gays; in the unsuitable condition, heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to bisexuals. This interaction was nonsignificant for adoption decisions. Future research should determine if these findings relate to other sexual orientations or gender identities.

AB  - I exploit a natural experiment in Indian schools to study how being integrated with poor students affects the social behaviors and academic outcomes of rich students. Using administrative data, lab and field experiments to measure outcomes, I find that having poor classmates makes rich students (i) more prosocial, generous, and egalitarian; and (ii) less likely to discriminate against poor students, and more willing to socialize with them. These effects are driven by personal interactions between rich and poor students. In contrast, I find mixed but overall modest impacts on rich students' academic achievement.

AB  - Much of the current psychological literature investigates single category dimensions (i.e., race or social class), with little focus on the intersection of multiple social category dimensions. Yet some evidence suggests that the intersection of race and social class information influences (a) stereotype expression, (b) categorization, (c) impressions, (d) prejudice, and (e) discrimination, revealing common links between Blackness and low social class and Whiteness and high social class in at least the United States. The present article reviews evidence for considering both target race and social class as intersecting social categories that simultaneously influence intergroup processes. This analysis suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of intergroup processes can be achieved when considering the intersection of race and social class information. This review also provides a series of future directions to advance intergroup processes research.

T2  - PHILOSOPHY COMPASS
LA  - English
KW  - FEMINISM
AB  - The 17th century author Francois Poulain de la Barre was both an important contributor to the history of feminist thought and a thoroughgoing Cartesian. Poulain borrows from many of Descartes's doctrines, including his dualism, distrust of epistemic authority, accounts of imagination, and passion, and at least some aspects of his doxastic voluntarism; here, I examine how he uses a Cartesian notion of prejudice for an anti-essentializing philosophy of women's education and the formation of the tastes, talents, and interests of individuals. "Prejudice" remains Descartes's notion of an entrenched, yet self-imposed doxastic commitment, but also takes on the sense of social-political group bias, founded on custom, transmitted through education, serving interests, and forming social expectations. Poulain also expands on the Cartesian notion and themes by emphasizing widespread yet unjustified social opinions in favor of the status quo in both epistemic practices and epistemic authorities, while considering how biased beliefs about sexual difference and gender identity can be internalized even by those who suffer most from them. At the same time, he shows how powerful Cartesian concepts can be for feminist methodology.

AB  - Using nationally representative U.S., German, and Australian samples from the World Values Survey, we examined tendencies to perceive differences (socially- and biologically-based) and threats (physical, economic, and symbolic) more negatively and cultural values (the emphasis on individual uniqueness and individual achievements) as predictors of prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers. The effects of each of the predictors on prejudice in a regression model did not significantly differ among these countries, except for a biologically-based difference, symbolic threat, and individual uniqueness. Compared to each of the other two countries, the effect of a biologically-based difference was stronger in Australia, and the effect of symbolic threat was stronger in Germany. The effect of individual uniqueness was stronger in the U.S. than in Germany. Results demonstrated that country-specific orientations toward race and ethnicity may affect the psychological dynamics of prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers and ultimately the reception of these groups in each country.

AB  - The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed.

AB  - Survival is dependent on sociality within groups which ensure sustenance and protection. From an early age, children show a natural tendency to sort people into groups and discriminate among them. The computations guiding evaluation of third-party behaviors are complex, requiring integration of intent, consequences, and knowledge of group affiliation. This study examined how perceiving third-party morally laden behavior influences children's likelihood to exhibit or reduce group bias. Following a minimal group paradigm assignment, young children (4-7 years) performed a moral evaluation task where group affiliations and moral actions were systematically juxtaposed, so that they were exposed to disproportionately antisocial in-group and prosocial out-group scenarios. Electroencephalography was recorded, and group preference was assessed with a resource allocation game before and after the EEG session. Across all children, evaluations of others' moral actions arose from early and automatic processing (similar to 150 ms), followed by later interactive processing of affiliation and moral valence (similar to 500 ms). Importantly, individual differences in bias manifestation and attitude change were predicted by children's neural responses. Children with high baseline bias selectively exhibited a rapid detection (similar to 200 ms) of scenarios inconsistent with their bias (in-group harm and out-group help). Changes in bias corresponded to distinct patterns in longer latency neural processing. These new developmental neuroscience findings elucidate the multifaceted processing involved in moral evaluation of others' actions, their group affiliations, the nature of the integration of both into full judgments, and the relation of individual differences in neural responses to social decision-making in childhood.

AB  - In this research note we replicate, update and expand innovative research by Sniderman et al. conducted in the Netherlands in the late 1990s, and ask whether the relative primacy of cultural compared with economic and safety threats in explaining ethnic prejudice remains true under markedly different national, economic and political contexts. Using two national British surveys conducted in 2011 and 2016, we examine the impact of threat on hostility toward three minority groups. Our results confirm the primacy of cultural threat as the strongest and most consistent predictor of hostility, while demonstrating the more context-specific effects of safety and economic concerns, with safety threats playing an overall more prominent role and increased economic concerns being related to less hostility post-Brexit.

AB  - In the field of the social psychology of prejudice, John Duckitt's Dual-Process Cognitive-Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice has gained a firm grounding over the past decade and a half, while empathy has become one of the most powerful predictors of prejudice, alongside right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. This study integrates empathy into the dual-process model, exploring the effects of this variable, along with the impact of personality and ideological attitudes, on prejudice in both its blatant and subtle forms. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 260 university students by self-report measures. Despite its cross-sectional nature, a pattern of causal relationships was hypothesized according to experimental and longitudinal findings from previous studies. The path analysis results show that in the model fitted to the data, empathy does not have any direct impact on prejudice, although it plays a significant role in the prediction of prejudice towards a particular immigrant group. On the other hand, the dual-process model is confirmed in the explanation of blatant prejudice and, in a weaker and indirect way, of subtle prejudice; sustaining the distinctive nature of these constructs on some differential predictors and paths. In the discussion, this study proposes that when ideological and personality-based variables are both included in the model, general empathy is not so robust in the explanation of prejudice, since some of the empathetic components might become diluted among other covariates. But even so, its indirect effectiveness through personality and ideological attitudes remains relevant.

AB  - Given its prevalence and impact, it is important that prejudice against sexual-and gender identity minorities is reduced and that negative behaviors against these minorities are prevented. We introduce and provide a definition of the term Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Prejudice (SOGIP), and discuss its determinants and configurations as well as ways to measure it. Furthermore, we review the recent social psychological literature on SOGIP-reducing interventions, identify scientific knowledge gaps regarding these interventions, and offer recommendations on how to apply the available knowledge to real-life situations. We conclude that there are many interventions currently being employed to target SOGIP with some seeming more effective than others. Particularly promising interventions are those aimed at evoking empathy and perspective taking and those aimed at developing alliances between minority and majority members. However, there is still room for improvement. Overall, little empirical evidence speaks to the robustness of intervention effects, its underlying mechanisms, duration, and boundary conditions. Researchers should focus on all aspects of SOGIP (i.e., sexual orientation prejudice as well as gender identity prejudice); different expressions of prejudice (i.e., blatant and subtle), actual behavior towards minorities, and on both perpetrators and targets of prejudice. By joining forces, researchers and practitioners should aim to overcome practical and theoretical obstacles in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Policy makers should support initiatives that test, improve, implement and distribute intervention programs, and can help bring together researchers and practitioners.

AB  - In the current work, we discuss how moving beyond the traditional emphasis in social psychology on differences in group memberships to diversity has both theoretical and practical benefits for the field and for policy. Specifically, we introduce a diversity paradigm that builds upon and complements traditional approaches to the study of prejudice and social identity by (1) incorporating multiple levels of analysis; (2) studying a range of different mechanisms that account for the separate and joint influences of factors operating at societal, group, and individuals levels; (3) including relations among multiple groups and recognizing the diversity that exists within diversity; and (4) examining both the potential benefits as well as the challenges of diversity. A diversity paradigm is important and timely because of rapidly changing technologies and shifts in demographics that increase encounters among members of diverse groups. We discuss several of the pressing questions and point to possible answers based on diversity principles and research. Questions such as Why is accomplishing diversity objectives so challenging/difficult?; How is a focus on diversity different from a focus on prejudice and stereotyping?; Why is it important to have, promote and value diversity?; and What does/should approaches to diversity encompass? In the final section, we identify possible paths forward in conceptualizing the paradigm and apply the work to the diversity challenges that lie ahead.

AB  - This paper analyses the effects of HIV-related stigma on children made orphans by AIDS and other children made vulnerable by HIV. HIV-related stigma is usually identified as the process of devaluation of people living with, affected by, or associated with HIV. The vast majority of children orphaned by AIDS or made vulnerable by HIV are ostracized, discriminated against, and isolated due to the shame associated with this disease. The authors emphasize how stigmatization makes it much more difficult to protect the basic rights of these children and add that many of them are at higher risk of being exploited by criminal gangs or becoming victims of abuse, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the authors suggest to promote a strategy that draws orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS into social protection schemes and programmes.

AB  - Cities are not only associated with incommensurable human diversity but also play a pivotal role in generating, assembling, and mobilizing differences. Alongside neoliberal processes that drive migrant-led diversification in global cities, we are witnessing growing inequality and precarity in populations of long-term residents that are themselves heterogeneous. Indeed, the diversification of peoples in the global city is also paralleled by the diversification of precarity. Yet, the ways in which new configurations of difference are producing more nuanced if still shadowy subjects of citizenship deserve more conceptual and contextualized attention. Although much has been written on the management of migration, far less attention has been focused on the management of multiplying forms of precarity resulting from insecure sociolegal status, disadvantaged labor market position, and deeply inscribed social prejudice. Even less has been documented on how these forms of management set up specific vernaculars about and subjects of citizenship, migrancy, and precariousness. This article addresses social inequality and the relationality of subject making in the context of diversification in Singapore, a city-state that has a particular historical understanding of diversity through a fixed formulaic "multiracialism." Drawing on state narratives and interview data, we analyze organized social support for both migrants and citizens both by state organizations and nongovernmental organizations to demonstrate the limits and possibilities of change and continuity in the production of precarity in the diversifying city. In doing so, we aim to extend scholarship of the global city beyond the well-debated issue of social polarization in the global city and to highlight the diversity and relationality of precariousness in a contemporary non-Western global city.

AB  - People with mental disorders often face prejudices that can further deteriorate their condition. We tested whether Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and Belief in a Just World (BJW), and characteristics of the mentally ill predict such prejudices. Both in a general population sample and a sample of health professionals and trainees, SDO, but not RWA and BJW, predicted more prejudice, although this pattern was less pronounced among health professionals/trainees. BJW interacted with the targets' gender in Study 1, predicting less empathy toward a male but not toward a female mentally ill person. In Study 2, depressed individuals were blamed more for their illness than those with schizophrenia or cancer. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - Human adults incline toward moral objectivism but may approach things more relativistically if different cultures are involved. In this study, 4-, 6-, and 9-year-old children (N = 136) witnessed two parties who disagreed about moral matters: a normative judge (e.g., judging that it is wrong to do X) and an antinormative judge (e.g., judging that it is okay to do X). We assessed children's metaethical judgment, that is, whether they judged that only one party (objectivism) or both parties (relativism) could be right. We found that 9-year-olds, but not younger children, were more likely to judge that both parties could be right when a normative ingroup judge disagreed with an antinormative extraterrestrial judge (with different preferences and background) than when the antinormative judge was another ingroup individual. This effect was not found in a comparison case where parties disagreed about the possibility of different physical laws. These findings suggest that although young children often exhibit moral objectivism, by early school age they begin to temper their objectivism with culturally relative metaethical judgments.

AB  - Research on prejudice seeks to understand and transform inaccurate beliefs about others. Indeed, historically such research has offered a cautionary tale of the biased nature of human cognition. Recently, however, this view has been challenged by work defending the essential rationality of intergroup perception, a theme captured controversially in Jussim and colleagues' (2009) research on the 'unbearable accuracy of stereotyping'. The present paper argues that in its own terms the 'rationalist turn' in socio-cognitive research on stereotyping presents an important challenge to the prejudice tradition, raising troubling questions about its conceptual and empirical foundations. However, it also argues for the necessity of transcending those terms. By focusing on the correspondence between individual beliefs and the supposedly 'objective' characteristics of others, we neglect the historical and discursive practices through which the social realities that we 'perceive' are actively constructed and institutionalized. We mask their social origins, contested and perspectival nature, relativity, and relationship to wider structures of power. By implication, moving beyond the Allportian perspective that has dominated both the prejudice tradition and the emerging stereotype accuracy paradigm, we may now need to prioritize other kinds of questions. Reversing Allport's famous definition of prejudice, it may now be time to ask: How, and with what consequences, does 'thinking ill of others' become sufficiently warranted? How does such thinking become part of institutionalized relations of power and an accepted way of perceiving, evaluating and treating others? What should social psychologists be doing to challenge this state of affairs?

AB  - Psychological research on prejudice against homosexuals distinguishes between old-fashioned (traditional) and modern (contemporary) homonegativity, which differ with regard to their content, correlates, and consequences. The current research offers evidence for the validity of old-fashioned versus modern homonegativity distinction in the post-communist, East European context. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 295 and 327, respectively) the Polish adaptations of the non-gendered and gendered Homonegativity Scale (Morrison, Parriag, & Morrison, 1999) and the Modern Homonegativity Scale (Morrison & Morrison, 2003) were developed. Furthermore, divergent (discriminant) validity of traditional and contemporary anti-homosexual prejudice was demonstrated. Old-fashioned and modern homonegativity exhibited differential relationships with social distance and support for same-sex couples' relational rights.

AB  - Jamaica has developed an international reputation for severe anti-gay prejudice. However, in the past few years, between 2012 and 2015, intensified waves of activism have increased the visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Jamaicans, and supported their social and legal inclusion in Jamaican society. This research investigated the effects of that activism by taking advantage of two large, representative surveys of Jamaicans' attitudes toward lesbians and gay men: one in 2012 and one in 2015. Over the three-year period there were significant reductions in desire for social distance and opposition to gay rights. However, there was no significant change in anti-gay attitudes, and there was evidence of an increase in anti-gay behaviors. There was also no evidence of polarization of responses to gay men and lesbians; rather, the most prejudiced Jamaicans showed the largest reductions in bias. Implications of these findings for activism in Jamaica and other anti-gay countries are discussed.

AB  - In a highly globalised world with increasing ethno-nationalistic tensions and conflicts, the importance of intercultural education has never been greater. The challenge remains, however, as to whether educating for mutual respect and social cohesion can be achieved through traditional modes of schooling or whether additional approaches that are not necessarily school-centric are required. Drawing on in-depth qualitative data including video diaries, narrative interviews and focus groups with Australian secondary school students and semi-structured interviews with teachers, this paper discusses such an endeavour in which a museum exhibition on identity and belonging is employed as an interactive space for meaningful encounter among students and as a form of professional learning that enlivened teaching practice. Using the concept of reflexive ethnicity, this paper examines whether cognitive and affective encounters outside the school gate' create opportunities for critical learning about ethnicity that can complement and enhance school curricula and classroom learning. More importantly, the paper explores how the possibility of building on such activities to create and sustain teaching practice can challenge entrenched static notions of ethnicity. The paper concludes that reflexive encounters with difference' within an interactive museum space can unsettle prejudice and provide a deeper and more meaningful understanding of ethnic identity that goes beyond rote classroom learning.

AB  - Private and public policies are increasingly aimed at supporting efforts to broaden participation of a diverse body of students in higher education. Unfortunately, this increase in student diversity does not always occur alongside changes in institutional culture. Unexamined biases in institutional culture can prevent diverse students from thriving and persisting in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Given the daily personal interactions that faculty have with students, we suggest that individual educators have the opportunity, and responsibility, to improve the retention and persistence of diverse students. However, in our experience, faculty professional development programs often limit discussions of diversity to "comfortable" topics (such as learning styles) and miss opportunities to explore deeper issues related to faculty privilege, implicit bias, and cues for stereotype threat that we all bring to the classroom. In this essay, we present a set of social science concepts that we can extend to our STEM courses to inform our efforts at inclusive excellence. We have recommended strategies for meaningful reflection and professional development with respect to diversity and inclusion, and aim to empower faculty to be change agents in their classrooms as a means to broadening participation in STEM fields.

AB  - Background/Context: High school educational environments find Black males experience systemic racial microaggressions in the form of discipline policies, academic tracking and hege-monic curriculum. Black males in high school are more likely than their White male peers to have high school truancies and be viewed as intentionally sinister. African American males are labeled by White teachers and administrators as deviant for issues like talking in class, dress code violations and being tardy. Deficit perceptions about African American students as held by White teachers and administrators serve as racial microaggressions within K-12 context.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Racial microaggressions based on prejudicial White beliefs of teachers impedes the learning process of participants. Racial microaggressive acts are problematic due to being a symptom of the overarching campus racial climate, which is often indicative of the negative historic treatment of Black males by Whites. The cumulative impact of racial microaggressions on Black males negatively impacts self-image, academic performance, and social navigation skills. Examining how Black males responded to racial microaggressions by White teachers and administrators at culturally diverse high school settings was the impetus for this study.
   Research Design: To understand how African American male students responded to racial microaggressions qualitative research was used. Conducting a study that focuses on multiple individualistic lived experiences, I am mindful that "human actions cannot be understood unless the meaning that humans assign to them is understood." This comparative case study allowed for narrative expression, which informed the experiential meanings participants as-signed to enduring racial microaggressions by gathering in-depth information through mul-tiple sources to understand participants' real life meanings to situations.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Participants' engaged in pro-active navigation strategies to minimize and counter racial microaggressions. Navigation strategies were influenced by in-and out-of-class interactions with White teachers and student peers. Analysis of the data gathered during interviews, focus groups, and observations confirmed the racial microaggressive lived experiences of participants. Three themes emerged: (1) monolithic targeting; (2) integrative fluidity; and (3) behavioral vacillation. Participants avoided monolithic targeted racial microaggression(s) by creating meaningful alliances within other racialized student populations by utilizing social and extracurricular relationships as protective barriers to lessen the adverse effects of racial microaggressive experiences.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between ethnicity, national identity, and xenophobia in Russia. Using survey data we analyze three hypotheses that might explain xenophobia toward five different groups: Roma, Chechens, Azerbaijanis, Muslims, and Americans. We find support for social dominance theory in a positive relationship between Slavic ethnicity and xenophobia. We then go beyond ethnicity to analyze Russian national identity content, and we find that pride does not simply equal prejudice: particular types of national identity content predicted greater or lesser xenophobia depending on the target group. Finally, we analyze theories of economic threat and xenophobia, and the findings are unexpected: higher income is associated with greater hostility toward most groups, and, for most target groups, economic vulnerability does not increase xenophobia.

AB  - Faculties at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) have demonstrated stellar contributions to social work, which include early thought and epistemology related to strengths, empowerment, and social justice perspectives; religious orientation; inclusive learning environment, and community-based research. W. E. B. DuBois was the most influential among these HBCU scholars; however, the DuBoisian tradition of scholar as activist must include works of Frazier, Haynes, Young, and others, who fueled discourse on contemporary social problems despite prejudice, discrimination, and Jim Crow. HBCUs provided direction for services to the new Black urban class when the profession was not prepared to do so. They led the profession to use new theoretical ideas, perspectives, and service modes for a new clientele.

AB  - Indices were developed to assess discomfort with specific behavioral violations of gender heteronormative gender roles, gender identity, and sexual orientation. A three-component model that proposes specific threats to social status as mechanisms of gender-based prejudice was then used to assess whether homophobia and transphobia were triggered by the non-gender heteronormative social identity status of the outgroup member or by perceived violations of specific gender heteronormative behaviors. For a sample of 145 female and 194 male gender heteronormative U.S. college undergraduates, path analyses showed that homophobia was particularly associated with discomfort with violations of sexual orientation norms while transphobia was particularly associated with discomfort with violations of gender identity norms. For men and women, discomfort with sexual orientation norms significantly mediated the relationships linking right-wing authoritarianism and benevolent sexism to homophobia while discomfort with violations of gender identity norms significantly mediated the relationships linking right-wing authoritarianism and benevolent sexism to transphobia. Discomfort with sexual orientation norms significantly mediated the relationships between religious fundamentalism and homophobia for men only, while this same discomfort mediated the relationship between benevolent sexism and homophobia for women only. A significant direct path from physical aggression proneness to homophobia was found for men only.

AB  - The present study proposes a new threat-benefit theoretical model explaining attitudes of local people toward immigrants. Based on the theory of human values and extending Integrative Threat Theory, the threat-benefit model suggests that the local population perceives immigrants as both threatening and beneficial for the receiving society. The model assumes that appraisal of an immigrant group as threatening or beneficial for the receiving society influences opinions regarding immigration policy related to the immigrant group. The study assessed the new model investigating attitudes toward asylum seekers in a representative sample of 283 social workers in Israel. Results of the study support a conceptualization of immigrant appraisal involving four types of threats (economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity) and four types of benefits (economic, physical, cultural diversity, and humanitarian), which represent different types of realistic and symbolic threats and benefits. Findings showed that appraisal of asylum seekers as beneficial or threatening to the receiving society mediated the connections between personal preferences for values of universalism, power, social security, and tradition and support for immigration policy directed either at defending immigrants' rights or defending the receiving society. Application of the model for understanding attitudes toward different minorities as well as for creation of value-based interventions and programs aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward various stigmatized groups in society are discussed.

AB  - The study was aimed at investigating perception of, attitudes toward, and knowledge of epilepsy among college students of the University of Messina in Sicily (Italy), high school students, and teachers from Sicily in order to structure health educational programs to remediate inadequate knowledge and stigma about epilepsy.
   Participants in this study consisted of 932 subjects (571 males, 361 females) aged between 13 and 63 years old (M 21.75 +/- 8.7): 571 college students aged between 18 and 35 years old (M 21.54 +/- 2.59), 62 teachers aged between 38 and 63 years old (M 51.18 +/- 6.27), and 299 high school students aged between 13 and 19 years old (M 16.05 +/- 1.67).
   Measures were two anonymous questionnaires to collect sociodemographic information and to assess knowledge of, attitudes toward, and perception of epilepsy. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, frequency counts, and percentages) and Mann-Whitney U-test nonparametric for two independent samples.
   This study provides general information about psychosocial aspects of epilepsy in Sicily which provides the basis for further studies and the development of interventions to eliminate prejudices against persons with epilepsy and related myths. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our research capitalized on a naturalistic data collection opportunity to investigate responses to experimental evidence of gender bias within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We analyzed 831 written comments made by members of the public in response to three prominent articles reporting on experimental evidence of science faculty members' gender biases. Utilizing a mixed-method approach (i.e., thematic and quantitative analysis), we identified the nature and frequency of positive and negative responses, and we investigated possible gender and professional differences in what commenters wrote. Although acknowledgment of gender bias was the most prevalent category, a wide range of positive (e.g., calls for social change) and negative (e.g., justifications of gender bias) reactions emerged. Among the subsample of 423 comments for which it was possible to code commenters' gender, gender differences arose for the majority of categories, such that men were more likely than women to post negative responses and women were more likely than men to post positive responses. Results were unaffected by commenters' own STEM field affiliation. We discuss implications for the role of clearly demonstrated bias in prejudice recognition and reduction as well as the development of STEM diversity interventions.

Mock-up Facebook profile pages in which the body size of the profile owner (thin vs. overweight) and peer-generated messages (accepting vs. thin-encouraging) were manipulated in the study. After viewing a Facebook profile page online, American and Japanese females completed a questionnaire.

AB  - We tested processes by which heterosexuals' direct and extended friendships with lesbian and gay individuals predicted homophobic and affirming behaviors toward lesbian and gay individuals. Results demonstrated that friendships predicted less homophobic behaviors and more affirming behaviors, mediated through reduced intergroup anxiety and sexual prejudice. Further, the strength with which individuals held their prejudiced attitudes moderated the extent to which these attitudes predicted affirming behaviors. Less prejudiced attitudes only predicted affirming behaviors when these attitudes were strongly held; in contrast, prejudiced attitudes predicted homophobic behavior regardless of how strongly these attitudes were held.

AB  - Attribution theory suggests the hypothesis that heterosexuals' attitudes toward homosexual sexual orientation will be more negative when homosexuality is attributed to controllable causes. Our randomized study analyzed (a) whether beliefs about the genetic or environmental etiology of the homosexual sexual orientation can be immediately modified by reading a text and (b) the causal effect of attributions about the controllability (environmental etiology) or noncontrollability (genetic etiology) of homosexual sexual orientation on the rejection of same-sex parenting and their social rights. The sample was composed of 190 Spanish university students with a mean age of 22.07 years (SD=8.46). The results show that beliefs about the etiology of the sexual orientation could be modified by means of a written text. Furthermore, participants who believed that sexual orientation had a genetic etiology showed greater support for social rights and less rejection of same-sex parenting. However, the effects were detected only when there was a traditional opposition to the family with same-sex parenting. When the opposition was normative, the effect was not statistically significant. Our results can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster tolerance toward and normality of sexual diversity.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine (a) the relationship among sport-related imagined intergroup contact, intergroup anxiety, and sexual prejudice, and (b) how these relationships varied across cultures. Students enrolled at major public universities in South Korea (n = 100) and the United States (n = 100) participated in an experiment in which they imagined playing basketball and then engaging in a conversation-with a gay man or with a friend. They then responded to a post-experiment questionnaire. South Koreans' intergroup anxiety significantly decreased when they imagined contact with a gay man, but the same was not necessarily the case for Americans. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between imagined contact and sexual prejudice for Americans, but not for Koreans.

AB  - Determining which dimensions of social classification are culturally significant is a developmental challenge. Some suggest this is accomplished by differentially privileging intrinsic visual cues over nonintrinsic cues (Atran, 1990; Gil-White, 2001), whereas others point to the role of noun labels as more general promoters of kind-based reasoning (Bigler & Liben, 2007; Gelman, 2003). A novel groups procedure was employed to examine the independent effects of noun labels and visual cues on social categorization. Experiment 1 demonstrated that in the absence of a visual cue, a noun label supported social categorization among 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that children and adults fail to differentiate between intrinsic and nonintrinsic visual cues to category membership, suggesting that this distinction is not central to the acquisition of social category concepts. Experiments 2 and 3 also showed that in the absence of a shared noun label, visual cues were not sufficient for younger children to form social categories. Experiment 4 ruled out a potential demand characteristic in the previous experiments. Together, these results reveal the primacy of verbal labels over visual cues for social categorization in young children and suggest a developmental change between ages 4 and 7 in the ability to construct new representations of social category concepts.

AB  - The current research examined the role of the belief in free will on prejudice across Han Chinese and white samples. Belief in free will refers to the extent to which people believe human beings truly have free will. In Study 1, the beliefs of Han Chinese people in free will were measured, and their social distances from the Tibetan Chinese were used as an index of ethnic prejudice. The results showed that the more that Han Chinese endorsed the belief in free will, the less that they showed prejudice against the Tibetan Chinese. In Study 2, the belief of the Han Chinese in free will was manipulated, and their explicit feelings towards the Uyghur Chinese were used as an indicator of ethnic prejudice. The results showed that the participants in the condition of belief in free will reported less prejudice towards Uyghur Chinese compared to their counterparts in the condition of disbelief in free will. In Study 3, white peoples' belief in free will was manipulated, and their pro-black attitudes were measured as an indirect indicator of racial prejudice. The results showed that, compared to the condition of disbelief in free will, the participants who were primed by a belief in free will reported stronger pro-black attitudes. These three studies suggest that endorsement of the belief in free will can lead to decreased ethnic/racial prejudice compared to denial of the belief in free will. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of contact versus education interventions for adolescents in reducing stigmatizing attitudes toward people with acquired brain injury (ABI), and whether visibility of ABI affects the intervention outcome. 408 students (age range = 14-17 years) from 13 schools in the Mid-West of Ireland were randomly allocated to one of the three interventions: Education only, Contact (Visible Disability), or Contact ("Invisible" Disability). Stigmatizing attitudes were measured before and after intervention. Results suggest that a Contact intervention was more effective in reducing stigmatizing attitudes in terms of social restrictiveness, benevolence, and community mental health beliefs than education alone. Visibility of ABI impacted the effectiveness of the contact intervention on Community Mental Health beliefs only. Contact with a person with ABI is thus more effective in promoting positive attitudes than ABI education alone, while the presence of visible impairment was not found to increase this intervention effect.

AB  - Mental health campaigns often promote biogenetic beliefs to reduce stigma, but their effectiveness may vary across disorders. Our study (N=127) examined two components of essentialist beliefsentitative (i.e., characterizing groupness) and natural kinds (i.e., biogenetic)about two stigmatized mental disorders (schizophrenia, alcoholism) as well as a somatic disorder (Parkinson's disease), and their relation to prejudice. The three disorders significantly differed in natural kind beliefs (Parkinson's highest, then schizophrenia, and alcoholism lowest) and prejudice (alcoholism highest, then schizophrenia, and Parkinson's lowest), but not entitative beliefs. Entitative beliefs, however, was a stronger predictor of prejudice against schizophrenia than natural kind beliefs even after controlling for social dominance orientation and prior contact. Implications for anti-stigma efforts and strategies are discussed.

AB  - We used a randomized quasi-experimental design to test the effectiveness of three types of perspective-taking condition in a forgiveness education program. Allport's Contact Hypothesis was used as a framework for the study design. Eighth graders (n = 132) in an urban Midwestern city were invited to participate. We evaluated the effectiveness of perspective-taking approaches in promoting forgiveness and reducing prejudice, anger and emotional reactivity. We also explored the effects of forgiveness education across socially and culturally diverse groups. We did not find differences between the perspective-taking conditions; however, all three groups improved on both forgiveness and prejudice. We also found the pattern of outcomes was different for the African American participants than for the European American participants. Implications for research and education are discussed.

AB  - Do social cohesion activities change the attitudes of the participants? This paper uses intergroup contact theory to explore attitude change resulting from contact with out-group(s) in social cohesion activities. Results from a pre-test/post-test design with fifty-five participants in two bicommunal camps in Cyprus show how attitudes change at the immediate end of these activities; an analysis of fourteen participants' comments after one, thirteen, and twenty-five months provides a medium-to long-term assessment of attitude change. Not all participants were completely positive towards the other community before they took part, as assumed by some. There is clearly space for impact in terms of attitude change. Social cohesion activities represent indispensable tools for reducing prejudice and improving relationships between former enemies in post-conflict countries.

AB  - A brief, casual interpersonal touch results in positive behavior toward the toucher, presumably because touch is a cue to friendship. Research on intergroup contact shows that feelings of friendship toward an individual outgroup member reduce prejudice toward that entire group. Integrating these areas, we examined whether interpersonal touch by an outgroup member could reduce prejudice. In three replications in two studies, interpersonal touch decreased implicit, though not explicit, prejudice toward the toucher's group. Effects of interpersonal touch can extend beyond the toucher to others sharing the toucher's ethnicity, and findings suggest that such effects are automatic and outside conscious awareness.

AB  - Inquiry into the written narrative's effect on social cognition is normally left to literary scholars and philosophers. Two experiments demonstrated narrative fiction's power to elicit empathy and reduce implicit and explicit prejudice against Arab-Muslims. Participants were randomly assigned to read a full narrative, condensed narrative, or a non-narrative. Critically, the full and condensed narratives were matched on counterstereotypical exemplars and exposure to Arab-Muslim culture so that the additional reduction in prejudice in the full narrative condition represented the unique power of the narrative. The narrative was particularly effective at reducing implicit prejudice in low dispositional perspective-takers. Partially explaining this effect, the narrative appeared to provide a safe haven from intergroup anxiety so that they could use perspective-taking to reduce prejudice. These findings demonstrate the narrative's power to induce spontaneous empathy and perspective-taking and consequently reduce implicit and explicit prejudice.

AB  - The article contends that the attitudes of the majority population towards the allocation of political rights to out-group populations are distinct from attitudes towards the allocation of social rights. Data obtained from an attitudinal survey administered to a representative sample of Israeli adults show that the level of objection to the allocation of rights to labour migrants in the political sphere is twice as high as that found in the social sphere. Multivariate analysis demonstrates that attitudes towards the granting of political and social rights not only differ in the degree of objection, but are also differentially affected by the social and economic characteristics of the population. Further analysis examines the effect of perceived socio-economic threat, threat to national identity and prejudice on attitudes towards the allocation of rights. This analysis reveals that different mechanisms underlie the formation of attitudes towards the allocation of rights in the political and social arenas. The findings are discussed in light of previous research and theory.

AB  - We examined whether increasing individuals' perceived variability of an out-group reduces prejudice and discrimination toward members of this group. In a series of four laboratory and field experiments, we attracted participants' attention to the heterogeneity of members of an out-group (or not), and then measured their attitudes or behaviors. Perceived variability was manipulated by portraying the out-group members as having diverse socio-demographic characteristics and different personality traits and preferences. Prejudice and discrimination were measured in terms of self-reported prejudice, stereotyping, in-group bias, social distance, and willingness to do something for the minority group under consideration. In all experiments, perceived variability decreased prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Adults tend to like individuals who are similar to themselves, and a growing body of recent research suggests that even infants and young children prefer individuals who share their attributes or personal tastes over those who do not. In this study, we examined the nature and development of attitudes toward similar and dissimilar others in human infancy. Across two experiments with combined samples of more than 200 infant participants, we found that 9- and 14-month-old infants prefer individuals who treat similar others well and treat dissimilar others poorly. A developmental trend was observed, such that 14-month-olds' responses were more robust than were 9-month-olds'. These findings suggest that the identification of common and contrasting personal attributes influences social attitudes and judgments in powerful ways, even very early in life.

AB  - The ability of modern medicine of treating, healing and prolonging life are so advanced that an end without resuscitation and ICU manoeuvres would seem inconceivable, regardless of the prejudices it generates. Still, there should be certain limits imposed by the promotion of the best interests of the patient and the respect of his/her dignity, the medical act being considered based on the notions of "beneficence" and "futility". Medical decision-making process, especially for terminal patients, must be balanced and relevant from the medical, ethical, psychological, social, cultural, religious and legal points of view. This paper presents the case of a terminal paediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, with numerous meningo-cerebral relapses, discussing the theoretical indication of withdrawing vital support in relation to the practical possibilities of implementing this decision. The conclusion of the paper is that the parents' autonomy regarding the withdrawal of the medical treatment, as well as the responsibility of the medical teams in situations where non-treatment represents the only alternative in the best interest of the patient are aspects that require legal analysis and regulations. In the absence of a legal framework and clear protocols in paediatrics, the entire responsibility for the medical decisions concerning the end of life for terminal paediatric patients is transferred to parents and the medical team.

AB  - This study examined the extent to which intercultural effectiveness dimensions (cultural empathy, open-mindedness, social initiative, emotional stability, flexibility) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) predicted the ethnic prejudice of 166 Australian respondents toward Indigenous Australians. Intercultural effectiveness was assessed on the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire, and RWA was assessed on the RWA scale, whereas ethnic prejudice was measured on the Modern Racism Scale. The results revealed that intercultural effectiveness (open-mindedness, flexibility, cultural empathy) was inversely related to ethnic prejudice, with open-mindedness being the main predictor. Intercultural effectiveness was also inversely related to RWA, the latter being directly related to ethnic prejudice. The implications of these findings for the potential role of intercultural effectiveness in combating ethnic prejudice are discussed.

AB  - College students frequently encounter prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes, but there is no research on effective teacher responses to classroom bias. Three studies examined students' perceptions of teacher responses to bias in the classroom. Study 1 experimentally manipulated the level of bias expressed and the teacher's response. Students perceived responding to bias as more effective than ignoring bias. Study 2 demonstrated that students perceive differences in the intensity of common responses to bias. Study 3 manipulated if bias occurred publicly or privately and if the target of bias was present or not, and students evaluated teacher responses of differing intensity for their effectiveness in achieving specific goals. The results provide evidence for the efficacy of matching responses to specific goals.

AB  - Why do Black/White workers earn wages similar to Black workers ($6.30 less per hour than White workers), despite encountering less negative, anti-Black sentiment from others? We propose that Black/White workers must contend with stereotypes suggesting that biracial people are socially unskilled. In the present study we observed that, regardless of whether job candidates were rejected for external reasons (interviewer prejudice) or whether candidates acted in undesirable ways (claimed discrimination), participants rated Black/White applicants as less socially skilled and as more likely to have demonstrated poor interview skills than Black applicants. Implications for biases against hiring biracial people are discussed.

AB  - Two experiments examined whether individual differences in prejudice are associated with different reasoning styles when targets and nontargets of prejudice are processed in the same context. High-prejudice and low-prejudice participants studied pairwise relations between four persons (one a prejudice target, three nontargets). Stereotypes were made salient by using specific ethnic names and stereotypic traits to define relations between the targets. Relations between the persons were always stereotype congruent in Experiment 1, whereas they were sometimes stereotype incongruent in Experiment 2. We examined study time, relational memory, and transitive reasoning in both experiments. The results of both experiments indicated that the high-prejudice participants studied sets of relations presented to them faster than did the low-prejudice participants. The high-prejudice participants were also more likely to show impaired relational memory and reasoning about nontarget persons but no such limitations with respect to target persons. This novel evidence that prejudice might substantially impair memory and transitive reasoning processes about nontarget persons is discussed in the light of alternative theoretical frameworks in the social cognition and emotion domains.

AB  - Objective: Previous studies overseas have suggested that the Compeer volunteer companion programme lowers expressions of stigma among volunteers. We used an Australian sample to examine the hypotheses that being a Compeer volunteer is associated with a lower expression of stigma and that stronger Compeer friendships are also associated with lower expressions of stigma.
   Method: Volunteers from the Compeer program were surveyed regarding their attitudes to mental illness (using the Social Distance Scale, Affect Scale and Dangerousness Scale), the strength of their Compeer friendship (Match Bond Scale) and previous levels of contact with mental illness (Contact Scale).
   Results: Volunteers showed low overall levels of stigma with no demographic variation in stigma levels. Lower levels of stigma were also associated with stronger friendships.
   Conclusions: Compared to similar US studies, Compeer volunteers show low overall levels of stigma. Stronger friendship bonds were associated with more positive attitudes.

AB  - Social work strives to be inclusive of all cultural groups and religious identities. However, a tension exists in the profession between freedom of religious expression and full acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. David Hodge and others claim social work is oppressive to evangelical Christians. This article critiques primarily Hodge's arguments using an analysis of biblical scriptures, new class theory, freedom of expression, and social work ethics. Social work and human rights principles are discussed as a guide for negotiating these issues in the social work educational environment. Intergroup dialogue is offered as a pedagogical method for addressing the tension in social work classrooms.

AB  - Policies and programs designed to challenge the effects of racial discrimination (such as affirmative action) are hotly contested. Factors which have been proposed to explain opposition to these policies include racial prejudice, group threat and self-interest, and perceptions of intergroup justice. We report the results of two random national telephone surveys which tested a theoretically based model of the predictors of policy support in post-apartheid South Africa. The results provided limited support for Blumer's group position model. Compensatory and preferential treatment policies had different underlying predictors: Violated entitlement featured in the models of compensatory policy attitudes, but not preferential treatment policy attitudes, where threat was the strongest predictor. In addition to threat and violated entitlement, policy attitudes among the black sample were related to ingroup identification but those of the white sample were related to prejudice. The effects of these variables were in the opposite directions for the two samples: Policy support was associated with strong ingroup identification and high levels of threat among the black sample (i.e. prospective beneficiaries of the transformation policies), but with low levels of prejudice and threat among the white sample. We conclude by considering the implications that these findings have for social change programs. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Early theorists assumed that sociopolitical or ideological attitudes were organized along a single left-right dimension and directly expressed a basic personality dimension. Empirical findings, however, did not support this and suggested that there seem to be 2 distinct ideological attitude dimensions, best captured by the constructs of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, which express 2 distinct sets of motivational goals or values. We outline a dual-process motivational (DPM) model of how these 2 dimensions originate from particular personality dispositions and socialized worldview beliefs and how and why their different underlying motivational goals or values generate their wide-ranging effects on social outcomes, such as prejudice and politics. We then review new research bearing on the model and conclude by noting promising directions for future research.
   The idea that personality powerfully influences people's political and ideological beliefs and behavior has a long history in the social sciences. The first speculative theories emerged in the 1940s as social scientists attempted to explain the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism in Europe. These led to the first major empirical investigation by Adorno and his colleagues (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswick, Levinson, & Sanford, 1950), whose theory influenced subsequent thinking for a number of decades.

AB  - This article presents a theory of the perception of hybrids, resulting from cross-breeding natural animals that pertain to different species and of children parented by couples with a mixed ethnic or racial background. The theory states that natural living beings, including humans, are perceived as possessing a deeply ingrained characteristic that is called 'essence' or 'blood' or 'genes' in everyday discourse and that uniquely determines their category membership. If, by whatever means, the genes or essences of two animals of different species are combined in a hybrid, the two incompatible essences collapse, leaving the hybrid in a state of non-identity and non-belonging. People despise this state and reject the hybrid (Study 1). This devaluation effect holds with cross-kind hybrids and with hybrids that arise from genetically combining animals from incompatible habitats across three cultures: Austria, India and Japan (Study 2). In the social world, groups and ethnic or racial categories frequently are essentialized in an analogue way. When people with an essentialist mindset judge ethnically or racially mixed offspring, they perceive a collapse of ethnic or racial essence and, consequently, denigrate these children, as compared to children from 'pure' in-group or out-group parents (Study 3). The findings are discussed in terms of the widespread 'yuck factor' against genetically modified animals, in terms of the cultural concepts of monstrosity and of racism and prejudice.

AB  - The present study aimed to delineate the psychological structure of materialism and intrinsic and extrinsic value pursuit. Moreover, we compared models based on self-determination theory (SDT), Fromm's marketing character, and Inglehart's theory of social change to account for racial prejudice. In a sample of undergraduate students (n=131) and adults (n=176) it was revealed that the extrinsic value pursuit Financial Success/Materialism could be distinguished from the extrinsic value scales Physical Appeal and Social Recognition, and Community Concern could be distinguished from the intrinsic value pursuit scales Self-acceptance and Affiliation. Moreover, Financial Success/Materialism and Community Concern were consistently and significantly related to prejudice, whereas the other SDT facet scales yielded weaker relationships with prejudice. Structural models based on SDT and Inglehart were not corroborated, but instead the present data supported a mediation model based on Fromm's work in which the effect of Community Concern was mediated by Financial Success/Materialism. Broader implications for SDT are critically assessed.

AB  - Despite the absence of an unemployment grant in South Africa, there is growing concern that other social assistance provision might nevertheless weaken work motivation and create a 'dependency Culture'. This study explores attitudes' about the relationship between grant receipt and paid employment in South Africa. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, it examines whether there is evidence of a 'dependency culture', the nature and strength of labour market attachment among grant recipients, and the opportunities and barriers to employment they face.
   We found that both those in and out of work placed a high value oil paid employment. joblessness had not become 'normalised', and all categories of the workless were extremely motivated to get work. Grant recipients did not subscribe to a distinctive Culture but to mainstream values and aspirations. While some benefit claimants subscribed to popularly promoted prejudices about other social assistance claimants, our findings appear to Counter recent concerns about potential unintended effects of the current grant system. The key factors in reducing people's chances of finding employment seem linked to the structural conditions of the labour market and the wider economy rather than the motivational characteristics of the unemployed and the arrangements of the grant system.

AB  - This study investigated U.S. ethnic majority and minority youth's perceptions of fair and unfair treatment by authorities and evaluations of three situations of interracial exclusion (N=685). Findings revealed that older adolescents who reported fair treatment by authorities were more likely to perceive wrongfulness in interracial exclusion scenarios than were their peers who reported unfair treatment. Additionally, in explaining the wrongfulness of interracial exclusion, older adolescents who had not experienced unfair treatment by authorities were more likely to mention racial prejudice than were their counterparts who had experienced unfair treatment. Results are discussed with reference to developmental theory on authority relations and the positive benefits of authority-adolescent relationships that reflect just and fair treatment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explain political tolerance for Muslims from an intergroup perspective. Explanatory mechanisms were derived from integrated threat theory, social identity theory, and the contact and multiculturalism hypotheses. Our results, based on survey data among Dutch youth and by using structural equation modeling, revealed that endorsement of multiculturalism and perceived symbolic and safety threat were the main determinants of political tolerance. Furthermore, we compared the explanatory model for prejudiced and nonprejudiced participants. Perceived safety threat was not associated with tolerance judgments among the nonprejudiced participants. All other relationships were similar for the two groups of participants.

AB  - Background There are increasing initiatives to reduce mental illness stigma among primary care providers (PCPs) being trained in mental health services. However, there is a gap in understanding how stigma reduction initiatives for PCPs produce changes in attitudes and clinical practices. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of a stigma reduction intervention in Nepal: REducing Stigma among HealthcAre Providers (RESHAPE). In a previous analysis of this pilot, we described differences in stigmatizing attitudes and clinical behaviors between PCPs receiving a standard mental health training (mental health Gap Action Program, mhGAP) vs. those receiving an mhGAP plus RESHAPE training. The goal of this analysis is to use qualitative interview data to explain the quantitative differences in stigma outcomes identified between the trial arms. Methods PCPs were randomized to either standard mental health training using mhGAP led by mental health specialists or the experimental condition (RESHAPE) in which service users living with mental illness shared photographic recovery narratives and participated in facilitated social contact. Qualitative interviews were conducted with PCPs five months post-training (n = 8, standard mhGAP training; n = 20, RESHAPE). Stigmatizing attitudes and clinical practices before and after training were qualitatively explored to identify mechanisms of change. Results PCPs in both training arms described changes in knowledge, skills, and confidence in providing mental healthcare. PCPs in both arms described a positive feedback loop, in which discussing mental health with patients encouraged more patients to seek treatment and open up about their illness, which demonstrated for PCPs that mental illness can be treated and boosted their clinical confidence. Importantly, PCPs in the RESHAPE arm were more likely to describe a willingness to treat mental health patients and attributed this in part to social contact with service users during the training. Conclusions Our qualitative research identified testable mechanisms of action for stigma reduction and improving clinical behavior: specifically, recovery stories from service users and social engagement led to greater willingness to engage with patients about mental illness, triggering a feedback loop of more positive experiences with patients who benefit from mental healthcare, which further reinforces willingness to deliver mental healthcare.

AB  - From social media to courts of law, recordings of interracial police officer-civilian interactions are now widespread and publicly available. People may be motivated to preferentially understand the dynamics of these interactions when they perceive injustice towards those whose communities experience disproportionate policing relative to others (e.g., non-White racial/ethnic groups). To explore these questions, two studies were conducted (study 1 neuroimaging n = 69 and study 2 behavioral n = 58). The fMRI study examined White participants' neural activity when viewing real-world videos with varying degrees of aggression or conflict of White officers arresting a Black or White civilian. Activity in brain regions supporting social cognition was greater when viewing Black (vs. White) civilians involved in more aggressive police encounters. Additionally, although an independent sample of perceivers rated videos featuring Black and White civilians as similar in overall levels of aggression when civilian race was obscured, participants in the fMRI study (where race was not obscured) rated officers as more aggressive and their use of force as less legitimate when the civilian was Black. In study 2, participants who had not viewed the videos also reported that they believe police are generally more unjustly aggressive towards Black compared with White civilians. These findings inform our understanding of how perceptions of conflict with the potential for injustice shape social cognitive engagement when viewing arrests of Black and White individuals by White police officers.

AB  - Guided by social cognitive career theory (SCCT; Lent et al. in J Vocat Behav 45(1):79-122, 1994), we assessed sociocultural (e.g., home-school cultural value mismatch) and contextual barriers (e.g., institutional climate) in science education and career development at both a baccalaureate-granting institution (BGI) and community college (CC) among 263 students (72.4% female; M-age = 22.96, SD = 5.70) in the USA. For BGI students, path analyses suggest proximal factors such as in-class prejudice negatively predicted science self-efficacy and prejudice from faculty and staff predicted lower career outcome expectations. For CC students, home-school cultural value mismatch directly predicted science career goals. Implications for future research, intervention and policy are discussed.

AB  - The rampant conflation between having a sexual interest in children and engaging in acts of sexual abuse contributes substantially to high levels of stigma directed toward people living with a sexual interest in children. Stigmatization and societal punitiveness surrounding people living with these interests can impact their well-being, obstruct help-seeking, and potentially increase risk of offending behavior. Previous research employing stigma intervention strategies have shown promising results in reducing stigmatizing attitudes toward this population, particularly regarding presentations of lived-experience narratives. The present study sought to examine the effectiveness of humanizing narrative (lived experience of an individual with sexual interest in children) and informative (fact-based information about pedophilia) antistigma interventions on members of the general public. Using a repeated measures experimental design, participants (N = 694) were randomly assigned one of two intervention videos as part of an anonymous online survey. Attitudes toward people with sexual interest in children (including cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses) were assessed pre- and post-intervention, using scales modified for valence framing effects and researcher-developed items. Both interventions were associated with reductions on all measured aspects of stigma, with the exception of perceptions of controllability, which neither intervention influenced. Although effects between interventions were similar, the informative intervention was associated with greater reductions in perceptions of dangerousness and increased understanding that sexual interest in children is not a choice. Implications for stigma-reduction interventions and future research are discussed.

AB  - Stereotypes are tools of social perception that attribute a superficial uniformity to individuals within a social group, providing an instrument to assess individuals and groups. The stereotype content model (SCM) provides a framework for understanding these dynamics. SCM explores how groups are stereotyped on competence and warmth. This research utilizes the SCM to study India, a heterogenous society with diverse social groups. The purpose of this paper is to study caste stereotypes using SCM within India while also comparing two distinct regions of the country - the north and the south. This study is unique because (a) earlier studies have not explored stereotyping while recognizing the regional variations "within" India and (b) it applies SCM to caste. We also include how caste perceptions are further defined for groups that fall under the affirmative action program. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we recruited subjects who responded to questions that assessed stereotypes of different social groups. The results indicate the presence of more ambivalent stereotypes and higher belief in karmic ideology in the four southern states compared to the northern states. Possible explanations discussed.

AB  - Racial disparities in policing are well documented, but the reasons for such disparities are often debated. In the current research, we weighed in on this debate using a regional-level bias framework: We investigated the link between racial disparities in police traffic stops and regional-level racial bias, employing data from more than 130 million police traffic stops in 1,413 U.S. counties and county-level measures of racial bias from more than 2 million online respondents. Compared with their population share in county demographics, Black drivers were stopped at disproportionate rates in the majority of counties. Crucially, disproportionate stopping of Black drivers was higher in counties with higher levels of racial prejudice by White residents (rs = .07-.36). Furthermore, county-level aggregates of White people's threat-related stereotypes were less consistent in predicting disproportionate stopping (rs = .00-.19). These observed relationships between regional-level bias and racial disparities in policing highlight the importance of the context in which police operate.

AB  - This colloquium discusses the crucial need to reconcile the ironic dilemma of enforcing social-distancing measures and social relationships simultaneously during the COVID-19 crisis. Young children have been exposed to multifaceted challenges during this time. However, their well-being, education, and safety have often been overlooked, ignored, or compromised. It is argued that society should abandon childism, which is prejudice and/or discrimination against children, and implement a holistic approach to protect and prioritize children's well-being, fundamental rights, and humanity.

AB  - Brands are increasingly embracing social activism and adopting positions on controversial issues, prompting some consumers to react by making uncivil comments on social media. How should brands reply to such incivility while maintaining their positions and protecting their reputations? Two common types of reply include either a sarcastic or an assertive tone, but the effects of these types of communication on consumers' attitudes toward brands remain largely unexplored. Results from a series of five studies exploring different causes (LGBT+ phobia, sexism, and racial equity) show that consumers evaluate brands that reply using an assertive tone more favorably than those using a sarcastic tone, which can be partially explained by the perceived aggressiveness of sarcasm. Additionally, support for a brand's stance acts as a boundary condition on the effect the type of reply adopted by the brand has on consumer attitudes toward the brand. So, the more someone supports a brand's stance, the less their perception of aggressiveness will negatively influence their attitude to that brand. We discuss the implications of these findings for marketing theory and practice.

AB  - Previous scholarly literature has documented a pronounced increase in the prevalence of prejudice-denoting terms in American news media content. Some have referred to this shift in journalistic discourse and related public opinion trends signaling increasing perceptions of prejudice severity in U.S. society as The Great Awokening. This work analyzes whether the increasing prevalence of prejudice themes in American news media outlets has been replicated in the news media ecosystem of a Spanish-speaking country. Thus, we computationally analyzed the prevalence of words denoting prejudice in five million news and opinion articles written between 1976 and 2019 and published in three of the most widely read newspapers in Spain: El Pais, El Mundo and ABC. We report that within the studied time period, the frequency of terms that denote specific prejudice types related to gender, ethnicity, sexuality and religious orientation has also substantially increased across the analyzed Spanish news media outlets. There are, however, some notable distinctions in the long-term usage dynamics of prejudice-denoting terms between the leading Spanish newspaper of record, El Pais, and its U.S. counterpart, The New York Times.

AB  - Feminist reflexivity aims to (re)consider and challenge power differentials that exist in the research process. This activity is well represented in, for example, research into heterosexism. In this article we expand feminist reflexive practice in relation to cisgenderism through a (re)examination of interview transcripts conducted by a cisgender researcher on the topic of cisgenderism in media representations of trans and intersex sportspeople. Drawing on interviews with 18 cisgender and trans and non-binary participants, we analyse three forms of researcher collusion in cisgenderism, namely: 1) perpetuating cisgenderism in the selection of media materials; 2) assuming trans women are the referent; and 3) disunifying assumptions about trans sportspeople. This reflexive analysis is discussed with regard to how analytical insights can be generated into the operation and functioning of prejudice. In so doing, we further the conception of prejudice as a ubiquitous and latent activity in research practices.

AB  - Bisexual men are one of the least studied populations within the sexual intimate partner violence (SIPV) literature, despite the prevalence of SIPV being equivalent between bisexual and gay men, and greater in bisexual than heterosexual men. Consequently, it remains unclear as to what factors contribute to SIPV-related victim blame toward bisexual men. The current study utilized a mixed-methods design to investigate prejudiced attitudes toward bisexual and gay men as predictors of victim blame in the context of SIPV. Participants (N = 124) were randomly assigned to read a vignette wherein a bisexual or gay man disclosed an experience of SIPV. Participants then completed measures of victim blame and prejudiced attitudes toward bisexual or gay men. As a means of contextualizing the quantitative analyses, participants also completed a qualitative stereotype task. Results indicated that prejudiced attitudes toward both bisexual and gay men predicted victim blame, and that victim blame attributions toward bisexual and gay men did not differ. Qualitative findings indicated that there was overlap between the stereotypes attributed to bisexual and gay men, which may explain the lack of difference in victim blame toward the two groups. These results implicate prejudice reduction and controlled stereotype processing strategies as a means of reducing victim blame attributions toward sexual minority men.

AB  - What can enhance positive inter-group contacts in a world of mass immigration is a subject high on the theoretical and practical agenda. However, there is a lack of research examining how contacts with different immigrant groups are related to characteristics of the group, as perceived by the receiving society. Using Threat-Benefit Theory (Tartakovsky & Walsh, 2016a, 2016b, 2019, 2020), the present study examines how different domains of positive and negative appraisal of a specific immigrant group may relate to contacts with group members. Using a representative sample of 1600 adults in the majority of the Jewish population in Israel, we applied network analysis to examine relationships between threat-benefit appraisal, opportunities for contact and levels of positive and negative contacts with four immigrant groups: diaspora immigrants from Ethiopia, Western countries and the former Soviet Union and asylum seekers. Levels of contact were related to particular domains of appraisal, which differed across immigrant groups. However, opportunities for contact had a stronger association with contact than the appraisal. Results point to a theoretical need to develop nuanced models related to inter-group contact, which consider particular characteristics of the immigrant group as perceived by the local population.

AB  - Clinician bias has been identified as a potential contributor to persistent healthcare disparities across many medical specialties and service settings. Few studies have examined strategies to reduce clinician bias, especially in mental healthcare, despite decades of research evidencing service and outcome disparities in adult and pediatric populations. This manuscript describes an intervention development study and a pilot feasibility trial of the Virtual Implicit Bias Reduction and Neutralization Training (VIBRANT) for mental health clinicians in schools-where most youth in the U.S. access mental healthcare. Clinicians (N = 12) in the feasibility study-a non-randomized open trial-rated VIBRANT as highly usable, appropriate, acceptable, and feasible for their school-based practice. Preliminarily, clinicians appeared to demonstrate improvements in implicit bias knowledge, use of bias-management strategies, and implicit biases (as measured by the Implicit Association Test [IAT]) post-training. Moreover, putative mediators (e.g., clinicians' VIBRANT strategies use, IAT D scores) and outcome variables (e.g., clinician-rated quality of rapport) generally demonstrated correlations in the expected directions. These pilot results suggest that brief and highly scalable online interventions such as VIBRANT are feasible and promising for addressing implicit bias among healthcare providers (e.g., mental health clinicians) and can have potential downstream impacts on minoritized youth's care experience.

AB  - The unexpected transformations produced by the conjunction of COVID-19, the murder of George Floyd and the resurgence of Black Lives Matter highlight the importance of social psychological understandings and the need for a step change in theorization of the social. This paper focuses on racialization. It considers issues that social psychology needs to address in order to reduce inequalities and promote social justice. It draws on theoretical resources of intersectionality and hauntology to illuminate the ways in which social psychological research frequently makes black people visible in ways that exclude them from normative constructions. The final main part of the paper presents an analysis of an interview with the racing driver Lewis Hamilton to illustrate possible ways of humanizing racialization by giving recognition to the multiplicity and historical location of racialized positioning. The paper argues that, while social psychology has made vital contributions to the understanding of group processes and of racisms, there remains a need to humanize racialization by conducting holistic analyses of black people's (and others') intersectional identities.

AB  - This study investigated how racial prejudice influences White college students' perceptions of hate crime. We also examined the moderating effects of the race of the victim of hate crimes and the absence of hate crime laws. Our sample included 581 White students in a predominantly White university located in a state that does not have a hate crime law. The study was set up in a 2 (race of the victim and the perpetrator) x 3 (level of assault) factorial design. Participants rated their perceptions of three scenarios (i.e., non-racially biased simple assault, racially biased simple assault, and racially biased aggravated assault). The dependent variables were perceptions of hate crime and willingness to report. The key independent variable was participants' level of racial prejudice. The moderators included race of the victim in each scenario and whether participants' state of origin has a hate crime law. Results suggest that higher levels of modern racism were associated with lower perceptions of hate crime and lower willingness to report racially biased simple and aggravated hate crime. When the victim was White, participants with higher levels of racial prejudice were more likely to perceive a hate crime and more willing to report it. The opposite was true when the victim was Black. The absence of state hate crime laws and race of victim were significant moderators. Our study suggests that racial prejudice is associated with lower perceptions of hate crime and willingness to report. Furthermore, the moderating effect of the race of victims provides insights on how racial prejudice can lead to a differential perception of hate crime, depending on whether one's racial in-group is targeted. Our findings also highlight the importance of having state-level hate crime laws to mitigate the linkage between modern racism and perceptions of hate crime.

AB  - Identification with multiple, seemingly incompatible identities has been linked to poor psychological well-being outcomes, including shame and guilt. However, the outcome of internalized sexual prejudice (ISP) has received scant attention in identity-conflict literature. The present study investigated the identity-conflict management strategy of identity integration as a protective factor against ISP in men who identify as both gay and religious. Additionally, this study explored the role of religious comfort and religious conflict in ISP, and whether gay-religious identity integration acts as a moderating variable for these relationships. The results of an online survey of 178 gay Australian men (M (age) = 29.32 years, SD = 10.46) were analyzed using a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis. As predicted, greater gay-religious identity integration predicted lower levels of ISP. Unexpectedly, religious comfort was positively related to ISP, and religious conflict was unrelated to ISP. Gay-religious identity integration was found to moderate these effects, demonstrating the protective influence of identity integration and multiple group membership against negative psychological outcomes in religious gay men. This study challenges the assumption that religious and sexual minority identities are dichotomous, emphasizes the benefits of multiple group membership, and may offer a foundation for further inquiry into the influence of gay-religious identity integration.

AB  - Purpose Humor can be a useful tool in the workplace, but it remains unclear whether humor used by men versus women is perceived similarly due to social role expectations. This paper explored whether female humorists have less social latitude in their use of aggressive and affiliative humor in the workplace. This paper also examined how formal organizational status and the target's gender can impact audience perceptions. Design/methodology/approach Two scenario-based studies were conducted where participants rated the foolishness of the humorist. For Study 1, participants responded to a scenario with an aggressive, humorous comment. For Study 2, participants responded to a scenario with an affiliative, humorous comment. Findings Results suggested that high-status female humorists who used aggressive humor with low-status women were viewed as less foolish than low-status female humorists who used aggressive humor with low-status women. Conversely, status did not impact perceptions of male humorists who used aggressive humor with low-status women. Results also indicated that high-status women who used affiliative humor were viewed as less foolish when their humor was directed toward low-status men versus low-status women. Conversely, no differences existed for high-status men who used affiliative humor with low-status men and women. Practical implications Narrower social role expectations for women suggest that interpersonal humor can be a riskier strategy for women. Originality/value This study suggests that women have less social latitude in their use of humor at work, and that organizational status and target gender influence perceptions of female humorists.

AB  - Prior research has established many factors which are linked with mental illness stigma (MIS). One such factor is that of socioeconomic status (SES). The current research intended to address if the link between SES, specifically income level, and MIS might be explained by social dominance orientation (SDO) and the legitimizing myth that mental illness onset is controllable in nature. A sample of 926 participants reported their level of household income and completed self-report measures of MIS, SDO, and mental illness controllability attributions (MI-Control). Results demonstrated that higher levels of income were associated with higher levels of MIS, SDO, and MI-Control. Furthermore, a significant three-path mediated effect was found from SES to MIS through SDO and MI-Control. Findings highlight the extent to which socio-demographic factors may be linked with negative attitudes toward those with mental illnesses, particularly when such factors work in tandem with competitive social worldviews. Implications in regard to the 4 importance of socioeconomically diverse mental health funding committees are discussed.

AB  - Although research on epistemic injustice has focused on the effects of prejudice in epistemic exchanges, the account of prejudice that emerges in Fricker's (2007) view is not completely clear. In particular, I claim that the epistemic role of prejudice in the structure of testimonial justification is still in need of a satisfactory explanation. What special epistemic power does prejudice exercise that prevents the speaker's words from constituting evidence for the hearer's belief? By clarifying this point, it will be possible to address two more general issues concerning the nature of prejudice: its resistance to counterevidence and the steps involved in overcoming prejudice. I propose a hinge account of prejudice, based on the recent perspective of hinge epistemology, to help clarify these aspects. According to the hinge account, prejudices share a fundamental feature with hinges: they work as norms of evidential significance, and as such, they determine what can and cannot count as evidence for belief.

AB  - The purpose of the present studies was to examine the connections that the dangerous and competitive social worldviews had with the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes. More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations these social worldviews had with the likelihood to engage in preemptive strikes may be mediated by perceived threat and certain psychological states (e.g., fear). The results of three studies with large Israeli community samples revealed partial support for our hypotheses using preemptive strike dilemmas concerning a business partnership (Study 1; N = 1629), a romantic relationship (Study 2; N =1481), and a home intruder (Study 3; N = 1502). As expected, the dangerous social worldview had a positive indirect association with the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes through perceived threat in each study. In contrast, the competitive social worldview had positive direct associations with the likelihood to engage in preemptive strikes in each study but the indirect association through perceived threat was less consistent. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that perceived threat may play in the connections between social worldviews and the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes.

AB  - Racial and ethnic division is a mainstay of the American social structure, and today these strains are exacerbated by political binaries. Moreover, the media has become increasingly polarized whereby certain media outlets intensify perceived differences between racial and ethnic groups, political alignments, and religious affiliations. Using data from a recent psychological study of the Alt-Right, we assess the associations between perceptions of social issues, feelings of status threat, trust in conservative media, and affiliation with the Alt-Right among White Americans. We find concern over more conservative social issues along with trust in conservative media explain a large portion of the variation in feelings of status threat among White Americans. Furthermore, more conservative social issues plus feeling of status threat significantly increase the odds of Alt-Right affiliation. Most surprisingly, however, trust in conservative media mitigated, instead of amplified, these associations. Implications and calls for future research are discussed.

AB  - Amid the epistemic divide about what social cohesion means as a foundational concept, the pursuit of social integration as a policy objective is more desirable than ever among policy makers. While scholarly debates seek to restore conceptual clarity for social cohesion and social integration separately, referring to them interchangeably in policy reports seems to go conveniently unnoticed across different migration contexts. This study seeks answers to the question: how does the concept of social cohesion manifest itself in forced migration contexts? It does so by first reviewing the state of the art on social cohesion-forced migration nexus to identify the recurring themes and substitute concepts in the literature. Secondly, based on an in-depth textual analysis of 327 scholarly articles and policy reports on the forcibly displaced theme in Turkey published between 2011 and 2018, this study presents a classification of conceptual frames on social cohesion in forced migration contexts as security threat-based, humanitarian emergency-driven, policy regime-oriented, and socio-interactional. One of the main findings is that the existing social cohesion models of the settlement countries do not explain what has been unfolding in Turkey in the post-2011 period with the mass influx of the forcibly displaced and ongoing conflict at its borders. The study concludes with a discussion on why integrating policy regime-oriented and socio-interactional approaches are more likely to advance both the quest for conceptual clarity around social cohesion and facilitate the design of actionable policies in protracted large-scale displacement contexts.

AB  - The present research aims at adapting to the Spanish context and language a measure of tolerance toward diversity recently developed, at analyzing its psychometric properties, and at examining the moderating effect of participants' sex on the relations between tolerance and prejudice. We conducted two studies considering two Spanish samples taken from the general population. In Study 1 (N = 586; 70.5 % females; M-age = 37.77, SD = 12.34) we confirmed the three-factorial structure of the questionnaire (i.e., acceptance of diversity, respect for diversity and appreciation of diversity) and their invariance across sex groups. In Study 2 (N = 333; 60.4 % females; M-age = 36.20, SD = 13.36) evidence of validity based on the relations of tolerance with prejudice (modern racism, hostile sexism, and benevolent sexism) are presented. Additional findings reveal the role of the appreciation of diversity dimension to reduce prejudice, as well as differences between men and women in this relation: when participants express low appreciation of diversity, men show more hostile sexism and modern racism than women. Such differences did not emerge for those who highly appreciate diversity. The implications of using this multidimensional questionnaire to measure tolerance are discussed.

AB  - Self-enhancement may exacerbate ingroup favoritism. What if, rather than self-enhancement, individuals focused on enhancing others? Could this reduce prejudice? Three studies tested the impact of self-enhancement versus 'other-enhancement' on prejudice. In Study 1 (N=95), a repeated measures design showed that participants demonstrated less implicit bias after reflecting on another person's positive traits relative to their own. In Study 2 (N=169), participants who reflected on an outgroup strength showed less racism than those who reflected on an ingroup strength and those in a comparison condition. In Study 3 (N=380), other-enhancement negatively linked to racism and sexism, whereas self-enhancement did not. Additionally, Study 3 examined an antecedent of other-enhancement - humility. We discuss the importance of enhancing others in reducing prejudice.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the connections that the dangerous and competitive social worldviews of Israelis had with their attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians. More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations these social worldviews had with attitudes toward peace may be mediated by the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation as well as the perceived threat from the Palestinians in a large community sample of Israelis (N = 1,236). The results of a serial parallel multiple mediation analysis revealed partial support for our hypotheses. As expected, the association that the dangerous social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians was mediated by right-wing authoritarianism and perceived threat from the Palestinians. However, the association that the competitive social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians differed from our expectations. More specifically, the competitive social worldview had a negative indirect association with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians through both right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation but there was also an unexpected positive indirect association through perceived threat from the Palestinians. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that ideological attitudes and perceived threat may play in the connections between the social worldviews of Israelis and their attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians.

AB  - We investigated manifestations of ethnic and gender-based prejudice in a rather understudied high-status environment, that is we studied biased ratings of physicians with a migration background and female physicians. In a preregistered, archival study, we analyzed ratings of more than 140,000 physicians on a German rating website for medical professionals. Results indicate that general practitioners (but not dentists or specialists) with non-German names are rated less favorably than general practitioners with German names. This effect did not vary across regional contexts with varying prosperity and diversity. Our analyses also revealed that female physicians are evaluated less positively than male physicians. Contrary to our assumptions, bias against female physicians was especially strong in medical sub-disciplines that are characterized by a high share of female physicians.

AB  - Since 1997, Ecuador has undergone a series of changes to ensure family rights to sexual minorities. However, there is still limited research regarding attitudes toward them. This study focused on the attitudes toward lesbians (L), gay men (G), and their rights. A sample of 318 cisgender Ecuadorians who responded to an online survey was recruited. Analyses indicated that men, heterosexuals, who practice their religion, attend more frequently to religious services, and identify as conservative showed higher levels of prejudice against LG as well as less support toward their rights. Further, participants who did not have LG acquaintances, friends, family members, and those who did not know any LG parented family showed less support toward these populations. Multiple regression analyses indicated that believing that a person's sexual orientation is learned significantly predicted the attitudes measured in our study. Implications of these findings to help reduce prejudice against LG individuals are discussed.

AB  - Economics games such as the Dictator and Public Goods Games have been widely used to measure ethnic bias in political science and economics. Yet these tools may fail to measure bias as intended because they are vulnerable to self-presentational concerns and/or fail to capture bias rooted in more automatic associative and affective reactions. We examine a set of misattribution-based approaches, adapted from social psychology, that may sidestep these concerns. Participants in Nairobi, Kenya completed a series of common economics games alongside versions of these misattribution tasks adapted for this setting, each designed to detect bias toward noncoethnics relative to coethnics. Several of the misattribution tasks show clear evidence of (expected) bias, arguably reflecting differences in positive/negative affect and heightened threat perception toward noncoethnics. The Dictator and Public Goods Games, by contrast, are unable to detect any bias in behavior toward noncoethnics versus coethnics. We conclude that researchers of ethnic and other biases may benefit from including misattribution-based procedures in their tool kits to widen the set of biases to which their investigations are sensitive.

AB  - This study was intended to examine the moderating effect of South Korean children's encounter with children from multicultural families on the relationship between their fathers' perception of multicultural families and their racial awareness. Research participants include 273 South Korean children between 3 and 5 years of age and their fathers. Self-reported questionnaires were given to the fathers, and their children were also asked to respond to the items measuring their racial awareness, as well as their encounter with children from multicultural families. In this study, three racial categories, including Asian, White, and Black, were used to assess children's racial awareness. The results of the study indicate that children tend to positively perceive Asian, White, and Black. While their perception of Asian was the most positive, that of Black was the least positive. The fathers' perception of multicultural families was significantly associated with their children's perception of Black only. The children's encounter with children from multicultural families did not moderate the relationship between their fathers' perception of multicultural families and their racial awareness of White, but did the relationship between their fathers' perception of multicultural families and their racial awareness of Asian and Black. The present study emphasizes the significance of enhancing fathers' anti-bias recognition of multicultural families for their children's positive perception of different cultures.

AB  - Facial expression stereotypes can affect the perception of other people's facial expressions. This study examined facial expression stereotypes of poor and rich adults and children. Experiment 1 found that the adult participants associated rich adults with positive emotions (i.e., happiness) and poor adults with negative emotions (i.e., sadness). In Experiments 2-4, adult participants still thought that rich 4-, 6-, and 10-year-old children would show positive facial expressions (happiness) but did not think that poor 4-, 6-, and 10-year-old children would show negative emotions (sadness). These finding have implications concerning how adults communicate with poor and rich adults and children.

AB  - Using large samples that are nationally diverse or nationally representative (total N = 44,836), this article presents evidence that citizens' prejudice does not usually benefit or undermine politicians who are from a particular demographic group, as many past studies assumed; instead. citizens' prejudice is associated with support for conservative politicians and opposition to liberal politicians, regardless of politicians' demographic background. Study la and Study 1b show that, regardless of the race and gender of real politicians, racism and sexism negatively predict support for liberal politicians, and positively predict support for conservative politicians. This overall pattern is experimentally confirmed in Study 2 where participants evaluate a hypothetical politician. Using data collected between 1972 and 2016. Study 3 shows that, historically, the predictive effect of racism and sexism on support for politicians in general is moderated by politicians' perceived ideology. Study 4 addresses a limitation of Study 1-3, and Study 5 extends the results for prejudice to the religious domain (i.e., prejudice toward Muslims). Together, these studies suggest that the way prejudice is related to support for a politician is primarily moderated by the politician's political ideology, not the politician's demographic background. Thus, this article highlights the often-overlooked role of politicians' ideology, clarifying theories that explain how citizens' prejudice is translated into their political preferences.

AB  - Habituation to ethnic ingroup members has been reported to be greater than to ethnic outgroup members. This pattern could be due to the lack of perceptive experience (familiarity) with outgroup facial morphs or, alternatively, to the prejudice held toward that outgroup. We explored this disjunctive in 71 participants, all Spanish, who were experimentally habituated to faces from their Ingroup and to faces from two unfamiliar outgroups, one for which there is low probability of prejudice in this population (Non-prejudiced Outgroup), and one for which the probability of prejudice is higher (Prejudiced Outgroup). We indexed habituation through event-related potentials, concretely as the differential amplitude of the face-sensitive N170 component from Initial to Final trials of each group. Afterward, participants completed several prejudice measures. N170 showed significant habituation to all faces, though it did not differ among groups. However, a regression analysis revealed that individual habituation to the Outgroup faces was inversely related to implicit prejudice scores. Importantly, N170 amplitudes were maximal for the Prejudiced Outgroup in both Initial and Final trials. We conclude that these effects are explained by the prejudice held toward a specific outgroup rather than perceptive experience.

AB  - Our study investigates several antecedents and consequences of negative emotional reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in a cross-national sample of 737 participants. Our results show that COVID-19 anxiety and negative mood are positively predicted by death anxiety and the use in communication of general COVID-19 information. Death reflection reduces negative mood in relation to COVID-19 and attenuates the positive association between death anxiety on the one hand and the negative mood and anxiety in relation to COVID-19 on the other hand. The use of humoristic information about COVID-19 reduces anxiety and social distance towards people infected with COVID-19 and also attenuates the positive association between the use in communication of general COVID-19 information and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. Our results also show that the association between death anxiety and social distance towards those infected with COVID-19 is mediated by anxiety and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. Finally, the association between the use of COVID-19 information in interpersonal communication and social distance is mediated by anxiety and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. The study thus reveals specific insights for tailored interventions to reduce negativity towards people infected with COVID-19.

AB  - This paper reviews our work that points to a link between the psychological aspects of social conservatism, intelligence, educational achievement, and militant extremist mindset (MEM). Conservative outlooks did not change under communist rule. Three ingredients of Social Conservatism are Religiosity, Nastiness/Social Dominance, and Social Awareness/Morality. There is a negative correlation between cognitive abilities and Social Conservatism. An increasing proportion of people with tertiary education contributes to a split in society between better-educated liberals and conservatives. Two ingredient processes of MEM (Pro-violence and Excuse) are conceptually similar to aspects of Social Conservatism. A critical ingredient of MEM that distinguishes it from Social Conservatism is Grudge. Three components of Grudge - Vile World, West, and Neighborhood Grudge - are important predictors of animosity towards outgroups. While nationalism/ethnocentrism has a significant correlation with all aspects of MEM, measures of trust in the system and socioeconomic status (SES) have essentially zero correlations.
   Terrorism motivated by right-wing ideology and MEM is also on the rise. Two recently completed studies produced outcomes that may be useful to policymakers. First, Serbs living in an area of recent conflict with Albanians show higher levels of Ethnocentrism, Neighborhood Grudge, and Pro-violence than Serbs living outside the conflict area. Second, asylum seekers hold lower levels of Grudge towards Western nations than do domicile populations from Southern Europe.

AB  - This study used thematic analysis to explore 28 socially vulnerable European Union (EU) citizens who support themselves by begging in public spaces in Malmo, Sweden, their exposure to crime, and the consequences of victimization. The analysis revolved around the following themes: daily harassment in public spaces, multiple motives for victimization, strategies to combat victimization, and consequences of victimization. The participants described that they lived in a constant state of stress, due to their marginalized life situation and a fear of becoming victimized in public spaces while begging. Study participants claimed that it was not their ethnicity but rather the activity of begging and their overall vulnerable life situation together with a label as "non-Swedish" that motivate offenders to commit attacks against them. The discussion concludes by presenting a number of policy implications.

AB  - The present study investigated a potential personality determinant of prejudiced attitudes among minority group members, namely, trait emotional intelligence. Two samples of European minorities (Blacks and Muslims, total N = 506) were collected. The results showed that (1) emotional intelligence was indeed negatively related to particular facets of anti-White bias, and (2) these relationships could be explained in terms of empathy. Interestingly, our findings also revealed inter-minority variability in prejudice levels and in the emotional intelligence-prejudice relationship. Taken together, the present study thus provides a first exploration into the roots of prejudiced attitudes held by minority group members.

We analyze public opinion trends by race and residents' experience as a student in a district under court-ordered desegregation-Nashville, TN. We find racial differences regarding the values of proximity and school diversity that are moderated by experience as a school-age resident in a city under mandatory desegregation. We build upon literature showing long-term impacts of attending integrated schools, underscoring the influence of time, place, and experience in shaping perceptions of school diversity policies.

AB  - Perceived responsibility for responding predicts whether people confront others' discriminatory behavior, but who is seen as and actually feels responsible for confronting prejudice? Study 1 examined whether people view status-based authority figures, stigmatized targets, or other bystanders as responsible for confronting a witnessed prejudicial remark. Results revealed that participants viewed the authority figure as most responsible for responding, and they reported feeling less personally responsible in the presence of both authorities and targets. Study 2 examined whether being in a position of authority enhances perceptions of responsibility for responding to discrimination and, in turn, facilitates confrontation. Participants who were randomly assigned to a leadership (vs. non-leader control) condition witnessed a racially insensitive remark. Leadership increased perceived responsibility, but did not significantly increase confrontation. Study 3 builds on the previous two studies by showing that leaders in actual organizations feel more responsible for confronting prejudice compared to those who are not conferred authority status. These findings extend previous studies by uncovering an important antecedent (i.e., conferred authority) of feeling responsible for addressing prejudice, which is shown to be a key factor in predicting whether bystanders confront discrimination. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Studies point to the positive role Twitter can play in social justice campaigns. Using Critical Discourse Analysis, this paper looks in detail at one such case: a racist call-out in Canada, which trended on Twitter in many countries leading to its coverage in mainstream media outlets. It had the characteristics, labelled at the time by critics, of `cancel culture', where there were calls for sackings and boycotts. This analysis demonstrates that there should be caution in regard to how social media platforms such as Twitter are able to lead in such matters of social justice. The paper shows how its affordances can work against coherent and careful discussion, fostering fast, simplified, contradictory commentary, where individual tweets load a range of different concerns onto a specific instance. In this particular case, this results in an individualization of racism, which therefore becomes decontextualized and depoliticized. While those tweeting revel in and enjoy their shared moral position, actual endemic structural racism in society remains invisible, and they misrepresent, arguably, the key question that this racist outburst raises.

AB  - Various pevious studies on Islamophobia have largely utilized Western perspectives. This occurrs owing to Islam and Muslims being a minority group that is considered a threat to the majority. This article discusses the delivery of Islamophobic hate speech via social media in the context of Indonesia, where the majority of the population are Muslims. The study found that Islamophobia on social media may be understood as a reaction against speeches by Islamic religious figures discrediting Christianity. Such Islamophobic articulation is considered a freedom of opinion, which is constructed on the ground of religion-based political polarization. Subsequently, this study brings into the literature a new understanding of Islamophobia within the context of Muslims as the majority and of netizens' activities on social media in Indonesia. The research data were obtained by observing Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter timelines containing Islamophobic hate speech that went viral on social media.

AB  - National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) emerged in the early 1990s as a subsidiary genre of the broader black metal movement. NSBM is distinguished by thematic content that promotes Aryan superiority, pagan spirituality and opposes globalization. Buesnel's article explores the history of the early NSBM movement through an analysis of the bands Graveland (Poland) and Absurd (Germany), which have both played vital roles in the establishment of the NSBM genre. Buesnel highlights the current state of National Socialist ideology within metal subcultures and concludes with observations about the future of far-right extremism in heavy metal.

AB  - Is it true that national identity increases trust, as liberal nationalists assume? Recent research has studied this side of the 'national identity argument' by focusing on conceptions of the content of national identity (often civic or ethnic) and their links to social, rather than political, trust. This paper argues that if we take social identity theory seriously, however, we need to complement this picture by asking how varying the strength - rather than the content - of a person's sense of their national identity affects both their social and political trust. We break down the different dimensions of national identity, hypothesizing and empirically verifying that there are divergent links from national attachment, national pride, and national chauvinism to social and political trust. We do so with data from the US (General Social Survey) and the Netherlands (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences ), thus expanding current knowledge of national identity and trust to a highly relevant yet neglected European case.

AB  - As society becomes increasingly racially diverse, fostering positive interracial interactions is more important than ever. Unfortunately, previous work suggests that there are barriers to positive interracial interactions including White people's concerns about being liked and being seen as nonprejudiced and Black people's concerns about being respected and being seen as competent (Bergsieker, Shelton. & Richeson, 2010). The current work tested the hypothesis that these seemingly divergent impression management concerns do not always lead White people to have an approach to interracial interactions that is "incompatible" with Black interaction partner's concerns about being respected. We argue that White people who are internally motivated to respond without prejudice (Plant & Devine. 1998) are aware that Black interaction partners want to be respected, are concerned about showing this respect, and demonstrate this respect by focusing on getting to know and engaging with Black interaction partners during interracial interactions. On the other hand, White people who are externally motivated to respond without prejudice are focused on their own concerns about appearing prejudiced and focus on themselves and their own experience rather the needs of Black interaction partners. The results of six studies supported our predictions. Overall. the current work provides an important link between research on impression management concerns and motivations to respond without prejudice and suggests that the key to cultivating positive interracial interactions may be to increase White people's internal motivation and knowledge that Black people want to be respected.

AB  - The left-cradling bias is the tendency to cradle an infant on the left side, regardless of the individuals' handedness, culture or ethnicity. Many studies revealed associations between socio-emotional variables and the left-side bias, suggesting that this asymmetry might be considered as a proxy of the emotional attunement between the cradling and the cradled individuals. In this study we examined whether adult females with high levels of prejudice toward a specific ethnic group would show reduced left-cradling preferences when required to cradle an infant-like doll with ethnical features of the prejudiced group. We manipulated the ethnicity of the cradled individual by asking 336 Caucasian women to cradle a White or a Black doll and then assessed their prejudice levels toward African individuals. Significant correlations were shown only in the Black doll group indicating that the more the prejudice toward Africans, the more the cradling-side preferences shifted toward the right. Furthermore, participants exhibiting low levels-but not those exhibiting high levels-of ethnic prejudice showed a significant left-cradling bias. These findings show that ethnic prejudice toward the specific ethnic group of the cradled individual can interfere with the left preference in the cradling woman. The present study corroborates our suggestion that the left-cradling bias might be considered as a natural index of a positive socio-communicative relationship between the cradling and cradled individuals. On the contrary, the right-cradling bias might be considered as a cue of the presence of affective dysfunctions in the relationship.

AB  - Sexual minority mental health disparities can be attributed, in large part, to chronic exposure to stress. There is growing interest in understanding the factors associated with psychological resilience, or the ability to positively cope with life's stressors. Using nationally representative data (2012-2013; N = 14,470), this study compared differences in resilience status (operationalized empirically using SF-12 mental health score among respondents reporting 2+ past-year stressful life events; respondents were categorized as "flourishing," "average," or "languishing") by sexual orientation and assessed whether social support mediated sexual minority disparities in resilience. Comparisons were made across four sexual orientation groups: heterosexuals and three sexual minority subgroups (lesbians/gay men, bisexual, heterosexual-identified sexual minorities [HSM]). Generally, heterosexual respondents were more likely to be flourishing, less likely to be languishing, and reported more social support, compared to sexual minority respondents. In multivariable analysis, bisexual women, HSM women, and gay men had lower odds of resilience than heterosexual women and men, respectively. In mediation models, lower social support was associated with reduced resilience for all sexual minority subgroups except lesbian/gay women. This study demonstrated that sexual orientation is an important determinant of resilience, and further, that social support contributes to sexual minority peoples' abilities to flourish when faced with stress.

AB  - This study investigates how news stories about models' social identities, models' actual social identities, and ease of categorization of models into societally predominant gender and racial categories affect processing and evaluation of persuasive messages. Participants read news stories about fashion companies that used transgender or biracial models in advertising campaigns or control stories and then viewed a series of still images edited to look like advertisements. Physiological responding and self-reported attitudes were recorded. Results indicated more positive evaluation of images preceded by news stories about models' social identities compared to control stories. With a few exceptions, participants did not differ in their evaluation of images based on actual identity, although actual identity did affect processing. While participants responded positively to images with racially ambiguous models, they did not respond positively to images with androgynous models. Results are discussed in regard to theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - With the influx of African and Middle Eastern refugees to Europe, the interest in immigrants has increased. This study analyzes how individual-level and country-level variables affect social and policy acceptance. It finds that personal ties and life satisfaction determine acceptance. Also, individual and contextual variables influence acceptance. Direction and significance of the predictor's impact depends on each national context. Skilled labor (+), ideology (left, +), knowledge (+), government spending (-), and crime rate (-) only affect social acceptance whereas social contact (+), unemployment rate (-), party seats of left/socialist (+), and ethnic diversity (+) affect policy.

AB  - Right-wing extremists and Islamist extremists try to recruit new followers by addressing their national (for instance, German) or religious (Muslim) social identity via online propaganda videos. Two studies examined whether capitalizing on a shared group-membership affects the emotional and cognitive response towards extremist propaganda. In both studies, Germans/(non-migrants), Muslim migrants and control participants (N= 235) were confronted with right-wing extremist and Islamist extremist videos. Emotional and cognitive effects of students (Study 1) and apprentices (Study 2) were assessed. Results showed a general negative evaluation of extremist videos. More relevant, in-group propaganda led to more emotional costs in both studies. Yet, the responses varied depending on educational level: students reported more negative emotions and cognitions after in-group directed videos, while apprentices reported more positive emotions and cognitions after in-group directed propaganda. Results are discussed considering negative social identities.

AB  - How does a chief executive officer (CEO)'s social media content disclosure on Twitter affect perceived CEO attributes, relationship investment, and public engagement, and to what extent does the CEO's gender (male vs. female) moderate how publics evaluate content disclosures? A 2 (CEO gender: male vs. female) x 4 (level of disclosure: 100% corporate vs. 70% corporate and 30% personal vs. 30% corporate and 70% personal vs. 100% personal disclosure) between-subject experimental design was used to address these questions with a random sample of 465 adult Twitter users in the United States. Results showed that posts that featured high personal disclosure did not increase the perceived likability or competence of the CEO. Nor did CEO gender impact these outcomes. However, CEO professional disclosure proved to be an effective means to gain high levels of perceived relationship investment from publics. Finally, publics may hold implicit gender bias in cognitive (i.e., perceived relationship investment) and behavioral evaluation (i.e., engagement intention) of a female CEO.

AB  - The Western hemisphere has witnessed recent increased immigration flows generating social and political debate across Europe. In one view, migration flows represent an opportunity to construct a diverse social cohesion. In another view, migration flows are perceived as a threat to existent national cultures. This view is held by political nationalisms and right-wing populist forces installed in the majority of EU countries' parliaments, accentuating discrimination against immigrants and residents in Europe. We theorize that European identity predicts positive attitudes toward immigrants (prosocial behavior and support for inclusive policies), whereas national identity's predictions of attitudes toward immigrants' inclusion depends on participants' political tendency. Moreover, we test the mediation effect of positive (humanitarian concerns and economic benefit) and negative (jobs scarcity, cultural deterioration, and invasion) arguments used in political discourses regarding immigrants' inclusion on the relation between national and European identities and attitudes toward immigrants' inclusion. Results (Portuguese sample,N= 176) show that national identity predicts negative attitudes toward immigrants' inclusion, but only among right-wing individuals. Among left-wing individuals, national identity predicts less contestation to immigrant's inclusion sustained by humanitarian concerns. Interestingly, European identification weakened right-wing individuals' adherence to discriminatory arguments and increased perceived economic contribution that immigrants bring to society, increasing agreement with prosocial behavior and immigrants' inclusion. We discuss that European identity, sustained in humanitarian values and economic benefit, may stimulate a stronger multicultural social cohesion, intergroup trust, and social well-being based on democratic values, social justice, and equality, and on the respect for human dignity.

AB  - Social identity theory (SIT) suggests that perceived identity difference between groups predicts to intergroup conflict, including interstate conflict. Contact theory suggests that social contact between groups can help reduce intergroup conflict. Contact theory, however, has not traditionally focused on perceived identity difference, and it has not been tested much on real-world interstate conflicts. Employing an experimental design, our study tests for the effects of imagined social contact on Chinese students' generally malign perceptions of identity difference with Japanese people. We find that imagined contact reduces key perceptions of difference by reducing both perceived Japanese malignity and perceived Chinese benignity. This suggests that social contact helps produce new hybrid in-group. By employing SIT, our findings provide a new microfoundation for contact theory, suggest an important process in the creation of security communities, and provide a proof of concept for public policies aimed at large-scale cultural exchanges.

AB  - When a terror attack occurs people appear to be prepared, in the short term, to be more accepting of authoritarian sanctions against outgroup members, particularly if sanctions are targeted against members of the outgroup perceived as responsible for the attack. The current study examined forty-two British participants' scores on measures of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and explicit prejudice (EP) before, within thirty-six hours of, and one year after the November 2015 Paris terror attacks. As higher scores on RWA measures have been linked to considering the world as dangerous and threatening, and desiring that authority control and punish transgressors of societal norms, and higher EP scores have been linked to negative perceptions of outgroups, we hypothesized that participants' scores on both measures would increase immediately after the terror attack. Analyses showed small but significant increases in RWA and EP scores immediately after the attacks, particularly for those initially scoring lower on these measures, but scores on both measures had returned to baseline levels oneyear later. These findings from a within-subjects sample support recent between-subjects research suggesting that RWA and EP attitudes are impacted in the short term by reported terrorist attacks.

AB  - The present studies examined the associations that narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and spitefulness had with the competitive and dangerous social worldviews as well as the possibility that these worldviews may explain, at least in part, the associations that these dark personality features had with the ideological attitudes of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Across three studies (N = 2,103), we found the dark personality features to be positively associated with the competitive social worldview in Studies 1 and 3 but these associations were much weaker in Study 2. Narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness had indirect associations with the dominance and anti-egalitarianism aspects of SDO through the competitive social worldview in Study 3 but not in Study 2. In contrast, the dark personality features had, at best, weak associations with the dangerous social worldview as well as divergent associations with aspects of RWA. More specifically, narcissism and spitefulness were positively associated with aspects of RWA but psychopathy was negatively associated with RWA. Discussion focuses on the role that social worldviews - especially perceptions of the world as being a highly competitive environment - may play in the connections that dark personality features have with various outcomes including ideological attitudes.

AB  - The present research examined whether the associations that the assertive/extraverted, antagonistic/disagreeable, and vulnerable/neurotic aspects of narcissism had with ideological attitudes were mediated by social worldviews . The assertive/extraverted and antagonistic/disagreeable aspects of narcissism had similar associations with the competitive social worldview which, in turn, mediated their associations with certain ideological attitudes. In contrast, social worldviews did not mediate the tendency for vulnerable/neurotic narcissism to be characterized by the rejection of right-wing ideological attitudes and the endorsement of left-wing ideological attitudes. These results suggest that these aspects of narcissism diverged in their associations with ideological attitudes and that the competitive social worldview played an important role in the associations that the assertive/extraverted and antagonistic/disagreeable aspects of narcissism had with ideological attitudes.

AB  - This article provides rich and unique insights into the experiences of women police leaders across seven European regions. Drawing on interview data, it presents accounts of women's experiences in policing and identifies informal and formal barriers to their advancement in European police organizations. Women police leaders report high levels of gender discrimination, obstruction and prejudice over the course of their careers. We argue that there are a number of subjective and informal criteria of 'acceptability' that shape women's experiences of promotion and that informal patronage is a strong basis from which strategic appointments are made within European police systems. The article makes sense of the ways in which informal aspects of career progression function alongside formal promotion criteria to preserve men as the 'ideal' candidates for police leadership positions, resulting in a preference for other men and the exclusion of women. The relevance of these findings is key to informing the future selection and development of police leaders in an increasingly complex police landscape.

AB  - Past research on prejudice confrontations as a prejudice reduction tool has only examined bias that was implicated in the confrontation, such as the use of negative Black stereotypes after being confronted for using negative Black stereotypes. Examining the breadth of prejudice confrontations, we hypothesize that confronted individuals should subsequently use fewer negative and positive stereotypes about other racial minority groups, and fewer stereotypes about groups stigmatized along other identity dimensions (e.g., gender). In two studies, White participants confronted for the use of negative Black stereotypes used fewer negative Latino stereotypes (Study 1), positive Black, but not Asian, stereotypes and fewer gender role stereotypes (Study 2). Additionally, participants confronted for female gender role stereotypes subsequently used fewer negative Black and Latino stereotypes 24-72 hr later due to greater racial egalitarian motivation (Study 3). Thus, prejudice confrontations have a broad effect on reducing bias toward multiple stigmatized groups across identity dimensions.

AB  - Collective narcissism is a belief that one's own group (the in-group) is exceptional but not sufficiently recognized by others. It is the form of "in-group love" robustly associated with "out-group hate." In contrast to private collective self-esteem (or in-group satisfaction, a belief that the in-group is of high value), it predicts prejudice, retaliatory intergroup aggression, and rejoicing in the suffering of other people. The pervasive association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is driven by a biased perception of the in-group as constantly threatened and out-groups as hostile and threatening. Collective narcissism is associated with hypersensitivity to provocation and the belief that only hostile revenge is a desirable and rewarding response. It arises when the traditional group-based hierarchies are challenged and empowers extremists as well as populist politicians. Instead of alleviating the sense of threat to one's self-importance, it refuels it. The association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is weakened by experiences that fortify emotional resilience (e.g., positive identification with a community).

AB  - Exogenous attention allows the automatic detection of relevant stimuli and the reorientation of our current focus of attention towards them. Faces from an ethnic outgroup tend to capture exogenous attention to a greater extent than faces from an ethnic ingroup. We explored whether prejudice toward the outgroup, rather than lack of familiarity, is driving this effect. Participants (N=76) performed a digit categorization task while distractor faces were presented. Faces belonged to (i) a prejudiced outgroup, (ii) a non-prejudiced outgroup and (iii) their ingroup. Half of the faces were previously habituated in order to increase their familiarity. Reaction times, accuracy and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to index exogenous attention to distractor faces. Additionally, different indexes of explicit and implicit prejudice were measured, the latter being significantly greater towards prejudiced outgroup. N170 amplitude was greater to prejudiced outgroup-regardless of their habituation status-than to both non-prejudiced outgroup and ingroup faces and was associated with implicit prejudice measures. No effects were observed at the behavioral level. Our results show that implicit prejudice, rather than familiarity, is under the observed attention-related N170 effects and that this ERP component may be more sensitive to prejudice than behavioral measures under certain circumstances.

AB  - Color-blind theory posits that ignoring race is a purposeful tool for protecting white privilege. Implicit in this theory is the idea that color blindness arises in times of racial threat because color-blind attitudes provide individuals with a tool for justifying racialized practices. Schools provide an ideal context for testing these implicit assumptions of color-blind theory. Public schools have shifted from using race conscious practices, such as forced busing, to racially ambiguous ones, such as touting diversity to address racial integration. Diversity is racially ambiguous because it can be interpreted as the inclusion of racial minorities but can also have a broader, color-blind meaning. In this study, I use a survey experiment to test whether experiencing racial threat leads white participants to have a color-blind interpretation of school diversity and whether racialized practices (in this case, picking a whiter school) mediates that relationship. I find evidence corroborating color-blind theory. Experiencing racial threat increases the probability that participants have a color-blind understanding of school diversity. Further, I find evidence that the mechanism explaining this relationship is participants picking whiter schools, highlighting that color blindness can be used as a tool to justify racialized practices.

AB  - Social psychologists are often criticized for failing to capture the dynamic nature of psychological processes. We present a novel framework to address this problem. The MOVE framework contends that to comprehend complex, contradictory, and divergent patterns of thought, affect, and behavior within changing, real-world contexts, it is necessary to undertake ecologically valid research that is attentive to the lived experiences and meaning-making processes of culturally embedded individuals over time. A focus on meanings, observations, viewpoints, and experiences is essential for social psychological research that holistically captures how people construct, understand, respond, position, and act over time within changing social, economic, and political contexts. To illustrate the utility of our proposition, we draw on classic social psychological studies and multimethod fieldwork during a period of rapid social and political change in Colombia during the peace process (2012-2017). We argue the MOVE framework has the potential to advance psychological understandings of, and contributions to, individuals embedded in real, dynamic social and political contexts. We discuss the implications of this extended social psychological paradigm for advancing psychological science.

AB  - Certain approaches to the meaning of utterances primarily characterize speakers' communicative intentions as the only source of meaning of a speaker's utterance. I show that a strict version of this position is difficult to maintain because the meaning of an utterance is partially due to the intentional attitudes of the audience to an utterance, including their reaction to the social identity of a speaker. This can result in a negotiation over meaning that can take place if the speaker and audience do not agree on the significance of the utterance. The view is motivated if one takes an ameliorative approach to meaning which acknowledges that theories of meaning are constrained by normative concerns related to meaning and communication.

AB  - Given the urgency of redressing South Africa's unjust legacies of the past, we interrogate the nature of support and opposition to restitution in South Africa. Informed by responses to the nationally representative South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS), we contend that South Africa remains deeply polarised when it comes to addressing these unjust legacies, with race being the major fault line. When it comes to restitution, South Africans are worlds apart on three levels. We are worlds apart across racial groups; we are worlds apart within racial groups, and we are worlds apart in the kind of language we wish to use in framing our pursuit of equality. In the final analysis, while South Africans may be unified in the acknowledgement that the inequality gap is too high, and perhaps even unified in a desire for change, there is a fundamental disagreement about the desirable vehicles we hope to employ.

AB  - Britain's unexpected vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) in June 2016 has proved divisive and damaging both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Across two correlational studies, the current research proposed a model to explain the Brexit vote, with attitudes to immigration and willingness to disagree (WD) as direct predictors of the referendum result, and internal (IMS) and external (EMS) motivation to respond without prejudice as indirect predictors. Study 1 (N = 353) and Study 2 (N = 363) both showed good fit with the model and, respectively, explained 48% and 46% of the referendum result. More positive attitudes to immigration predicted a vote to remain. Higher IMS and lower EMS predicted a vote to remain, fully mediated by attitudes to immigration. In Study 1, lower WD also predicted a vote to remain, both directly and indirectly via attitudes to immigration, although this was not replicated in Study 2. These results are discussed both in relation to the Brexit result, and the implications for motivation to respond without prejudice, WD, and political correctness more generally.

AB  - This study extends the current body of work on dehumanization by evaluating the social, psychological, and demographic correlates of blatant disregard for immigrants. Participants (n = 468) were randomly assigned to read a scenario where 1) an immigrant or 2) an immigrant and their child were caught illegally crossing the southern border of the United States, and then rated how long they should spend in jail if convicted. Participants reported that they would sentence the immigrant to more jail time than the immigrant and child. Those who sent immigrants to jail for more time also viewed them as socially distant and less human, described immigration in impersonal terms, and endorsed other social harms unrelated to immigration (e.g., the death penalty for convicted murderers). Crucially, endorsed social harms accounted for explained variance beyond simply holding conservative views. We position these data within the current literature on dehumanization theory and immigration issues.

AB  - Previous research has shown that the stereotypical characteristics of successful leaders are perceived to be congruent with the stereotypical masculine characteristics and incongruent with the characteristics stereotypically associated with women. The lack of congruency between stereotypical feminine characteristics and the stereotypical characteristics of a successful leader is considered to be one of the main causes of prejudice against women, who often face obstacles in achieving leadership positions. Drawing on the theoretical and empirical evidence, we conducted two online experimental studies to investigate the perceived effectiveness of gay leaders; these studies involved, respectively, 192 and 202 heterosexual US men. Specifically, in the first study, we hypothesized that participants with high levels of sexual prejudice would perceive leadership as less effective when the leader was gay rather than heterosexual, regardless of the gendered nature of the organization (masculine vs. feminine). In the second study, we tested the hypothesis that participants with high (vs. low) levels of sexual prejudice would perceive a gay leader who showed more stereotypical feminine characteristics to be less effective than a gay leader who showed more stereotypical masculine characteristics. Moderated regression analyses confirmed our expectations. Limitations, applied implications, and future directions are discussed.

AB  - In an adversarial collaboration, we examined associations among factors that could link ideological conflict-perceiving that members of a group do not share one's ideology-to prejudice and affiliation interest. We also examined whether these factors would possess similar ("symmetrical") or different ("asymmetrical") associative strength among liberals and conservatives. Across three samples (666 undergraduate students, 347 Mechanical Turk workers), ideological conflict was associated with perceived dissimilarity on political and nonpolitical topics, as well as negative emotions. Perceived political and nonpolitical dissimilarity were also associated with negative emotions, prejudice, and lower affiliative intentions among both liberals and conservatives. Importantly, however, perceived political dissimilarity was associated with negative emotions, prejudice, and lower affiliative intentions more strongly among liberals. Some inconsistent evidence also suggested that perceived nonpolitical dissimilarity was associated with prejudice and lower affiliative intentions more strongly among conservatives. These findings document nuance in relationships that could link ideological conflict to prejudice.

AB  - This study describes the process of developing and validating the Sexual Prejudice in Sport Scale (SPSS), which is a multidimensional instrument developed to assess attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (LG) in sports. The authors conducted two studies: first, to establish the factor structure of the SPSS on 297 heterosexual athletes; and, second, to test the reliability and validity of the resulting 19-item scale on a sample of 311 heterosexual and 160 LG athletes. Exploratory factor analysis of an initial item pool yielded three factors: open rejection, which assesses the blatant prejudice expressed toward LG people; denial of visibility, which evaluates attitude toward the coming out of LG people; and gendering performance, which corresponds to gender stereotypes about performance/skills of LG people. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the SPSS. The authors documented internal consistency, test-retest stability, and convergent/divergent validity. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Considerable research has shown that people generally hold more negative attitudes toward homosexuals. Given this fact, it is important to understand psychological and social correlates of homophobia. With this purpose, the present study investigates attachment styles, openness to experience, and social contact in relation to attitudes toward homosexuals. The findings show that being female, having prior contact with homosexuals, and scoring high in openness to experience predict more favorable attitudes toward homosexuals. The supplementary analyses also support the moderating effect of secure attachment on the relationship between openness to experience and attitudes toward homosexuals. The present study not only extends the related research by examining the interactive effects of attachment style and personality trait, but also provides important implications for researchers, educators, or managers in terms of reducing anti-homosexual attitudes in diverse settings.

AB  - Stigma is a social construct that discredits people based on attributes regarded as undesired by the wider community. Previous research has regarded drug use as the most stigmatized health condition in the world and found that ceasing this behavior does not necessarily entail the disappearance of the associated stigma. This article explores preferences of social distance from stigmatized groups among a group of students training to be health or criminal justice professionals by using a series of vignettes that measure willingness to interact with people who are currently active in or ceasing substance use and offending behaviors in a range of contexts. Findings reveal that offending behaviors are at least as stigmatized as drug use, as well as show that several behaviors can have more long-standing discrediting effects than others. These results have profound implications for community reintegration and call attention to differential power relations between stigmatized and nonstigmatized people. Moreover, this study uncovers that stigma comprises public and private masks and how these entail different effects related to majorities and minorities and gender, as well as implications for current students who will hold positions of power. This article also reveals and frames the positive effects of teaching in health and wellbeing on destigmatization of health-related conditions. Additionally, this research explores the influence of previous contact experiences with stigmatized groups, thereby suggesting specific mechanisms and levels of intervention.

AB  - Women, ethnic minority and LGB police officers often experience prejudice, disadvantage and exclusion within police forces because of their perceived 'otherness' in a predominantly white, heterosexual, male organisation. In the context of an increasingly diverse service, the paper argues that the concept of intersectionality is important in order to understand the experiences of police officers who encounter bias and prejudice because of their multiple, intersecting identities. Drawing on data from qualitative interviews with 20 individuals based in an English police force, the paper examines their occupational experiences of bias, discrimination and exclusion perpetrated by their colleagues and supervisors. Utilising the 'exit, voice and loyalty' model, the paper analyses how police officers are affected by, and respond to these experiences. Taken together, these arguments lay the foundation for future work to further understand the experiences of police officers as victims of bias and prejudice due to their multiple, intersecting identities.

AB  - Growing Muslim minorities in Western societies has sparked debate about which Muslim practices should be accepted, with many people finding certain practices intolerable. Two competing perspectives on this intolerance argue that it represents either principled objections or prejudice. Using four large samples from the Netherlands, we apply latent profile analysis and find four groups of people: two groups that like and dislike Muslims and their practices respectively, but also two groups who are intolerant of some or most Muslim practices without necessarily displaying prejudice. A person-centered analysis of key demographic and psychological variables suggests that the two intolerant groups differ with one group's intolerance motivated more by anti-Muslim feelings, while the second group's intolerance is motivated more by principled objections.

AB  - We review work from persuasion science relevant to reducing prejudiced attitudes. We begin by introducing the idea that the thoughts people generate - their number and valence - are critical for understanding when responding to persuasive attempts will result in egalitarian attitudes. A focus on thinking highlights the importance of understanding short and long-term attitude change in promoting diversity. How much people think is also consequential for spreading of initial change to more distal attitudes and generalization of change to other judgments. The second section describes a process of thought validation that emphasizes the importance of considering what people think and feel about their own thoughts. This meta-cognitive process is shown to make a difference in producing consequential changes in reducing prejudiced attitudes toward African Americans, immigrants, refugees, individuals with disabilities, and beyond. The conditions under which variables such as minority status and stigmatized sources affect elaboration and validation are also specified. The fourth section explores how these two processes are relevant for understanding explicit and implicit ambivalence and change in the domain of prejudiced attitudes. We highlight the utility of a process-oriented approach for designing future research and promoting more inclusive attitudes and actions.

AB  - Guided by intergroup contact theory, this study examined participants' communication with their most frequent contact with an invisible physical disability and their attitudes and stereotypes toward people with disabilities. Results indicated that participants' perceptions of communication frequency and quality with the contact and the contact's disclosure about disability all had a significant indirect effect on attitudes and stereotypes through social support and intergroup anxiety sequentially. Contact quality had significant negative direct and indirect effects on endorsement of stereotypes and a significant positive indirect effect on attitudes. Protective disclosure had a significant positive indirect effect on cognitive attitudes through social support.

AB  - Background: The study analyses the perception of risks of pandemic due COVID-19 by Roma people living in Roma settlement Zehra and their attitudes to quarantine, emergency actions and vaccination against influenza and their willingness to get vaccinated with the forthcoming vaccine against COVID-19.
   Methods: We used quantitative research to collect data at the time of first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in April-May 2020. The sample was consisted of 98 Roma people at the age of 25-60 years old and the data were analysed by descriptive statistics on the path of chi test p<0.05.
   Results: The wearing masks is considered and recommended as an effective protection against the spreading of COVID-19; there is significant corelation between internal motivation to wear masks and information about danger of coronavirus (p=0.032) and a government regulation (p=0.037) and state punishments if we refuse to wear the mask on the face in public places (0.028). The level of significance p= 0.048 (df 14, v=1.12) confirmed the relationship between the reasons for wearing protective masks and attitudes to emergency measures due COVID-19. To increase motivation of Roma people to follow rules, restrictions and the quarantine is not via financial penalties and threats, but it is important to increase health and information literacy and their trust in authorities.41.8% of the Roma people use masks due to a government regulation at the places where it is obligatory, not for personal reasons to protect themselves or others. There is significant correlation between poor motivation to wear masks, lack of information and misunderstandings of government restrictions (0.036) in the quarantine.Due to the quarantine Roma living in segregated settlements lost sources of income and economic activity (formal or informal), the rate of unemployment and poverty has been increased in these communities.The quarantine caused problems with e-learning at home (some of them do not have equipment or no ability to learn online due low education of parents and missing internet connection), social distance, increased cases of domestic violence, misunderstandings of restrictions, fear of social insecurity and deeper poverty.
   Conclusion: At the first wave of epidemic COVID-19 the most of Roma returned from countries (UK, Germany, France, Italy), they lost their jobs and faced negative prejudices from other Roma as "returners" to gained benefits from social and health care system. There should be interdisciplinary strategies to solve problems based on health care via public insurance, psychological support via crisis links, street work in communities via non-profit organisations and health and social support via Slovak Red Cross, help with distance education by community centres near Roma settlements, supports rights and living conditions by The Slovak National Centre for Human Rights and municipalities preparing a framework of initiatives financed through the reallocation of resources to eliminate consequences of COVID-19.

AB  - Body weight is a critical dimension by which we evaluate others, with heavier individuals facing higher levels of stigma and discrimination compared to thinner individuals. Yet, the perception of body weight can be ambiguous, suggesting that stereotypic associations and heuristics influence which bodies are deemed as "typical" for a particular group or social category. Here, we investigate whether interdependent associations between body weight and social category dimensions (ethnicity, gender, age, and sex) affect the typicality ratings of a heavier body. Specifically, we hypothesize that heavier bodies labelled as Asian, feminine, younger, or female, compared to Black, White, masculine, older, or male, will be rated less typical and these typicality judgments will mediate social evaluations. Participants made typicality and social evaluative judgments about a wireframe body with a set BMI of 38, accompanied by one of sixteen category labels (e.g., Asian man). Our results show that typicality judgments broadly align with our hypotheses and mediate social evaluations of the heavier body. Overall, we showcase the interdependent nature of weight and other social categories, highlighting the role of typicality for social evaluations of heavier targets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The presence of international students on campus does not necessarily lead to meaningful interactions between domestic and international students; findings in the literature reveal that Southeast Asian students are frequently targeted by prejudice and discrimination in the context of Korean higher education. This study aims to better reveal the dynamics behind such discrimination by examining the experiences of Southeast Asian students at a case study university in Korea. Focusing on science and engineering graduate schools due to their unique context, the study triangulates the perspectives of Southeast Asian students, Korean students, and professors. It attempts to understand the interactions among these different actors as well as the various factors shaping their responses. Based on Allport's Contact Theory, findings reveal that individual, interpersonal, institutional, and environmental factors seem to prevent positive contact among Korean and Southeast Asian students within a lab, thus leading to the latter's academic and social marginalization. This portends that addressing the current gap between policy rhetoric and reality will be crucial in overcoming identified obstacles to meaningful intergroup interaction on campus.

KW  - Epistemic injustice
KW  - testimonial injustice
KW  - speaking for
KW  - silencing
KW  - prejudice
AB  - In this paper, I will characterize a phenomenon I call 'self-appointed speaking-for', and show how it constitutes a counter-example to Miranda Fricker's definition of testimonial injustice (TI), expanding our understanding of the category. Self-appointed speaking-for occurs when one speaks on behalf of or in place of another individual or group without their authorization. It is the sort of phenomenon that occasions complaints like, 'You put words in my mouth'; that happens when someone else answers a question directed at you; or when someone purports to represent the perspective of a group they are not affiliated with or entitled to represent. I argue that this is a central case of Fricker's testimonial injustice, on the grounds that it inflicts the same harms as other kinds of TI - particularly demeaning someone in their capacity as a giver of knowledge - in a way that is both epistemically and ethically culpable. TI is wrong not only for the harms it generates but also because its cause - prejudice - is ethically wrong and bad epistemic practice. As I show, self-appointed speaking-for is wrong for the same reasons as prejudice is, no matter what motivates it.

AB  - Objectives A recently growing literature explored the effect of mindfulness on the reduction of stereotypes and prejudice. However, studies exploring the relationship between dispositional mindfulness and prejudice are very limited and contradictory. The current work focused on the associations of dispositional mindfulness with internalized sexual stigma and sexual prejudice in gay/bisexual men and heterosexual men, respectively. Methods Participants were 180 Italian men, both heterosexual (N = 91, 50.6%) and gay/bisexual (N = 89, 49.4%), ranging between 18 and 40 years old (M=28.23, SD = 5.59) that completed a questionnaire which contained demographic information and measures of mindfulness, need for cognitive closure, and adherence to traditional and stereotypical gender roles. In order to test the predictive power of mindfulness' dimensions on internalized sexual stigma and on sexual prejudice over and above the other predictors, we used dominance analysis. Results Analyses revealed that only the FFMQ-Nonjudging of inner experience explained a proportion of variance of internalized sexual stigma significantly larger than zero, whereas the variance of the score on the sexual prejudice was mostly accounted for by right-wing political orientation and FFMQ-Observing. Conclusions Having a mindful nonjudging attitude toward one's inner experience would associate to less internalized sexual stigma in gay and bisexual men, whereas having a mindful observing disposition would help heterosexual men to have less sexual prejudice against gay men. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Many diversity and social justice-related training workshops are conducted on college campuses, in workplaces, and with community organizations each year, yet psychological practitioners and trainers have very little evidence for making decisions about the effectiveness of these trainings. It remains unclear, for instance, whether group specific interventions are necessary or whether general values clarification interventions generalize to specific marginalized groups. The current study used a quasi-experimental design to evaluate one general values clarification intervention and two group-specific interventions (focusing on lesbians and gay men). The interventions were conducted with three sorority and three fraternity groups on a college campus in the United States. The findings in this study suggest that a general values clarification intervention did not significantly increase group-specific positive social justice-related attitudes toward lesbians and gay men or more general social justice attitudes and advocacy. Findings also suggest that specific interventions focused on lesbians and gay men may be effective in facilitating group-specific positive social justice-related attitudes and behaviors. Both group-specific interventions were effective in increasing group specific positive attitudes while the general intervention was not. Men and women in the study responded to interventions differently, and men might need targeted interventions to create meaningful attitudinal and behavioral change. Findings are situated in a discussion of enhancing efforts to cultivate social justice on college campuses and in the general population.

AB  - Previous studies have not examined whether (personal) political ideology influences how trusters perceive of immigrants and refugees as a threat. Our contribution to the literature builds on theories of motivated reasoning and hypothesizes that political ideology weakens the ability of social trust to reduce perceived (ethnic) outgroup threat. Indeed, analyses show that the relationship between social trust and perceived outgroup threat is considerably weaker among rightists than among leftists. Although social trust does relate negatively to perceived outgroup threat across the ideological divide, political ideology has a constraining influence that cannot be ignored. Social trust is also a political phenomenon. We apply a fixed-effects regression, and analyses are based on the 2014-European Social Survey, including 21 countries and 32,175 individuals. In the concluding section, we discuss the full implications of our findings for theories of social trust in an era of increasing flows of immigrants and refugees that go beyond the usual gateway nations.

AB  - When Whites believe prejudice cannot change, they often adopt a behavioral style that is intended to reduce the possibility that they are seen as racist (i.e., performance-oriented behaviors). The present research tests the possibility that these performance-oriented behaviors may be interpreted, ironically, as racist. Across two studies, Black participants viewed performance-oriented behaviors as indicating racial prejudice. Additionally, when Black participants were led to believe that Whites' racial prejudice could not change, they perceived Whites as more prejudiced. This research highlights a potential source of misunderstanding in interracial interactions and offers implications for improving interracial interactions from target and perpetrator perspectives.

AB  - Recent discourse has emphasized the legal causes of racial segregation in the development of cities such as St. Louis, Missouri. Before and alongside these laws were a long history of community prejudicial beliefs, many of which have outlived the laws they produced. Prejudice propelled de facto community decisions made during the development of St. Louis, and later solidified into de jure practices of racial segregation, which ultimately shaped the metropolitan area. De facto and de jure processes of segregation and urban planning also shaped the experiences of black families in St. Louis, especially those living in ethnic enclaves or ghettos. This history of St. Louis provides evidence of the profound racial prejudice within its community, existing parallel to, and beyond laws enforcing racial segregation. This intense community prejudice ultimately formed the context of the race riots in the St. Louis surrounding municipality of Ferguson in 2014.

AB  - This paper articulates lessons learned about without-prejudice teaching and learning from a researcher-practitioner who has experience in both developing and developed contexts. Developing countries often look to Western countries for education standards, but Western countries rarely look to developing contexts where theory is being generated about divisions and access to education. This comparative study integrates lessons learned from both contexts. It uses an auto-ethnographic methodology and draws upon phenomenographic research and critical theory. The need for emic (insider) without-prejudice teaching and learning practices is articulated in three lessons: 1. culture privileges for or prejudices against students' access to education; 2. beliefs systems allow or deny access to learning opportunities and environments; and 3. student-teacher relationship can interrupt prejudice.

AB  - Background: Much has been done regarding the promotion of equality in rights in terms of legislation, but persons with disabilities remain marginalised in society. Negative attitudes and prejudice contribute towards numerous challenges for persons with disabilities.
   Objectives: This study investigated the level of empathy and prejudice of students towards persons with disabilities, and the effect of the use of a serious game to enhance empathy and reduce prejudice.
   Method: A randomised controlled experiment with pre-test, post-test and follow-up test was used. Availability sample (N = 83) of psychology university students (22% males; 78% females) was divided into an experimental group that played the serious game The World of Elva and two control groups. The first control group received texts on case studies and information on reacting in a sensitive and responsive way, and the second control group received no intervention.
   Results: Participants have average levels of empathy (score: 32 to 52) and strong prejudice (score: 0.08 to -0.87) towards persons with disabilities. The intervention results in a slight short-term effect for prejudice and sub-scale measurements of empathy. A slight improvement was noted in participants' ability to transpose themselves imaginatively into the experience of disabled characters.
   Conclusion: The findings contribute to the understanding of empathy as a dynamic component that can be positively influenced by, for example, a serious game. These results have teaching implications on the facilitation of empathy. The short-term effect on empathy and prejudice towards persons with disabilities may contribute to bridge the inequality experienced by persons with disabilities.

AB  - Current literature on the economic determinants of prejudice focuses on how relative deprivation might lead to bias by focusing on group perceptions, with little or no attention given to individual-level deprivation. We address this gap in literature by examining how relative and objective individual-level hardship affects generalised prejudice and suggest that both forms of deprivation lead to increase in a wide variety of out-group biases. We test our hypotheses with data from an original cross-national survey conducted in 2015 in nine European countries (N approximate to 18,000) by applying multilevel models. We include macro-level measures of economic context, including measures of unemployment levels and GDP growth. We make a novel contribution to the growing literature on prejudice in European societies: our results are surprising and suggest that individuals experiencing deteriorating living standards are less likely to express generalised prejudice. We suggest that these findings can be explained using political psychology literature: recent studies suggest that low self-esteem increases altruistic behaviour and reduces the level of out-group bias. These findings open new avenues of research and suggest a new way of theorising the relationship between economic deprivation and prejudice.

AB  - To date, the effect of intercultural contact on racial prejudice toward the out-group has been, for the most part, examined and studied by way of face-to-face encounters but the effect has seldom been investigated in a computer-mediated interaction. The objective of this research, therefore, is to look into the effect of intercultural contact on the level of prejudice among intercultural partners in both face-to-face and computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment from the perspective of the Intergroup Contact Theory. One hundred participants were involved in the time series experiment and they were randomly assigned to intra-cultural versus intercultural conditions in the two-channel conditions namely faceto-face and CMC. Participants were required to interact in pairs with their 'zero history' partners. Parallel to the premise of the theory, for the face-to-face group, the overall level of prejudice among the intercultural communicative partners was significantly lower as compared to those in the intra-cultural group. However, the effect of intercultural contact in the CMC group failed to yield significant findings despite the decreasing trend of the level of prejudice over the four-week period among the intercultural partners. The study provides greater insight into the issue of intercultural integration in Malaysia. With much intercultural interaction and collaboration conducted online nowadays, the study provides preliminary evidences on its effectiveness in reducing perceptual prejudice.

AB  - Recent research highlights the importance of considering how values, ideologies and worldviews inform attitudes on the environment and climate change. Although social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) have been linked to environmentalism, the nature and extent of these relationships is unclear. We meta-analyse correlations between SDO, RWA and six indices of environmentalism from 53 independent samples identified from database searches and contact with researchers in the field. We show that SDO and RWA have comparable associations with environmentalism, regardless of how this is measured. We re analyse data from 16 independent samples using regression to assess the unique relationships, finding that both ideologies independently predict environmentalism. For SDO, we show that the effect size depends on the sample type, with a weaker association in student samples than in the general population. These results highlight the role of ideological attitudes as a barrier to belief and action on environmental issues.

The Social Distance Scale of Bogardus was employed to prepare the questionnaires that were used in the study. Domestic tourists (n = 400) visiting the Southeastern Anatolia Region (before and after their visit) and people who had not visited the region (n = 263) before were asked to complete the questionnaire. The tourists' social distance towards the local people has changed positively.

Results of pre-, post-, and follow-up surveys show significant improvements in knowledge and attitude; correlations between post-project knowledge, attitude, and interest in continued contact; and correlations between interest in continued contact and actual contact in the follow up. The majority of the participants evaluated the project as effective for friendship formation. Of the follow-up respondents, 23% developed friendships with their former buddies. The project serves as an example for assignments with the potential for friendship development, which is essential for optimal intergroup contact.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between traditional machismo and prejudice toward lesbian and gay individuals as mediated by contact in a Latino college sample. Gender was examined as a potential moderator. Undergraduate students from a public university in South Texas (128 males and 447 females; mean age=22.1. SD=4.75) completed online measures of prejudice toward lesbian and gay individuals, machismo, and contact experience with lesbian and gay individuals. Contact significantly mediated the relationship between machismo and anti-gay prejudice, yet this indirect effect was relatively small. Significant direct and indirect effects of machismo on prejudiced attitudes toward lesbian and gay individuals were found. Gender did not moderate the relationship between machismo and contact. Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce Latinos' prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women should take cultural views toward gender roles into consideration. Increased positive contact experience with lesbian and gay individuals may be a possible avenue to decrease anti-gay prejudice that stems from heightened traditional machismo.

AB  - Online poker has become a multibillion dollar industry, with millions of people from around the world both playing and watching online poker each year. Unlike live poker, players and watchers, typically cannot rely on physical cues of other players; in fact, the only information often available to poker players is others' nationality. Because these poker games often involve members of different national groups, it constitutes a context of indirect contact that has considerable potential to examine how attitudes and beliefs about people from other nationalities can be influenced by interactions in online poker. In the current research, we examined how observing an in-group player have positive or negative contact with a player of another nationality impacted one's own attitudes and beliefs about the out-group nation. Participants (N=157) watched an online poker video recording of a fellow in-group member have negative, positive, or no intergroup contact with an out-group member at an online poker table. Subsequent affective (out-group attitudes) and cognitive (perceived out-group variability) measures of intergroup bias were taken. Data revealed that while observing negative contact increased out-group prejudice, observing positive contact reduced prejudice (all relative to no intergroup contact). However, no differences were found in perceived out-group variability. Implications for online poker and future research intergroup contact are discussed.

AB  - Self-reported level of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), the two facets of social dominance orientation (SDO-Dominance and SDO-Egalitarianism) and pro-torture attitudes were measured both in the immediate aftermath (terror salience, N = 152) of the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels and when terrorism was not salient (non-salience, N = 140). Results showed that RWA and pro-torture attitudes, but not SDO-Dominance and SDO-Egalitarianism, were significantly higher immediately after. Furthermore, RWA and SDO both predicted pro-torture attitudes more strongly under terror salience. We argue that the reason why RWA is higher under terror salience is a response to external threat, and that SDO-Dominance may be more clearly related to acceptance of torture and other human-rights violations, across context. Future research on the effects of terror-related events on sociopolitical and pro-torture attitudes should focus on person-situation interactions and also attempt to discriminate between trait and state aspects of authoritarianism.

AB  - Background: Although there is a substantial body of research on the stigma associated with mental illness, much of the extant research has not explicitly focused on the concept of prejudice, which drives discriminatory behaviour. Further, research that has investigated prejudice towards people with mental illness has conceptual, theoretical and psychometric limitations. To address these shortcomings, we sought to develop a new measure, the Prejudice towards People with Mental Illness (PPMI) scale, based on an improved conceptualisation and integration of the stigma and prejudice areas of research.
   Methods: In developing the new scale, we undertook a thematic analysis of existing conceptualisations and measures to identify a pool of potential items for the scale which were subsequently assessed for fidelity and content validity by expert raters. We tested the structure, reliability, and validity of the scale across three studies (Study 1 N = 301; Study 2 N = 164; Study 3 N = 495) using exploratory factor, confirmatory factor, correlational, multiple regression, and ordinal logistic regression analyses using both select and general community samples.
   Results: Study 1 identified four factors underlying prejudice towards people with mental illness: fear/avoidance, malevolence, authoritarianism, and unpredictability. It also confirmed the nomological network, that is, the links of these attitudes with the proposed theoretical antecedents and consequences. Studies 2 and 3 further supported the factor structure of the measure, and provided additional evidence for the nomological network.
   Conclusions: We argue that research into prejudice towards people with mental illness will benefit from the new measure and theoretical framework.

AB  - Strong identification with the male gender group, or gender self-esteem, predicts trans prejudice in heterosexual men. Less is known about whether gender self-esteem predicts gay and bisexual men's attitudes toward trans people. Cisgender gay (n = 88), bisexual (n = 74), and heterosexual (n = 98) men completed measures of trans prejudice and gender self-esteem, as well as beliefs that transgenderism is a psychological disorder and that people are born transgender. The lowest levels of trans prejudice, the least agreement that transgenderism is a psychological disorder, and the most agreement that people are born transgender were reported by gay men, followed by bisexual men, then heterosexual men. Reported levels of teasing were higher for trans women than trans men regardless of men's sexual orientation. Higher levels of trans prejudice correlated with greater agreement that transgenderism is a psychological disorder and less agreement that people are born transgender for all 3 groups of men. Finally, higher levels of gender self-esteem predicted higher levels of trans prejudice for bisexual and heterosexual men, but not gay men. Future research could further examine factors that underlie gay and bisexual men's trans prejudice, such as strength of identification with one's sexual orientation and attitudes toward masculinity and femininity.

AB  - The implicit association test (IAT) and concept of implicit bias have significantly influenced the scientific, institutional, and public discourse on racial prejudice. In spite of this, there has been little investigation of how ordinary people make sense of the IAT and the bias it claims to measure. This article examines the public understanding of this research through a discourse analysis of reactions to the IAT and implicit bias in the news media. It demonstrates the ways in which readers interpreted, related to, and negotiated the claims of IAT science in relation to socially shared and historically embedded concerns and identities. IAT science was discredited in accounts that evoked discourses about the marginality of academic preoccupations, and helped to position test-takers as targets of an oppressive political correctness and psychologists as liberally biased. Alternatively, the IAT was understood to have revealed widely and deeply held biases towards racialized others, eliciting accounts that took the form of psychomoral confessionals. Such admissions of bias helped to constitute moral identities for readers that were firmly positioned against racial bias. Our findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the IAT in prejudice reduction interventions, and communicating to the public about implicit bias.

AB  - Many areas of social psychological research investigate how social information may bias judgment. However, most measures of social judgment biases are (1) low in reliability because they use a single response, (2) not indicative of individual differences in bias because they use between-subjects designs, (3) inflexible because they are designed for a particular domain, and (4) ambiguous about magnitude of bias because there is no objectively correct answer. We developed a measure of social judgment bias, the Judgment Bias Task, in which participants judge profiles varying in quality for a certain outcome based on objective criteria. The presence of ostensibly irrelevant social information provides opportunity to assess the extent to which social biases undermine the use of objective criteria in judgment. The JBT facilitates measurement of social judgment biases by (1) using multiple responses, (2) indicating individual differences by using within-subject designs, (3) being adaptable for assessing a variety of judgments, (4) identifying an objective magnitude of bias, and (5) taking 6 min to complete on average. In nine pre-registered studies (N > 9000) we use the JBT to reveal two prominent social judgment biases: favoritism towards more physically attractive people and towards members of one's ingroup. We observe that the JBT can reveal social biases, and that these sometimes occur even when the participant did not intend or believe they showed biased judgment. A flexible, objective, efficient assessment of social judgment biases will accelerate theoretical and empirical progress.

AB  - Collective historical trauma underlies much of the social conflict in the world today. This article places the processes of collective trauma at the center of both conflict analysis and transformation. As a collaborative analysis between a clinical psychologist and a peace and conflict studies scholar-practitioner, the authors open a trans-disciplinary research agenda on trauma as a collective disease and underaddressed root cause of protracted social conflict. Applying the Strategies for Trauma Awareness and Resilience (STAR) Model, an innovative model developed by Eastern Mennonite University and Church World Service following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the authors explore collective trauma as a cyclical process and use two case studies involving interactions between officers of the state and citizens from marginalized communities in Palestine-Israel and the United States. The authors aim to bring to the fore of their respective disciplines a critical discussion of the social dynamics, societal costs, and potential solidarities of privileging collective trauma.

AB  - We develop a model in which some employers hold unobservable racial prejudice towards black workers. Workers, however, observe a signal of prejudice status the presence of a black supervisor. Jobs in firms with black supervisors hold higher option value for black workers, because they are less likely to face prejudice-based termination. Hence, black workers are willing to accept employment with lower expected match quality from firms with black supervisors. We derive predictions on differences in wages and job stability across supervisor race and prejudice levels and find empirical support for them using unique longitudinal data on workers' supervisors and state-level measures of prejudice.

AB  - Prior research (Stepanova, Bartholow, Saults, & Friedman, 2012) indicates that exposure to alcohol-related cues increases expressions of racial biases. This study investigated whether such effects can be replicated with other tasks assessing racial bias and whether they stem from stereotyping or prejudice. In two experiments participants (N-1 = 118; N-2 = 152) were exposed to either alcohol-related or neutral advertisements, and then completed a race-priming lexical decision task (LDT, Wittenbrink, Judd, and Park, 1997). Experiment 1 provided weak evidence that exposure to alcohol cues decreases positive attitudes toward Blacks, which was not confirmed in a high-powered replication (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest a short-lived nature (if any) of alcohol priming effects on racial bias when measured by the primed LDT.

AB  - Superior cognitive abilities are generally associated with positive outcomes such as academic achievement and social mobility. Here, we explore the darker side of cognitive ability, highlighting robust links between pattern detection and stereotyping. Across 6 studies, we find that superior pattern detectors efficiently learn and use stereotypes about social groups. This pattern holds across explicit (Studies 1 and 2), implicit (Studies 2 and 4), and behavioral measures of stereotyping (Study 3). We also find that superior pattern detectors readily update their stereotypes when confronted with new information (Study 5), making them particularly susceptible to counterstereotype training (Study 6). Pattern detection skills therefore equip people to act as naive empiricists who calibrate their stereotypes to match incoming information. These findings highlight novel effects of individual aptitudes on social-cognitive processes.

AB  - The article discusses one of the most compelling policy issues facing liberal democracies in Europe: What policy tools can be used to promote social cohesion in a pluralist multi-ethnic society with different moral and religious and ethical values, and cultural and linguistic traditions? We focus on the role that citizenship education has taken since the early 2000s in light of the integration of immigrant children in schools in the Netherlands and England. Citizenship education is designed to integrate immigrant groups socially, foster their loyalty to the state and encourage them to become engaged in democratic politics. Our empirical analysis advances our understanding of the policy ramifications of a new turn in integration policies directed towards stronger civic integration through sharing common values and moral standards.

AB  - Research on intergroup contact has mostly viewed desegregation as a necessary condition for contact to unfold its power to reduce prejudice. Through residential and school choices, however, prejudice also contributes to segregation. To shed light on this bidirectional link, we conducted two survey-based experiments with stratified quota samples of German adults. In Study 1, respondents with less contact and more prejudice indicated a lower likelihood of renting an apartment in a neighborhood with a larger proportion of minority members, although housing quality and crime rate were held constant. In Study 2, similar results were obtained for the likelihood of enrolling their child at a school with a larger proportion of minority students. Building on these results in a computer simulation, we find that because contact only reduces prejudice, but does not produce pro-minority preferences, spontaneous desegregation is unlikely to occur even under the most favorable structural and economic conditions.

Participantswere asked to rate quarterbacks based on stereotypes identified in previous literature and then were asked to rate the credibility of stereotype-consistent or inconsistent messages. The study found that participants stereotyped both races, but Black participants actually stereotyped more strongly. Only messages concerning stereotype-consistent descriptors of White quarterbacks were rated as more credible. These results are interpreted based on social identity theory.

AB  - The displaced children of Europe, who live in and through landscapes and in temporary accommodationstheir bare worlds of life stuffed into rucksacksare our constant companions, their movement and immobility paraded as a geopolitical inconvenience and security threat to governments and officials even before they embark on treacherous Mediterranean sea and land crossings to hoped-for asylum in Europe. Gigliotti examines the humanitarian ambitions and changing narrative authority in the coverage of displaced children in the photography of David Chim' Seymour, notably from his UNICEF/UNESCO-commissioned tour of Europe in the summer of 1948 and, briefly, in UNICEF's online platform, Refugees in Europe: Then and Now'. She outlines the post-war historical context of internationalism and humanitarian engagement with the visual to advocate for displaced children's rights to place, home and belonging, and concludes with an analysis of the representation of the post-war refugee and displaced person as a memory emissary in today's refugee crises.

AB  - Prejudice motivated crime (PMC) is defined as crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred towards members of particular groups, communities and individuals. To understand how police awareness training facilitates or constrains the capacity of police officers to appropriately classify and respond to PMC, data were collected from a population of Police Recruits (PRs) and Protective Service Officers (PSOs) (N=1609) to ascertain their perceptions of PMC pre- and post-PMC awareness training. These were used in a logistic regression model to identify factors explaining whether PRs and PSOs would identify a vignette/scenario as a PMC. We found PRs and PSOs were more likely to correctly identify a PMC scenario than a control scenario, but only 61% as likely to identify an incident as PMC post-PMC awareness training after accounting for other variables. We argue that awareness training programmes need to be more aligned to the specific needs of policing in diverse societies.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship among internal factors (mental health concerns) that affect relationship satisfaction and contextual factors (social support) that affect relationship satisfaction in female same-sex couples (N = 99). Correlation and regression analyses indicated significant relationships among the variables. Specifically, mental health concerns were negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction whereas social support was positively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Mental health concerns and social support were found to be significant predictors of relationship satisfaction. Implications for practitioners are provided.

AB  - This study examined the interplay of anti-immigrant prejudice and intergroup contact experience on voting intentions within Britain's 2016 referendum on its membership in the European Union. In the days before the referendum, we asked more than 400 British people how they planned to vote. We measured a number of demographic factors expected to predict voting intentions as well as individuals' prejudice towards and intergroup contact experience (positive and negative) with EU immigrants. Anti-immigrant prejudice was a strong correlate of support for Brexit. Negative intergroup contact experience was associated with higher anti-immigrant prejudice and, in turn, increased support for Leave'. Positive intergroup contact, on the other hand, seemed to play a reparative role, predicting lower prejudice and increasing support for Remain'.

AB  - We tested a mediated moderation model with the interaction of students' degree of religiosity and perception of the university environment as accepting of one's religion predicting satisfaction with the university mediated by positive social relations. When the university was perceived as accepting of one's religion (vs less accepting), greater religiosity predicted more positive relations with other students and greater university satisfaction. The model was supported with social interactions mediating the relationship between the interaction of religiosity and perceived environment and satisfaction with one's university experience.

AB  - Implicit and explicit bias among providers can influence the quality of healthcare. Efforts to address sexual orientation bias in new physicians are hampered by a lack of knowledge of school factors that influence bias among students.
   To determine whether medical school curriculum, role modeling, diversity climate, and contact with sexual minorities predict bias among graduating students against gay and lesbian people.
   Prospective cohort study.
   A sample of 4732 first-year medical students was recruited from a stratified random sample of 49 US medical schools in the fall of 2010 (81% response; 55% of eligible), of which 94.5% (4473) identified as heterosexual. Seventy-eight percent of baseline respondents (3492) completed a follow-up survey in their final semester (spring 2014).
   Medical school predictors included formal curriculum, role modeling, diversity climate, and contact with sexual minorities. Outcomes were year 4 implicit and explicit bias against gay men and lesbian women, adjusted for bias at year 1.
   In multivariate models, lower explicit bias against gay men and lesbian women was associated with more favorable contact with LGBT faculty, residents, students, and patients, and perceived skill and preparedness for providing care to LGBT patients. Greater explicit bias against lesbian women was associated with discrimination reported by sexual minority students (b = 1.43 [0.16, 2.71]; p = 0.03). Lower implicit sexual orientation bias was associated with more frequent contact with LGBT faculty, residents, students, and patients (b = -0.04 [-0.07, -0.01); p = 0.008). Greater implicit bias was associated with more faculty role modeling of discriminatory behavior (b = 0.34 [0.11, 0.57); p = 0.004).
   Medical schools may reduce bias against sexual minority patients by reducing negative role modeling, improving the diversity climate, and improving student preparedness to care for this population.

AB  - The prejudice habit-breaking intervention (Devine, Forscher, Austin, & Cox, 2012) and its offshoots (e.g., Carnes et al., 2015) have shown promise in effecting long-term change in key outcomes related to intergroup bias, including increases in awareness, concern about discrimination, and, in one study, long-term decreases in implicit bias. This intervention is based on the premise that unintentional bias is like a habit that can be broken with sufficient motivation, awareness, and effort. We conducted replication of the original habit-breaking intervention experiment in a sample more than three times the size of the original (N = 292). We also measured all outcomes every other day for 14 days and measured potential mechanisms for the intervention's effects. Consistent with previous results, the habit-breaking intervention produced a change in concern that endured two weeks post-intervention. These effects were associated with increased sensitivity to the biases of others and an increased tendency to label biases as wrong. Contrasting with the original work, both control and intervention participants decreased in implicit bias, and the effects of the habit-breaking intervention on awareness declined in the second week of the study. In a subsample recruited two years later, intervention participants were more likely than control participants to object on a public online forum to an essay endorsing racial stereotyping. Our results suggest that the habit-breaking intervention produces enduring changes in peoples' knowledge of and beliefs about race-related issues, and we argue that these changes are even more important for promoting long-term behavioral change than are changes in implicit bias.

AB  - Low levels of civic engagement and social trust in post-communist countries constitute an important limitation to national economic growth and the well-being of inhabitants. In the current paper we propose that discovering local history should result in greater place attachment which constitutes a viable strategy for stimulating indicators of social capital. Specifically, we tested the influence of teaching local history on the development of interest in history, place attachment, and civic engagement. Two intervention studies (N-1 = 486; N-2 = 1098) confirmed that young people who learned about local history displayed increased interest in that history, greater place attachment, civic engagement intentions, and generalized social trust. We also demonstrate the relevance of place attachment as a link between greater interest in local history and increased civic engagement. The importance of stimulating youth civic engagement and generalized social trust are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A major shortcoming of current models of ideological prejudice is that although they can anticipate the direction of the association between participants' ideology and their prejudice against a range of target groups, they cannot predict the size of this association. I developed and tested models that can make specific size predictions for this association. A quantitative model that used the perceived ideology of the target group as the primary predictor of the ideology-prejudice relationship was developed with a representative sample of Americans (N = 4,940) and tested against models using the perceived status of and choice to belong to the target group as predictors. In four studies (total N = 2,093), ideology-prejudice associations were estimated, and these observed estimates were compared with the models' predictions. The model that was based only on perceived ideology was the most parsimonious with the smallest errors.

AB  - We assessed whether people express more prejudice and discrimination toward mixed-weight couples (i.e., romantic partners with dissimilar body mass indexes [BMIs]) than matched-weight couples. In Study 1, people rated mixed-weight couples less favorably than matched-weight couples. In Study 2, people acted as matchmakers; they chose to pair potential relationship partners on the basis of similar BMI and body size. Mixed-weight couples were perceived as poorer matches than matched-weight couples. In Study 3, people offered advice to a person dating a mixed-weight or matched-weight partner. Men and women dating a mixed-weight, rather than matched-weight, partner were advised to go on less active, public, and expensive dates, display less physical affection, and delay introductions to close others. In Study 4, perceived relational inequity, prejudice toward mixed-status relationships, in general, and system justification motives moderated mixed-weight prejudice. Implications for couples are discussed.

AB  - Part of the goal of the International Paralympic Committee is to "touch the heart of all people for a more equitable society" by exposing people to adaptive sports, with the goal of improving public views toward people with disabilities. The authors hypothesized that exposure to parasocial contact with images of athletes with disabilities could lead to a change in attitude during the formation of social identity, disrupting the tendency to view the population of individuals with physical disabilities as "other." This case study found that viewing a documentary of a Paralympic sprinter produced in the same style as an Olympic feature appeared to affect the emotional components of attitude formation, especially when compared with respondents who viewed a comparable documentary about an able-bodied athlete. These findings are of interest to proponents of adaptive sports, producers of adaptive-sports media, and marketers who use athletes with disabilities in advertising campaigns.

AB  - Whether and how societal structures shape individual psychology is a foundational question of the social sciences. Combining insights from evolutionary biology, economy, and the political and psychological sciences, we identify a central psychological process that functions to sustain group-based hierarchies in human societies. In study 1, we demonstrate that macrolevel structural inequality, impaired population outcomes, socio-political instability, and the risk of violence are reflected in the endorsement of group hegemony at the aggregate population level across 27 countries (n = 41,824): The greater the national inequality, the greater is the endorsement of between-group hierarchy within the population. Using multilevel analyses in study 2, we demonstrate that these psychological group-dominance motives mediate the effects of macrolevel functioning on individual-level attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, across 30 US states (n = 4,613), macrolevel inequality and violence were associated with greater individual-level support of group hegemony. Crucially, this individual-level support, rather than cultural-societal norms, was in turn uniquely associated with greater racism, sexism, welfare opposition, and even willingness to enforce group hegemony violently by participating in ethnic persecution of subordinate out-groups. These findings suggest that societal inequality is reflected in people's minds as dominance motives that underpin ideologies and actions that ultimately sustain group-based hierarchy.

AB  - In this paper, the relationship between territorial sense of community (SoC), perceived ethnic heterogeneity within the community and ethnic prejudice was analyzed. Specifically, the moderating role of perceived ethnic heterogeneity within the community on the SoC-prejudice relationship was tested in a sample of residents (N=603) of the Salento region, Italy. Results showed that the relationship between SoC and prejudice was moderated by perceived contextual heterogeneity. For blatant and subtle prejudice, when perceived ethnic heterogeneity was low, SoC was negatively associated with prejudice. In the case of modern prejudice, SoC was positively associated with prejudice when perceived ethnic heterogeneity was high. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Black mothers are 60 percent more likely than white mothers to have preterm births and twice as likely to have a baby with low birth weight. We examine whether these black-white gaps in birth outcomes are larger in counties with higher levels of racial prejudice.
   Method: We use data from the restricted-use natality files in the United States, which provide information on birth weight, gestation, and maternal characteristics for over 31 million births from 2002 to 2012, combined with county-level data measures of both explicit and implicit racial prejudice from Project Implicit from over a million individuals who took the Implicit Association Test during this same period. We compare counties that are one standard deviation above the mean (high prejudice) with those that are one standard deviation below the mean (low prejudice) in terms of their average level of racial prejudice.
   Results: The black-white gap in low birth weight is 14 percent larger in counties with high implicit racial prejudice compared to counties with low prejudice. The black-white gap in preterm births is 29 percent larger in the high prejudice counties. The gaps are even larger when we use explicit measures of racial prejudice with high prejudice counties having a black-white gap that is 22 percent larger for low birth weight and 36 percent larger for preterm births. These relationships do not appear to be biased by the way the prejudice sample is constructed, since the racial gap in birth outcomes is unrelated to other county-level biases such as those based on gender or sexual orientation.
   Conclusion: The black-white gap in United States' birth outcomes is larger in those counties that have the highest levels of racial prejudice. This is true for both implicit and explicit racial prejudice, though the strength of the relationship is strongest for explicit racial prejudice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individual differences in the preference for group-based hierarchy and inequality, as indexed by social dominance orientation (SDO), have been shown to predict environment-relevant variables. To date the.literature examining the SDO-environmentalism link has used the traditional unidimensional conceptualisation of SDO. This article reports three studies using the new measurement and conceptualisation of SDO that involves the SDO7 scale and the sub-dimensions of intergroup dominance (SDO-D) and intergroup anti-egalitarianism (SDO-E). SDO-D entails support for group-based dominance achieved via overt oppression and aggressive intergroup behaviour, and SDO-E entails support for group-based inequality subtly achieved via unequal distribution of resources. Our results show anti-egalitarianism to be the main SDO sub-dimension related to environmentalism. While SDO-D is either a weaker or non-significant predictor, individuals with high levels of SDO-E were less willing to make personal sacrifices for the environment, value environmental protection and endorse climate change beliefs. Interestingly, neither facet of SDO predicted change in environmentalism over a five-month period; but climate change denial predicted change in SDO-E while pro-environmental attitudes predicted change in SDO-D over time.

AB  - Debates about the meaning of Southern symbols such as the Confederate battle emblem are sweeping the nation. These debates typically revolve around the question of whether such symbols represent heritage or hatred: racially innocuous Southern pride or White prejudice against Blacks. In order to assess these competing claims, we first examine the historical reintroduction of the Confederate flag in the Deep South in the 1950s and 1960s; next, we analyze three survey datasets, including one nationally representative dataset and two probability samples of White Georgians and White South Carolinians, in order to build and assess a stronger theoretical account of the racial motivations underlying such symbols than currently exists. While our findings yield strong support for the hypothesis that prejudice against Blacks bolsters White support for Southern symbols, support for the Southern heritage hypothesis is decidedly mixed. Despite widespread denials that Southern symbols reflect racism, racial prejudice is strongly associated with support for such symbols.

AB  - The traditional and still dominant approach to authoritarianism measures it as a unidimensional construct. However, in the past few years some studies have assessed the three hypothesized authoritarianism components (i.e., authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism) separately. The aims of this study are to verify that the three-correlated-factor structure fits the data better than the one-factor model and to analyze the distinct effects of the three dimensions of authoritarianism on values and prejudice. A total of 169 Italian citizens responded to a questionnaire. As hypothesized, a structural equation model shows that the dimension of authoritarian submission is mainly related to the openness to change vs. conservation values opposition; the dimension of authoritarian aggression is more characterized on the self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement values opposition; conventionalism is mainly linked to traditional values. As concerns prejudice, this variable is predicted just by authoritarian aggression. Theoretical implications as concerns the conceptualization of authoritarianism are discussed.

AB  - Blomqvist's article holds that nationalism in the socialist labour movement did not suddenly manifest itself as Europe went to war in 1914. In Sweden, patriotic ideas from the French Revolution and radical liberalism heavily influenced the early labour movement and contributed to the development of a socialist patriotism. As a twin of socialist internationalism, this left-wing working-class nationalism centred on the question Who is the nation?' The answer was not simply the working people', but penetrated further into the questionin this age of nationalization of the massesof who those working people' were. With few intellectual resources of its own in its early years, the young socialist movement in Sweden had to rely on popular liberal education. Accordingly, knowledge from the modern natural sciences and anthropology was imported with its ideas of human races as kernels of nationality. Academics who subsequently joined the socialist movement tried to interpret racial science and eugenics to the advantage of the working class and for the sake of social reform. Together with socialist patriotism, this attempt developed into a racialized message on the anthropological value of Swedish workers as opposed to both the bourgeois elites and foreign low-paid workers and strikebreakers. In its more extreme versionas represented by a leading Swedish social democratit turned older stereotypes of Jews into a racist antisemitic discourse against those who were believed to be the enemies of Swedish labour. The combination of socialist patriotism, racism and antisemitism, however, was challenged by other interpretations and experiences.

AB  - Ethnic groups use music to promote in-group favoritism and values, but also to enhance intergroup closeness and understanding. The current study examined whether national music, often used for emphasizing intergroup separateness, can also reduce prejudice and promote theory of mind among two groups in conflict, Jews and Arabs in Israel. More specifically, the study examined whether removing a national song from its conflictual context, and introducing it in a manner which emphasizes out-group familiarity, enhances mentalization and positive attitudes between groups. Arab/Jewish women (N = 254) were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to one of two types of national Israeli songs, a Holocaust Day song (HDS), which is not associated with the IsraeliArab conflict, or a Memorial Day song (MDS), which is aired only on days of remembrance for Israel's fallen soldiers, sung by either a Jewish or an Arab singer. The results demonstrated that exposure to a HDS enhanced theory of mind when it is sung by an Arab singer. Moreover, Arabs who heard the HDS demonstrated reduced prejudice against Jews, when compared with the MDS. The results demonstrate that national songs, which may be the epitome of in-group favoritism, can be used for promoting theory of mind even among adversarial groups.

AB  - This study examined how socio-demographic factors related to the levels of cultural and non-cultural prejudice among college students from Korea, China, and Japan. We used data collected from the Asian Value Survey. The main findings are as follows. First, Chinese students showed the lowest levels of cultural and non-cultural prejudice. Second, those who had higher cultural prejudice also showed higher levels of non-cultural prejudice. However, while Korean and Japanese students had significantly higher levels of cultural prejudice than non-cultural prejudice, a statistically significant difference was not found among Chinese students. Third, while levels of cultural prejudice were explained by the country of origin and income, those of non-cultural prejudice were explained by the country of origin, gender, and the size of the areas in which students resided during childhood. Future directions for research and multicultural education were suggested based on the findings.

AB  - In light of the growing role of social media in conflict management, the current study analyzes the interrelationship of online political participation of Israeli Jews, the frequency of their online contacts with Arabs, and Jews' perceived social distances from Arabs. The research was conducted through an online survey of a representative sample of 458 Israeli Jews who use the social media at least 3 times a week. Overall, although causation cannot be inferred because of the correlational design of our study, results suggest that frequency of online contacts may positively affect closeness to Arabs in line with contact theory. In keeping with the socialization perspective of political engagement, the findings indicate that the impact of online political participation on social distances from Arabs was mediated by interactions between Jews and Arabs in the social media.

AB  - Marzec investigates socialist strategies in relationship to antisemitism during the 1905-7 Revolution in the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland. An extensive, diachronic discourse analysis of political leaflets reveals a dialogical differentiation of political identities and ideological positions. Antisemitism was an important political device used by the National Democracy party (Endecja) to assist in the construction of a new national identity. It represented a certain discursive binary logic that ushered in a need for a negatively perceived and threatening outside'. Jews easily became the focus of this mechanism due to the particular sociodemographic conjuncture of events as well as older, more established Judaeophobic tendencies. This antisemitism was, for the same structural reasons, questioned and rejected by the socialist parties that were struggling to maintain class unity. For socialists, the need to prevent the redirection of class anger into ethnic animosities and to secure the united struggle of Polish and Jewish workers were matters of life and death. While general antisemitic attitudes may be perceived as more common in Russian Poland than in Western Europe, nevertheless domestic socialists of all parties and denominations remained firmly against antisemitism and did not accept the economic Jew' stereotype that was often a hidden undercurrent of anti-capitalism at the time. A broader overview of the genealogy of divisions among Polish radicals from the 1880s and 1890s and afterwards, up until the tragic rise of antisemitism from 1910 onwards, demonstrates that an anti-antisemitic strategy was adopted, and subsequently kept in place, as the most viable political identity in the given social and political situation. It remained unsuccessful, however, and some socialist writers started to distance themselves from the earlier, virtually unanimous, anti-antisemitic stance.

AB  - We test two assumptions of the generalized prejudice literature. First, that the structure of generalized prejudice (i.e. how prejudices are interrelated) is dependent on the intergroup context. Second, that different types of prejudice have similar political consequences and run via the generalized prejudice component. We perform these tests in the two main regions of Belgium - Flanders and Wallonia - and investigate the influence of differences in the history of immigration, experience of the linguistic and autonomy conflict, and the separate party system and political discourse (i.e. the societal and intergroup context) on these premises. We make use of the Belgian Election Panel (BEP) data that included measures of prejudice toward multiple target groups (immigrants, Flemings, Walloons, homosexuals, and Jews) and voting propensities for the main political parties. Our results show that, regardless of the differences in intergroup experiences, the structure of prejudice is identical in Flanders and Wallonia. Flemings are, however, more tolerant toward homosexuals and immigrants than Walloons. The political context and the set of potential political outlets does play an important moderating role in the translation of prejudices to party preferences: While negative attitudes toward the other regional group seem to divide the electorate in Flanders, it does not affect voting intentions in Wallonia. Anti-immigrant prejudice is crucial in both regions, but affects voters in different ways at the right-side of the political spectrum.

AB  - The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most deeply entrenched in the world. While there is great knowledge about numerous individual factors contributing to this conflict's persistence, much of the information is fragmented and segregated into different disciplines. This article seeks to integrate an array of literature using a dynamic systems perspective to examine how social - as opposed to political - forces contribute to ongoing tensions. The first part describes the dynamical systems perspective, focusing on how intractable conflicts emerge as a result of interlinking factors that anchor the social system in patterns that resist change. The second part explores the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in terms of specific social forces contributing to the conflict's persistence. These include leadership issues, economic inequalities poverty, youth disenfranchisement, and population distribution. Then the contribution maps how the discussed social factors interrelate to reinforce the ongoing tensions and addresses how small-scale approaches may circumvent the volatile, entrenched patterns of hostility.

AB  - As public awareness of implicit bias has grown in recent years, studies have raised important new questions about the nature of implicit bias effects. First, implicit biases are widespread and robust on average, yet are unstable across a few weeks. Second, young children display implicit biases indistinguishable from those of adults, which suggests to many that implicit biases are learned early. Yet, if implicit biases are unstable over weeks, how can they be stable for decades? Third, meta-analyses suggest that individual differences in implicit bias are associated weakly, although significantly, with individual differences in behavioral outcomes. Yet, studies of aggregate levels of implicit bias (i.e., countries, states, counties) are strongly associated with aggregate levels of disparities and discrimination. These puzzles are difficult to reconcile with traditional views, which treat implicit bias as an early-learned attitude that drives discrimination among individuals who are high in bias. We propose an alternative view of implicit bias, rooted in concept accessibility. Concept accessibility can, in principle, vary both chronically and situationally. The empirical evidence, however, suggests that most of the systematic variance in implicit bias is situational. Akin to the "wisdom of crowds" effect, implicit bias may emerge as the aggregate effect of individual fluctuations in concept accessibility that are ephemeral and context-dependent. This bias of crowds theory treats implicit bias tests as measures of situations more than persons. We show how the theory can resolve the puzzles posed and generate new insights into how and why implicit bias propagates inequalities.

AB  - Among all the socialist strategies and responses to antisemitism, those developed and applied in Russia before 1917 command our attention because of the violence and ubiquity of antisemitism, and because of the principal role of socialists in promoting democracy and revolution in the Russian empire. A significant part of the socialist movement to in Russia was in the hands of Jewish socialists because of the disproportionately large number of Jews in Russian revolutionary parties. This was even more the case in the Pale of Settlement, where Russia's Jewish population was concentrated and where the first Marxist party in the Russian Empire, the Bund, flourished. Jewish members of socialist parties were, however, inhibited from pleading the case of Jews due to the internationalist, even anti-nationalist, political position of most socialists. Surh's article explores the response to antisemitism among Jewish socialists, primarily in the Pale, by considering the career of the revolutionary Social Democrat, Grigorii Aronson, in the period before 1914. Aronson joined and worked with the Bund for a short while but, for most of his career, he was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (RSDRP), first as a Bolshevik and, from 1917 until the end of his life, as a Menshevik. Although most Jewish socialists joined the Bund or a number of Zionist socialist parties, quite a number joined Russian parties including, besides the RSDRP, the Socialist Revolutionary Party and a number of anarchist groups. These are the parties whose attitude and stance towards antisemitism that Suhr's article explores through Aronson's biographical journey.

AB  - Employment, demographic, cultural, and legal changes in Europe over the past 40 years have brought unprecedented numbers of minority groups into organisations at all levels, and research suggests that most workplaces are likely to become even more diverse in the future. While much attention has been paid to negative experiences of minorities in the workplace, it also has the potential to be an important site of prejudice reduction. In response, drawing on original quantitative and qualitative data, this article explores the encounters of socially different groups in the workplace. It demonstrates that workplaces can promote meaningful encounters. However, cases of positive encounter with difference were often discussed at the level of the individual, with reference to specific people and friendships, rather than towards the minority group to which the individual belonged. As such, these positive encounters were often superficial with underlying tensions still existing between different groups in the workplace.

AB  - Across two studies we test the prediction that multicultural experiences reduce intercultural prejudice by increasing Openness to Experience. In Study 1, frequency of self-reported multicultural experiences was associated with greater openness and less ethnic prejudice, and openness explained the relationship between multicultural experiences and ethnic prejudice. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated a multicultural experience. Compared to those in a control condition, participants exposed to the cultural members and elements of foreign cultures reported being higher in Openness to Experience and expressed less prejudice toward these cultural groups. There was also some evidence that multicultural exposure, through openness, caused secondary transfer effects in prejudice reduction. Our findings suggest that exposure to multicultural environments can improve intercultural attitudes by personality shifts in Openness to Experience.

AB  - Social life hinges on the ability to infer others' mental states. By default, people often recruit self-knowledge during social inference, particularly for others who are similar to oneself. How do people's active perspective-taking efforts-deliberately imagining another's perspective-affect self-knowledge use? In 2 experiments, we test the flexible self-application hypothesis: that the application of self-knowledge to a perspective-taking target differs based on that person's similarity to oneself. We found consistent evidence that, when making inferences about dissimilar others, perspective taking increased the projection of one's own traits and preferences to those targets, relative to a control condition. When making inferences about similar others, however, perspective taking decreased projection. These findings suggest that self-target similarity critically shapes the inferential processes triggered by active perspective-taking efforts.

AB  - Two studies tested a model, whereby, identification with the minority group was predicted to impact on acculturation preferences, which in turn were proposed to impact involvement in intragroup friendships with other minority members, intergroup friendships with majority members and stress experienced by minority members. A direct path from minority identification to stress was also included in the model. The model was tested using structural equation modelling on survey data collected from Muslim women (N=250) and from Somali minority members (N=198) in Britain. Results supported predictions and revealed that identification was associated with more culture maintenance preference and less culture adoption preference. Culture maintenance preference was associated with involvement in intragroup friendships, and culture adoption preference was associated with involvement in intergroup friendships and increased stress. Practical applications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - We study what determines whether someone is an early Facebook adopter in a context in which Facebook is still relatively new compared to a far more popular Dutch social networking site (SNS) (Hyves). We use representative survey data of 4363 adolescents aged 14-15years. First, adolescents who participate in more leisure activities, who have more digital resources, and who have more friends who are SNS members are more likely to be SNS members. Second, we hypothesize and show that for adopting communication technology that highly fluctuates in popularity and is highly time-dependent, individuals are more likely to be early Facebook adopters when the number of their friends who are Facebook members increases. Finally, non-native adolescents are also more likely to be early Facebook adopters.

AB  - Previous research has documented associations between prejudice and agreeableness, as well as openness to experience, from the five-factor model (FFM). Still, empathy/altruism and narcissism/honesty-humility are related traits and also potent predictors of prejudice. Thus, we examined whether there is an association between prejudice and agreeableness, as a global trait, or if the correlations depend on facets that are part of the broader FM factor, but belong to other dimensions in the HEXACO model. We further analyzed how well the documented relations of agreeableness on prejudice hold up when entered alongside empathy/altruism and honesty-humility within the HEXACO framework. Results from Sweden and the United States showed that only FFM agreeableness, and not the HEXACO counterpart, correlates with an index of prejudice (racism and sexism). Furthermore, the negative relations of FFM agreeableness were absent or reversed in regression analyses with the other HEXACO predictors. Instead, we found negative effects of honesty-humility and empathy/altruism on prejudice. Thus, the effect of agreeableness on prejudice is directly contingent on its definition in relation to honesty-humility and empathy/altruism. In conclusion, we found little evidence of an association between a global agreeableness trait and prejudice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drawing on minority stress theory, the present study tested the relations of minority stressors (i.e., experiences of prejudice and discrimination, internalized antitrans attitudes, fear of antitrans stigma), social support (i.e., friend, family, and significant other support), and substance use (i.e., drug and alcohol use) with depression and suicide risk in a sample of trans individuals. Depression was examined as a mediator of the relations of minority stressors and social support with suicide risk; drug and alcohol use were examined as direct correlates of suicide risk. Participants were 335 trans-identified individuals, diverse in gender identities (e.g., trans men, trans women, nonbinary gender identities). They were recruited using online social networks and they completed the study survey online via Qualtrics. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypothesized relations. Depression fully mediated the relations of perceived experiences of discrimination, fear of antitrans stigma, and friend support with suicide risk, and partially mediated the relation of internalized antitrans attitudes with suicide. Drug use was positively associated with suicide risk, whereas alcohol use was not linked with suicide risk. Exploratory comparisons across gender subgroups suggested that the pattern of relations among study variables was consistent across trans men, trans women, and individuals with nonbinary gender identities. These findings point to minority stressors, friend support, and drug use as potentially fruitful targets of prevention and intervention efforts to reduce depression and suicide risk in trans populations.

AB  - Social contagion concerns, heterosexuals' fears about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, can lead to avoidant and hostile responses toward gay men/lesbians. We argue that apprehension about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian contributes to contagion concerns. We hypothesized that exposing heterosexuals to others' nonprejudiced attitudes would reduce their contagion concerns. Consistent with these predictions, perceptions of peer prejudice statistically predicted contagion concerns, over and above personal prejudice (Study 1). In addition, participants exposed to a nonprejudiced versus a high-prejudiced norm (or control condition) expressed lower contagion concerns and less anxious/avoidant responses toward gay men/lesbians (Studies 2 and 4). Finally, exposure to fellow students' nonprejudiced views resulted in lower contagion concerns than a control group (Study 3) due to decreased concerns about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian (Study 4). These results provide evidence that changing perceptions of others' prejudice can reduce contagion concerns.

AB  - The current study postulates a more holistic view on the Dual-Process Motivational model (DPM). More specifically, it questions placing specific social worldview beliefs (Dangerous World and Competitive Jungle) at the very heart of the process which produces right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). The sample was comprised of 750 adult respondents representative of the population of Poland. Data were collected with computer-assisted questionnaires and analyzed using hierarchical regression analyses. The results show that the complexity of social phenomena related to DPM can primarily be seen as direct consequences of the fundamental duality of moral intuitions and preferences for values. High RWA is primarily an expression of the ethics of community and preference for conservation values; high SDO is primarily an expression of rejection of the ethics of autonomy and is related to preference for self-enhancement values. Both, moral intuitions and preferences for values, cannot be reduced to the components of RWA and SDO. The role of social worldview beliefs in the Dual Process should be examined in relation to the ethical and axiological duality underlying RWA and SDO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent research suggests that Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) constructs are actually multifaceted. We studied the underlying personality structure of both RWA and SDO by examining their facet correlates with the Big Five personality dimensions. In a sample of 406 participants, Openness and Conscientiousness appear to be the most important personality correlates for all RWA facets, thus supporting findings conducted with the RWA total measure. Unexpectedly, for the two SDO facets and SDO total scale, Openness was the most important correlate, followed by the anticipated significant relation with Agreeableness. The SDO and RWA facets were differentially correlated with the Big Five, suggesting that they may not have the same latent structure. These results suggest that some accuracy may be lost when using only the total RWA and SDO scales and that research should explore the similarity and differences in which the facets correlate and predict other variables.

AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on how perceived discrimination influences the impact of intergroup contact among ethnic minority members. Previous research has shown that perceived group discrimination inhibits the positive outcomes of intergroup contact among ethnic minority members. In extension, this paper examines whether perceived personal discrimination has a similar negative impact as a boundary condition of the contact-prejudice relationship among ethnic minority members. Analyses expand previous intergroup contact research by showing that the impact of intergroup contact is uniform across various levels of perceived personal discrimination. This finding suggests that the otherwise harmful consequences of perceived personal discrimination can be effectively counterbalanced by positive contact experiences among ethnic minority members. Analyses use evidence from a national probability sample, which was fielded in 2006 to examine some of the largest ethnic minority groups (N=3,462). The concluding section discusses the theoretical implications of the empirical findings.

AB  - The Dual Process Model ( DPM) of social attitudes and prejudice proposes that Social Dominance Orientation ( SDO) and Right Wing Authoritarianism ( RWA) reflect two distinct motivational processes. In two studies, we investigated how political involvement moderates the impact of social worldviews and value-based dimensions on SDO and RWA. We proposed that political involvement constrains SDO, RWA and their antecedents into a tighter left-right ideological dimension, therefore transforming the double dissociation pattern of the DPM into a double additive pattern. As expected, for stronger political involvement, Study 1 ( N=237) showed that SDO and RWA were a function of both the competitive jungle and the dangerous world worldviews, whereas Study 2 ( N=143) pointed out that SDO and RWA were both connected with the value dimensions of self-enhancement and conservation.

AB  - The current study analyzes whether cross-cultural communication through online social platforms between immigrants from the Former Soviet Union and different sectors of veteran Israelis reduces social distances and facilitates immigrants' integration. The research was conducted through an online survey of 296 Former Soviet Union immigrants who use social media sites in Hebrew. The findings show a positive impact of online contacts, only on social distances toward groups with very different cultures from Former Soviet Union immigrants: Arabs and ultra-orthodox Jews. Online contacts were found not to have a positive impact on social distances between immigrants and veteran Israelis from the dominant culture. In other words, online contact was not found to contribute to the social integration of Former Soviet Union immigrants, but the social media were found to have the potential to narrow cleavages in Israeli society by reducing stigmas and alienation.

AB  - Research has shown that the perception of sexual harassment depends on factors such as gender, the situational context, the type of harassment, the ideology of the perceiver, the physical attractiveness of the harasser and victim and the relationship between them. This study focuses on examining the influence of physical attractiveness in the perception of a situation like sexual harassment. Through a questionnaire, 205 participants read a scenario in which a male worker (attractive vs. unattractive) engaged in gender harassment against a female colleague (attractive vs. unattractive). The participants then answered the measurements on the perception of harassment, responsibility, motivation and ideology. The main results were that the situation was more often perceived as sexual harassment when the victim of the harassment was physically attractive than when she was unattractive. Furthermore, the higher the participants' acceptance of harassment myths the more they tended to blame the victim. We can conclude from this study the importance of the influence of certain myths or preconceived ideas about sexual harassment, which are found in both men and women, on how these situations are perceived.

AB  - This article analyzes the role of Spanish television in preparing children and young people for life in a society moving toward democracy after decades of authoritarian rule. The Spanish government, which had exceptional power over TVE, the country's sole television network, hoped to use this medium to instill democratic values and convey a sense of normality. However, findings show that TVE's new agenda was hampered by its programming requirements, responsibility as a monopoly to cater to the entire population, failure to understand the preferences and needs of young audiences, and emphasis on U.S. family-oriented series. Children's and young people's programming during the transition was a mix of innovative content and reactionary programs typical of the Franco era.

AB  - Do economic downturns encourage racist attitudes? Does this in-turn lead to worse labour market outcome for minorities? We assess these important questions using British attitude and labour force data. The attitude data show that racial prejudice is counter cyclical, with the effect driven by large increases for high-skilled middle-aged working men - a 1%-point increase in unemployment is estimated to increase self-reported racial prejudice by 4%-points. Correspondingly, the labour force data show that racial employment and wage gaps are counter-cyclical, with the largest effects also observed for high skilled men, especially in the manufacturing and construction industries-a 1%-point increase in unemployment is estimated to increase the wage gap by 3%. These results are entirely consistent with the theoretical literature, which proposes that racial prejudice and discrimination are the result of labour market competition among individuals with similar traits, and that the effects of this competition are exacerbated during periods of economic downturn.

AB  - Given the current debate over the distinction between subtle and blatant prejudice, this study provides new evidence regarding problems with the construct validity of the Pettigrew and Meertens' Blatant and Subtle Prejudice Scale. To assess these issues, an existing data sample of 896 Chilean participants collected in 2010 was reanalyzed. The main analysis method used was a confirmatory factor analysis. The model that best represented the original theory (a model of two correlated second-order factors) had an improper solution due to the unidentified model. The scale has substantial psychometric problems, and it was not possible to distinguish between subtle and blatant prejudice.

AB  - Official definitions of hate crime are viewed as overly narrow and unnecessarily exclusive. To enable more inclusive practices, many jurisdictions have embraced alternative terminologies such as bias crime, targeted crime and prejudice motivated crime. In this article, we examine how police agencies in Victoria, Australia, are grappling with incidents and responses to hate crime. Drawing on the accounts of high priority victim groups, we illustrate how victims and victim advocates make sense of new hate crime terminologies and whether these terminologies facilitate hate crime incident reporting. Our findings speak to the importance of shared understanding and vocabularies; however, police responses to prejudice motivated crime incidents and police interactions with victims remain a significant barrier to reporting behaviour.

AB  - The shortened version of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale (PPS) analyzes new manifestations of prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women. Specifically, this instrument consists of 16 items distributed in four subscales: values gay progress, positive beliefs about gay men, positive beliefs about lesbian women, and resistance to heteronormative expectations. The aim of the current study is to add new evidence about the reliability and validity of the scale. The scale is administrated to 348 heterosexual university students from Spain with a mean age of 22.62years (SD=7.63). Reliability and factorial validity estimates are presented. A four-factor structure is supported using confirmatory factor analysis (short version). Our results can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual diversity.

AB  - In this paper I ask what implicit attitudes tell us about our freedom. I analyze the relation between the literature on implicit attitudes and an important subcategory of theories of free willself-disclosure accounts. If one is committed to such a theory, I suggest one may have to move to a more social conceptualization of the capacity for freedom. I will work out this argument in five sections. In the first section, I discuss the specific theories of free will that are central to this paper. In the second section, I will show that implicit-bias research raises questions about people's capacities to exercise (these specific understandings of) free will. In the third section, I will consider how an individual may overcome these failures and argue that the individual ability for self-regulation is significantly limited. One could stop here and conclude that free will is a limited capacity. But I argue that this conclusion would be too hastily drawn. I will instead continue to ask what would be required for free will. By discussing how failures of free will are due to social structures and may be therefore repaired by changing social structures in section 4, I will arrive at an alternative conclusion about the capacity for free will in section 5.

AB  - Prejudice and stigma about mental illness is still present in society. Patients suffer both from the disease, and from the marginalization behavior exhibited by others towards them and their families. Psychiatric professionals may also become ill and suffer for the same reason. The authors of this international multicenter study have set themselves the question of whether there may be prejudice and/or stigma among psychiatric professionals towards their suffering colleagues, among patients towards nursing staff affected by the same disease and between patients themselves. Using two standardized questionnaires which have been tested, but have not been used before they have studied 207 mental health professionals and 407 patients, of Italian, Belgian, Hungarian and Croatian nationalities. The results show that there are in fact prejudices among Mental Health Professionals about colleagues suffering from mental illness because they responded that such persons cannot treat well patients with their own pathology. However Mental Health Professionals do not demonstrate behaviors which are not frankly marginalizing or stigmatizing towards colleagues suffering from mental illness. On the other hand, among patients the prevailing view was that psychiatric professionals who suffer from mental illness, can better understand the sick, because they are also suffering. This is in analogy with the Jungian theory of the "wounded healer" in the myth of the centaur Chiron. Patients did not demonstate rejection or marginalization behavior towards other sick patients. Finally both the professionals and the patients tend to be cautious in relating to healthy persons and tend not to disclose their suffering for fear of being misjudged or marginalized.

AB  - Implicit social biases are ubiquitous and are known to influence social behavior. A core diagnostic criterion of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is abnormal social behavior. We investigated the extent to which individuals with ASD might show a specific attenuation of implicit social biases, using Implicit Association Tests (IATs) involving social (gender, race) and nonsocial (nature, shoes) categories. High-functioning adults with ASD showed intact but reduced IAT effects relative to healthy control participants. We observed no selective attenuation of implicit social (vs. nonsocial) biases in our ASD population. To extend these results, we supplemented our healthy control data with data collected from a large online sample from the general population and explored correlations between autistic traits and IAT effects. We observed no systematic relationship between autistic traits and implicit social biases in our online and control samples. Taken together, these results suggest that implicit social biases, as measured by the IAT, are largely intact in ASD.

AB  - For some people, religion strongly influences their worldviews. We propose that religious outgroups threaten the foundational beliefs of people with strong religious worldviews (RWVs) by endorsing alternative belief systems and that this threat contributes to religious prejudice. To examine these ideas, we developed a measure of RWV strength and assessed the role of RWV threat in religious prejudice. Across five studies, strength of RWV was related to religious prejudice, including derogation and denial of alternative religious viewpoints, as well as support for suppressing, avoiding, and even aggressing against religious outgroups. These responses were strongest toward religious outgroups whose worldviews were the most different, and therefore most threatening. Mediational analyses revealed that strong RWV people expressed heightened prejudice because of the worldview threat posed by religious outgroup members. These findings indicate that the avoidance and subjugation of religious outgroups can serve as a worldview protection strategy for some people.

AB  - The cognitive functioning of individuals with stronger endorsement of right-wing and prejudiced attitudes has elicited much scholarly interest. Whereas many studies investigated cognitive styles, less attention has been directed towards cognitive ability. Studies investigating the latter topic generally reveal lower cognitive ability to be associated with stronger endorsement of right-wing ideological attitudes and greater prejudice. However, this relationship has remained widely unrecognized in literature. The present meta-analyses revealed an average effect size of r = -.20 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) [-0.23, -0.17]; based on 67 studies, N= 84 017] for the relationship between cognitive ability and right-wing ideological attitudes and an average effect size of r= -.19 (95% CI [-0.23, -0.16]; based on 23 studies, N= 27 011) for the relationship between cognitive ability and prejudice. Effect sizes did not vary significantly across different cognitive abilities and sample characteristics. The effect strongly depended on the measure used for ideological attitudes and prejudice, with the strongest effect sizes for authoritarianism and ethnocentrism. We conclude that cognitive ability is an important factor in the genesis of ideological attitudes and prejudice and thus should become more central in theorizing and model building.

AB  - Multicultural training in academic counseling and psychotherapy programs is often designed to address the needs of minority populations, and it rarely places Whiteness in the spotlight. Its structure, in fact, risks mirroring the very dynamics embedded in White privilege. Using the framework of feminist theory, we build on key findings on White racial socializationwhich has a profound impact on the quality of communication and interaction within and across racial groupsto outline the skills and awareness needed for White counselors and psychotherapists to promote racial justice in both their individual/counseling and community/advocacy work.

AB  - Objective: Video games increasingly have become multiplayer, and thus online video game players have the unique opportunity to cooperate with players from all over the world, including those who belong to different social groups. Consistent with research showing that intergroup cooperation leads to reductions in intergroup bias, playing a video game cooperatively with a member of a different social group (i.e., an outgroup member) may reduce bias. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to test whether playing a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup member reduces intergroup bias toward that partner's group. Method: In our investigation, Canadians (n = 138) played a violent video game cooperatively with an outgroup (American) or ingroup member against alien (i.e., zombie-like) enemies. Results: Cooperating with an outgroup member in a violent context for only 12 minutes generated large reductions in outgroup prejudice. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential for even violent video games to serve as prejudice interventions.

AB  - The modal distribution of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) is commonly interpreted as showing high levels of implicit prejudice among Americans. These interpretations have fueled calls for changes in organizational and legal practices, but such applications are problematic because the IAT is scored on an arbitrary psychological metric. The present research was designed to make the IAT metric less arbitrary by determining the scores on IAT measures that are associated with observable racial or ethnic bias. By reexamining data from published studies, we found evidence that the IAT metric is "right biased," such that individuals who are behaviorally neutral tend to have positive IAT scores. Current scoring conventions fail to take into account these dynamics and can lead to faulty inferences about the prevalence of implicit prejudice.

AB  - Although affirmative action based on race and/or ethnicity is a widely debated political issue within the public sphere, relatively few studies have examined the correlates of people's attitudes towards gender-based affirmative action. The few studies that have assessed this topic suggest that both Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and sexism are independently associated with people's opposition to affirmative action for women. The current study expands upon this literature by investigating the moderating effect of Benevolent Sexism (BS)-a dimension of sexism that sees women as weak and in need of protection-on the relationship between SDO and support for gender-based affirmative action within a nationally representative sample of New Zealand adults (N = 5697). Specifically, we argue that protective aspects of BS will weaken the previously-identified positive relationship between SDO and opposition to affirmative action for women. As expected, our results showed that SDO was positively, whereas BS was negatively, associated with opposition to gender-based affirmative action. Also as predicted, BS attenuated the relationship between SDO and opposition to affirmative action for women. These results replicate and extend past research by demonstrating that SDO is an ideology that works to maintain existing unequal structures. We also show that part of the insidious nature of BS is that it offers women ostensible short-term benefits.

AB  - A central hypothesis about discrimination is that prejudice forces the stigmatized into low-paying, undesirable jobs. Prejudice clearly leads to exclusion. But surprisingly, evidence linking exclusion to disadvantage is mixed. We address this issue theoretically, providing a formal rational choice model combining arguments from sociology ( on prejudice) and economics ( on competition). Our theory suggests that economic organization is crucial. In economies dominated by monopoly, oligarchy, tradition, or government, prejudice may reduce some workers' pay, and a disadvantageous secondary labor market may emerge. By contrast, in competitive free markets, exclusionary discrimination often occurs but does not reduce workers' pay, nor does it induce a disadvantageous secondary labor market. Our theory suggests the conventional analytic approach to discrimination is misguided: Exclusion does not necessarily imply disadvantage; a shortfall in pay does not necessarily imply that the lower paid worker is disadvantaged; and analysis should focus on the overall subjective well-being or utility derived from a job, not on pay alone.

AB  - Social anxiety the fear of social embarrassment and negative evaluation by others ranks among peoples worst fears, and it is often thought to impair task performance. We investigated the neurocognitive processes through which trait social anxiety relates to task performance, proposing a model of the joint contributions of reactive control, theoretically associated with conflict monitoring and activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and proactive control, theoretically associated with top-down regulation and activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Participants varying in their degree of trait social anxiety completed the Eriksen flanker task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Task-related left dlPFC activity was indexed by relative left prefrontal EEG (inverse alpha), and conflict-related dACC activity was indexed by the N2r component of the event-related potential. Stronger activity in both regions predicted better response control, and greater social anxiety was associated with worse response control. Furthermore, for all participants, greater left prefrontal EEG activity predicted better behavioral control, but for high social anxiety participants only, greater N2r responses also predicted behavioral control. This pattern suggests that low social anxiety individuals engaged a proactive control process, driven by dlPFC activity, whereas high social anxiety individuals relied additionally on a reactive control process, driven by conflict-related dACC activity. These findings support a model of control that involves different patterns of interplay between proactive and reactive strategies and may help to explain self-regulatory impairments in social anxiety.

AB  - A sociofunctional, threat-based approach to prejudice suggests that perceived outgroup threats lead people to act to minimize those threats. In 2 experiments the current research explores how perceived threats to values affect antiatheist prejudices. In Experiment 1 we found that atheists were perceived to pose significantly greater threats to values, and elicit greater moral disgust, than other groups also perceived to pose values-related threats (gay men, Muslims). In Experiment 2 we randomly assigned participants to read either a news story detailing moral decline-priming values threats-or a control story. Following the values-threat prime, participants reported increased negative affect and greater discriminatory intentions toward atheists, but not toward students or other groups (gay men or people with HIV). Together, these experiments suggest that perceptions of threats to values are associated with, and negatively affect, antiatheist prejudice. We discuss our findings' theoretical implications for a sociofunctional, threat-based approach to prejudice.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge in popularity of the fair-trade industry, which seeks to improve trading conditions and to promote the rights of marginalized workers. Although research suggests that fair-trade products are perceived as promoting social and economic responsibility, some individuals-namely, those who seek to maintain existing group inequalities (i.e., those high in social dominance orientation or SDO) or those induced to think inequality is a good thing-may not share this perception. Across three studies, we found that (1) SDO relates negatively to fair-trade consumption, and (2) this relationship is mediated by the tendency for high-SDO individuals to see fair-trade products as less compatible with their conception of social justice. Our findings held after controlling for related individual-differences variables, and regardless of whether SDO was measured or manipulated. Implications for how to maximize the likelihood that people will perceive fair-trade products as "fair" are discussed.

AB  - Stigma and fear of discrimination are powerful deterrents against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing. Prejudice and discrimination against people living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are deterrents to their willingness to disclose their status and thereby avail themselves of treatment. Stigma impairs employees' general well-being, affecting their work capacity, and thus directly impacting upon project management success. Little is known about construction workers' prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons, and the determinants thereof. A field-administered questionnaire survey gathered data from 512 site-based construction employees in the Western Cape, South Africa. Following bivariate and regression analyses of the survey response data, a structural equations model comprising demographic factors, lifestyle risk, substance use (alcohol consumption and drug use), knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and attitudinal fear of testing is posited to explain prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. The results indicate the following: (1) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudinal fear of testing, and prejudice towards HIV+ persons are determinants of discrimination against HIV+ persons; (2) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and attitudinal fear of testing are determinants of prejudice towards HIV+ persons; (3) AIDS knowledge is predicted by level of education and ethnicity; and (4) attitudinal fear of testing is predicted by level of education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and extent of risky lifestyle. The research confirms current knowledge about the multivariate determination of prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. It advances this understanding by identifying and emphasizing the central role played by education and subject-specific information in such determination. Specifically, it offers a clearer picture of the direct influence of educational background and AIDS knowledge in determining both the cognitive dimension of prejudice and the behavioral manifestation of this through discrimination. This has clear implications for construction firms in their efforts at HIV/AIDS intervention management. As much of this AIDS knowledge is determined by cultural beliefs and values, there exists the need to design programs that directly and sensitively address these cultural beliefs and their likely impact on prejudice and discrimination. Likewise, prior education is also critical, both in terms of amplifying or mitigating the impact of cultural beliefs and in terms of the potential comprehension by workers of such structured media and awareness campaigns. Failure to account for these two factors and their influence on cognition and behavior would result in interventions of diminished impact and success. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Psychological essentialism, the perception that groups possess inherent properties binding them and differentiating them from others, is theoretically relevant to predicting prejudice. Recent developments isolate two key dimensions: essentialistic entitativity (EE; groups as unitary, whole, entity-like) and essentialistic naturalness (EN; groups as fixed and immutable). We introduce a novel question: does tapping the covariance between EE and EN, rather than pitting them against each other, boost prejudice prediction? In Study 1 (re-analysis of Roets & Van Hiel, 2011b, Samples 1-3, in Belgium) and Study 2 (new Canadian data) their common/shared variance, modelled as generalized essentialism, doubles the predictive power relative to regression-based approaches with regard to racism (but not anti-gay or -schizophrenic prejudices). Theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - It is well known that we utilize internalized representations (or schemas) to direct our eyes when exploring visual stimuli. Interestingly, our schemas for human faces are known to reflect systematic differences that are consistent with one's level of racial prejudice. However, whether one's level or type of racial prejudice can differentially regulate how we visually explore faces that are the target of prejudice is currently unknown. Here, White participants varying in their level of implicit or explicit prejudice viewed Black faces and White faces (with the latter serving as a control) while having their gaze behaviour recorded with an eye-tracker. The results show that, regardless of prejudice type (i.e., implicit or explicit), participants high in racial prejudice examine faces differently than those low in racial prejudice. Specifically, individuals high in explicit racial prejudice were more likely to fixate on the mouth region of Black faces when compared to individuals low in explicit prejudice, and exhibited less consistency in their scanning of faces irrespective of race. On the other hand, individuals high in implicit racial prejudice tended to focus on the region between the eyes, regardless of face race. It therefore seems that racial prejudice guides target-race specific patterns of looking behaviour, and may also contribute to general patterns of looking behaviour when visually exploring human faces.

AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of different dimensions of religiosity and trust on religious and racial prejudice in Europe. The sample is based on 37 European countries that are current or potential members of the European Union (EU). Using multi-level logistic regression modeling and the latest wave from the European Values Study data, we test the effects of both individual and country-level variables. Our results suggest that religious particularism is correlated with more religious and racial prejudice. Doctrinal belief and individual spirituality are both correlated with less religious prejudice only. Nonreligious individuals have the highest religious prejudice compared to members of religious denominations. Individual and country-level generalized trust, as well as trust in the EU, are all negatively correlated with religious and racial prejudice.

AB  - We examined the role of social dominance orientation (SDO) as a predictor of men's reactions to romantic rejection and attitudes toward female sexuality. In Study 1 (n=158), we found that men who scored higher in SDO were more likely to blame women for romantic rejection, and report having responded to women's past rejection with persistence and manipulation (e.g., convincing her to "give him another chance"), as well as with aggression and threats of violence. In Study 2 (n=398), we replicated these findings, and further found that men higher in SDO were more likely to endorse rape myths (e.g., believing that sometimes a woman's barriers need to be "broken down" in order to attain sex), and to want to lower the legal age of sexual consent in women. Two mediators explained this relationship, hostile sexism and the belief that insubordinate women need to be disciplined. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - Does Buddhism really promote tolerance? Based on cross-cultural and cross-religious evidence, we hypothesized that Buddhist concepts, possibly differing from Christian concepts, activate not only prosociality but also tolerance. Subliminally priming Buddhist concepts, compared with neutral or Christian concepts, decreased explicit prejudice against ethnic, ideological, and moral outgroups among Western Buddhists who valued universalism (Experiment 1, N = 116). It also increased spontaneous prosociality, and decreased, among low authoritarians or high universalists, implicit religious and ethnic prejudice among Westerners of Christian background (Experiment 2, N = 128) and Taiwanese of Buddhist/Taoist background (Experiment 3, N = 122). Increased compassion and tolerance of contradiction occasionally mediated some of the effects. The general idea that religion promotes (ingroup) prosociality and outgroup prejudice, based on research in monotheistic contexts, lacks cross-cultural sensitivity; Buddhist concepts activate extended prosociality and tolerance of outgroups, at least among those with socio-cognitive and moral openness.

AB  - This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less old-fashioned prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processessubtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance normsinteract to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics.

AB  - Critically discussing the causal social ontologies presented by Dave Elder-Vass and John Searle, the article argues that these views implausibly identify the causal ontological source of human sociality in collectively known, recognized and accepted statuses, criteria, norms and the like. This is implausible, for it ignores human sociality as occurring in temporally and spatially dispersed on-going processes of human interaction of differently placed, often unequal, and thus epistemically differently equipped actors in division of labour. Human scientific concepts are best seen as picking out (aspects of) such complex and heterogeneous processes, not what the participating actors allegedly collectively know, accept or recognize about them. The article observes that similar appeals to collective recognition are also common in Wittgensteinian literature that, however, have claimed to reject the causal ontological view. It is argued that the ultimate value in rejecting the causal ontological view, and the accompanying idea of collective recognition, resides in that we thereby avoid epistemically homogenizing and over-intellectualizing the diverse mass of dispersed, often unequal, but interacting actors.

AB  - This study was designed to test the effects of different types of influence on the expression of stereotypes towards people who are obese. It was hypothesized that public social pressure would more significantly impact the expression of stereotypes towards obese people than other types of influence.
   One-hundred fifty-eight undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions or a control condition. Participants completed measures of stereotypes towards obese people prior to and after receiving manipulated feedback depicting purported stereotypes possessed by others (anonymously or publically) or scientific information about the base rates of these stereotypical traits in the obese population (i.e., trait prevalence). Participants also completed a measure of weight bias unrelated to the manipulated feedback.
   Explicit beliefs were influenced more when people perceived that others' views were inconsistent with their own in a public setting than an anonymous setting or when they received trait prevalence feedback. However, levels of weight bias on a separate measure were unchanged.
   Strong, public manipulations of social feedback have great potential to impact, at least, the short-term expression of stereotypes towards obese people.

AB  - Psychologists have amassed robust evidence of antigay prejudice by assessing participants' global attitudes toward sexual minorities and their reactions to behavioral descriptions of hypothetical targets. In daily interactions, however, perceivers make decisions about others' sexual orientations based upon visible cues alone. Does antigay prejudice arise on the basis of such visual exposure, and if so, why? Three studies revealed that perceivers evaluated women they categorized as lesbians more negatively than women they categorized as straight. Moreover, prejudice against lesbian women was strongly tethered to gendered aspects of their facial appearance: Women categorized as lesbians tended to appear gender-atypical, and women who appeared gender-atypical were perceived to be unattractive, leading to prejudice. Similar findings did not emerge for men categorized as gay. As such, we argue that gendered appearance cues lay the perceptual foundation for prejudice against women, but not men, who are categorized as sexual minorities.

AB  - Mortality salience (MS) strengthens cultural values but individuals might differ in whether this process operates at a superficial, explicit level only or also at a profound, implicit level. Two studies investigated whether explicit and implicit attitudes toward Muslims after an MS induction vary as a function of threat-related action orientation (AOT), an efficient form of self-regulation of emotion and behavior that draws on the activation of the implicit, integrated self. In Study 1, there was a main effect of MS on explicit prejudice but only participants with high levels of AOT showed reduced implicit prejudice following MS. In Study 2, this interaction effect was replicated using an alternative implicit measure of prejudice. Defense in response to MS might thus not be a uniform phenomenon but might be composed of processes operating on different (i.e., profound vs. superficial) levels that vary with types of self-regulation such as high versus low AOT.

AB  - Decades of scholarship have identified several determinants of political intolerance, including authoritarianism and normative threat. Previous attempts in the literature to associate other individual difference variables (i.e., social dominance orientation [SDO]) and situational variables (i.e., out-groups' gains in power and status) have been unsuccessful. Using a dual-process motivational (DPM) model framework, in Study 1 we found that SDO predicted political intolerance of groups with hierarchy-attenuating political objectives. This relationship was consistent over and above other well-known predictors of political intolerance, including right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). RWA predicted intolerance of groups with both hierarchy-attenuating and cohesion-reducing objectives. In Study 2, we manipulated whether an immigrant-rights group was described as presenting a normative threat or as gaining power and status. Consistent with extant findings, RWA moderated the effect of normative threat on political intolerance. More interestingly, SDO moderated the effect of gains in power and status on political intolerance. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Many controversial immigration policies have recently emerged across the United States and abroad. We explore the role of national context in shaping support for such policies. Specifically, we examine whether the extent to which ideological attitudesRight-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)predict policy support is moderated by the national context of the policy. Across three studies, United States citizens read about a controversial immigration policy affecting either their own country (United States) or a foreign country (Israel or Singapore) and indicated their support for the policy. Results reveal that SDO predicts policy support, regardless of its national context; this effect is mediated by perceived competition. Conversely, RWA predicts policy support only if the policy affects domestic immigration; this effect is mediated by perceptions of cultural threat. Consistent with prior research, the present findings highlight the role of perceived cultural threat to one's ingroup and perceived competition in shaping attitudes toward immigration and shed light on some of the motivations underlying the recent rise in popularity of strict immigration policies.

AB  - News reporting on research studies may influence attitudes about health risk, support for public health policies, or attitudes towards people labeled as unhealthy or at risk for disease. Across five experiments (N = 2123) we examined how different news framings of obesity research influence these attitudes. We exposed participants to either a control condition, a news report on a study portraying obesity as a public health crisis, a news report on a study suggesting that obesity may not be as much of a problem as previously thought, or an article discussing weight-based discrimination. Compared to controls, exposure to the public health crisis article did not increase perception of obesity-related health risks but did significantly increase the expression of antifat prejudice in four out of seven comparisons. Across studies, compared to controls, participants who read an article about weight-based discrimination were less likely to agree that overweight constitutes a public health crisis or to support various obesity policies. Effects of exposure to an article questioning the health risks associated with overweight and obesity were mixed. These findings suggest that news reports on the "obesity epidemic" and, by extension, on public health crises commonly blamed on personal behavior may unintentionally activate prejudice.

AB  - Multiracial individuals often do not easily fit into existing racial categories. Perceivers may adopt a novel racial category to categorize multiracial targets, but their willingness to do so may depend on their motivations. We investigated whether perceivers' levels of internal motivation to control prejudice (IMS) and external motivation to control prejudice (EMS) predicted their likelihood of categorizing Black-White multiracial faces as Multiracial. Across four studies, IMS positively predicted perceivers' categorizations of multiracial faces as Multiracial. The association between IMS and Multiracial categorizations was strongest when faces were most racially ambiguous. Explicit prejudice, implicit prejudice, and interracial contact were ruled out as explanations for the relationship between IMS and Multiracial categorizations. EMS may be negatively associated with the use of the Multiracial category. Therefore, perceivers' motivations to control prejudice have important implications for racial categorization processes.

AB  - Fundamentalism is consistently related to racial prejudice (Hall, Matz, & Wood, 2010), yet the mechanisms for this relationship are unclear. We identify two core values of fundamentalism, authoritarianism and traditionalism, that independently contribute to the fundamentalism-racial prejudice relationship. We also contextualize the fundamentalism-racial prejudice relationship by suggesting that fundamentalists may show prejudice based on conceptions of African Americans as violating values but show tolerance when prejudice is less justifiable. These ideas are tested and confirmed using three data sets from the American National Election Studies. Across all three samples, fundamentalism is related to increases in symbolic racism but decreases in negative affect towards African Americans, and these relationships are mediated by both authoritarianism and traditionalism.

AB  - We argue that conflict over immigration largely concerns who bears the burden of cultural transaction costs, which we define as the costs associated with overcoming cultural barriers (e.g., language) to social exchange. Our framework suggests that the ability of native-born citizens to push cultural transaction costs onto immigrant out-groups serves as an important expression of social dominance. In two novel studies, we demonstrate that social dominance motives condition emotional responses to encountering cultural transaction costs, shape engagement in cultural accommodation behavior toward immigrants, and affect immigration attitudes and policy preferences.

AB  - Kasbarian and oktem explore the extent to which 'political friendships' between Armenians, Turks and Kurds-members of communities antagonized by the traumatic experience of genocide-can subvert hegemonic power arrangements of denial and nationalist mobilization. Based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with a group of Armenians and Turks in London, their paper explores how the members of this group experienced a transformation of their subject positions by facing each other's stories, gradually overcoming insecurities and fears of the Other. This dynamic process precipitated a shift of position, individually and collectively, enabling the formation of a community that acted beyond the confines of the reigning logics of nationalist projects. They argue that, in the relatively level playing field of the transnational, political and other friendships can develop to the point of becoming 'moral communities' that challenge established status quos and unequal power relations. Friendship and interpersonal relations that transgress these boundaries undermine reigning discourses and are, ultimately, political acts. However, these 'low' politics interactions still face the reality of 'high' politics, structured by the actions of an overbearing and semi-democratic Turkish state, the political expedience of third countries and a factious Armenian diaspora.

Specifically, the impact of exposure on interethnic evaluations as well as perceptions of self and other was evaluated. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 suggest that although exposure to positive media depictions of Latinos can prompt more favorable evaluations of ingroup and self among Latinos, the same cannot necessarily be said for the effects of exposure to affirmative messages on judgments about Latinos among outgroup members (i.e., whites). Instead, these data indicate that for whites, ingroup (racial/ethnic) identification is a potent factor in media-related interethnic evaluations.

AB  - Within the social representations' field of research, the "mute zone" hypothesis considers that some objects are characterized by counternormative content that people usually do not express in standard conditions of production. Within the framework of this approach, this study aims to explore the variations in the expression about the Gypsy community following the manipulation of different contexts and the issues associated with a pluri-methodological approach of data analysis. Indeed, two methodologies have been combined. The participants were asked to express themselves in public or in private. In addition, the identity of the experimenter was also manipulated as she presented herself as a Gypsy or not. Then, through a set of analyses based on a methodological triangulation approach, we were able to observe a recurrent modulation of the participants' answers. These analyses highlighted a greater incidence of the expression of counternormative elements when the context of expression was private and especially when the experimenter did not present herself as a Gypsy (p < .01, eta(2)(p) = .06). These results will be discussed in terms of the contribution of the methodologies employed and their comparison within the framework of the study of counternormative content.

AB  - Sexual prejudice may arise from beliefs that certain sexual orientation groups direct unwanted sexual interest, with the implication that heterosexual men and women hold prejudices against different groups. Study 1 confirmed that heterosexual women believe bisexual men, bisexual women, and lesbians (but not gay men) direct unwanted sexual interest, whereas heterosexual men believe bisexual and gay men (but not bisexual women or lesbians) direct unwanted sexual interest. Study 2 revealed patterns of negativity toward different sexual orientation groups mirroring Study I's pattern of perceptions of unwanted sexual interest and Study 3 demonstrated that the perception of unwanted sexual interest statistically mediates the relationship between target sexual orientation group and negativity. Existing theoretical approaches for understanding sexual prejudices, including the in-group-out-group heterosexism, gender-role violation, and sexual identity threat approaches, fail to account for the nuanced pattern of findings observed.

AB  - The main goal of this study was to identify acculturation preference profiles using cluster analysis in public and private areas of culture in the host and immigrant populations, and to find out the relationship between these profiles and prejudice levels. Four hundred and ninety-nine Spaniards and 500 Romanians participated in a survey. The sampling of Spaniards was multistage random and the sampling of Romanians was by quota. The results confirm our predictions. Romanians who are less prejudiced against Spaniards prefer assimilation in public areas and integration in private areas. Romanians who are more prejudiced against Spaniards prefer integration in public areas and separation in private areas. Spaniards who are less prejudiced against Romanians prefer integration in both public and private areas. Spaniards who are more prejudiced against Romanians prefer assimilation in both areas.

AB  - Extended contact has been shown to improve explicit and implicit attitudes toward a number of outgroups, but not yet toward people with mental health conditions. Using people with schizophrenia as the target group, this experiment is the first to demonstrate that extended contact can reduce explicit prejudice, buffer stress responses to future interactions, improve non-verbal behavior, and improve the quality of interactions in a manner detectable by the target group member. Participants watched a video of a brief, positive interaction between two strangers, one of whom they were led to believe had schizophrenia. Control participants watched the same video without being told that the person had schizophrenia. They then participated in a social interaction with a confederate whom they were led to believe had the disorder. Participants' cardiovascular and electrodermal activity were monitored immediately before the interaction. The interaction was also secretly recorded to allow independent judges to assess the participants' non-verbal behaviors. The confederate also rated the positivity of each interaction. Participants in the extended contact condition reported more positive attitudes toward people with schizophrenia, displayed more positive non-verbal behaviors, and had a more positive interaction with the confederate. Moreover, just prior to the interaction, participants in the extended contact condition displayed smaller anticipatory stress responses, as reflected in smaller changes in interbeat interval and non-specific skin conductance responses during this phase. Together, these findings support the use of the extended contact as an intervention that could lead to genuine changes in attitudes toward and treatment of people with severe mental health disorders.

AB  - Social tolerance towards left-handed people is commonly accepted in the twenty-first century, though not universal. However, at the level of social cognition a subtle bias against this visible minority group might not have disappeared. To investigate this possibility we adopted the theoretical framework of the stereotype content model (SCM) whereby two fundamental dimensions (warmth and competence) are sufficient to explain group differences in stereotype content. We examined how a large sample of medical students (N=300) perceived nine social groups (seven with various physical, social, or mental handicaps, and the two target groups of left- and right-handers), and four anchor groups comprising educated people, pensioners, drug addicts, and rich people) which are considered as prototypical in terms of the SCM. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to determine similarity of groups in the warmthxcompetence two-dimensional space. Four clusters were identified, with left- and right-handers located in the same cluster together with educated people. This cluster had higher ratings on both warmth and competence (i.e., more positive stereotype) compared with all other groups. However, within-cluster analysis showed that the left-handed group was perceived as lower on both dimensions compared to the right-handed group. This statistically significant difference suggests that implicit bias against left-handed individuals has not vanished despite pervasive social tolerance. Possible mechanisms that may explain this subtle and subliminal stereotyping are discussed.

AB  - Reducing the burden of epilepsy in low- and middle-income countries requires understanding of the cultural aspects of epilepsy. This cross-sectional study among individuals attending a clinic in an urban setting in Paramaribo, Suriname aimed to obtain information on the knowledge of and attitudes towards epilepsy and epilepsy treatment, comparing people with epilepsy (PWE) to those without epilepsy. This study also explored the help-seeking behavior and experience of having epilepsy in PWE.
   While the results of interviews with 49 PWE and 33 controls compared favorably to studies conducted in similar countries, a significant minority of PWE still rely on traditional remedies. Prejudices regarding social roles, schooling, and occupational choices of PWE also remain prevalent. Currently, the major source of information for both groups is the media, but there could be opportunities for the local epilepsy association to play a larger role.
   These findings, despite some selection bias, could be useful in bringing conventional medical treatment strategies to more PWE in Suriname, as well as empower patient organizations in designing stigma-reducing interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Women often face sexism and stereotypes about their academic ability, and this makes it important to examine the effects of confronting sexism in the college classroom. The current research consisted of 2 studies of how witnessing a confrontation of a sexist stereotype in the classroom affects female students' perceptions of the confronters and self-reported sexism. The samples consisted of female students from a public college in the Northeastern U.S. who provided their perceptions of teachers described in vignettes as either confronting or not confronting a student's stereotype of women as unskilled at math. In Study 1 (N = 48) perceptions of the teacher were more positive when confronting the stereotype, and students' self-reported sexism was reduced when the teacher confronted rather than ignored the stereotype. Study 2 (N = 56) compared the effects of a teacher versus a student confrontation of the same stereotype. Participants perceived the teacher and student more positively when they confronted rather than ignored the stereotype. However, the source of the confrontation yielded no differences in sexism. These results suggest that students want their teachers to respond to bias in the classroom and that teachers should respond to sexist incidents in order to reduce the level of sexism among their students.

AB  - Presentation. - Statistics across European countries show that immigrants have a disproportionate lower employment probability than persons born in the host county (SOPEMI, 2010). Explanations to this phenomenon are complex.
   Objectives. - An experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship between multicultural personality traits and managers' selection preferences in the hiring of native vs. foreign-born job candidates. We proposed that this relationship was mediated by prejudice.
   Methods. - Norwegian managers (n = 222) were presented with one Turkish immigrant job candidate and two Norwegian-born, less qualified job candidates. The managers completed the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) and the Blatant Prejudice Scale (SBPS).
   Results. - We found that the threat and rejection blatant prejudice subscale and Emotional stability predicted the managers' hiring preferences. Specifically, the higher threat and rejection subscale scores and the lower emotional stability scores, the more likely it is that the managers preferred to hire a native, less qualified candidate over the Turkish immigrant candidate. The effect of emotional stability on candidate preference was not mediated by prejudice.
   Conclusions. - The results suggest that managers' feelings of threat due to foreign-born immigrants' participation in the host society (political conservatism), and threat due to intercultural interactions, are significantly related to foreign-born immigrant job candidates' chances of being hired.

AB  - In order to address the specific social challenges of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the poorest urban neighbourhoods in Paris, new policies of social cohesion have been implemented over the past three decades that focus on place of residence rather than on ethnicity or national origin. The design of a social cohesion policy that deals with socio-geographic inequality rather than with ethnicized populations as such has been a subtle way of addressing the ethnic issue without directly calling into question the postulate of republican universalism. From this perspective, Audebert attempts to understand the role of place and social geography in the formalization of collective identities that have emerged in response to decades of public policies that have been unable to respond to the social, economic and political demands of ethnic minorities. He also attempts to analyse how the French state has relied on social geography as a way to address racial and ethnic issues without directly endowing them with an institutionalized dimension. His hypothesis is that the issue of social cohesion in contemporary France and the way it is dealt with by republican institutions is above all a matter of social geography. The French approach that gives prominence to the urban territorialization of social inequalities over the ethnic categorization approach remains firmly based on republican ideals. Nonetheless, such a policy is innovative in the French context, as it differs from the French traditional assimilationist model and takes into account social and cultural diversity in large metropolitan areas. Audebert's article provides a better understanding of the influence of this integration model on the construction of Otherness. It puts into relief the role of urban geography in the emergence of ethnicity and the design of innovative policy that addresses the issue of cultural diversity.

AB  - Contemporary public debates on social cohesion in Europe at both the European Union (EU) and member-state level tend to reduce the topic to the problem' of immigration by third-country nationals, and the integration of these immigrants and their descendants into European national societies. These debates often emphasize a culturalist perspective on the social cohesion of national societies based on core national cultures, identities and histories that pre-date the mass immigration of non-EU/European Economic Area immigrants, with social cohesion depending on their identifiable assimilation to this core set of values, beliefs and behaviours. This culture-based perspective on social cohesion has become an integral component of the neoliberal reorganization of the interventionist state in Europe that both punishes the native poor and coerces the immigrant third-country national as it frees markets and restructures the European welfare state. Yet, an examination of European social cohesion policies across seven policy domains suggests that the problem of social cohesion has little to do either with the issue of immigration or of immigrant and ethnic minority integration. However, it does have a lot to do with increasing inequalities and insecurities in European societies that result from neoliberal political economic policies. Drawing on Emile Durkheim's seminal discussion of social cohesion that includes structural and cultural dimensions, Boucher analyses the seven policy domains of European social cohesions within a functionalist framework that highlights inconsistencies, policy gaps and internal tensions between the domains. His analysis suggests the need for a more coherent, integrated and multilevel governance policy framework based on social justice, socio-economic equality and cultural diversity to achieve the elusive goal of social cohesion in Europe.

AB  - Although confrontations can be an effective means of reducing prejudicial responding, individuals often do not confront others due to the interpersonal costs. In the present research, we examined the intrapersonal implications of not confronting prejudice. In three studies, female participants were exposed to a confederate who made a sexist remark. Consistent with self-justification theories, in Study 1, participants who valued confronting and were given the opportunity to confront-but did not-subsequently made more positive evaluations of the confederate. Study 2 found that when participants were given a chance to affirm an important aspect of the self prior to evaluating the confederate, these inflated evaluations of the confederate did not occur. Finally, in Study 3, participants who initially valued confronting but did not confront a sexist partner reduced the amount of importance they placed on confronting. These data reveal that there are important intrapersonal consequences of not confronting prejudice.

AB  - Despite close relationships between men and women in daily lives, gender inequality is ubiquitous and often supported by sexist ideology. The understanding of potential bases of sexist ideology is thus important. According to Duckitt's dual-process model (2001), different worldviews may explain different types of sexist ideology. Individuals who hold a competitive world worldview tend to endorse group-based dominance. This lends itself to the endorsement of hostile sexism, because hostile sexism is an obvious form of male dominance. Conversely, individuals who hold a dangerous world worldview tend to adhere to social cohesion, collective security, and social traditions. This lends itself to the endorsement of benevolent sexism, because benevolent sexism values women who conform to gender norms. As predicted by Duckitt's model, research has shown that social dominance orientation, a general orientation towards the endorsement of group-based dominance, is closely associated with hostile sexism. Furthermore, right-wing authoritarianism, which measures adherence to social traditions, is closely associated with benevolent sexism. Due to the interdependent nature of gender relationships, the current research proposed that a relationship-based belief in hierarchy, deferential family norms, and norms depicting proper manners among family members should predict the endorsement of hostile and benevolent sexism, after controlling for social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism. As predicted, according to student samples collected in Taiwan and the US, the endorsement of deferential family norms predicted the endorsement of hostile sexism and of benevolent sexism, respectively. In addition, among men and women, social dominance orientation predicted hostile sexism more strongly (as opposed to benevolent sexism), whereas right-wing authoritarianism predicted benevolent sexism more strongly (as opposed to hostile sexism). Implications regarding relationship norms, social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and sexist ideology are discussed.
   En depit des relations intimes entre les hommes et les femmes dans la vie quotidienne, l'inegalite des genres est omnipresente et souvent soutenue par une ideologie sexiste. La comprehension des bases potentielles qui engendrent l'ideologie sexiste est, par consequent, importante. Selon le modele de double processus de Duckitt (2001), differentes visions du monde peuvent expliquer differents types d'ideologie sexiste. Les individus qui entretiennent une vision competitive du monde ont tendance a adherer a une dominance basee sur le groupe. L'adhesion a cette dominance mene a son tour a l'endossement d'un sexisme hostile parce que le sexisme hostile est une forme evidente de dominance masculine. Inversement, les individus qui entretiennent une vision dangereuse du monde ont tendance a adherer a la cohesion sociale, la securite collective et les traditions sociales. Cette adherence mene a son tour a l'endossement d'un sexisme bienveillant parce que le sexisme bienveillant valorise les femmes qui se conforment aux normes liees au genre. Tel que predit par le modele de Duckitt, la recherche anterieure a montre que l'orientation de dominance sociale, une orientation generale envers l'endossement d'une dominance basee sur le groupe, est etroitement associee avec le sexisme hostile. En outre, l'aile droite de l'autoritarisme, laquelle mesure l'adherence aux traditions sociales, est etroitement associee avec le sexisme bienveillant. En raison de la nature interdependante des relations entre les hommes et les femmes, la presente etude proposait qu'une croyance de hierarchie basee sur les relations, les normes familiales differentielles et les normes decrivant les manieres convenables entre les membres de la famille devraient predire l'endossement d'un sexisme hostile et bienveillant, apres avoir controle pour l'orientation de dominance sociale et l'autoritarisme de l'aile droite. L'etude fut realisee aupres d'echantillons d'etudiants de Taiwan et des Etats-Unis. Tel que predit, les resultats ont indique que l'adherence aux normes familiales differentielles predisait l'endossement du sexisme hostile et l'endossement du sexisme bienveillant, pour les participants taiwanais et americains. De plus, pour les hommes et les femmes, l'orientation de dominance sociale predisait plus fortement le sexisme hostile (par opposition au sexisme bienveillant), tandis que l'autoritarisme de l'aile droite predisait plus fortement le sexisme bienveillant (par opposition au sexisme hostile). Les implications pour les normes relationnelles, l'orientation de dominance sociale, l'autoritarisme de l'aile droite et l'ideologie sexiste sont discutees. A pesar de la estrecha relacion que existe entre hombres y mujeres en la vida cotidiana, la desigualdad de genero es omnipresente y a menudo esta apoyada por la ideologia sexista. La comprension de las posibles bases que conforman la ideologia sexista es, por lo tanto, importante. Segun el modelo del proceso dual de Duckitt (2001), distintas cosmovisiones pueden explicar los diferentes tipos de ideologia sexista. Las personas que tienen una cosmovision competitiva tienden a adherir a la dominacion basada en el grupo. El apoyo a la dominacion basada en el grupo, entonces, se presta a la adhesion al sexismo hostil, ya que el sexismo hostil es una forma evidente de dominacion masculina. Por el contrario, los individuos que tienen una vision peligrosa del mundo tienden a adherir a la cohesion social, la seguridad colectiva y las tradiciones sociales.
   El respaldo a la cohesion social, la seguridad colectiva y la tradicion social se presta, entonces, a la aprobacion del sexismo benevolente, dado que el sexismo benevolente valora a las mujeres que se ajustan a las normas de genero. Asi como fue predicho por el modelo de Duckitt, las investigaciones previas han demostrado que la orientacion a la dominacion social, una orientacion general hacia la adhesion a la dominacion basada en el grupo, esta estrechamente relacionada con el sexismo hostil. Aun mas, el autoritarismo de derecha, que determina la adherencia a las tradiciones sociales, esta estrechamente relacionado con el sexismo benevolo. Debido a la naturaleza interdependiente de las relaciones de genero, la presente investigacion propone que la creencia de la jerarquia basada en las relaciones, las normas familiares de deferencia, las normas que muestran buenos modales entre los miembros de la familia, deberia predecir el apoyo al sexismo hostil y benevolente, despues de controlar la orientacion a la dominancia social y el autoritarismo de derecha. Como predicho, de acuerdo a los datos recolectados de muestras de estudiantes de Taiwan y Estados Unidos, la adherencia a las normas familiares deferentes predicen la adhesion al sexismo hostil y el sexismo benevolente, respectivamente. Ademas, entre los hombres y mujeres, la orientacion a la dominacion social predijo con mas fuerza el sexismo hostil (en comparacion con el sexismo benevolente), mientras que el autoritarismo de derecha predijo mas significativamente el sexismo benevolente (en comparacion con el sexismo hostil). Se discuten las implicaciones respecto de las normas de relacionamiento, la orientacion a la dominacion social, el autoritarismo de derecha y la ideologia sexista.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze the effect of moral identity on prejudice in conjunction with moral inclusion/exclusion attitudes. In particular, the hypothesis is that even if high moral identity people tend to be less prejudicial than low moral identity people, this result can be explained with reference to moral inclusion/exclusion attitudes. A questionnaire was distributed to 192 Italian subjects. According to the hypothesis, results show that moral identity is negatively correlated with blatant prejudice, but that this effect is completely mediated by the perception of moral inclusion/exclusion with the other groups. These results suggest that it is not how morally you behave (symbolization), or the relevance you give to moral traits for your identity (internalization), that have an effect on prejudice, but rather it is who you include within the moral community within which moral values apply.

AB  - Researchers have demonstrated that unconscious prejudices around characteristics such as race, gender, and class are common, even among people who avow themselves unbiased. The authors present a method for teaching about implicit racial bias using online Implicit Association Tests. The authors do not claim that their method rids students of biases. Instead, the authors show that this approach helps students recognize that they and many other people may hold implicit biases that can affect perceptions and actions and realize that prejudice is not reducible to overt bigotry. The authors also show that the exercise helped some students recognize that talking about race and challenging unconscious associations are better methods of combating prejudice than simply pretending not to notice race. Qualitative and quantitative data reveal that the approach described here was effective in building students' understanding of unconscious prejudice.

AB  - By the 1990s, sociology faced a frustrating paradox. Classic work on mental illness stigma and labeling theory reinforced that the "mark" of mental illness created prejudice and discrimination for individuals and family members. Yet that foundation, coupled with deinstitutionalization of mental health care, produced contradictory responses. Claims that stigma was dissipating were made, while others argued that intervention efforts were needed to reduce stigma. While signaling the critical role of theory-based research in establishing the pervasive effects of stigma, both claims directed resources away from social science research. Yet the contemporary scientific foundation underlying both claims was weak. A reply came in a resurgence of research directed toward mental illness stigma nationally and internationally, bringing together researchers from different disciplines for the first time. I report on the general population's attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral dispositions that targeted public stigma and implications for the next decade of research and intervention efforts.

AB  - The ways in which national prototypes are defined constitute an important symbolic resource for maintaining hierarchy between groups within society. Two studies examined how New Zealanders downplayed or emphasized inclusionary versus exclusionary features of the national prototype. Study 1 tested a structural equation model indicating that people high in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) rated monocultural features that best fit an exclusionary (Anglo/European) ideal as characteristic of the national prototype (citizenship and ancestry, rugby/sporting culture). Simultaneously, people high in SDO also rated pluralistic features that were inclusive as less important for the national prototype (cultural awareness, liberal democratic values; n=95). Study 2 replicated and extended these opposing effects to show that they held controlling for Right-Wing Authoritarianism and patriotism (n = 258). People high in the competitive-driven motivation for group-based hierarchy and inequality position representations of the national prototype in ways that privilege some groups over others in defining who constitutes a 'true' citizen. This likely helps legitimize various subtle discriminatory and exclusionary practices directed toward recent immigrant groups, to the extent that such groups are seen as not really 'belonging' to the nation.

AB  - A meta-analysis of 46 studies (N = 12,939) examined the cross-sectional associations between dangerous worldview and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and between competitive worldview and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). These dual associations were asymmetric; the dangerous worldview-RWA partial-correlation was moderate (r = .37), whereas the competitive worldview-SDO partial-correlation was stronger in size (r = .53). The results support a dual-process model perspective and indicate that RWA and SDO are consistently linked with distinct social schemas of the social world as dangerous and threatening (versus safe and secure), and competitive and cut-throat (versus co-operative and characterized by mutually beneficial exchange). We present a refined competitive worldview scale that reduces content overlap and provides a more accurate estimate of the worldview-SDO association. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most theories addressing the topic have proposed that threat and fear underlie right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and many empirical findings have been consistent with this proposition. Important questions, however, remain unanswered, such as whether RWA is associated with fear and threat in general or only specific kinds of fear and threat. Theories of RWA generate markedly different predictions on this issue, particularly with respect to social or personal fears, and whether the association would also hold for the closely related construct of social dominance orientation (SDO). We investigated the issue by asking 463 undergraduate students to rate their feelings of fear, concern, and anxiety to a comprehensive 93-item list of potential fears and threats, which were formulated as either personal or social. Exploratory factors analysis identified five distinct fearthreat factors: Harm to Self, Child, or Country; Personal and Relationship Failures; Environmental and Economic Fears; Political and Personal Uncertainties; and Threats to Ingroup. All the fearthreat factors were correlated with RWA, with the strongest correlations being for Threats to Ingroup, and with stronger effects for social than for personal fears. None of the fear factors correlated with SDO. These relationships were not affected by controlling for Social Desirability or Emotional Stability (EMS). When the intercorrelations between fear factors and EMS were controlled using ridge regression, only Threats to Ingroup predicted RWA. Structural equation modeling indicated good fit for a model in which low levels of EMS had a significant path to Threats to Ingroup, which in turn had a significant path to RWA, and EMS having a significant though weak indirect (fully mediated) inverse effect on RWA. Implications of these findings for theories of authoritarianism and future research are discussed.

AB  - This mixed-methods study examined associations between prejudice events and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 382 lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGB) and 126 heterosexuals. Using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, we assessed PTSD with a relaxed Criterion A1; that is, we allowed events that did not involve threat to life or physical integrity to also qualify as traumatic. We first assessed whether exposure to prejudice-related qualifying events differed with respect to participants' sexual orientation and race. We found that White LGBs were more likely than White heterosexuals to encounter a prejudice-related qualifying event, and among LGBs, Black and Latino LGBs were no more likely than White LGBs to experience this type of event. We then used qualitative analysis of participants' brief narratives to examine prejudice events that precipitated Relaxed Criterion A1 PTSD among 8 participants. Two themes emerged: (a) the need to make major changes, and (b) compromised sense of safety and security following exposure to the prejudice event.

AB  - People's reactions to crimes sometimes change depending on whether the perpetrators are members of their own ingroup or an outgroup. This observation results in questions concerning how moral reasoning works in intergroup situations. In this research, we analyzed the combined effect of the nationality of the protagonist in a moral dilemma and the participant's social dominance orientation (SDO) attitudes on the participant's level of moral reasoning. A total of 230 Italian participants responded to two moral dilemmas taken from the Defining Issues Test, which had been modified so that one was about an Italian and the other about a Romanian. The results showed a significant interaction between the dilemma, the protagonist's nationality, and the participant's SDO: The P scores (postconventional reasoning) of low-SDO participants were on the same level when they were judging people of either nationality, while high-SDO participants tended to have a higher P score when judging Italians as opposed to Romanians.

AB  - The Stolen Generations are Indigenous Australians who were taken from their homes by the State and placed in children's homes or foster care. This study investigated relations between the values held by Non-Indigenous Australians and willingness to support a hypothetical organization set up to repair the damage caused. Participants (N = 235) completed the Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire followed by items concerning their perceived responsibility; Indigenous deservingness; feelings of pleasure, anger, guilt, regret, shame, and sympathy; their support for the organization; and how efficacious they expected their support would be. It was found at the bivariate level that support was positively associated with self-transcendence values (universalism, benevolence) and negatively associated with both self-enhancement (power, achievement, hedonism) and security values. A path analysis implied that universalism values influenced support via the justice-related variables of perceived responsibility and undeserved treatment, outcome expectations, negative emotions, and sympathy. This study contributes new information about the effects of values on personal willingness to repair past wrongs.

AB  - According to a literature of theory and advocacy, immigration and resettlement jeopardize the mental health of children and youth, largely because of factors such as intergenerational tensions arising from conflicts about the retention of traditional values, and experiences of prejudice and discrimination. The current study examines the specificity of these putative mental health risks to the immigration experience. The level and predictors of emotional problems among preadolescent Ethiopians living in immigrant families in Toronto, Canada, were compared with a matched sample of Ethiopian youngsters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data came from structured interviews with the person most knowledgeable about the family (usually a parent), as well as from the children themselves. Youth reported higher levels of emotional problems (EP) than their parents. Predictors differed for parent and child ratings. In both the Toronto and Addis Ababa samples, parental mental health predicted parent-rated, but not self-rated EP. Contrary to immigration stress theory, parental perceptions of prejudice predicted EP in Addis Ababa, but not Toronto, and parent-child discordance regarding ethnic adherence were predictors of self-rated emotional problems in Ethiopia, but not in Canada. Perceived discrimination was a significant predictor of self-rated emotional problems in both settings. Implications for theory and further research are discussed.

AB  - One of the ways in which therapists treat anxiety disorders is to expose patients to a fear-evoking stimulus within a safe environment before encouraging more positive stimulus-related thoughts. In the study reported here, we adapted these psychotherapeutic principles of exposure therapy to test the hypothesis that imagining a positive encounter with a member of a stigmatized group would be more likely to promote positive perceptions when it was preceded by an imagined negative encounter. The results of three experiments targeting a range of stigmatized groups (adults with schizophrenia, gay men, and British Muslims) supported this hypothesis. Compared with purely positive interventions, interventions in which a single negative encounter was imagined just prior to imagining a positive encounter resulted in significantly reduced prejudice. Furthermore, reduced anxiety uniquely derived from the mixed-valence imagery task statistically explained enhanced intentions to engage positively with the previously stigmatized group in the future.

AB  - We developed a multi-faceted prejudice habit-breaking intervention to produce long-term reductions in implicit race bias. The intervention is based on the premise that implicit bias is like a habit that can be broken through a combination of awareness of implicit bias, concern about the effects of that bias, and the application of strategies to reduce bias. In a 12-week longitudinal study, people who received the intervention showed dramatic reductions in implicit race bias. People who were concerned about discrimination or who reported using the strategies showed the greatest reductions. The intervention also led to increases in concern about discrimination and personal awareness of bias over the duration of the study. People in the control group showed none of the above effects. Our results raise the hope of reducing persistent and unintentional forms of discrimination that arise from implicit bias. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The right of initiative offers the opportunity to Swiss citizens to have a direct and prominent influence on penal policy. This research tries to evaluate the effect of social instability on social reaction to deviance using the results of the 2004 Swiss vote on the lifelong detention initiative. I determine that extreme right-wing political orientation (p < 0.001) and xenophobic attitudes such as national preference (p < 0.05) and preference for a closed country (p < 0.05) explain the support for this measure at the individual level. These results can be interpreted according to the Durkheimian view of punishment, which considers this process as an emotional response in order to defend established norms and values. At the macro-social level, social instability (p < 0.05) reinforces the positive relationship between xenophobic attitudes (p < 0.001) and support for lifelong detention. This result supports Young's theory concerning the effect of social instability on social reaction to deviance. Social instability would create a situation in which norms and values are contested. The need to reinforce these norms and values would be fostered by these circumstances.

AB  - This article presents an evolutionary framework for identifying the characteristics people use to categorize members of their social world. Findings suggest that fundamental social motives lead people to implicitly categorize social targets based on whether those targets display goal-relevant phenotypic traits. A mate-search prime caused participants to categorize opposite-sex targets (but not same-sex targets) based on their level of physical attractiveness (Experiment 1). A mate-guarding prime interacted with relationship investment, causing participants to categorize same-sex targets (but not opposite-sex targets) based on their physical attractiveness (Experiment 2). A self-protection prime interacted with chronic beliefs about danger, increasing participants' tendency to categorize targets based on their racial group membership (Black or White; Experiment 3). This work demonstrates that people categorize others based on whether they display goal-relevant characteristics reflecting high levels of perceived desirability or threat. Social categorization is guided by fundamental evolved motives designed to enhance adaptive social outcomes.

AB  - Empathy facilitates prosocial behavior and social understanding. Here, however, we suggest that the most basic mechanism of empathy-the intuitive sharing of other's emotional and motivational states-is limited to those we like. Measuring electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha oscillations as people observed ingroup vs outgroup members, we found that participants showed similar activation patterns when feeling sad as when they observed ingroup members feeling sad. In contrast, participants did not show these same activation patterns when observing outgroup members and even less so the more they were prejudiced. These findings provide evidence from brain activity for an ingroup bias in empathy: empathy may be restricted to close others and, without active effort, may not extend to outgroups, potentially making them likely targets for prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - In a series of five experiments, we demonstrate that exposure to information related to an out-group's heterogeneity reduces prejudice more effectively than exposure to only positive characteristics of the out-group. We exposed participants to a poster that associated both positive and negative traits with an out-group (mixed condition), to a poster that associated only positive traits with the out-group (positive condition), or to no poster (control condition). Results revealed that participants in the mixed condition expressed less explicit prejudice (Experiments 1-2) and less implicit bias (Experiments 3-4) than participants in the other two conditions. The last experiment demonstrated that the mixed poster was more acceptable and created less reactance than the positive poster. The results suggest that a persuasive message highlighting both the positive and negative characteristics of the out-group reduces prejudice more effectively because it is easily acceptable and yet effectively modifies people's representation of the out-group.

AB  - Two studies focused on the relationship between religiosity and intergroup bias. In Study 1, participants completed brief measures of religiosity and spirituality and attitudes toward religiously value-consistent in-groups (Christians, heterosexuals) and value-violating out-groups (atheists, Muslims, and gay men). As predicted, self-reported religiosity and spirituality correlated positively with more negative attitudes toward out-groups relative to in-groups. In Study 2, priming methods were used to examine whether activating cognitive representations of religion would affect intergroup bias. Individuals subliminally primed with religious words showed significantly larger increases in negative attitudes toward value-violating out-groups relative to attitudes toward in-groups than those primed with neutral words. This change in relative attitudes was due to simultaneous increases in in-group favoritism and out-group derogation. These effects remained when statistically controlling for self-reported religiosity and spirituality and preexisting attitudes toward these groups. Furthermore, there were no interaction effects between religious primes and self-reported levels of religiosity, indicating that the religion primes drove the effects. Results are discussed in light of religious priming and its association with increases in attitudes relevant to the social group component of religion.

AB  - Data from an Australian community survey (n=189) examining the predictors of prejudice against Muslim Australians were analysed. Using thematic analysis, we investigated the specific values our participants reported regarding their perceptions of Muslim Australians and Islam. We then investigated the relationship between prejudice against Muslim Australians, the most important value priorities given by our participants, and other prejudice-related variables. After entry into a regression analysis, the participants high in prejudice were found to be significantly more likely to have lower educational levels and more right-wing views. They were also significantly more likely to report high levels of national attitudes (i.e. stronger identification with Australian identity), concern about gender equality within the Muslim community, less concern about equality generally and report that Muslims were not conforming to Australian values. High prejudiced participants also scored higher in the reporting of negative media-related beliefs, were more likely to perceive higher support in the community for their views than was the case and were more negative towards Muslim men than Muslim women. The implications for anti-prejudice interventions are discussed. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study is the first contribution to the understanding of gender differences in best friendship patterns of adolescents sexual minorities. We explored friendship patterns, self-disclosure, and internalized sexual stigma in an Italian sample of lesbian (N = 202) and gay (N = 201) adolescents (aged 14-22 years). We found gender differences in cross-sex and cross-orientation patterns of best friendship. Gay men (52%) reported more cross-sex friendships than lesbians (20%). The 52% of participants had cross-orientation friendships, and no differences were found between lesbians and gay men. Lesbian and gay men with a cross-orientation best friend showed a lower level of internalized sexual stigma. Gay men with cross-orientation friendship showed a low level of internalized sexual stigma and less conflict with a best friend. For gay men and lesbian participants, self-disclosure to the best friend was better predicted by internalized sexual stigma and self-disclosure. Future studies may provide direct comparisons between heterosexual and sexual minority individuals. (C) 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marginalization and stigmatization heighten the vulnerability of sexual minorities to inequitable mental health outcomes. There is a dearth of information regarding stigma and mental health among men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. We adapted Meyer's minority stress model to explore associations between stigma and depression among MSM in South India. The study objective was to examine the influence of sexual stigma, gender non-conformity stigma (GNS) and HIV-related stigma (HIV-S) on depression among MSM in South India. A cross-sectional survey was administered to MSM in urban (Chennai) (n = 100) and semi-urban (Kumbakonam) (n = 100) locations in Tamil Nadu. The majority of participants reported moderate/severe depression scores. Participants in Chennai reported significantly higher levels of GNS, social support and resilient coping, and lower levels of HIV-S and depression, than participants in Kumbakonam. Hierarchical block regression analyses were conducted to measure associations between independent (GNS, HIV-S), moderator (social support, resilient coping) and dependent (depression) variables. Sexual stigma was not included in regression analyses due to multicollinearity with GNS. The first regression analyses assessed associations between depression and stigma subtypes. In Chennai, perceived GNS was associated with depression: in Kumbakonam enacted/perceived GNS and vicarious HIV-S were associated with depression. In the moderation analyses, overall GNS and HIV-S scores (subtypes combined) accounted for a significant amount of variability in depression in both locations, although HIV-S was only a significant predictor in Kumbakonam. Social support and resilient coping were associated with lower depression but did not moderate the influence of HIV-S or GNS on depression. Differences in stigma, coping, social support and depression between locations highlight the salience of considering geographical context in stigma analyses. Associations between HIV-S and depression among HIV-negative MSM emphasize the significance of symbolic stigma. Findings may inform multi-level stigma reduction and health promotion interventions with MSM in South India. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While previous studies have found that threats to masculinity are associated with aggression and anxiety in men, no studies have examined the effects of threat on perceptions of masculinity directly. Sixty heterosexually identified men were divided into the low sexual prejudice or high sexual prejudice group based on an index of sexual prejudice, and their masculine identity was either "threatened" or not in a 2 X 2 quasi-experimental design. We find that threats to masculinity differentially impact men who are high and low in sexual prejudice. Specifically, we find that men with low sexual prejudice react to masculinity threat by perceiving themselves to be more masculine, while men with high sexual prejudice react to threat by perceiving themselves to be less masculine on the Bern (1974) Sex Role Inventory, F(1, 56) = 4.58, p < .037, eta(2)(p) = .16. Implications of these patterns of results for aggression are discussed.

AB  - We tested the ability of white participants to encode and retain over a brief period of time information about the identity of white and black people, using faces as stimuli in a standard change detection task and tracking neural activity using electroencephalography. Neural responses recorded over the posterior parietal cortex reflecting visual working memory activity increased in amplitude as a function of the number of faces that had to be maintained in memory. Critically, these memory-related neural responses varied as a function of participants' implicit racial prejudice toward black people. High-prejudiced participants encoded black people faces with a lower degree of precision compared to low-prejudiced participants, suggesting that the class of mental operations affected by implicit racial prejudice includes basic cognitive mechanisms underpinning the encoding and maintenance of faces' visual representations in visual working memory.

AB  - Unstructured interactions between members of different ethnic groups are increasingly common, yet have received relatively little research attention. The present research examined whether membership of an ethnic majority/minority group and one's ethnic identification predicted perceptions of similarity with cross-group interaction partners. Each participant spoke individually with three members of another ethnic group in round-robin fashion. Analyses using the social relations model revealed that majority/minority status moderated the relationship between ethnic identification and similarity perceptions. Among minority participants, but not those from the majority, stronger ethnic identification was associated with less projection (perceived and assumed dissimilarity). Additional analyses revealed that, across both groups, stronger other-group orientation was correlated with more mirror effects (eliciting similarity perceptions from others).

AB  - An online diary study was used to examine the individual and situational variables that influence non-targets' verbal and nonverbal reactions and responses to sexually prejudiced remarks. Results indicated that anti-gay comments were extremely prevalent in a college setting and resulted in a range of reactions and behaviors. Confrontation of the perpetrator was predicted by the perceived offensiveness of the comment, perceived social pressure to confront, and the number of close same-sex attracted friends. Additionally, those who confronted felt more satisfied with their responses than those who did not confront. Implications for future research and prejudice reduction strategies are discussed.

AB  - Extant research has established numerous demographic, personal-history, attitudinal, and ideological correlates of sexual prejudice, also known as homophobia. The present study investigated whether Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality domains, particularly Openness, and FFM facets, particularly Openness to Values, contribute independent and incremental variance to the prediction of sexual prejudice beyond these established correlates. Participants were 117 college students who completed a comprehensive FFM measure, measures of sexual prejudice, and a demographics, personal-history, and attitudes-and-ideologies questionnaire. Results of stepwise multiple regression analyses demonstrated that, whereas Openness domain score predicted only marginal incremental variance in sexual prejudice, Openness facet scores (particularly Openness to Values) predicted independent and substantial incremental variance beyond numerous other zero-order correlates of sexual prejudice. The importance of integrating FFM personality variables, especially facet-level variables, into conceptualizations of sexual prejudice is highlighted. Study strengths and weaknesses are discussed as are potential implications for prejudice-reduction interventions.

AB  - A full cross-lagged panel design examined the bidirectional effects of the Big-Five personality dimensions on Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) over 9 months (N = 190 undergraduates). Consistent with the Dual Process Cognitive-Motivational Model, SDO and RWA exhibited markedly different personality bases. Low Agreeableness predicted change in the motivational goal for group-based dominance and superiority (SDO), whereas Openness to Experience predicted change in the motivational goal for social cohesion and collective security (RWA). Extending previous longitudinal research, this study indicates that the effect of personality on ideology is unidirectional, as RWA and SDO did not predict reciprocal prospective change in broad-bandwidth personality. These findings are consistent with a model in which relatively stable broad-bandwidth personality traits shape ideological attitudes over even relatively short time periods, and not the reverse.

AB  - This article explores the ways in which young, Black lesbians manage their sexual minority identity when experiencing sexual prejudice. Fourteen Black lesbians between the ages of 16 and 24 participated in semistructured interviews. Instances of sexual prejudice and the young women's responses were thematically analyzed using open and axial qualitative coding techniques. Results indicated that participants experienced sexual prejudice frequently and even within the lesbian community. Responses to sexual prejudice included: cognitive reframing of heterosexist messages, passing, gaining support from self-created gay families, and fighting back (physically and verbally) in the event of isolated instances of sexual prejudice. Analysis focuses on how gender identity relates to experiences of sexual prejudice and identity management strategies. Findings suggest that there are parallels between the management strategies of these women and young, Black gay and bisexual males and between these women and Black women who are coping with sexism and racism.

AB  - We develop a dynamic cognitive model of network activation and show that people at different status levels spontaneously activate, or call to mind, different subsections of their networks when faced with job threat. Using a multimethod approach (General Social Survey data and a laboratory experiment), we find that, under conditions of job threat, people with low status exhibit a winnowing response (i.e., activating smaller and tighter subsections of their networks), whereas people with high status exhibit a widening response (i.e., activating larger and less constrained subsections of their networks). We integrate traditional network theories with cognitive psychology, suggesting that cognitively activating social networks is a precondition to mobilizing them. One implication is that narrowing the network in response to threat might reduce low-status group members' access to new information, harming their chances of finding subsequent employment and exacerbating social inequality.

AB  - This research examined whether Person-Organization fit would mediate the relationships of Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism with the outcome variables of turnover intentions, satisfaction, and commitment. The study was conducted with a military sample and found that both Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism predict greater satisfaction, continuance and normative commitment and that these relationships were mediated by perceived Person-Organization fit. Furthermore, this relation was moderated by the interaction between Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism such that lower scores on Social Dominance Orientation increased the relation between Right-Wing Authoritarianism and P-O fit while higher scores on Social Dominance Orientation lowered that relation.

AB  - Although social exchange theory has been used to predict and explain attitudes toward tourists, it has been criticized for lacking theoretical sophistication. This research goes beyond social exchange theory to test a predictive model of attitudes toward tourists, incorporating the contact hypothesis and Integrated Threat Theory. It was hypothesized that positive attitudes toward tourism would be predicted by employment in industry, country of residence, and positive perceptions of tourism impacts. It was further hypothesized that more frequent and satisfying intercultural contact, lower perceptions of threat, more positive stereotypes and less intergroup anxiety would predict positive attitudes. Hierarchical regression analysis supported all hypotheses. The utility of Integrated Threat Theory in predicting attitudes is discussed, and recommendations for future research proposed.

AB  - Based on terror management theory, previous research has shown that terrorism threat increases prejudice against Muslims and is mediated by death-related thoughts. Because this effect was found on a correlational level, it remains unclear whether terrorism threat increases prejudice against Muslims because of enhanced death-related thoughts or the opposite: terrorism threat increases death-related thoughts because of stronger prejudice against Muslims. To disentangle this shortcoming, we varied death-related thoughts by systematically manipulating the belief in literal immortality. Using two studies, we found that participants exposed to terrorism pictures (vs. controls) had increased prejudice against both Muslims (Study 1) and immigrants (Study 2) when they were led to believe that literal immortality does not exist but not when they were led to believe that it does exist. Mediation analysis indicated that this effect was mediated by death-related thoughts. This provides further evidence that terrorism threat increases prejudice because of death-related thoughts.

AB  - Two general strategies for reducing prejudice are to approach equality and to avoid prejudice. The current research investigated the importance of matching two factors, contextual valence and regulatory focus, on the efficacy of these two strategies in reducing implicit prejudice. The findings demonstrate that although an approach strategy is more effective in decreasing prejudice on the Implicit Association Test in a positive rather than a negative context, an avoidance strategy is more effective in decreasing prejudice in a negative rather than a positive context (Study 1). In addition, the results show that although an approach strategy is more effective in decreasing prejudice when a promotion rather than a prevention focus is primed, an avoidance strategy is more effective in reducing prejudice when a prevention rather than a promotion focus is primed (Study 2). The implications of these findings for current interventions aimed at decreasing implicit prejudice are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Implicit social cognition refers to the mental processes that influence social perception and behavior independently of conscious awareness. To date, implicit social processes have been explained by single-system models of associations among concepts that, while addressing questions of information processing, are generally silent regarding the interface of implicit social processes with behavior. In this article, we present a multisystem model of implicit social cognition based on emerging cognitive neuroscience research on systems of learning and memory. This model describes how different underlying memory systems, characterized by different patterns of learning, unlearning, and behavioral expression, may contribute to implicit social processes. We describe how the memory systems model differs from previous theories of implicit social cognition and how it makes new and increasingly refined predictions regarding implicit sociocognitive processes and their influences on behavior.

AB  - Data from the 1996 and 2006 General Social Survey were analyzed to examine the relationship between the desire for social distance from individuals with mental illness and a number of factors that were thought to contribute to it, including perceptions of mental illness and dangerousness. Random samples of participants were assigned to one of four experimental conditions, in which they were read a vignette describing a character who presented with alcoholism, depression, schizophrenia, or minor problems. The desire for social distance from characters whose presenting problems were alcoholism or depression was significantly lower in 2006 than in 1996. The participants' perceptions that the character was mentally ill and/or dangerous to others partially mediated the association between presenting problem and social distance. Participants who were younger, white, better educated, and attended religious services more often required less social distance from the vignette characters than did their counterparts.

AB  - Two experiments tested the prediction that stigmatized individuals can avoid backlash when they confront others about bias if they first ask questions designed to activate self-affirmation processes. Experiment 1 showed that compared to a no-strategy control condition, highly prejudiced perceivers tended to express less desire to meet an Arab-American when he asked them to take his perspective on prejudice, but they expressed more desire to meet him when he asked self-affirming questions prior to making the perspective-taking request. Experiment 2 replicated this effect with a different affirmation and revealed that asking self-affirming questions reduced perceptions that the target was being confrontational when asking others to take his perspective. Together, these studies show that stigmatized targets can effectively challenge prejudiced individuals to reduce their biases if they first use a subtle strategy that reduces defensiveness.

AB  - Previous research suggested that Self-Determination Theory's distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic goal pursuits provides a partial explanation for individual differences in ethnic and racial prejudice in general and for individual differences in negative attitudes towards multiculturalism in particular. Negative attitudes towards multiculturalism would partly take root in valuing extrinsic over intrinsic goals. Results of the present study among university students (N = 440) suggest that the relationship between goal pursuit and multicultural ideology is less straightforward than previously assumed. Specifically, results suggest that it is moderated by differences in the causality orientation underlying people's goal pursuit, with multicultural ideology only being less positive among people predominantly pursuing extrinsic goals for controlled rather than autonomous reasons.

AB  - In research on religiosity and prejudice, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) has been studied alongside variables such as fundamentalism and orthodoxy. Four concerns regarding research on the relationship between RWA and religiosity are identified: (1) the overlap of religiosity and prejudice within the RWA scale; (2) the inflation of relationships by correlating part-whole measures; (3) covariation in the extremes of the construct hiding the possible independence of components within RWA; and (4) statistical artifacts arising in multiple regression from the combination of these factors. We elaborate these four issues and then demonstrate how they can lead to different interpretations of some previously published data. The article concludes with suggestions for the management and resolution of these issues that may allow RWA to continue to be used in religiosity and prejudice research and how it might evolve to become the boon to researchers that they seek.

AB  - Using data from the 2002/3 module of the European Social Survey project, this study examines the relationship between public views about immigrants' impact on crime and measures of criminal behavior in 21 countries of Europe. The results from hierarchical regression models show that perceptions about immigrants' impact are unaffected by personal experience with crime and by contextual measures such as the homicide rate, prison population rate, and ratio of foreign inmate to non-European foreign population. The analysis further reveals that perceived immigrants' impact on crime is sensitive to having friends among immigrants, residing in an ethnic neighborhood, having affinity with right-wing ideologies, as well as several socio-demographic characteristics. At the country level, perceptions that immigrants worsen crime problems are more evident in societies harboring larger stocks of non-European immigrants, but such views are not affected by economic circumstances. These findings imply that Europeans' expressions of concern regarding immigrants' impact on crime may be a guised form of prejudice against foreigners, as they seem to be nurtured less by fear of crime and more by fear of immigrants. The reported results are discussed with respect to the restrictiveness of immigration regimes and the practice of criminalizing foreigners.

AB  - Macroeconomic conditions have long been suspected of increasing hostility toward ethnic outgroups. Integrating prior work on macroeconomic threat with recent threat-based models of prejudice, the current work employs an experimental approach to examine the implications of economic threat for prejudice toward ethnic outgroups. In Study 1, participants primed with an economic threat (relative to a non-economic threat and neutral topic) reported more prejudice against Asian Americans, an ethnic group whose stereotype implies a threat to scarce employment opportunities. In addition, economic threat led to a heightened state of anxiety, which mediated the influence of economic threat on prejudice against Asian Americans. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings by demonstrating that economic threat heightened prejudice against Asian Americans, but not Black Americans, an ethnic group whose stereotype does not imply a threat to economic resources. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of macroeconomic conditions in potentiating antisocial responses to particular outgroups. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study proposes that broader social systemic factors could have a role in the perpetuation of two types of heterosexism. Old-fashioned and modern heterosexism are discussed and differentiated. The roles of social dominance orientation and the acceptance of structural violence in the maintenance of heterosexism are explored. Results indicated that social dominance orientation and the acceptance of structural violence predicted the level of old-fashioned and modern heterosexism in a sample of 129 people. Acceptance of structural violence better predicted both modern and old-fashioned heterosexism than did social dominance orientation. Such relationships highlight the possibility that social systemic beliefs may create and support heterosexism.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between national identity and in-group/out-group attitudes with Bosniak and Serbian children living in Bosnia. In total, 89 Bosniak (n = 49) and Serbian (n = 40) children aged 7 and 11 years participated in the study. They were presented with the national identity and the in-group/out-group attitudes scale. The data show that the older children attached less importance to their national identity than the younger children. On three out of six scales, Serbian children attributed greater importance to national identity than Bosniak children did. In addition, Bosniak as well as Serbian children attributed more positive characteristics to their own in-group than to the out-groups. They also ascribed more negative adjectives to the out-groups than the in-group. There were no effects for age. The findings show that the relationship between in-group favouritism and out-group derogation is present with Bosniak but not with Serbian children.

AB  - Threat perceptions are associated with politically conservative attitudes. Research has also found that specific forms of threat perception (e. g., concerns about pathogens) are associated with functional reactions (e. g., anti-fat prejudice). Recently, moral intuitions have been implicated in explaining political orientation: Liberals tend to place greater weight on "individualizing foundations" (justice and care concerns) in particular, whereas conservatives tend to place high weight on "binding foundations" (loyalty, respect, and purity concerns) as well. A recent study attempted to integrate the above strands of research by showing that the effect of threat perceptions on conservatism is mediated by a tendency to place relatively greater weight on the binding foundations. The present study was intended to replicate and extend past research by testing (a) whether concerns about pathogens predict conservatism and anti-fat prejudice and (b) whether those effects are mediated by a tendency to place relatively greater weight on the binding foundations.

AB  - The construction of the 'black Other' can perhaps best be characterized as a politically motivated pattern of argumentation in colonial discourse. It was crystallized in the reality of German colonial rule in Africa between 1884 and 1914-18. The achievement of German colonial rule in Africa was considered a task of national importance; and colonial rule could be justified by employing an image of the Other. However, this deployment of the Other should not be seen as merely a political strategy in the context of the power politics of colonization. It also brought into focus widely held racist views of the world. The history of German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of 'culture' and 'civilization', concepts that had their origins in the Enlightenment. This cultural-missionary project declared colonial expansion to be a type of humanitarian intervention and an educational endeavour. This was in sharp contrast to the racism, based on social Darwinism, that claimed Germany's undeniable right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the 'survival of the fittest'.

AB  - Terror management research shows that death reminders (mortality salience) increase prejudice toward worldview violators. Two studies investigated whether death reminders exacerbated differences in heterosexual men's and women's reports of sexual prejudice (negative attitudes based on sexual orientation). Results showed that following death reminders, sex differences in anti-gay discrimination and affective prejudice toward gay men (but not toward lesbians) were larger, and that these increased sex differences were mediated by gender role beliefs. The current studies suggest that researchers may attenuate the effects of death reminders by lessening the perceived worldview violation in addition to alleviating the existential terror of death.

Responses to open-ended questions about what makes them think a person is and is not prejudiced and general advice for Whites were collected from a total of 236 African American university students. The most common behaviors listed that indicated prejudice included name calling and stereotyping. Indications of nonprejudice included positive behaviors (smiling, helping), equal treatment, and seeking out interaction with minorities. Respondents also advised Whites to be authentic. Results also indicated that common impression management behaviors by Whites may backfire. Results are discussed in terms previous research and the complicated nature of interracial interactions.

AB  - Two hundred and twenty-six heterosexual participants (115 women and 111 men) were asked to indicate their attitude toward gender-roles, their perceived similarities with gay men, and their attitude toward gay men (i.e., sexual prejudice). As expected, male participants showed more sexual prejudice than female participants, and perceived dissimilarities were related to a greater sexual prejudice. Support for gender-roles was related to sexual prejudice for male participants, but not for female participants. More interestingly, the three-way interaction suggested that perceived similarities moderated the link between gender-roles and sexual prejudice among heterosexual men, but not among heterosexual women. Attitude in favor of traditional gender-roles was related to sexual prejudice for male participants who perceived gay men as different, but not for those who perceived gay men as similar. These findings are discussed in terms of the defensive function of men's attitude toward homosexuality as a result of threat to masculinity.

AB  - Utilizing moderated hierarchical multiple regression analyses, the researchers examined the relative roles of right wing authoritarianism (RWA), religious fundamentalism (RF), general religiosity, sex, gender role traits, and self-discrepancy along gender role traits in predicting multiple dimensions of prejudice toward homosexuals. The goal was to identify gender-specific correlates of homosexual prejudice. Findings revealed that RWA exhibited a consistently positive relationship with prejudice, which along the Condemnation-Tolerance dimension of prejudice was stronger for men. Also, RF's and general religiosity's relationship with prejudice was consistently fully mediated by the presence of RWA. Gender roles were inconsistently correlated with dimensions of prejudice, and the interaction of masculine gender roles and perceived self-discrepancy from gender roles was only significant in predicting the Condemnation-Tolerance homosexual prejudice scale. Lastly, for females, general religiosity was a significant positive predictor for only the Condemnation-Tolerance and Neutral Contact Apprehension homosexual prejudice scales. Implications are reviewed related to authoritarianism as a universal correlate of homosexual prejudice, RF's and RWA's distinctiveness, perceived self-discrepancy from masculine gender roles as a male-specific correlate of homosexual prejudice, and general religiosity as a female-specific correlate.

AB  - Perception-action-coupling refers to the vicarious activation of the neural system for action during perception of action, and is considered important for forms of interpersonal sensitivity, including empathy. We hypothesize that perception-action-coupling is limited to the ingroup: neural motor networks will fire upon the perception of action, but only when the object-person belongs to the ingroup; if the object-person belongs to an outgroup these motor neurons will not fire. Using electroencephalographic oscillations as an index of perception-action-coupling, we found exactly this: participants displayed activity over motor cortex when acting and when observing ingroups act, but not when observing outgroups - an effect magnified by prejudice and for disliked groups (South-Asians, then Blacks, followed by East Asians). These findings provide evidence from brain activity for yet another detrimental aspect of prejudice: a spontaneous and implicit simulation of others' action states may be limited to close others and, without active effort, may not be available for outgroups.

AB  - The current work examined factors that contribute to positive interracial interactions. It argues that the source of people's motivation to respond without prejudice and the goals and strategies they pursue in interracial interactions influence the quality of these interactions. Three studies show that non-Black participants who are highly internally motivated to respond without prejudice tend to focus on strategies and behaviors in interactions with Black people that approach a positive (i.e., egalitarian) outcome. As a result of engaging in these approach behaviors, their interracial interactions go more smoothly for both themselves and their interaction partners as compared to people less internally motivated. In contrast, externally motivated people tend to focus on avoiding negative (i.e., prejudiced) outcomes, which ironically results in their coming across to their partners as prejudiced. The implications of the findings for smoothing out the rocky road to positive intergroup interactions are discussed.

AB  - Religious fundamentalism has been consistently linked to prejudice toward a variety of outgroups. This article proposes that this is partially the case because fundamentalist ideology provides a sense of consistency and closure. Outgroups that challenge the epistemic certainty that fundamentalism provides are rejected in an effort to protect this certainty. Results from two studies, including one using a nationally representative sample, found that the need for closure was related to fundamentalism and partially mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and the derogation of lesbians and gays (Study I) and value violators in general (Study 2). Furthermore, in Study 2, it was found that only some aspects of the need for closure explain the fundamentalism-prejudice relationship. Results are discussed in relation to past need for closure and ideology research as well as what this means for the study of fundamentalism.

AB  - The present research examined the invariance hypothesis, which predicts lower levels of social dominance orientation (SDO) for women compared to men even when accounting for other factors. Previous research shows that gender linked variables mediate the gender difference in SDO. In two studies using undergraduates in the northeastern U.S., we tested mediation by cognitive complexity, a variable linked to social status but not to gender. Study 1 (n = 117) found that women had higher levels of attributional complexity, but not need for cognition. Study 2 (n = 206) further found that attributional complexity mediated the relationship between gender and SDO, suggesting that higher cognitive complexity due to low social status may be involved in gender differences in SDO.

AB  - The household registration system (Hukou) implemented by the Chinese government divides the Chinese society into two groups: urban residents and rural residents. Since the 1980s, millions of rural residents have migrated to cities without official permission. In this paper, we investigate urban residents' subtle prejudice towards rural-to-urban migrants. Specifically, the impacts of urban residents' socioeconomic status (SES) and their perception of migrants' adaptation styles are examined. A sample including 457 Chinese urban residents is taken from four cities in China. Educational and occupational levels are used to indicate urban residents' SES. Four adaptation styles (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) are manipulated by using vignettes. The results show that SES has a negative impact on urban residents' subtle prejudice. This link is further moderated by urban residents' perceptions of migrants' adaptations: the negative effect of SES on subtle prejudice holds only under a perception of integration or assimilation and disappears under a perception of separation or marginalization.

AB  - Theoretically, ambivalent sexism maintains gender hierarchy through benevolence toward conforming women but hostility toward nonconforming women. Men have shown ambivalent sexism to sex-typed vignettes describing "chaste" and "promiscuous" women (Sibley and Wilson 2004). This study of 117 Florida male and female undergraduate participants examined whether, benefiting more from gender hierarchy, men respond more extremely. If sexism supports gender hierarchy, social dominance also should moderate ambivalent sexism. Sexual self-schema (detailed, self-confident sexual information-processing) might moderate men's and women's hostility. Supporting ambivalent sexism theory, women's hostility targeted the promiscuous character, but their benevolence targeted the chaste character, with men unexpectedly differentiating less. Social dominance enhanced Hostile Sexism and its differentiating the two female subtypes. Sexual self-schema moderated women's but not men's hostility.

AB  - The nature of social cognition-how we "know about" the social world-is one of the most deceptively obvious problems for sociology. Because we know what we know, we often think that we know how or why we know it. Here, we investigate one particular aspect of social cognition, namely, what we will call "political ideology"-that is, people's self-placement on a dimension on which persons can be arrayed from left to right. We focus on that understanding that is in some ways the "ur-form" of social cognition-our sense of how we stand by others in an implicit social formation whose meaning is totally relational. At the same time, these self-conceptions seem to be of the greatest importance for the development of the polity and of civil society itself. Our question is, when citizens develop such a "political ideology," what does this mean, and what do they do with it? We examine what citizens gain from their subjective placement on the dimension from liberalism to conservatism by using the results of a survey experiment that alters aspects of a hypothetical policy.

AB  - Individual differences in preference for consistency (PFC) and their interplay with situational variables were studied in relation to effects of counter-attitudinal advocacy on prejudice. German adults (N = 202) who initially had relatively high prejudice toward Turks generated counter-attitudinal arguments favoring integrated housing of Turks and Germans. Freedom of choice (low, high) and self-threat (low, high) were manipulated; PFC (low, high) was measured and used as a third independent variable. Control participants generated arguments on a neutral topic. Dependent variables were discomfort at integrated housing and generalized prejudice toward Turks. Results showed that PFC moderated effects of choice and self-threat: Discomfort and prejudice were lowest for high-PFC participants who had generated counter-attitudinal arguments under high choice and high self-threat.

AB  - Self-concept is accessible information that can be used when facing a demanding task. Based on findings suggesting that effects observed in Implicit Association Tests (IATs) could be partially explained by the procedural features of the task, we investigated the role of participants' self-inclusion in target categories for group IATs. We propose that IAT constraints lead participants to use self-relevant heuristics related to their membership of target categories in order to respond rapidly, which contributes to IAT group preferences. Thus positive IAT effects should dramatically diminish if participants were induced not to use self-related heuristics. Study 1 showed that when mapping outgroup names and idiosyncratic characteristics of participants onto the same category during the IAT task, the IAT effect no longer occurs. Study 2 replicated these findings when associating outgroup-participants' idiosyncratic characteristics prior to the completion of the standard IAT. Therefore inhibiting the use of self-related heuristics reduces IAT effects. The implications of our results for the construct validity of prejudice IATs are discussed.

AB  - People with albinism are prone to experiencing negative attitudes from society, including stigma and discrimination, which place them at risk of mental health-related challenges. This exploratory study expanded and deepened our understanding of people with albinism by examining in-depth the experiences of women with albinism residing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The study utilized community-based descriptive cross-sectional and mixed data collection methods to identify the unique experiences of women with albinism. Findings indicate that women with Albinism experience stress and adversity at some point throughout their lives. This study showed that threats to their safety, discrimination, and abuse affect this population physically and bring profound psychological/emotional impacts. Myths and misconceptions about albinism have laid the foundation for the present prejudices and social stigma, thus requiring increased efforts at public education regarding albinism in Tanzania. Points of interest This article explores the unique experiences of women with albinism in Tanzania; albinism might be an additional factor to others which might contribute to the development of mental health challenges. This study also contributes to research on people with albinism in Tanzania by examining the unique experiences of women from their own voices. The present study focuses on psychological problems and provides awareness on risks the population faces regarding their general mental health. Understanding the experiences and psychological impacts of such experiences to people with albinism, particularly women, may impart knowledge to service providers and society at large. The study found that personal threats to the life of women with albinism or other people with albinism are significant sources of trauma which causes major distress at the time of the experience and in the months following experiences.

AB  - Hate speech recognizers (HSRs) can be the panacea for containing hate in social media or can result in the biggest form of prejudice-based censorship hindering people to express their true selves. In this paper, we hypothesized how massive use of syntax can reduce the prejudice effect in HSRs. To explore this hypothesis, we propose Unintended-bias Visualizer based on Kermit modeling (KERM-HATE): a syntax-based HSR, which is endowed with syntax heat parse trees used as a post-hoc explanation of classifications. KERM-HATE significantly outperforms BERT-based, RoBERTa-based and XLNet-based HSR on standard datasets. Surprisingly this result is not sufficient. In fact, the post-hoc analysis on novel datasets on recent divisive topics shows that even KERM-HATE carries the prejudice distilled from the initial corpus. Therefore, although tests on standard datasets may show higher performance, syntax alone cannot drive the "attention" of HSRs to ethically-unbiased features.

AB  - Purpose A consensus in the literature is that anti-gay prejudice has a negative impact on HIV programming for men who have sex with men (MSM). This paper aims to analyse the prevalence and predictors of anti-gay prejudice in Barbados, an island in the Caribbean, and possible impacts on the full recognition of the right to health care. Design/methodology/approach The study used nationally representative data obtained from the Caribbean Development Research Services capturing anti-gay prejudice in Barbados in 2004, 2013 and 2019. The data were analysed using logit models and ordinary least squares regression. Findings The share of persons who expressed feelings of hatred towards gays and lesbians did not change significantly over the period. Social distance attitudes improved between 2004 and 2013 but have not changed since. Men generally expressed more prejudice than women and male sexual prejudice could be localised to three groups - men without tertiary education, men under 51 and members of non-Christian religions. Meanwhile, there was little consistency in the predictors of women's attitudes over the period. Originality/value This study provides insights into the trends in attitudes towards sexual minorities in a developing country. The main conclusion is that although health care is provided as a universal right to all Barbadians, a strictly medical approach to HIV prevention among MSM in countries with high levels of anti-gay prejudice is insufficient.

AB  - Migration is the basis for development-economic, social, and psychological. In this paper I will examine borders on migration that entail the ambivalent relating by the societal context of migration to the act of movement of the people who become migrants, and their counterparts ("counter-migrants") who do not. My focus on the issue stems from my theory of Cultural Psychology of Semiotic Dynamics that can deal with the process of becoming, being, and feeling as "migrant" or "counter-migrant". A societal rule system is fortified by the system of social representations of the people who-by the act of moving from one place to another-are designated to become migrants by the rule systems of the non-migrants. Cultural psychology contributes to the study of the emerging prejudices and ways of their overcoming by the non-migrant local recipients as well as to the ambivalences of the persons who move to the relating with the social role "migrant" and its overcoming. Historically speaking-we as the species of Homo sapiens are all migrants-only at differing times and circumstances.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused distress in students globally. The mental health of international students studying abroad has been neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially Chinese students who have been unfairly targeted. Objective: To explore and document the positive and negative experiences of a group of Hong Kong Chinese international students studying in the U.K. and U.S. from an insider perspective in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The qualitative study used four 1.5-h online focus group interviews of 20 Chinese international students from Hong Kong aged 18 or older studying in universities in the United Kingdom or the United States, from 3 May to 12 May 2020. A framework approach with a semi-structured interview guide was used to reflect students' stressors, cognitive appraisals, coping, and outcomes (negative impacts and positive gains), in the early stages of COVID-19. Different strategies were used to ensure the credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability of the study. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic content analysis. Results: Twenty full-time international University students (60% female, 90% aged 18-25 years and 65% undergraduates) were recruited. Students reported (i) stress from personal (e.g., worries about health and academic attainment), interpersonal (e.g., perceived prejudice and lack of social support), and environmental factors (e.g., uncertainties about academic programme and unclear COVID-19-related information); (ii) significant differences in culture and cognitive appraisal in the levels of perceived susceptibility and severity; (iii) positive thinking and using alternative measures in meeting challenges, which included effective emotion and problem coping strategies, and the importance of support from family, friends and schools; and (iv) negative psychological impact (e.g., worries and stress) and positive personal growth in crisis management and gains in family relationships. Conclusions: With the rise in sinophobia and uncertain developments of the pandemic, proactive support from government and academic institutions are urgently needed to reduce stress and promote the well-being of international students, especially Chinese students in the U.K. and U.S. Clear information, public education and policies related to the pandemic, appropriate academic arrangements from universities and strong support systems play important roles in maintaining students' psychological health. Clinical Trial Registration: The study was registered with the National Institutes of Health (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier: NCT04365361).

AB  - The present study used EEG/ERPs to detect the activation of implicit stereotypical representations associated to other-race (OR) people and the modulation of such activation through the previous presentation of positive vs. neutral social information. Electrophysiological signals were recorded in 40 Italian Caucasian participants, unaware of the overall study's purpose. They were presented with 285 sentences that could either violate, non-violate (e.g., "the Roma girl was involved in a robbery) or be neutral with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning other-race people (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabic). ERPs were time-locked to the terminal words. Prior to the sentence reading task, participants were exposed to a 10 minutes colourful video documentary. While the experimental group was presented a video containing images picturing other-race characters involved in "prestigious" activities that violated stereotypical negative assumptions (e.g. a black neurosurgeon leading a surgery team), the control group viewed a neutral documentary about flora and fauna. EEG signals were then recorded during the sentence reading task to explore whether the previous exposure to the experimental video could modulate the detection of incongruence in the sentences violating stereotypes, as marked by the N400 response. A fictitious task was adopted, consisted in detecting rare animal names. Indeed, only the control group showed a greater N400 response (350-550 ms) to words incongruent with ethnic stereotypes compared to congruent and neutral ones, thus suggesting the presence of a racial bias. No N400 response was found for the experimental group, suggesting a lack of negative expectation for OR individuals. The swLORETA inverse solution, performed on the prejudicerelated N400 showed that the Inferior Temporal and the Superior and Middle Frontal Gyri were the strongest N400 intra-cortical sources. Regardless of the experimental manipulation, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500-600 ms) compared to incongruent and neutral ones and a late frontal positivity (650-800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences involving OR than own-race characters (either congruent or incongruent with the prejudice) thus possibly indicating bias-free perceptual in-group/out-group categorization processes. The data showed how it is possible to modulate a pre-existing racial prejudice (as reflected by N400 effect) through exposure to positive media-driven information about OR people. Further follow-up studies should determine the duration in time, and across contexts, of this modulatory effect.

AB  - Contemporary writers have taken enormous steps in an effort to re-define and focalize on the prejudiced presentation of the African woman in African literature, with themes that advocate and improve the state of the woman to fully partake in and undeniably, lead socio-political struggles in her society. The study, therefore, aims to explore the Feminist approach to Stylistics as a theoretical framework in addressing the issue of gender inequality by identifying the linguistic features of Free Indirect Discourse in the novel, Children of the Eagle (2002) by Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo. Major findings from the study include; Adimora-Ezeigbo's use of Free Indirect Discourse is dynamic in her representation of women in the text; education is an important tool for accomplishing the goals of gender equality, advancement and unity. Women must also be encouraged and integrated in the areas of leadership, political activities and electoral process by providing leadership skills through gender-sensitive training.

TI  - Which Narrative Strategies Durably Reduce Prejudice? Evidence from Field and Survey Experiments Supporting the Efficacy of Perspective-Getting
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - EFFICIENT
KW  - DESIGN
AB  - Exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups contribute to social and political challenges worldwide. Previous field experiments found that interpersonal conversations employing multiple narrative strategies can durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. We theoretically distinguish between three of these narrative strategies: narratives which promote analogic perspective taking, vicarious perspective-giving, and perspective-getting. Previous research has assigned these strategies together in a compound treatment, leaving open important theoretical and practical questions about each's effectiveness. We present results from three field studies and a survey experiment that individually manipulate their presence. Across the field studies, we find omitting prompts to engage in analogic perspective-taking and vicarious perspective-giving does not diminish effects; conversations employing only perspective-getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. Results from within-subject analyses and a survey experiment similarly show that perspective-getting consistently reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple mechanisms. These results refine theoretical understandings of prejudice reduction and support facilitating perspective-getting in conversations intended to reduce exclusionary attitudes.

AB  - Objective This study examines the improvement of U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) European ancestry groups in the post-World-War II United States, applying the idea that prejudice against these groups was due to racial/ethnic prejudice and social class prejudice. Methods Analyzing data from the Bogardus surveys and other published sources, the study tests the proposition that U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward SCE European ancestry groups improved because social class prejudice against these groups diminished as the groups' educational attainment levels increased from the second- to third-generations. Results Contrary to modernization and classical assimilation theories, the favorable trend in U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward SCE European ancestry groups was unaffected by the groups' intergenerational educational mobility. Conclusion The decline in prejudice against SCE European ancestry groups in the postwar United States resulted from a decrease in racial/ethnic prejudice against these groups, independently of social class prejudice.

The issue includes six articles comprising multilingual school children, youth, university students, adult migrants, and indigenous minorities. Several of the articles focus on second language acquisition, use and assessment, while others deal more with social issues, including unequal power relations and prejudices that newcomers encounter in everyday life.

AB  - Social workers often experience higher levels of burnout compared with other healthcare professionals. The capacity to manage one's own emotional reactions efficiently, frequently in complex care settings, is central to the role of social workers. This article highlights the complexity of emotions in social work research and practice by exploring the perspective of emotional intelligence. The article is both theoretical and empirical, based on reflections from a qualitative longitudinal study interviewing fathers with behavioural and criminal backgrounds, all in their 40 s. The analysis contains an exploration of the researcher position that illuminates the reflective, emotional aspects that took place within this interview process. Three overall themes emerged - first: Recognising emotional complexity; second: Reflecting on emotional themes; and third: Exploring my own prejudices and preconceptions. The findings apply to both theoretical and practical social work, addressing the need to understand emotions as a central part of critical reflection and reflexivity. The argument is that emotions have the potential to expand awareness of one's own preconceptions, related to normative societal views. This form of analytical awareness entails identifying and paying attention to one's own, sometimes embodied, emotional triggers.

AB  - Recent migrations of East European Roma have exacerbated the currently widespread phenomenon of antiziganism in Europe, but there are cultural, social, political, and historical factors in the various European countries that may affect reactions to Roma in diverse ways. This study aims to compare the attitudes of two groups of 198 young Italian and French people towards Romanian Roma. Stereotypical representations, affective reactions, and levels of cognitive and affective ambivalence were assessed. The results showed a univalent prejudice even if the attitudes of the Italian participants were more unfavourable than those expressed by their French peers. The data showed a similar stereotypical image of the outgroup but different intensities in the affective variables assessed. Italian and French participants were cognitively but not affectively ambivalent towards the Romanian Roma, and the difference between the two levels of cognitive ambivalence was not statistically significant. Potential social factors, such as the history of migration or the political agenda setting, are hypothesized as the origin of the differences in the intensities of Italian and French participants' feelings towards the Romanian Roma.

AB  - The present study conducted in the Netherlands examines citizen's attitudes towards asylum seekers. We collected data in a large (N=993) heterogeneous adult sample in November 2015, in the midst of the European "refugee crisis". Our first aim was to map the reactions of citizens towards asylum seekers. Our second aim was to examine the role of right-wing ideological attitudes (i.e., Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation) in explaining these reactions. With respect to the first research aim, it was revealed that, on average, our respondents were rather unwilling to help asylum seekers. Moreover, respondents were more welcoming towards legitimate asylum seekers (who are on the run from war and violence in their home country) compared to economic asylum seekers. With respect to the second research aim, we found that right-wing attitudes were related to stronger negative reactions towards asylum seekers. Moreover, individuals higher on right-wing ideological attitudes were more likely to perceive asylum seekers as being economic asylum seekers and less as legitimate asylum seekers, which related to stronger feelings of threat and ultimately, to more negative reactions towards asylum seekers.

AB  - Members of high-status groups (e.g., men) often lead social justice efforts that seek to benefit low-status groups (e.g., women), but little is known about how observers respond to such instances of visible and influential solidarity. We presented information about a nonprofit organization seeking to address gender (Study 1, N = 198) or racial (Study 2, N = 216) inequality, in which the leadership team was manipulated to include a numerical majority of either high-status group members or low-status group members. Members of low-status groups who read about the majority high-status leadership team reported lower levels of collective action intentions, compared with those who read about the majority low-status leadership team. Mediation analyses (Studies 1 and 2) and an experimental-causal-chain design (Study 3, N = 405) showed that lower collective action intentions in response to the majority high-status leadership team were mediated by participants' perception of a specific problem presented by high-status group leaders (lower awareness of inequality) and lower levels of hope. Study 4 (N = 555) demonstrated that low-status group members responded more negatively to a majority high-status leadership team in an organization seeking to benefit their low-status ingroup (solidarity context), compared with organizations seeking to benefit other groups (nonsolidarity contexts). Results provide the first evidence that the presence of influential high-status group leaders can discourage members of low-status groups from joining a social justice effort that seeks to benefit their ingroup, and that these negative responses extend beyond preferences predicted by frameworks of ingroup bias and role congruity.

AB  - This article discusses dis/ability and physical education teacher education (PETE). The aim is twofold. First, I explore how dis/ability is problematised in PETE syllabi from nine Swedish universities. Bacchi's What's the problem represented to be? approach for analysing policy texts is used. The centre of attention thus shifts from a problem and its solution, to how a phenomenon is made into a problem and to the effects of this problematisation. Second, a theoretical framework that corresponds better with the aims of the steering documents advising Swedish compulsory schools and PETE is proposed.
   In the analysis, two dominant problem representations were discerned. First, pupils with impairment or special needs are constructed as the problem. When pupils with impairment are problematised, they risk being constructed as deviant and marginal in PE. This is reinforced by the fact that, in some cases, the subject is dealt with in only a few pages of text and as part of a single course. Second, power relations, norms or inequality are constructed as the problem. Thus, the focus shifts from the pupils' reduced physical, cognitive or neuropsychiatric ability to the interactions with able-bodied teachers and peers. Bacchi also asks where the silences are in the texts. The notion of disability, caused by social barriers such as inaccessibility and prejudices, is completely missing. Moreover, ableism - discrimination that favours being able-bodied - is not explicitly dealt with, not even when the syllabi bring up power relations or norms.
   A change within PETE is required, with inclusive education as the goal. I suggest that both the effects of impairment and ableism, which lead to disabilities, need to be taken into account. Cripistemologies - that is, the knowledge of disabled people - would be useful in this process, as a way to dismantle ableism and appreciate differences.

AB  - People with Albinism tend to face multiple adverse physical, psychological and social consequences. Very little is known about experiences of women with Albinism and their deliberations whilst making reproductive decisions. This study aimed to explore lived experiences of women with Albinism and to understand their perspectives on reproductive decision making. Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten women with Albinism in Taiwan. Five key themes emerged from the accounts which were centred around the sense of discrimination that they felt whilst growing up, their strive for normality, making difficult choices in their reproductive decisions, desire to protect children from harm and reflections of parenting struggles from own experiences and the experiences of their parents. We call for global and national policy makers and practitioners to introduce explicit measures to challenge the myths, stereotypes and prejudices associated with Albinism including specific interventions towards supporting women in pregnancy decision making. Points of interest
   Very little is known about the lived experiences of women with Albinism and their deliberations whilst making reproductive decisions.
   The research found that a key element of the overall experience is the sense of discrimination that the women had to face due to their physical appearance and visual impairment.
   Most women actively attempted to fight off notions of abnormality and to keep their identity close to what they perceived as normal.
   The women with and without children viewed pregnancy decisions as making difficult choices. Having a child who would not inherit Albinism was a key influence in pregnancy decisions.
   They strongly desired to protect the children from the difficult experiences that they have had.
   The research recommended that global and national policy makers and practitioners should introduce explicit measures to challenge the myths, stereotypes and prejudices associated with the condition including specific interventions towards supporting women in pregnancy decision making.

AB  - Scholarship produced by psychologists typically focuses on one area of social identity and oppression per study (e.g., only sexism) with very little intersectional analysis across systemic oppression and privilege. To better understand the intersecting patterns of ally behavior, we examined online confrontation behavior by privileged individuals in response to antigay, antitransgender, and racist comments. Study 1 explored rates and types of confrontation during encounters with anti-Mexican and antigay comments. Study 2 used an experimental design to assess rates and types of confrontation of anti-Arab and antitransgender comments in the presence of a second confederate who either confronted the prejudice or remained silent. When exposed to anti-Mexican bias, men were initially more likely to speak up than women, whereas women were more likely to respond to antigay comments. In terms of anti-Arab and antitransgender bias, social influence resulted in more direct confrontation for anti-Arab statements and higher rates of confrontation for antitransgender bias. Applying an intersectional lens, patterns of power and privilege reveal gender socialization may impact ally responses to racism and antigay bias. For example, gender socialization and stereotypes equating femininity with gay men may both decrease ally behavior among men and increase confrontation of antigay bias among women. When another potential ally is present, social influence appears to become the most powerful predictor of both whether or not a participant confronts bias and how direct they are with the perpetrator. Intersectional examination of invisible norms for promoting ally confrontation informs development of effective equity and justice interventions.

AB  - Background: Media coverage and scholarly research have reported that Asian people who reside in the United States have been the targets of racially motivated incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the types of discrimination and worries experienced by Asians and Asian Americans living in the United States during the pandemic, as well as factors that were associated with everyday discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination that the Asian community may face.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. A total of 235 people who identified themselves as Asian or Asian American and resided in the United States completed the questionnaire.
   Results: Our study suggested that up to a third of Asians surveyed had experienced some type of discrimination. Pooling the responses "very often," "often," and "sometimes," the percentages for each experienced discrimination type ranged between 14%-34%. In total, 49%-58% of respondents expressed concerns about discrimination in the future. The most frequently experienced discrimination types, as indicated by responses "very often" and "often," were "people act as if they think you are dangerous" (25/235, 11%) and "being treated with less courtesy or respect" (24/235, 10%). About 14% (32/235) of individuals reported very often, often, or sometimes being threatened or harassed. In addition, social media use was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination (beta=.18, P=.01) and having concerns about future episodes of discrimination the community may face (beta=.20, P=.005). Use of print media was also positively associated with experiencing discrimination (beta=.31, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Our study provided important empirical evidence regarding the various types of discrimination Asians residing in the United States experienced or worried about during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between media sources and the perception of racial biases in this group was also identified. We noted the role of social media in reinforcing the perception of discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination among Asians during this outbreak. Our results indicate several practical implications for public health agencies. To reduce discrimination against Asians during the pandemic, official sources and public health professionals should be cognizant of the possible impacts of stigmatizing cues in media reports on activating racial biases. Furthermore, Asians or Asian Americans could also be informed that using social media to obtain COVID-19 information is associated with an increase in concerns about future discrimination, and thus they may consider approaching this media source with caution.

AB  - The paper explores how youth engagement (i.e. organised social participation in a group, club, or activity) can impact young people's interethnic attitudes, via pathways of positive and negative interethnic contact. To do so, it examines processes of interethnic cohesion occurring on a large-scale, nationally-implemented UK youth engagement scheme. Employing a quasi-experimental approach, using pre-test/post-test data on a sample of participants and a (propensity-score matched) control-group, analyses demonstrate that participation leads to positive changes in young people's interethnic attitudes, evident at least 4-6 months after participation ended. This improvement in attitudes is driven primarily by increases in young people's positive interethnic contact, while participation has no impact on young people's levels of negative interethnic contact. However, the impact of participation on interethnic attitudes depends on how much positive contact young people hadpriorto taking part: young people who joined the scheme with less frequent positive contact see substantially larger improvements in their levels of positive contact which, in turn, drives even greater improvements in their interethnic attitudes. These findings provide encouraging evidence that sites of youth engagement, especially national engagement schemes, can foster intergroup cohesion among adolescents; especially among those with less frequent positive contact in their daily lives.

AB  - The Roma have been and still are a target of prejudice, marginalization, and social exclusion across Europe, especially in East-Central European countries. This paper focuses on a set of stereotypical, emotional, and behavioral evaluative responses toward Roma people selected as representing the underlying components of anti-Roma bias. Employing network analysis, we investigated if attitude strength is associated with stronger connectivity in the networks of its constituent elements. The findings from representative surveys carried out in Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, France, and Ireland supported our assumption, as high attitude strength toward the Roma resulted in stronger connectivity in all pairs of high- versus low-attitude-strength networks. Our finding yields a solid theoretical framework for targeting the central variables-those with the strongest associations with other variables-as a potentially effective attitude change intervention strategy. Moreover, perceived threat to national identity, sympathy, and empathy were found to be the most central variables in the networks.

AB  - Does an increase in creative thinking or imagination make people more sensitive toward others? To answer this question, this paper re-analyses data collected by Dziedziewicz et al. (2014), who developed a creativity training oriented toward the development of intercultural competencies and creative abilities of school children. While the original study has shown that the intervention was effective in increasing both creative abilities and intercultural competencies, little is known about the exact mechanism of this influence. In this re-analysis, based on the raw data from the original study, we tested two empirical models. The first hypothesized that the increase in creativity mediated the effect of the training on intercultural sensitivity, and the second examined the mediating effect of the growth of intercultural sensitivity on creative abilities. While both models demonstrated mediation effects, the increase in creative abilities - specifically originality of thinking and creative imagination - fully mediated the effect of the group (control versus experimental) on the increase in intercultural sensitivity. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB  - An emerging theoretical framework suggests that neural functions associated with stereotyping and prejudice are associated with frontal lobe networks. Using a novel neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), during a face-to-face live communication paradigm, we explore an extension of this model to include live dynamic interactions. Neural activations were compared for dyads of similar and dissimilar socioeconomic backgrounds. The socioeconomic status of each participant was based on education and income levels. Both groups of dyads engaged in pro-social dialectic discourse during acquisition of hemodynamic signals. Post-scan questionnaires confirmed increased anxiety and effort for high-disparity dyads. Consistent with the frontal lobe hypothesis, left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), frontopolar area and pars triangularis were more active during speech dialogue in high than in low-disparity groups. Further, frontal lobe signals were more synchronous across brains for high- than low-disparity dyads. Convergence of these behavioral, neuroimaging and neural coupling findings associate left frontal lobe processes with natural pro-social dialogue under 'out-group' conditions and advance both theoretical and technical approaches for further investigation.

AB  - This article examines the myriad of challenges faced by primary and secondary school going children amongst the San community in their quest to attain formal education in rural Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe. Using a mixed method approach, the study utilised focus group discussions from selected primary and secondary schools, key informant interviews with headmasters and teachers and also survey questionnaires supported by an ethnographic research design. It emerged from the study that long distance travelled to school, abject poverty, dilapidated infrastructure and the perceived negative attitude towards education has had telling effects on the marginalised San community. The hindrances to attaining formal education has tended to solidify the existing stereotypes, prejudices and social labels against the San community by other ethnic groups as "separatists", "non-conformist" and at worst "primitive" in as far as participating in modern and mainstream development is concerned. The article suggests that there is a need for a paradigm shift in attitude and behaviour of development agents and actors in their policy positions and their interventions to the San community. Formal education for the San community will be hard to achieve as long as institutions perceive them as subaltern citizens, who are a nuisance.

AB  - The censorship of death-related issues is widespread in contemporary Western culture because the boundary between death and life is substantially managed in medical areas. In the context of Italian educational initiatives, to remove this limitation, 215 high school students in Southern Italy were educated on death through conventional and informal lessons. The students answered a questionnaire with open questions to survey their emotional and reflective experiences. Their answers were qualitatively, thematically analysed to explore how the representation of death can follow a death education course, and if this experience can be managed without harmful effects. The students' answers narrated how the course reduced their anxiety linked to these themes, on the one hand improving communication between peers by making it more authentic and empathic and, on the other, providing alternative perspectives on life. Indeed, the project offered an opportunity to discuss something strongly heartfelt but rarely faced, and the survey confirmed that the research objectives were fully achieved.

AB  - Michael Burroughs and Deborah Tollefsen (2016) claim that children are subject to widespread testimonial injustice. They argue that empirical data shows that children are prejudicially accorded less epistemic credibility in forensic contexts, and that this in turn shows that the same is true in broader contexts. While I agree that there is indeed testimonial injustice against children, I argue that Burroughs and Tollefsen exaggerate its severity and extent, by exaggerating children's testimonial reliability. Firstly, the empirical data do not quite support their claim about children's performance in forensic contexts. Secondly, while they advocate a relational conception of children's agency which emphasizes the role of adults in realizing their testimonial abilities, Burroughs and Tollefsen miss the full implications of such a conception for our evaluation of children's credibility, and for our behavior towards them in testimonial contexts. Thirdly, they underestimate the significance of children's limited general knowledge.

AB  - Negativity toward gay men and transgender people is pervasive. Past research suggests that authoritarianism predicts biases against transgender people, in part due to an essentialist view of gender. To determine the generalizability of these findings, but with political conservatism as the focal predictor, we re-analyzed Norton and Herek's (2013) large (n = 2281) nationally representative U.S. dataset. In doing so, we modeled a latent factor indicated by anti-transgender attitudes and prejudice toward gay men to capture prejudice toward gender non-conformists. That is, prejudice against transgender people and gay men on the political right might arise from perceived gender norm violations, which binary gender beliefs could potentially explain. Consistent with social dominance theory, results revealed that those more conservative in ideology were more likely to display prejudice toward gender non-conformists in part due to their greater endorsement of binary gender beliefs. Unexpectedly, and novel to the existing literature, conservatism predicted binary gender beliefs and prejudice toward gender non-conformists more strongly for women than for men. Binary gender beliefs seemingly function as a legitimizing myth to bolster existing hierarchical relations between gender conforming versus gender non-conforming people, particularly among conservative women.

AB  - Ambivalent sexism theory conceptualizes sexism as comprised of two distinct yet complementary attitudinal views of women: hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS). HS is an antipathy toward women; BS is an ostensibly positive view of women as pure and warm yet weak and incompetent. The current research adds to extant models of individual differences and sexism by capturing a wider range of interpersonal warmth-dominance measures associated with both BS and HS. Four studies were conducted that featured online and student samples (N = 772; 55.7% female) as well as self (Studies 1-4) and friend-reports (Study 4). We found that men's HS correlated positively with interpersonally dominant characteristics and negatively with interpersonal warmth. In contrast, men's BS correlated positively with both interpersonal dominance and warmth measures. For women, HS positively correlated with one interpersonal dominance measure (i.e., Machiavellianism) and negatively with warmth measures. However, the relationships between BS and dominance-warmth measures were less consistent or clear for women. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that BS (but not HS) was associated with apparent biases in self-perception. Extending prior research on prejudice and personality, this research provides a comprehensive examination on the relationships between ambivalent sexism and interpersonal dimensions of dominance and warmth.

AB  - Readers of Whitman's poetry have long celebrated his radical portrayal of crossing racial boundaries. Yet, as recent scholars have documented, Whitman "erased" almost all of his references to black Americans in his Reconstruction-era writings. This article argues against the standard interpretation of this erasure, contending that it was a product of a rhetorical shift, rather than of Whitman's increasing personal prejudice toward black Americans. By tracing Whitman's rhetorical strategy from pre- to post-Civil War periods, I show that Whitman maintained a public commitment to a racially heterogeneous democracy. What changed, I argue, was his rhetorical approach. While Whitman's prewar poetic experimentation was addressed to Americans more generally, his postwar writings were tailored to court the Americans who were least open to his democratic project-white Southerners. I conclude by examining the limitations of both rhetorical approaches, arguing that they point toward the need for a pluralist approach to social criticism.

AB  - Native American youth face a number of challenges that affect their academic success and wellbeing. In schools, Native American youth are presented with textbooks that include stereotyped and distorted information about their peoples' history. However, there is a gap in the literature showing whether these textbooks contain microaggressive statements. The current study is a qualitative inquiry into five Montana history that explores the following questions: The first, are there microaggressions in history textbooks used across Montana, and the second - if there are microaggressions, what are those themes? Results of this study indicate that these books included 96 microinvalidations, 54 microinsults, and 11 microassaults. The themes of these microaggressive statements expanded beyond Sanchez's (2007) original themes. In turn, this study discusses the results from a perspective of White privilege, and how educational consultants can help combat this prejudice engrained in curriculum.

AB  - A mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) design was used to explore the experiences of Muslim women moving to the United States from countries where either Islam is a dominant religion or Muslims comprise a majority of the population. Participants completed established scales measuring both psychosocial adjustment and various dimensions of spirituality. In addition, participants completed a biographic interview which assessed women's sentiments about moving to the United States, their perceptions of treatment in traveling to or once arrived in the U.S., and how newly formed relationships were perceived to have affected participants' intrapersonal, social, and spiritual experience. The contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) guided the development of biographic interview questions. Participants scored similarly to population-based samples on indices of psychosocial adjustment and they reported high scores on measures assessing spiritual beliefs, strength of faith, and the Reflective Commitment subscale of the Islamic Reflections Scale. Three distinct themes emerged from interpretive analyses following in-depth interviews: 1) participants were aware of media-projected antipathy toward Muslims emerging from inflammatory rhetoric ensconced by political posturing; 2) the reception women received from the majority of American neighbors, friends, and coworkers was very positive; and 3) relationships formed with other Muslims - importantly, persons who also immigrated from other Muslim-majority countries - provided opportunities for personal reflection on the differences across cultural interpretations and practices of faith.

AB  - In many conducted psychological studies, it has been demonstrated that attitudes towards minority groups can change under the influence of electoral campaigns, as well as terrorist attacks, or street riots. In the first study presented in this article, we have examined whether the level of prejudice towards Muslims increases during the period preceding national and religious holidays. It was assumed that during such periods, issues of identity are accented, which may reinforce negative attitudes towards an external group not included in the category of "we". The study was carried out following the lost letter procedure. It turned out that the prejudices thus operationalized against Muslims grew modestly in the period preceding a state holiday, and much more so in the period preceding Christmas. In the second study we activated accessibility of concepts of a national or Catholic nature, after which we measured anti-Muslim prejudices. It turned out that activated content of a religious nature influences (to a small degree) the activation of prejudices, while in respect of activation of content of a national character we did not record such an impact.

AB  - In light of current egalitarian norms, it seems intuitive to assume that people endorsing ethnically prejudicial beliefs are largely unaware of their xenophobic content. However, a cognitive consistency perspective would suggest that individuals with low anti-prejudice standards might care less if their opinions are prejudiced. Corroborating this idea, Study 1 (N = 919) reveals that intra-individually the endorsement of prejudicial beliefs was negatively related to their evaluation as xenophobic (prejudice awareness), but more so among individuals with strong self-related egalitarian standards. Study 2 (N = 1,201) replicates these findings and shows that egalitarian standards salience led to a stronger negative association between prejudice endorsement and awareness. This suggests that low-egalitarians are less suitable targets for awareness-raising components of anti-prejudice interventions.

AB  - Access to and engagement with social services among women who trade sex is essential to address issues including substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder, and housing instability. This grounded theory study aims to understand how adult women who trade sex accessed and engaged with social services. Drawing from semistructured, in-depth interviews with 30 mostly Black and White women, results suggest that women's differing viewpoints of sex trading and experiences of racial prejudice impacted their access and engagement with services. Women's experiences ranged from affirmed to disrespected, which influenced whether and how they chose to continue seeking services. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Despite the existence of protocols for effective pain control, pediatric pain is still high, due to scarce knowledge of its treatment, especially regarding opioids. This study aimed to evaluate doctors and nurses' knowledge of pain treatment and the use of opioids in children, before and after the implementation of Law 38/2010, that represented an important step in guaranteeing patients' rights to gain access to appropriate services for pain control and palliative care in Italy and in establishing the obligation of specific training programs in this matter for health professionals. An ad hoc questionnaire was developed and administered before (investigation A) and after (investigation B) the issuance of the Law. In B both doctors and nurses showed a slight but significant increase in correct answers and a reduction in incorrect ones, mainly concerning the category Myths and Prejudices. In both investigations doctors and nurses showed adequate general knowledge, yet there were some gaps regarding the specific knowledge of opioid drugs. Most of the participants were not familiar with the Law and its provisions.Investigation B showed an improvement in health professionals' knowledge, perhaps due to a hospital environment that followed the provisions of Law 38/2010. Nevertheless, the establishment of training courses according to the Law is needed to improve the knowledge of opioids, as well as to dispel deeply rooted myths and prejudices on pediatric pain.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the effect of identify and status in the field of global mobility and expatriate management. It conceptualizes perceived prejudice towards low-status expatriates (LSE) though the social identity theory (SIT) lens and examines the effect it has on two state self-esteem domains, that is, performance self-esteem and social self-esteem. The study also highlights that the moderation roles education level and age of expatriates play towards their adaptability. In doing so, it seeks to expand the expatriate management domain by investigating the negative side associated with expatriation. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze responses from 373 LSE working in China. The results provide evidence indicating the significance attached to status and identity, thus indicating that perceived prejudice significantly affects expatriate's self-esteem negatively and that age and education level mitigate these effects by moderating the relationship. Age and education level attained by the expatriates are found to be significant moderators in this relationship. The study therefore proposes the use of SIT as a powerful theoretical lens for understanding LSE.

AB  - How can reflexivity be fostered among future managers? This article presents the dynamics and impacts of an immersion program used by a business management and public administration school based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for 13 years. Every year, students conduct research for 20-30 days on public, social, and private organizations, coordinating projects focused on economic and social development and promoting citizenship. These projects occur in poor regions far from the largest urban centers in Brazil. After visiting areas and situations within the country's borders that are unknown to them, the students bring their experiences back to the classroom to be analyzed, recorded, and shared. We evaluated the impact of this program on the participants and observed the following: prejudices and stereotypes were reconsidered; a richer and more complex view of reality was achieved; and new ways of acting in the world were adopted. We argue that immersion in social projects fosters reflexivity, and we encourage fellow educators to consider adopting transdisciplinary programs of this type as a teaching strategy to educate reflexive managers and to prepare them for work and life.

TI  - Defying racial prejudice: Second World War relationships between British women and black GIs and the raising of their offspring
T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - SEX
AB  - When American troops started to arrive in Britain in 1942 there was concern about British women?s potential intimacy with black GIs. To discourage such relationships, British troops, including the women in the ATS, were lectured on the need to keep contact with black GIs to a minimum; soldiers found with black GIs were reported; a whispering campaign hinted at the high rate of VD amongst black Americans; women were prosecuted under DORA for trespass if found with black GIs on military premises. Despite all warnings, many women had relationships with black GIs. Americans generally were attractive due to their relatively high pay. Black GIs were thought to have better manners and may have had particular appeal because black American culture was so focused on dance and music; dancing was British women?s main leisure pursuit. British women went on to have approx 1,700 mixed race babies, despite being called ?nigger lover? and their children labelled ?bastard? and ?half-caste?. Drawing on interviews with these mixed-race offspring I explore the lives of women who bravely keep their children against all odds. Their agency lay in their decision to have relationships and children in the face of racial prejudice and the stigma of illegitimacy.

AB  - Ageism in the workplace has documented detrimental consequences for its victims, but its effects on those who hold ageist views are rarely investigated. A cross-sectional study and a longitudinal study examined ageism toward both younger and older workers and its relation to intergroup contact, work behaviors, organizational identification, and the well-being of prejudiced individuals. It was hypothesized that ageism would predict prejudiced individuals' behaviors toward co-workers, identification with their organization, and vitality at work, indirectly through intergroup anxiety and quality of intergroup contact. Overall, 647 employees aged 24-62 years provided data on the variables of interest. Both studies suggested that ageist views worsened the quality of intergroup contact, which in turn increased counterproductive behaviors toward co-workers and decreased identification with the organization. Moreover, ageism marginally predicted vitality at work longitudinally through the mediation of quality of intergroup contact. No support emerged for the mediational role of intergroup anxiety. Theoretical explanations for these findings and their practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Public stigma towards people with mental health problems has been demonstrated in Western societies. Little is known about non-Western cultures and whether cultures differ in their perceptions of people with mental health problems. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination towards people with psychosis. Participants were from White British and South Asian backgrounds (N = 128, aged 16-20 years) recruited from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. They completed a cross-sectional survey on affective, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions of stigma. Results revealed significant cultural differences on all three stigma dimensions. South Asians attributed higher anger (prejudice) and dangerousness (stereotypes) to people with psychosis than White British. They also reported lower willingness to help, greater avoidance, and higher endorsement of segregation (discrimination). The effects of ethnic group on helping intentions, avoidance, and segregation endorsement were mediated by anger and by dangerousness. Understanding cultural differences in stigma towards psychosis will be important for designing stigma interventions as well as treatments for people with different cultural backgrounds.

AB  - The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016. In addition, the number of hate crimes committed against members of the religion jumped 67% in 2015 alone. Addressing the rise in anti-Muslim prejudice is critical. We examined (N = 406) the role of regional identification in predicting anti-Muslim attitudes. That is, identification with the American South, a more conservative and religious part of the country with a history of slavery and violent secession movements, predicted anti-Muslim attitudes. This relationship was mediated by conservation values. For Southerners who strongly identified with "the South", the endorsement of values related to a general resistance to change led to greater anti-Muslim attitudes. Anti-Muslim bias may lie in perceptions of threat: for strongly identified Southerners, the Muslim faith is viewed as a societal threat.

AB  - Research on the imagined contact hypothesis suggests that simply imagining a positive interaction with an out-group member can reduce prejudice toward stigmatized social groups. To date, however, it remains unclear whether imagined contact has transient or long-lasting effects. This preregistered study (N = 153) tested the hypothesis that a single session of imagined contact is sufficient for reducing explicit and implicit prejudice toward a stigmatized social group and intergroup anxiety over several days. Highlighting the power of imagination, the results suggest that imagined contact could have long-lasting effects on explicit prejudice and intergroup anxiety.

AB  - Children are at higher risk of influenza complications. The goals of this article are, estimating influenza vaccination coverage of Health Care Workers (HCWs) in tertiary children hospital, evaluating attitudes and practices of HCWs and evaluating whether HCWs vaccination uptake improved with onsite vaccination campaign. This was a before-after trial, which was carried out in a tertiary children hospital at 2017-2018 influenza season. The vaccination team visited all participants and collected information about previous vaccination uptake, attitudes and beliefs of HCWs by means of an anonymous questionnaire. Moreover, the influenza vaccine was offered onsite to all participants. A total of 572 HCWs participated in this study (response rate: 94.2%). Coverage was 10.8% in 2016-17 season and 39.9% in 2017-18 season (p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that being younger than 35 years (OR: 2.09), being vaccinated in previous season (OR: 47.02) and professional category of the participant (clinicians being reference group; OR: 1.73 for support staff and OR: 0.23 for nurses,) were significantly associated with vaccination uptake in 2017-18 season [95% CI]. None of the participants with former bad experience about vaccination was vaccinated in 2017-2018 season. And 90% of the participants having lack of knowledge about the vaccine were vaccinated in 2017-2018 season. After onsite vaccination campaign, influenza vaccination coverage improved significantly among HCWs. In order to achieve target vaccination coverage we should break down the prejudices with a comprehensive education program.

AB  - In the past 20 years, the number of Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand has increased tremendously. Due to several criminal incidents in which offenders were Myanmar workers shown in the news over the last decade, many Thais have developed prejudice against Myanmar migrant workers. This article contends that a museum can be a starting point in creating social change through focused research, exhibition design, and community engagement. I will explain how field research allowed the exhibit development team to gain first-hand experiences with Myanmar migrant workers and overcome their own prejudice. This attitude change among team members led to the overarching concept of the Myanmar Up-Close exhibition, which was that direct contact with Myanmar migrant workers could make Thai people understand migrants better and ultimately reduced prejudice against them. Thus, the exhibition, education programs, and the public event were all designed to encourage interactions between Thais and the Myanmar.

AB  - African Americans in the United States endorse conspiracy theories at greater rates than Whites. The extant literature explains this pattern in terms of a rational motivation to blame the social system for prejudice and discrimination. However, little research distinguishes between race-relevant conspiracy theories against African Americans and general conspiracy theories. We propose that African Americans may seek out race-relevant conspiracy theories in particular because they satisfy a search for meaning that is brought about by chronic social devaluation. We present two studies that examine this social devaluation hypothesis. In Study 1 African Americans endorsed race-relevant conspiracy theories, even when controlling for perceptions of discrimination, an aspect of system blame. Study 2 employed an experimental affirmation of social value that significantly reduced African Americans' endorsement of race-relevant conspiracy theories consistent with the social devaluation hypothesis. These data indicate that there may be psychologically adaptive features of race-relevant conspiracy theory endorsement.

AB  - This study investigates the physiological consequences of derogation. In the face of an ingroup threat, an opportunity to derogate the outgroup is associated with increases in salivary cortisol, a stress biomarker. These findings support the intergroup anxiety model, which suggests that following an anxiety-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress. In this study, we investigated whether threatened participants who derogated would show higher cortisol levels. Canadian undergraduates (N = 169) read either a threatening or favourable passage about Canadians. They then engaged in either a linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) or control task. Salivary samples were collected prethreat, postthreat, and posttask. The results suggest that ingroup threat was associated with increases in cortisol levels. Threatened participants who displayed LIB showed higher cortisol levels than those who were threatened and did not show LIB. These findings illustrate the importance of incorporating a neuroscientific approach.

AB  - The present investigation provides the first systematic empirical tests for the role of politics in academic research. In a large sample of scientific abstracts from the field of social psychology, we find both evaluative differences, such that conservatives are described more negatively than liberals, and explanatory differences, such that conservatism is more likely to be the focus of explanation than liberalism. In light of the ongoing debate about politicized science, a forecasting survey permitted scientists to state a priori empirical predictions about the results, and then change their beliefs in light of the evidence. Participating scientists accurately predicted the direction of both the evaluative and explanatory differences, but at the same time significantly overestimated both effect sizes. Scientists also updated their broader beliefs about political bias in response to the empirical results, providing a model for addressing divisive scientific controversies across fields.

AB  - The paper critically approaches the western epistemological tradition and its psychologized perspectives that pose identitarian and cultural categories as standing at the basis of societal conflicts. It suggests that staying attached to a conceptualization of identity as a, more or less, fixed cognizant entity and of culture as a, rather, fixed body of traditions and meaning might not allow multicultural, interfaith, or peace education initiatives geared towards soothing societal conflicts achieve their goals. It does so by reviewing data gathered at the integrated bilingual and multicultural schools in Israel which I have been studying for over a decade utilizing a variety of ethnographic tools. It concludes by locating the problems exposed within present social sciences theorizing and suggest possible ways to overcome these problems.

AB  - Both human rights organisations and studies in political communication have noticed an increasing use of conflict frames in contemporary politics within Western societies. As such frames are only interesting for political actors if they find resonance among a substantial share of the population, these observations raise the question as to who supports conflict thinking and why? Whereas public opinion research has studied many attitudes that are based on conflict thinking (e.g., ethnic prejudice, populism, feelings of collective deprivation, and welfare chauvinism), this paper addresses the more fundamental question as to whether it is possible to measure people's general tendency to perceive the world through the lens of social conflict. Data from the European Quality of Life Survey (34,655 respondents; 34 countries) reveal strong correlations between the perceptions of the amount of tension between seven pairs of groups. These correlations are combined into a single scale reflecting the amount of perceived social conflict in society. Subsequent multilevel analyses support the claim that conflict thinking is embedded in different feelings of vulnerability. In the conclusion, we elaborate on the implications of our findings.

AB  - Objective: Personality has a long history of being linked to attitudes toward various social groups, but little research has explored how darker aspects of personality might contribute to social attitudes. In this article, we explore the role of the ominous personality traits in the Dark Triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) in accounting for prejudice, in the specific case of antipathy toward asylum seekers.
   Method: A community sample of 173 Australians (M-age = 23.37 years, SD = 7.88; 74% females) responded to measures of classical and modern explicit attitudes and implicit attitudes toward this group. This study used a correlational research design.
   Results: The sample reported neutral explicit attitudes (both classical and modern) but implicit attitudes were negative. Classical attitudes were less negative than modern attitudes. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses revealed political conservatism and psychopathy predicted modern explicit attitudes while political conservatism and Machiavellianism predicted classical attitudes. Narcissism was unrelated to all attitudes, and none of the Dark Triad personality traits were related to implicit attitudes.
   Conclusion: The implications of the relationships between sub-clinical personality traits and social attitudes are discussed in reference to intervening with punitive attitudes towards this vulnerable social group. This article presents new evidence that Machiavellianism is related to classic attitudes, and provides more evidence that psychopathy is related to modern attitudes. Finally, this article adds to the scarce literature on implicit attitudes towards asylum seekers.

AB  - This Agenda article argues that studying the continuing world-wide migration and the resulting cultural diversity has specific benefits for social psychology: it raises new questions for the field, introduces new topics of research, and challenges conventional ways of thinking. The argument is developed in relation to four issues. The first one relates to the literature on ethnic and civic nationhood and the importance for social psychology to study citizenship and lay understandings of genetics. The second issue relates to the social psychological literature on threat and prejudice and the relative lack of interest in prosocial behavior and intergroup toleration. Third, the limiting implications of the majority-minority schematic framework that dominates in social psychology are discussed. Finally, the relevance of studying immigration for the evidentiary value movement that has developed in response to the current crisis' in (social) psychology is discussed.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine whether stigma consciousness shapes cortisol responses to social stress among women in the laboratory. Undergraduate women (N=45) completed background measures and then participated in a public speaking task, with assessments of cortisol prior to the stressor as well as 20 and 40minutes post stressor onset. Results from multilevel models revealed that women higher in stigma consciousness evidenced blunted cortisol reactivity following social stress across the study session compared to women lower in stigma consciousness. This interaction was robust to adjustment for a number of covariates, including demographic (e.g., age), physiological (e.g., menstrual cycle), and psychological (e.g., depressive symptomatology) factors. Potential explanations for observed cortisol patterns are discussed, including hyporeactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and elevated anticipatory stress. In conclusion, implications for health disparities research are considered.

AB  - The Northwestern University Law Review's 2017 Symposium asked whether McCleskey v. Kemp closed the door on social science's ability to meaningfully contribute to equal protection deliberations. This inquiry is understandable; McCleskey is widely understood to have rendered statistical racial disparities doctrinally irrelevant in the equal protection context. We suggest, however, that this account overstates McCleskey and its doctrinal impact. Roughly fifteen years after McCleskey, Chief Justice William Rehnquist-himself part of the McCleskey majority-invoked admissions data to support his conclusion that the University of Michigan Law School unconstitutionally discriminated against white applicants.
   Chief Justice Rehnquist's disparate treatment of statistical evidence in McCleskey and Grutter v. Bollinger reveals the doctrine's under-determinacy and invites a corresponding inquiry: why do Justices rely on social science in some cases, yet reject it in others? We propose that one answer lies at the intersections of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and empirical scholarship on motivated social cognition. This "eCRT" lens illuminates how ostensibly neutral biases and heuristics, when informed by socially salient racial stereotypes, will predictably and systematically lead judges to overvalue "evidence" that rationalizes existing racial disparities and, as a result, author legal opinions that re-instantiate and legitimize the status quo.

AB  - Through the lens of stereotyping and stigma, this article examines discrimination and prejudice toward homeless families from the perspective of social service providers. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with practitioners. A critical social work practice perspective is used to provide a framework for understanding how social worker knowledge about discrimination and prejudice informs the ways in which the workers engage with clients, build capacities, and advocate for clients in an anti-oppressive manner. The themes found in this study include: a) providers' awareness of bias, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination; b) providers' use of a range of strategies to work with people experiencing homelessness; c) providers' ideas about strategies that organizations can implement for service provision; and) providers' belief that additional advocacy and policy are needed in relationship to people experiencing homelessness.

AB  - One of the key requirements of a democratic society is the absence of police discrimination. Discriminatory treatment by the police is a challenge in many societies, and every society that wishes to be truly democratic, should aim to keep police discrimination to an absolute minimum and continuously work on its elimination. One step toward this is studying the perceptions and understanding that police have toward discrimination to enable the most effective preventive measures to any discriminatory behaviour they may exhibit. This paper presents the results of a study conducted on the attitudes of police officers toward discrimination in the Republic of Serbia. This research focused on the recognition of the meaning of discrimination and awareness of the presence of discrimination in Serbian society by police officers, the level of police social and ethnic distance toward different groups, police perceptions as to the influence and responsibility that public and social institutions can have in provoking discrimination, as well as the existence and acceptance of prejudice among police officers in Serbia.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that Event-related potentials (ERPs) are sensitive to violations of gender based stereotypes. In the present investigation, we used ERPs to measure the detection of a discrepancy between gender-based occupational stereotypes and written material presented to fifteen Italian viewers in a completely implicit task. No awareness or judgment about stereotypes was required, no decision had to be made on sentence acceptability or congruence, and no prime words related to gender were presented (which might reveal the matter of the investigation). EEG was recorded while participants engaged in a task that consisted of pressing a key in response to animal words, while ignoring the overall study's purpose. Two hundred forty sentences that did or did not violate gender stereotypes were presented randomly with 32 other sentences ending with an animal word. Terminal words violating gender stereotypes (such as "The notary is BREASTFEEDING" or "Here is the commissioner with HER HUSBAND") elicited a greater anterior N400 response and left anterior negativity (LAN) than words conforming to the gender stereotype (e.g., "The chemist put on a nice TIE'). LAN modulation suggests that gender stereotypes are processed automatically (as if they were morpho-syntactic errors) and hints at how they are deeply rooted in our linguistic brain. According to the inverse solution, the neural representation of gender-based stereotypes mostly involved the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). The temporo/parietal junction (TPJ) supporting theory of mind (TOM) processes was also engaged, along with the superior and middle temporal gyri representing person information. (C) 2017 IBRO.

TI  - Global evidence of extreme intuitive moral prejudice against atheists
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
LA  - English
KW  - RELIGION
AB  - Mounting evidence supports long-standing claims that religions can extend cooperative networks. However, religious prosociality may have a strongly parochial component. Moreover, aspects of religion may promote or exacerbate conflict with those outside a given religious group, promoting regional violence, intergroup conflict and tacit prejudice against non-believers. Anti-atheist prejudice-a growing concern in increasingly secular societies-affects employment, elections, family life and broader social inclusion. Preliminary work in the United States suggests that anti-atheist prejudice stems, in part, from deeply rooted intuitions about religion's putatively necessary role in morality. However, the cross-cultural prevalence and magnitude-as well as intracultural demographic stability-of such intuitions, as manifested in intuitive associations of immorality with atheists, remain unclear. Here, we quantify moral distrust of atheists by applying well-tested measures in a large global sample (N = 3,256; 13 diverse countries). Consistent with cultural evolutionary theories of religion and morality, people in most-but not all-of these countries viewed extreme moral violations as representative of atheists. Notably, anti-atheist prejudice was even evident among atheist participants around the world. The results contrast with recent polls that do not find self-reported moral prejudice against atheists in highly secular countries, and imply that the recent rise in secularism in Western countries has not overwritten intuitive anti-atheist prejudice. Entrenched moral suspicion of atheists suggests that religion's powerful influence on moral judgements persists, even among non-believers in secular societies.

AB  - Prejudice toward marginalized groups is recognized as a complex and harmful social issue. The present study investigates the role of polyculturalism in undermining prejudice toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people and refugees. A pilot study (N=76) compared participants' prejudice, contact, and moral exclusion toward lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) and transgender or intersex (TI) people. There were differences for three out of four variables; thus, LGB and TI variables were separated in the study proper (N=154). In this study, we investigated moral exclusion and contact (quantity and quality) relating to LGB, TI, and refugee groups as simultaneous mediators of the relationship between polyculturalism and prejudice, while taking into account openness as per previous research. Structural equation modeling indicated that moral exclusion and contact quality acted as mediators between polyculturalism and prejudice for LGB people, TI people, and refugees.

AB  - The formal exit from the labor market, through the Retirement, is a moment that causes significant changes in the rhythms of daily life and organization. This conclusion justifies a reflection on its impact on people's lives and on the prejudices and stereotypes that end up being associated with them. This study aimed to understand how the transition to retirement affected the lives of the people who participated in the study, in the light of the theory of "Social bond" proposed by Serge Paugam (2008). The analysis is on the experience of the retirement considering the two dimensions of Social Bond, proposed by the author - the protection and recognition - as well as the implications that the retirement had for these people in the four types of Social Bond. This work held up an interpretative paradigm of reality, having performed six semi-structured interviews with rfetired people, which were then subjected to an detailed content analysis. It was concluded that while the bond of organic participation is weakened with the entry in the retirement, the other three types of social bond turned out to be strengthened with this transition, and in particular affiliation bond, the bond of the elective participation and citizenship bond, even with diversified expressions. This text still shows up discussions about the retirement and prejudices and stereotypes associated with old age and aging as current concerns for Social Pedagogy.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of immersive exposure to other-race individuals on racial bias. In Study 1, we tracked African students (N = 85) who went to study at a Chinese university and thus experienced daily contact with Chinese individuals en masse for the first time. Using a cohort-sequential longitudinal design, we found that an implicit pro-Chinese racial bias emerged within 3 months after these students arrived in China, and that this bias remained stable for at least a year. In contrast, their explicit racial bias did not change. In Study 2, we assessed another group of African students (N = 47) at 1 month and at 3 months after their arrival in China, looking at not only their implicit and explicit racial bias, but also their intergroup contact quantity, intergroup contact quality, and intergroup friendship. We found that intergroup contact quantity and intergroup friendship predicted implicit but not explicit racial bias 2 months later. The findings suggest that immersive experiences with racial out-groups can have early and lasting effects on implicit racial bias.

AB  - We consider the conflicting multilevel forces around concealment and disclosure that may weigh on individuals as they navigate life with a concealable stigmatized identity. In particular, we explore a tension that can arise between immediate personal motivations to conceal and the potential for disclosure to increase the visibility of a stigmatized group and normalize it, thus helping to change social attitudes and reduce structural stigma. We argue that personal benefits of disclosure are moderated by individual differences and situational characteristics. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach that focuses exclusively or primarily on the benefits of disclosure can be problematic. We thus recommend that any intervention campaign that seeks to encourage disclosure should balance social advocacy goals with individual needs. We conclude with a discussion of possible intervention strategies that could be used to (1) help individuals manage the disclosure process and (2) help create more favorable organizational and civic climates where concealment is less necessary.

AB  - The United Kingdom's Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act (2013) was framed by the Government as an equality measure and, as such, those who opposed the legislation were likely to be sensitive to possible accusations of prejudice. This article examines opposition to marriage equality within the British press and explores how denials of homophobia were made. Opponents to same-sex marriage attended to commonsense notions of homophobes', either by aligning their views with categories of persons not typically considered homophobic or by distancing their views from a homophobic other. Opponents also offered a counter-accusation that it was liberal supporters of same-sex marriage who were intolerant. Parallels are drawn with discursive literature on racist discourse and it appears that despite social scientists' attempts to expand the concept of antigay prejudice, homophobia is commonly referred to in terms of irrational bigoted individuals.

AB  - Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth too often live in nonsupportive environments. This study reports the influence of social support from primary and secondary social ties on confidence and self-esteem among participants in Hatch Youth, a drop-in group-level intervention for SGM youth. Each 3-hour Hatch Youth meeting consists of a social, educational, and youth-led support hour. Over 14 weeks, these meetings were randomly observed and individual interviews with participating youth (n = 12) and staff and volunteers (n = 12) were conducted; data underwent a content analysis. Participants perceived an increase in confidence and self-esteem through enhanced bonding with family and friends, a sense of belonging, and community empowerment because of their involvement with Hatch Youth, suggesting drop-in centers can strengthen secondary social ties and improve confidence and self-esteem.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) is conceived as an individual's level of support for group-based hierarchy in general that causes support for more specific group hierarchies. According to social dominance theory, group differences in SDO underpin ideological and behavioural group differences related to specific group hierarchies. Using representative 5-year longitudinal panel data from New Zealand (N = 3,384), we test whether SDO mediates effects of sex and ethnicity on legitimizing myths (LMs) relating to gender and ethnic hierarchy over time. The SDO mediation hypothesis is supported in the case of hostile sexism. However, it is unsupported in the case of benevolent sexism and LMs relating to ethnic hierarchy, where there was no cross-lagged effect of SDO. Moreover, being in the dominant ethnic group is associated with more legitimization of ethnic hierarchy but less legitimization of gender hierarchy, which is inconsistent with the notion of a general orientation underpinning group differences in legitimation. There was mixed evidence for a reverse path whereby specific LMs mediate group differences in SDO across time. We argue for the need to find alternative ways to theorize ideological consensus and difference between groups.

AB  - The Great Recession widened social-class divides, so social interactions across gaps in workplace status and in race generally may be more salient and more fraught. Different statuses and races both carry stereotypes that targets know (meta-perceptions, how they expect to be viewed by the outgroup). In both cross-status and cross-race interactions, targets may aim to manage the impressions they create. Reviewing literature and our own recent work invokes (a) the role of the Stereotype Content Model's two dimensions of social perception, namely warmth and competence; (b) the compensation effect, a tendency to tradeoff between them, especially downplaying one to convey the other; and (c) diverging warmth and competence concerns of people with lower and higher status and racial-group positions. Higher-status people and Whites, both stereotyped as competent but cold, seek to warm up their image. Lower-status people and Blacks, both stereotyped as warm but incompetent, seek respect for their competence. Overviews of two previously separate research programs and the background literature converge on shared findings that higher-status people, comparing down, display a competence downshift, consistent with communicating apparent warmth. Meanwhile, lower-status people, comparing up, often display less warmth, to communicate competence. Previous research and our diverse samplesonline workplace scenarios, online cross-race interactions, and presidential candidates' speechessuggest a novel, robust interpersonal mechanism that perpetuates race, status, and social-class divides.

AB  - Although the lives of gay men in the post-closet generation are easier in many ways, everyday discrimination still exists in the forms of hetero-sexism and microaggressions. These forms of discrimination are difficult and risky to talk about, partly because they are often ambiguous, and also because these conversations can disrupt the status quo. In this paper, we explore how the idea of 'discrimination' is more complex than it might first appear, and how the boundaries between 'discrimination' and 'not discrimination' are socially constructed. We conducted qualitative interviews with 15 undergraduate students who self-identified as gay men, and used dialogical analysis to explore their identity work. Participants constructed discrimination/not discrimination in different ways as they shifted between different I- positions: I- as authentic individual, I- as what I am not (not camp and not a victim), and I- as powerful. Our analysis indicates the extent to which 'discrimination' is socially constructed (rather than an objective reality), and suggests means by which practitioners and advocates can support clients in talking about discrimination.

AB  - The number of individuals currently living in a country other than the one in which they were born peaked at more than 244 million in 2015. This makes the global society a culturally and racially diverse one. Although unpopular with some residents, immigrants are the reality of contemporary society. This study discusses immigration as a global phenomenon and the creation of immigrant-friendly society as a necessity. The study utilizes data from the 2014 General Social Survey on American attitudes toward immigrants to create the feelings toward immigrants (FTI) index and investigates the determinants of the feelings toward immigrants in the United States. The study finds that college education, income, political views, citizens, and residing in the West and the Northeast United States affect feelings toward immigrants. Interestingly, the study reveals that college education enhances the positive perception of liberals and moderates the negative views that conservatives and citizens might have. The study concludes that policy-makers seeking to create immigrant-friendly society should focus on the above factors rather than race, attendance, and participation at religious events and other variables that were not significant.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to undertake a phenomenological study of the working conditions and living standards of private security guards (private police) in New Delhi. The focus here is to bring forth their lived experiences as security guards.
   Design/methodology/approach-The paper touches briefly upon the theoretical formulations on phenomenological sociology. The principal emphasis here is on the field application of phenomenology as a methodology of social inquiry-how phenomenology was put to use, the research problems encountered and how these research conundrums were navigated. The research makes use of interview as the technique of data collection. The study uses purposive and convenience sampling.
   Findings-The research has tried to bring forth the lived experiences of the private security guards as regards to their job and living conditions, by "bracketing off" the author's biases to the best of the author's capacity. From the interview responses, some higher level concepts have been formulated, called the "essence" of lived experiences.
   Research limitations/implications-As the sample size is small, the research cannot be considered a peremptory account of the "lived experiences" applicable to all the private security guards in Delhi. Such sweeping generalizations need to be avoided.
   Practical implications-Besides highlighting the lived experiences of the private security guards, the larger purpose of this paper to solicit critical comments from the readers so that the field application of phenomenology could be better understood and refined further.
   Originality/value-This is an original research work carried out by the author. During the fieldwork, "reflexivity" has been the author's constant companion, where the author has tried best to keep the author's prejudices at bay. Its value is twofold: first, as phenomenological research works on private security guards are few in India, this study can stimulate further research works in this field and second, the research can carry forward the debate on how to improve further phenomenological research works.

AB  - In 2011, the killing of a Black man by a police officer triggered violent riots across England. In a context where ethnic minorities are rarely openly blamed, we examined the lens through which the events were interpreted in the official discourses of the British Prime Minister. A thematic content analysis (Study 1) revealed that, without explicitly blaming ethnic minorities, the discourses built on antagonistic normative references opposing a virtuous majority to threatening minorities. Then, based on online survey data of self-declared Londoners (N5223) during the riots, we analyzed (Study 2) how agreement with the discourses related to individuals' ethnocentrism and their understanding of the causes underlying the events. Results of regression analyses showed how agreement with the discourses related to blaming ethnic diversity for the riots and to higher ethnocentrism, especially among individuals least likely to discriminate against minorities (i.e., low in social dominance orientation). Agreement with the discourses was also linked to reduced blame of authorities. To conclude, we discuss the mobilization potential of political discourses on ingroup virtue and outgroup threat.

AB  - Considering xenophobic attacks against foreigners and ethnic or religious motivated wars, there is a need for educational concepts to extinguish xenophobia. A model describing the cognitive processes involved in Xenophobic cognition was developed. Instructional multimedia material that discussed various forms of alienation was developed and evaluated. The computer program was based on research findings and proven intercultural teaching strategies. To evaluate the training sessions, methods were developed to measure attitudes toward foreigners. Based on a multi-method concept an evaluation-tool was created that validated the effectiveness of long-term intervention programs and short-term effects on an implicit level of awareness. The procedure used the implicit association test. The applied methods were evaluated in a study with 79 High School students (46.8% female; mean age = 14.13, SD = 1.16) within a one-factorial control group design. Although there were no significant results in explicit measures of attitude, there was a significant change in implicit measures showing a reduction of implicit xenophobic cognitive processes in the experimental group and an increase in the control group. Results imply that the chosen tutorial methods lead to a change in attitudes on trait and state-level regarding xenophobic self-concept.

AB  - Rationale: We conducted three experiments to examine how cultural frames shape attitudes about health, focusing on obesity, which is considered a public health crisis and is imbued with symbolic meaning.
   Methods: College students (Ns = 99, 114, and 293) read news articles that presented high body weight according to one or more of the following frames: 1) public health crisis; 2) personal responsibility; 3) health at every size (HAES); or 4) fat rights.
   Results: Compared to people who read the HAES and Fat Rights articles, those who read the Public Health Crisis and Personal Responsibility articles expressed more belief in the health risks of being fat (ds = 1.28 to 1.79), belief that fat people should pay more for insurance (ds = 0.53 to 0.71), anti-fat prejudice (ds = 0.61 to 0.69), willingness to discriminate against fat people (ds = 0.41 to 0.59), and less willingness to celebrate body-size diversity (ds = 0.77 to 1.07). They were less willing to say women at the lower end of the obese range could be healthy. Exposure to these articles increased support for price-raising policies to curb obesity but not support for redistributive or compensatory policies. In Experiment 3, in comparison to a control condition, exposure to HAES or Fat Rights frames significantly reduced beliefs in the risks of obesity and support for charging fat people more for insurance. However, only people exposed to the Fat Rights frame expressed fewer anti-fat attitudes and more willingness to celebrate body-size diversity.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that simply disseminating information that people can be both fat and healthy will not suffice to reduce prejudice. Given that anti-fat stigma is a health risk and barrier to collective solidarity, fat rights viewpoints can buffer against the negative consequences of anti-fat stigma and promote a culture of health by fostering empathy and social justice.

AB  - Essentialist beliefs about social groups can contribute to prejudice and intergroup distancing. To date, little data have been gathered regarding minority group members' essentialistic thinking about the White majority in the U.S. Do essentialist beliefs show a similar structure when minority group members are thinking about the majority as when the majority group is thinking about the minority group? Do minority group essentialist beliefs predict affective prejudice and diminished desire for intergroup contact as they do among White respondents? We sought answers to these questions in a study that included 248 African American participants. We found clear evidence that the structure of Blacks' essentialist thinking about Whites matches the structure of Whites' essentialist thinking about Blacks. Specifically, Black respondents made a distinction between bio-somatic and bio-behavioral essentialism, and reported stronger endorsement of the former as compared to the latter. Also replicating prior studies of Whites' essentialist thinking, only bio-behavioral essentialist beliefs were predictive of negative attitudes. This suggests that essentialism can be linked to prejudice even in contexts that do not involve a dominant group rationalizing its social advantages. Discussion centers on implications of this work for prejudice reduction.

AB  - Racial disparities in rates of exclusionary school discipline are well documented and seemingly intractable. However, emerging theories on implicit bias show promise in identifying effective interventions. In this study, we used school discipline data from 1,666 elementary schools and 483,686 office discipline referrals to identify specific situations in which disproportionality was more likely. Results were largely consistent with our theoretical model, indicating increased racial and gender disproportionality for subjectively defined behaviors, in classrooms, and for incidents classified as more severe. The time of day also substantially affected disproportionality. These findings can be used to pinpoint specific student-teacher interactions for intervention.

AB  - This study examined the relevance of disgust to evaluations of an obese target person, and the connection between disgust and prejudice toward that person. Participants (n=598) viewed an image of an obese or non-obese woman, and then evaluated that woman on a number of dimensions (emotions, attitudes, stereotypes, desire for social distance). Compared with the non-obese target, the obese target elicited more disgust, more negative attitudes and stereotypes, and a greater desire for social distance. Furthermore, disgust mediated the effect of the target's body size on all of the outcome variables (attitudes, stereotypes, social distance). Disgust plays an important role in prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity, and might in part explain the pervasiveness of weight bias.

AB  - This article is concerned with the evolving social construction of older workers and retirement. Evolving and competing 'world-views' from public policy, and social advocacy of productive and vulnerable older workers, are described and critiqued. Contradictions and disjunctions, in terms of public policies aimed at changing employer behaviour towards older workers, are identified. It is argued that present representations of older workers have serious flaws that provide a weak basis for policy development and may not only undermine the prospects for overcoming prejudicial societal attitudes but may in fact strengthen them. It is further argued that sheltering older workers in employment placements will inevitably limit the extent and nature of their participation. Instead, the mainstreaming of their employment is justified, bearing in mind negative attitudes towards ageing.

AB  - People commonly reference minority friendships when expressing conceivably prejudiced attitudes. The prevalence of this strategy suggests a widespread belief that having minority friends makes one look less racist, but to date, there is little research demonstrating whether or not this is the case. White and Asian participants were presented with a Facebook profile depicting a White target who posted an anti-Asian statement. Being depicted with Asian friends (Study 1) or even verbally claiming that they had Asian friends (Study 2) reduced attributions of racism irrespective of whether they were being evaluated by White or Asian observers. Furthermore, the presence of Asian friends made the conceivably racist comments seem relatively benign, and observers were less offended and upset by them. The data suggest that minority friendships can partially offset costs associated with expressing prejudice.

AB  - In social psychology, the concept of implicit attitudes has given rise to ongoing discussions that are rather philosophical. The aim of this paper is to discuss the status of implicit prejudices from a philosophical point of view. Since implicit prejudices are a special case of implicit attitudes, the discussion will be framed by a short discussion of the most central aspects concerning implicit attitudes and indirect measures. In particular, the ontological conclusions that are implied by different conceptions of implicit attitudes will be scrutinized. The main question to be discussed involves whether implicit prejudices are mental states at all, or whether they are (despite the label 'implicit mental states') rather dispositions to behave in a certain way. This question will be discussed against the background of principles for belief (and mental state) ascription, which requires ascribed mental states to fulfill some specific explanatory role. We defend a conception of implicit prejudices that does not assume them to be mental states.

AB  - This essay responds to the criticism that contemporary efforts to redress discrimination and inequality are overly individualistic. Critics of individualism emphasize that these systemic social ills stem not from the prejudice, irrationality, or selfishness of individuals, but from underlying structural-institutional forces. They are skeptical, therefore, of attempts to change individuals' attitudes while leaving structural problems intact. I argue that the insistence on prioritizing structural over individual change is problematic and misleading. My view is not that we should instead prioritize individual change, but that individual changes are integral to the success of structural changes. These theorists urge a redirection of attention, claiming that we should think less about the individual and more about the social. What they should urge instead is that we think differently about the individual, and thereby think differently about the social.

AB  - Renshaw examines in comparative terms two of the most virulent manifestations of racial prejudice in early twentieth-century British society. The language of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the Edwardian period and the years preceding the First World War, the similarities and differences in the ways that these two forms of prejudice were articulated, and the overlap between them are analysed. Five strands of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese sentiment and action are discussed. The first examines how international manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia, suspicions aimed at Jews and Chinese as transnational diasporic communities, and perceptions of these minorities, through Russian pogroms, the Boxer Rebellion in China and the post-Boer War economic situation in South Africa, were framed in narratives of victimhood and aggression. Second, the transnational and colonial circuits of racialized discourse and the relationship between periphery and metropole are considered, as are divergences in the articulation of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese prejudice. The third strand investigates the use of the language of invasion', used by both the political right and the left in discussing Jewish and Chinese immigration and economic activity in Britain, with Chinese employment in British industries (in this period particularly as sailors on British ships) framed in the context of a demographic Asiatic' takeover of European societies. The fourth strand looks at the intersection of racial prejudice and sexual and social angst, the visceral association of immigrant groups with dirt and disease, and the sexual threat that racist and antisemitic literature attributed to Jews and Chinese. Finally, physical manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the period and the racial violence that occurred in Cardiff and Tredegar in 1911 will be described and placed in context. The article positions Edwardian antisemitism and Sinophobia as a transitory stage in the evolution of British racism: a bridge between the separate domestic and colonial forms of prejudice present in late Victorian discourse, and the new manifestations of racism located in British cities and ports, but aimed at non-white minorities, that emerged in the interwar period.

AB  - This study examines how Latina/o students perceive and frame experiences of prejudice against them in the classroom through narratives told in informal interviews in Spanish. This project started as an inquiry about these students' general perceptions and experiences in their Advanced Spanish-language classes and how these compared to their experiences in other classes on campus. Narratives are essential to understanding how speakers perceive and evaluate the experiences narrated and how they position themselves in relation to their group as well as to outsiders. The results show that, in most cases, when recounting narratives of discrimination or situations that can be considered instances of prejudice, students were hesitant to recognize that they were the subjects of discrimination or to qualify the story as an occurrence of racism. Different strategies were used to avoid this recognition, including assigning others the role of recognizing the situation as discriminatory and also using narrative evaluations or introductions to justify or mitigate the reasons that motivated these incidents. Discourses of prejudice and racism denial have been broadly documented, yet most studies focus on those who deny being racist themselves or being part of a racist group. This study shows how the underrepresented group might incorporate these discourses of denial and also how their discourses support or, at least, do not challenge the ideologies of majority groups about race, language, and immigration.

AB  - This research presents the development of a measure of religiosity that includes social intrinsic religiosity as distinct from extrinsic religiosity and from the typical conceptualization of intrinsic religiosity as an individual orientation. Study 1 developed the measure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis; the results confirmed two intrinsic identity factors (individual and social) and two extrinsic benefit factors (individual and social). Correlations with previously established religiosity measures demonstrate the scales construct validity and that social intrinsic religiosity is independent from extrinsic religiosity. In Study 2, differential responding by Christian and Jewish participants was consistent with these religions' reputed cultural theological approaches and confirmed the independence of social intrinsic religiosity. Furthermore, social intrinsic religiosity was positively correlated with prejudice towards value-violating outgroups, as would be expected from an intrinsic religiosity. These results unconfound social and extrinsic religiosity and provide empirical evidence that intrinsic religiosity can be socially as well as individually oriented.

AB  - Intercountry adoptions from Guatemala were highly controversial, because of the large numbers of children being adopted to the USA, along with evidence of corruption and child theft. Since the implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption in 2008, Guatemala's central authority for adoption has prioritized domestic placements for children over intercountry adoption. A possible attitudinal barrier to domestic adoption in Guatemala-negative attitudes and prejudice against Indigenous people-was investigated through questionnaires measuring attitudes toward adoption and attitudes toward and social distance from the two major ethnic groups (Ladino and Indigenous). Guatemalan university students (N = 177, 61 % men) were recruited from basic required courses at a private university. Results showed that attitudes toward adoption in general were more favorable than toward interethnic adoption, with the most negative attitudes toward adoption of Ladino children by Indigenous parents. Multiple regression and analysis of covariance models revealed that female gender, experience with adoption and more positive attitudes about Indigenous persons were associated with more positive attitudes toward adoption. The findings imply that negative attitudes toward Indigenous persons are associated with negative attitudes toward adoption, and serve as barriers to promoting domestic adoption in Guatemala.

AB  - CONTEXT Health care trainees demonstrate implicit (automatic, unconscious) and explicit (conscious) bias against people from stigmatised and marginalised social groups, which can negatively influence communication and decision making. Medical schools are well positioned to intervene and reduce bias in new physicians.
   OBJECTIVES This study was designed to assess medical school factors that influence change in implicit and explicit bias against individuals from one stigmatised group: people with obesity.
   METHODS This was a prospective cohort study of medical students enrolled at 49 US medical schools randomly selected from all US medical schools within the strata of public and private schools and region. Participants were 1795 medical students surveyed at the beginning of their first year and end of their fourth year. Web-based surveys included measures of weight bias, and medical school experiences and climate. Bias change was compared with changes in bias in the general public over the same period. Linear mixed models were used to assess the impact of curriculum, contact with people with obesity, and faculty role modelling on weight bias change.
   RESULTS Increased implicit and explicit biases were associated with less positive contact with patients with obesity and more exposure to faculty role modelling of discriminatory behaviour or negative comments about patients with obesity. Increased implicit bias was associated with training in how to deal with difficult patients. On average, implicit weight bias decreased and explicit bias increased during medical school, over a period of time in which implicit weight bias in the general public increased and explicit bias remained stable.
   CONCLUSIONS Medical schools may reduce students' weight biases by increasing positive contact between students and patients with obesity, eliminating unprofessional role modelling by faculty members and residents, and altering curricula focused on treating difficult patients.

AB  - Humans often behave discriminatorily towards others depending on their group membership. In this work, we establish a spatial Prisoner's dilemma model to investigate the relation between tag-mediated discrimination and cooperation. By introducing tag-mediated selective interaction, we find that if tag length is sufficiently large and individuals have moderate tolerance, cooperation can be promoted. Interestingly, both too high or too low tolerance may inhibit the emergence and maintenance of cooperation, which means that individuals may benefit from moderate tolerance in society. It is also shown that the high levels of cooperation stem from the high heterogeneity and clear boundaries between clusters. Our work should be helpful to understand both the evolution of human cooperation and the science of social identity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research effort explores attitudes toward interracial marriage and related behavior patterns in the United States. These patterns are examined longitudinally from the perspective of the general public over a 25-year period. Specifically, responses to whether one favors or opposes laws prohibiting marriages between Blacks and Whites are combined with a measure of social distance (whether one had a member of the opposite race over for dinner in the past year) to produce a hierarchy of responses that include both attitudes and corresponding behaviors, and in essence reflect varying degrees of racial prejudice. These attitudes and behaviors are analyzed using ordinal logistic regression from 1973 through 1996. Through the application of race relations and differential assimilation theories, the impact of racial group membership, age, and socio-economic status on interracial marriage attitudes and behaviors in contemporary American society is assessed. Our findings suggest that while there have been some dramatic shifts in racially patterned attitudes and behaviors across all groups, barriers to assimilation persist, and non-Blacks engage in a greater degree of social closure.

AB  - This research aims at comparing the way gender-based and age-based discriminations are expressed in recruitment settings. It takes into account how the social ingraining of non discriminatory policies influences the expression of discrimination. Concretely, given the long-term existence of non-sexist legislations, it can be assumed that gender-based discrimination would be expressed implicitly rather than explicitly. Conversely, since non-ageist policies are fairly recent, it can be supposed that age-based discrimination would be expressed either implicitly or explicitly. To validate this hypothesis, 140 participants were asked to rate the hiring chances (scale measurement) of applicants, who were either male or female and younger or older, and to provide a written justification of their decision (discursive measurement). The results generally validate the hypotheses and show that if participants rate male and female applicants similarly when using scales, their discourses reveal marks of gender based discrimination. In the case of younger and older applicants, participants express age-based prejudices explicitly and implicitly. The discussion deals with the ways discrimination is expressed and how individuals inhibit their gender-based prejudices in a normative context.

AB  - Prejudice against atheists is pervasive in the United States. Atheists lag behind virtually all other minority groups on measures of social acceptance. The sociofunctional approach suggests that distrust is at the core of anti-atheist prejudice, thus making it qualitatively different than prejudice against other disadvantaged groups. Accordingly, this research examined political bias against atheists, gays, and Blacks and the affective content accompanying such biases. Results indicated that atheists suffered the largest deficit in voting intentions from Christian participants, and this deficit was accompanied by distrust, disgust, and fear, thereby suggesting that the affective content of anti-atheist prejudice is both broader and more extreme than prejudice against other historically disadvantaged groups. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

AB  - Access to care is a critical issue for ameliorating the health and social impact of marginalization. Research indicates that sexual minority women experience low utilization of medical care overall, combined with high levels of substance abuse and lack of access to culturally appropriate services. This study uses qualitative data to examine factors that affect access to services for sexual minority women who use(d) heroin or crack cocaine. Semi-structured interviews were done with 34 sexual minority women drug users, of diverse sexual identities, recruited from community-based agencies. Interviews explored factors shaping service utilization, including basic life history, self-assessed needs, positive and negative experiences with service providers, and barriers to care. Analysis explored prejudice and discrimination at institutional and interactional levels, the role of social policy, the interactional dynamics surrounding gender presentation, and how these institutional and social processes shape individual experience. The women who participated in this study described multiple layers of marginalization that limited access to-and discouraged use of-a range of vital services, but their stories simultaneously demonstrated the power of personal networks and low-threshold agencies to share resources, provide bridges to services, and build supportive communities.

AB  - Guilt, shame, and embarrassment are quintessential moral emotions with important regulatory functions for the individual and society. Moral emotions are, however, difficult to study with neuroimaging methods because their elicitation is more intricate than that of basic emotions. Here, using functional MRI (fMRI), we employed a novel social prejudice paradigm to examine specific brain regions associated with real-time moral emotion, focusing on guilt and related moral-negative emotions. The paradigm induced intense moral-negative emotion (primarily guilt) in 22 low-prejudice individuals through preprogrammed feedback indicating implicit prejudice against Black and disabled people. fMRI data indicated that this experience of moral-negative emotion was associated with increased activity in anterior paralimbic structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, in addition to areas associated with mentalizing, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. Of significance was prominent conflict-related activity in the supragenual ACC, which is consistent with theories proposing an association between acute guilt and behavioral inhibition. Finally, a significant negative association between self-reported guilt and neural activity in the pregenual ACC suggested a role of self-regulatory processes in response to moral-negative affect. These findings are consistent with the multifaceted self-regulatory functions of moral-negative emotions in social behavior.

AB  - The findings from this study reveal a significantly higher prevalence of neurological and intellectual disabilities as well as epilepsy among adolescents residing in a social welfare/juvenile justice institution in Nigeria compared with a cohort of school going adolescents. Epilepsy and neurological deficits was particularly prevalent among adolescents admitted into the institution as victims of neglect compared with those brought in as offenders. Stigmatization of and social prejudices against children with neuro-psychiatric disabilities and epilepsy as well as lack of support for their caregivers in Nigeria was speculated as the key factor promoting neglect of such children. The speculation was based on the findings from this study and extant literature. Consequently, efforts should be geared towards disengaging childhood epilepsy and neuro-psychiatric disabilities from myth and prejudices and to provide needed support for caregivers of children with such conditions. Meanwhile curative and restorative neuro-psychiatric services should be part of the service package for children within social welfare/juvenile justice institutions in Nigeria.
   AbstractA total of 67 adolescents from a juvenile remand home were matched with 67 other adolescents by age and gender, with a view to determine the prevalence and spectrum of neurological and intellectual disabilities. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was estimated using an adapted version of the Slosson's Intelligence Test and a full neurological evaluation was carried out. The mean IQ score for the remand home participants was significantly lower than the controls (77 +/- 11 vs. 99 +/- 14; t = 1.6, P = 0.001). Almost half (46.7%) of the participants in the remand home had intellectual disability of varying degrees, including borderline intellectual functioning, compared with only two (3.3%) of the comparison group (P < 0.001). Epilepsy and neurological deficits were significantly more prevalent among the remand home group, particularly those admitted as victims of neglect, compared with the comparison group (P 0.02). These findings and recent literature were used to speculate the possible underlying factors. Policy implications for child social welfare in Nigeria were suggested.

AB  - Objective: Psychiatric stigma is a major barrier to the recovery of persons with serious mental illnesses. This study tested the efficacy of an innovative peer-run photography-based intervention, called antistigma photovoice, which targets self-stigma and promotes proactive coping with public stigma. Methods: A total of 82 individuals with serious mental illnesses enrolled at a university-based recovery center were randomly assigned to the antistigma photovoice program or to a wait-list control group. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the impact of photovoice on self-stigma, coping with stigma, empowerment, perceived recovery, self-efficacy, and depression. Results: Participation in the photovoice intervention was associated with significantly reduced self-stigma, greater use of proactive coping with societal stigma, greater increase in a sense of community activism, and perceived recovery and growth. Conclusions: The photovoice intervention demonstrated promise for reducing self-stigma and enhancing proactive coping with prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Perceivers use gendered body motion to categorize others' social identities, and these categorizations carry important consequences ranging from mate selection to prejudice. In light of such consequences, people might be motivated to control others' perceptions of their social identities by altering gendered aspects of their gait. However, it is unclear whether such deliberate body motions are sufficient to alter basic social perceptions. The authors examined sex (Study 1) and sexual orientation categorizations (Study 2) based upon point-light displays of targets who moved with self-paced, accelerated, deliberately gender-typical, and deliberately gender-atypical gaits. Categorization accuracy varied by walk condition and target characteristics, such that lesbian/gay and female targets were systematically miscategorized when altering gendered aspects of their gait. These findings demonstrate that deliberately gendered gaits can indeed alter basic social perceptions, raising new questions about the malleability of gait and the role of targets' motivations in social vision.

AB  - Public health professionals and educators have developed effective school-based interventions to reduce prejudice and stigma against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students. Such interventions can reduce the harm caused to sexual minority youths by stigma and can improve health outcomes. However, critics have warned that these interventions attempt to control speech and religious beliefs protected by the First Amendment. We review this critique and assess the legal and ethical arguments. We conclude that, both legally and ethically, there is great leeway for schools to implement LGBT-affirmative interventions. Still, we recommend that interventionists attend critics' concerns using principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). Using CBPR approaches, interventionists can achieve better community acceptance and cooperation and more successful interventions.

AB  - We examined levels of, and reasons for, anti-gay and anti-lesbian prejudice (homophobia) in pre-service physical education (PE) and non-physical education (non-PE) university students. Participants (N=409; 66% female; N=199 pre-service physical educators) completed questionnaires assessing anti-gay and lesbian prejudice, authoritarianism, social dominance orientation (SDO), physical/athletic identity and self-concept, and physical attributes. ANCOVAs revealed that PE students had higher levels of anti-gay (p=.004) and lesbian prejudice than non-PE students (p=.008), respectively. Males reported greater anti-gay prejudice (p<.001), but not anti-lesbian prejudice, than females. Authoritarian aggression was positively associated with greater anti-gay (=.49) and lesbian prejudice (=.37) among male participants. Among females, higher authoritarian aggression and SDO was associated with greater anti-gay (=.34 and =.25, respectively) and lesbian (=.26 and =.16, respectively) prejudice. The physical identity-related constructs of athletic self-concept (=.-15) and perceived upper body strength (=.39) were associated with anti-gay attitudes among male participants. Physical attractiveness (=-.29) and upper body strength (=.29) were also associated with male participants' anti-lesbian prejudice. Regression analyses showed that the differences between PE and non-PE students in anti-gay and lesbian prejudice were largely mediated by authoritarianism and SDO. The present study is the first to examine the relationship between investment in physical/sporting identity and attributes and anti-gay and lesbian prejudice in PE/sport participants. In the present sample, anti-gay and lesbian prejudice was greater in pre-service PE students than non-PE students, but these differences appear to be explained by differences in conservative ideological traits. Additionally, physical identity and athletic attributes based around masculine ideals also appear to contribute to this prejudice in males.

TI  - Implications of free will beliefs for basic theory and societal benefit: Critique and implications for social psychology
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Greater belief in free will is associated with greater empathy towards the working poor, support for social mobility, greater desire for socio-economic equality, and less belief that poor people are fated to live in poverty. We found no sign that belief in free will led to prejudice or discrimination against poor people or undercut justice. These findings from an online survey flatly contradict the claims made by James Miles (2013). Belief in a just world did produce many of the patterns Miles attributed to belief in free will. We also question the reasoning and the strength of the purported evidence in his article, and we recommend that future writers on the topic should cultivate cautious, open-minded consideration of competing views. Miles' article is a useful reminder that to some writers, the topic of free will elicits strong emotional reactions.

AB  - Classical conceptual distinctions in philosophy of education assume an individualistic subjectivity and hide the learning that can take place in the space between child (as educator) and adult (as learner). Grounded in two examples from experience I develop the argument that adults often put metaphorical sticks in their ears in their educational encounters with children. Hearers' prejudices cause them to miss out on knowledge offered by the child, but not heard by the adult. This has to do with how adults view education, knowledge, as much as child, and is even more extreme when child is also black. The idea is what Miranda Fricker calls 'epistemic injustice' which occurs when someone is wronged specifically in their capacity as a knower. Although her work concerns gender and race, I extrapolate her radical ideas to (black) child. Awareness of the epistemic injustice that is done to children and my proposal for increased epistemic modesty and epistemic equality could help transform pedagogical spaces to include child subjects as educators. A way forward is suggested that involves 'cracking' the concept of child and a different non-individualised conception of education.

AB  - Rather than critiquing social institutions and practices that have historically excluded lesbians and gay men, as did earlier social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, since the 1990s the politics of sexuality has increasingly been about demanding equal rights of citizenship. These citizenship demands have, at least to a degree, been answered via a raft of recent legislation in the UK including the Adoption and Children Act 2002, Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the Civil Partnership Act 2004, and by associated changes in policy making and practice that emphasize Equality and Diversity'. In this article we consider how the implementation of sexualities equalities policies is related to processes of privatization and individualization. This is illustrated by using sexualities equalities work in local government as a case study to indicate how processes of change and resistance are aided by these processes. The article draws on findings from a study of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equalities initiatives in local government in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which examined the views of those who now have a public duty to implement recent legislative and policy shifts and are obliged to develop equalities initiatives concerning sexual orientation' and gender reassignment'.

AB  - Attitudes, stereotyping, and prejudice are often conceived of as inner, mental or cognitive processes. Drawing on discursive psychology and critical theory, this article proposes a language-based understanding of stereotyping and the "syndrome character" of prejudice that is able to avoid certain epistemological shortcomings and connect social-psychological and sociological research. Stereotyping is outlined as a relational concept that denotes a linguistic mode of relating to the world, whilst the syndrome character of prejudice is conceptualized as a phenomenon that shows in particular stereotypical speech acts, but does not completely coincide with them. The impact of this conceptual figuration is empirically illustrated using Anders Breivik's manifesto.

AB  - When interacting with someone from another social group, one's responses may be influenced by both stereotypes and evaluations. Given behavioral results suggesting that stereotypes and evaluative associations operate independently, we used fMRI to test whether these biases are mediated by distinct brain systems. White participants viewed pairs of Black or White faces and judged them based on an evaluation (who would you befriend?) or a stereotype-relevant trait (who is more likely to enjoy athletic activities?). Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed that a predominantly occipital network represented race in a context-invariant manner. However, lateral orbitofrontal cortex preferentially represented race during friendship judgments, whereas anterior medial prefrontal cortex preferentially represented race during trait judgments. Furthermore, representation of race in left temporal pole correlated with a behavioral measure of evaluative bias during friendship judgments and, independently, a measure of stereotyping during trait judgments. Whereas early sensory regions represent race in an apparently invariant manner, representations in higher-level regions are multi-componential and context-dependent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the automatic activation of ageism by using a go/no-go version of the masked evaluative priming task. Pictures of younger persons, of older persons in everyday contexts, and of older persons depicting age-related conditions of decline were used as masked primes that preceded positive and negative target adjectives conveying either other-relevant valence (e.g., just and mean) or possessor-relevant valence (e.g., serene and lonely). The evaluative priming effect (denoting relative negativity of old-everyday primes in comparison with younger primes) was significant, as hypothesized, only for possessor-relevant targets. It was not moderated by explicit ageism. A second priming index (denoting relative negativity of old-decline primes in comparison with old-everyday primes) predicted, however, explicit ageism. Again, this result was, as expected, constrained to the index based on possessor-relevant targets. This study provides further evidence that prejudice in terms of automatic evaluations of social stimuli can be more fine grained beyond a mere one-dimensional positivenegative differentiation.

AB  - Tensions emanating from the Israeli/Palestinian conflict lead to misunderstanding, segregation, and conflict between Arab and Jewish students on U.S. college campuses. Teaching about this conflict presents particular challenges for faculty and student affairs staff. This study uses a participatory action research method that engages Arab and Jewish students in understanding and changing issues of concern to their own campus communities. A qualitative analysis of the final papers and interviews from the students in Arab/Jewish intergroup dialogue courses indicated that the students had different pre-perceptions of each other, experienced conflict and strong emotions in the dialogue, and reported outcomes that progressed from the development of communication and listening skills to critical self-reflection, perspective-taking and empathy, development of friendships, and action for social change. The students continued to struggle with understanding each other and maintaining relationships. Recommendations for pedagogy and research are discussed in this article.

AB  - This article considers some of the impacts of armed political conflicts on field supervision where supervisor and student are affiliated with different sides, as exemplified by the Jewish supervisor/Arab student dyad in social work training in Israel. This conflict, it suggests, impedes the development of a trusting supervisory bond, makes it difficult for supervisors to provide candid feedback and evaluation, and impairs the students' development of professional identity. The article ends with detailed recommendations for dealing with the many practical issues that arise in field supervision in the context of armed conflicts.

AB  - Children and adolescents who are growing up gay, lesbian, bisexual, gender nonconforming, or gender discordant experience unique developmental challenges. They are at risk for certain mental health problems, many of which are significantly correlated with stigma and prejudice. Mental health professionals have an important role to play in fostering healthy development in this population. Influences on sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, and gender discordance, and their developmental relationships to each other, are reviewed. Practice principles and related issues of cultural competence, research needs, and ethics are discussed. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2012;51(9):957-974.

AB  - Research has documented the stigma of obesity extensively, but little attention has been given to the study of stigma toward formerly obese individuals. The present study examines whether the stigma of obesity in romantic relationships carries over to formerly obese individuals by using primary data collected from a Midwestern university in the United States (N = 363). We consider how an individual's own body weight, demographic characteristics, familiarity, and attitudes affect the willingness to form a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person. Results suggest that obese individuals are less likely to hesitate about engaging in a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person than underweight or normal weight individuals, but only when attitudes toward obese and formerly obese individuals are controlled. In terms of demographic characteristics, men and African Americans are more likely to hesitate about forming a romantic relationship than their respective counterparts. More familiarity with currently obese family members and formerly obese close friends appears to reduce the stigma minimally. Greater social distance is also desired if weight loss is believed to be temporary.

AB  - This study explored HIV vaccine acceptability and strategies for culturally appropriate dissemination among sexually diverse Aboriginal peoples in Canada, among those at highest HIV risk. We conducted four focus groups (n = 23) with Aboriginal male (1) and female (1) service users, peer educators (1) and service providers (1) in Ontario, Canada. Transcripts were analysed with narrative thematic techniques from grounded theory, using NVivo. Participants' mean age was 37 years; about half (52%) were female, half (48%) Two-spirit or lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB)-identified, 48% had a high-school education or less and 57% were unemployed. Vaccine uptake was motivated by community survival; however, negative HIV vaccine perceptions, historically based mistrust of government and healthcare institutions, perceived conflict between western and traditional medicine, sexual prejudice and AIDS stigma within and outside of Aboriginal communities, and vaccine cost may present formidable obstacles to HIV vaccine acceptability. Culturally appropriate processes of engagement emerged on individual levels (i.e., respect for self-determination, explanations in Native languages, use of modelling and traditional healing concepts) and community levels (i.e., leadership by Aboriginal HIV advocates and political representatives, identification of gatekeepers, and procuring Elders' endorsements). Building on cultural strengths and acknowledging the history and context of mistrust and social exclusion are fundamental to effective HIV vaccine dissemination.

AB  - In many instances, adults serve as gatekeepers for what books children are permitted to explore. Unfortunately, this means that most children have limited access to picture books with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) characters. In this article, we use queer pedagogy and observations about neoliberalism to provide a qualitative analysis of LGBTQ characters in picture books which were finalists for a Lambda Literary Award during 2000-2005. We examined the ways in which LGBTQ identities and relationships are negotiated and how sexual prejudice is treated. While it is improbable that the books we analyze would be embraced by proponents of neoliberalism, we also briefly consider some ways in which they may be inadvertently consistent with that perspective. The article closes with recommendations regarding discussion questions, additional readings, and educational activities aimed at guiding children, and adults, to appreciate a diversity of multidimensional identities and family structures, to develop strategies to respond constructively to emotional and physical violence, and to promote the public wellbeing. We hope that this analysis will lead to more frequent, productive, and expansive discussions of this literature among adults and children.

AB  - Spain has experienced a radical change in terms of recognition of same-sex couples and non-heterosexual families. Officially a Catholic country during a 40-year dictatorial regime, the consolidation of democracy created a favourable context for the legalization of same-sex marriage and the recognition of lesbian and gay families. In this article, the Spanish case is examined against existing literature on queer kinship revealing important peculiarities. The available data on people's use of this new legal possibility and their reasons for marrying or not are also analysed. This article argues that these social changes bring about new challenges, since they shed light onto different forms of discrimination and homophobic prejudice, still present at the different levels of society, public policies and the legal system.

AB  - Context Studies involving physicians suggest that unconscious bias may be related to clinical decision making and may predict poor patient-physician interaction. The presence of unconscious race and social class bias and its association with clinical assessments or decision making among medical students is unknown.
   Objective To estimate unconscious race and social class bias among first-year medical students and investigate its relationship with assessments made during clinical vignettes.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A secure Web-based survey was administered to 211 medical students entering classes at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, in August 2009 and August 2010. The survey included the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess unconscious preferences, direct questions regarding students' explicit race and social class preferences, and 8 clinical assessment vignettes focused on pain assessment, informed consent, patient reliability, and patient trust. Adjusting for student demographics, multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether responses to the vignettes were associated with unconscious race or social class preferences.
   Main Outcome Measures Association of scores on an established IAT for race and a novel IAT for social class with vignette responses.
   Results Among the 202 students who completed the survey, IAT responses were consistent with an implicit preference toward white persons among 140 students (69%, 95% CI, 61%-75%). Responses were consistent with a preference toward those in the upper class among 174 students (86%, 95% CI, 80%-90%). Assessments generally did not vary by patient race or occupation, and multivariable analyses for all vignettes found no significant relationship between implicit biases and clinical assessments. Regression coefficient for the association between pain assessment and race IAT scores was -0.49 (95% CI, -1.00 to 0.03) and for social class, the coefficient was -0.04 (95% CI, -0.50 to 0.41). Adjusted odds ratios for other vignettes ranged from 0.69 to 3.03 per unit change in IAT score, but none were statistically significant. Analysis stratified by vignette patient race or class status yielded similarly negative results. Tests for interactions between patient race or class status and student IAT D scores in predicting clinical assessments were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions The majority of first-year medical students at a single school had IAT scores consistent with implicit preference for white persons and possibly for those in the upper class. However, overall vignette-based clinical assessments were not associated with patient race or occupation, and no association existed between implicit preferences and the assessments.

AB  - Obese individuals experience pervasive stigmatization. Interventions attempting to reduce obesity stigma by targeting its origins have yielded mixed results. This randomized, controlled study examined the effectiveness of two interventions to reduce obesity stigma: cognitive dissonance and social consensus. Participants were college undergraduate students (N = 64, 78% women, mean age = 21.2 years, mean BMI = 23.1 kg/m(2)) of diverse ethnicities. Obesity stigma (assessed with the Antifat Attitudes Test (AFAT)) was assessed at baseline (Visit 1) and 1 week later, immediately following the intervention (Visit 2). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups where they received standardized written feedback on their obesity stigma levels. Cognitive dissonance participants (N = 21) were told that their AFAT scores were discrepant from their values (high core values of kindness and equality and high stigma), social consensus participants (N = 22) were told their scores were discrepant from their peers' scores (stigma much higher than their peers), and control participants (N = 21) were told their scores were consistent with both their peers' scores and their own values. Following the intervention, omnibus analyses revealed significant group differences on the AFAT Physical/Romantic Unattractiveness subscale (PRU; F (2, 59) = 4.43, P < 0.05). Planned contrasts revealed that cognitive dissonance group means were significantly lower than control means for AFAT total, AFAT PRU subscale, and AFAT social/character disparagement subscale (all P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between social consensus and controls. Results from this study suggest that cognitive dissonance interventions may be a successful way to reduce obesity stigma, particularly by changing attitudes about the appearance and attractiveness of obese individuals.

AB  - The present paper, drawing from the perspective of social cognition, examines and evaluates an intervention based on social-cognitive perspective-taking on the reduction of stereotyping and prejudice in older adults. Data were collected in a sample of Spanish participants with a mean age of 63.2 years. The intervention, aimed at reducing prejudice and stereotyping, was based on mental imagery and tested different variables that could moderate perspective-taking effectiveness. Main effects were not found in ANOVAs, but the interaction effects reveal that the intervention was effective for some participants, particularly for those with higher scores in agreeableness, differential attribution, and some values. Conclusions are applied to the field of university programs for older adults.

AB  - Previous research indicates that racial and ethnic prejudice continues to be prevalent in U.S. society; however, the social-psychological processes of prejudice are not fully understood. Furthermore, much research on prejudice focuses on white against black prejudice, at the exclusion of other minority groups. The purpose of this chapter is to explore white prejudice against Latinos using in-depth interview data with college students. Findings indicate that many participants describe instances in which they felt prejudice, yet they use creative mechanisms to justify their prejudice or construct it as something other than prejudice. Mostly, participants described their own prejudice as a "special type" of prejudice - including trait prejudice, situational prejudice, reciprocal prejudice, and recovered prejudice - that is distinct from ordinary prejudice. By describing their own prejudice as a "special type," participants are able to construct themselves as nonprejudiced individuals while simultaneously acknowledging their prejudice.

AB  - We analyze bibliometric trends of topics relevant to the epidemiologic research of social determinants of health. A search of the PubMed database, covering the period 1985-2007, was performed for the topics: socioeconomic factors, sex, race/ethnicity, discrimination/prejudice, social capital/support, lifecourse, income inequality, stress, behavioral research, contextual effects, residential segregation, multilevel modeling, regression based indices to measure inequalities, and structural equation modeling/causal diagrams/path analysis. The absolute, but not the relative, frequency of publications increased for all themes. Total publications in PubMed increased 2.3 times, while the subsets of epidemiology/public health and social epidemiologic themes/methods increased by factors of 5.3 and 5.2, respectively. Only multilevel and contextual analyses had a growth over and above that observed for epidemiology/public health. We conclude that there is clearly room for wider use of established techniques, and for new methods to emerge when they satisfy theoretical needs.

AB  - Although the stigma of mental illness has been widely documented, the specific processes through which psychiatric labels evoke prejudice and discrimination are not well understood. We examined how ascribing humanity to an individual labeled with mental illness may influence perceptions of dangerousness and motivations for social rejection. Study 1 revealed that a general mental illness label (compared to a general physical illness label) led to reductions in ascribed humanity, which predicted increased perceptions of dangerousness. In Study 2, participants formed impressions about an individual bearing a specific mental illness label (or a specific physical illness label) while normative behavioral information and full remission status were held constant. Under these conditions, the target labeled with mental illness evoked greater ascribed humanity. Further analyses revealed a unique effect for the target bearing the mental illness label: ascribing humanity to the target predicted reductions in perceived dangerousness, which in turn influenced social rejection. A similar mediational path was not found for the target bearing the physical illness label. We discuss the implications of ascribing humanity to people labeled mentally ill for stereotyping and stigma reduction.

AB  - "Geburtenpolitik in Deutschland, 1912-1945: Diskurse, Politik und Praxis". This article compares the responses to the declining birthrate by three very different regimes in Wilhelmine, Weimar and Nazi Germany. In their intent these policies were markedly different: just before and during the First World War a declining birthrate symbolised national decline, sapping national progress and military power and the central aim was to boost fertility almost at any price; eugenics was not yet a major influence on official Wilhelmine policy. In the wake of the devastation reaped by the lost war and also influenced by the depression at the end of the 1920s the democratically elected governments of the Weimar Republic attempted to 'rationalise' reproduction to suit the prevailing socio-economic circumstances and the belief in modernity in industry and everyday life. They favoured 'fewer but better children' but their policies remained fragmented and heavily contested; lawmakers tried to balance individual rights and collective interests, welfarism and eugenic concerns. In contrast, Nazi leaders developed a comprehensive and sophisticated system of selective reproduction based on racial prejudice; legal safeguards to protect the rights of individuals were ruthlessly dismantled. Material and ideological inducements to boost the birthrate benefited only 'Aryans' and healthy Germans. A series of extremely repressive measures were introduced: on the one hand they were meant to curb the breeding of the 'unfit', like Jews, gypsies, or those considered congenitally diseased and, on the other, they aimed to curb individual birth control by those deemed 'fit'.
   But of course the picture is more complicated. If we compare official population programmes with their implementation at the local level and also with the reproductive strategies employed by ordinary women and men, a more subtle picture emerges about the regimes which is marked by both fundamental changes but also striking continuities.

AB  - The primary question asked for this special issue concerns how neuroscience data might contribute to and generate new theories in social psychology. Interestingly, in attempts to address this question, social neuroscientists have rushed to make sometimes overly bold claims about their data to demonstrate the utility of social neuroscience. The implicit logic in this response is a fear that to be useful, social neuroscience data needs quickly to move beyond brain mapping-the localization of specific social processes such as morality, the self, attitude, or prejudice to a particular brain region-and contribute in a more meaningful way. The promise of social neuroscience has always been to link multiple levels of analysis, constrain interpretation across these levels, and derive new predictions; yet there is now some question as to whether the field can deliver on this promise. Although this is an important question to ask, I suggest that requiring specific answers to this concern may be counterproductive at this stage of the field and that shifting the focus from brain mapping to process inference may be too early. Reverse inferences from the brain to social theory need to be based on accurate models of brain function and to the extent there are errors in our understanding of observed brain activation patterns our inferences will be necessarily invalid. What is required in social neuroscience research is an iterative cycle of brain mapping with one goal to understand how social and affective processes are computed in the brain, and with each iteration a second goal to determine whether (a) current social psychological models can account for these data, and (b) if not, to derive new theories. Thus, brain mapping as a research goal cannot be maligned, as it is a critical element of the social neuroscience enterprise. Indeed, at this stage of this newly emerging field, brain mapping should perhaps even be our dominant focus.

AB  - Objective: Meta-analyze the literature on posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in youths post-disaster. Method: Meta-analytic synthesis of the literature (k = 96 studies; N-total = 74,154) summarizing the magnitude of associations between disasters and youth PTS, and key factors associated with variations in the magnitude of these associations. We included peer-reviewed studies published prior to 1/1/2009 that quantitatively examined youth PTS (<= 18 years at event) after a distinct and identifiable disaster. Results: Despite variability across studies, disasters had a significant effect on youth PTS (small-to-medium magnitude; r(pooled) = .19, SEr = .03; d = 0.4). Female gender (r(pooled) = .14), higher death toll (disasters of death toll <= 25: r(pooled) = .09; vs. disasters with >= 1,000 deaths: r(pooled) = .22), child proximity (r(pooled) = .33), personal loss (r(pooled) = .16), perceived threat (r(pooled) = .34), and distress (r(pooled) = .38) at time of event were each associated with increased PTS. Studies conducted within 1 year post-disaster, studies that used established measures, and studies that relied on child-report data identified a significant effect. Conclusion: Youths are vulnerable to appreciable PTS after disaster, with preexisting child characteristics, aspects of the disaster experience, and study methodology each associated with variations in the effect magnitude. Findings underscore the importance of measurement considerations in post-disaster research. Areas in need of research include the long-term impact of disasters, disaster-related media exposure, prior trauma and psychopathology, social support, ethnicity/race, prejudice, parental psychopathology, and the effects of disasters in developing regions of the world. Policy and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - This article introduces the 16 articles appearing in the 2009 and 2010 volumes of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy that were submitted in response to a call for papers on "The Social Psychology of the 2008 United States Presidential Election." The papers touch a wide array of election topics, comparing the backgrounds and values of voters and nonvoters, those voting for different candidates, and those who choose which candidates they support early vs. late during the campaign. These papers, together with several others on media representations of candidates, highlight the continuing presence of race in shaping political attitudes and preferences, and also emphasize the evolution of American prejudices in the election process, from overt rejection of individuals who are racially different, to qualified political support under certain circumstances. Other papers in the collection focus on the role of gender as well as race, and also on some of the many ways in which presidential elections reflect and shape the self-concepts of American voters.

AB  - This research analyses the mediational role of threat perception in the relationship between prejudice and discrimination (opposition to immigration and opposition to naturalization of immigrants). In the first study, using representative samples in 21 European countries (N=36 566) from European Social Survey (2002), we showed that the relationship between prejudice and opposition to immigration was more strongly mediated by realistic than by symbolic threat perceptions. In Study 2, using representative samples in two countries with different traditions of immigration (Switzerland, N=940; Portugal, N=1514), we showed that realistic threat more strongly mediated the relationship between prejudice and opposition to immigration, while only symbolic threat perception mediated the link between prejudice and opposition to naturalization. The theoretical implications of considering threat perceptions as factors that legitimize discrimination are discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We present an alternative self-report measure of the social worldview component in Duckitt's (2001) Dual Process Model (DPM) of prejudice. Theoretically, worldviews represent belief structures about the nature of the social world (schemas). The new Frequency Estimation Index of Dual Social Worldviews (FEI-DSW) uses 0-100% response scales to assess social worldviews using indicators of the subjective estimation of the frequency of events. Previously, worldview indicators have been indexed using ideological attitude measures as a proxy. Exploratory (N = 378: Study 1) and Confirmatory (N = 300: Study 2) Factor Analyses validated the factor structure of the FEI-DSW in undergraduate and New Zealand community samples. The FEI-DSW evidenced good construct validity, as its dual factors, dangerous worldview (FEI-DW) and competitive worldview (FEI-CW) differentially predicted Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). The FEI-DSW provides a reliable and valid measure of social worldviews that is closer to a formal definition of worldviews as social schemas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A case study of Muhammadiyah's Islamic charitable health services in the islands of Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, was undertaken in 2008, to assess the impact of privatization of health care on this socially-oriented service provider, especially in terms of access for the poor. Findings presented here relate primarily to the effects on Muhammadiyah's maternal and child health and contraceptive services. In order to survive and thrive amidst private and public competitors, Muhammadiyah's primary care units, mostly consisting of maternal and child health centres and maternity clinics, when not closed altogether, have been directed toward providing curative hospital services, and more expensive and sometimes unnecessary treatment. A shift in the patient population away from the poor has also occurred, as market pressures transform this charitable enterprise into a commercial one, prejudicing reproductive health care and reducing access for those most in need. An improved stewardship role by government is needed to regulate the private sector, along with serious thinking about the future of primary and preventive care and health promotion, including for comprehensive reproductive health care. The neglect of these core primary care elements in Indonesia may worsen as privatization proceeds and profit considerations become more pressing with increased competition.

AB  - We outline primary features of a theoretical perspective on processes of social change in human systems that deals with broadly defined kinds of process, the nature of variants that are expressed and consolidate as change occurs, and, with specific reference to agency, the ways in which intentional actors are implicated in the changes that befall them. Our aim is to contribute to a general theory of process that is not prejudiced by the possible misrepresentation of outcomes arising in particular contexts (e.g. modernity), or the contexts themselves, as being causal processes. We direct attention to four problems of a methodological and ethical nature that may arise when analysts strive for generality.

AB  - Prior stereotyping research provides conflicting evidence regarding the importance of person categorization along a particular dimension for the automatic activation of a stereotype corresponding to that dimension. Experiment 1 replicated a racial stereotyping effect on object identification and examined whether it could be attenuated by encouraging categorization by age. Experiment 2 employed socially complex person stimuli and manipulated whether participants categorized spontaneously or by race. In Experiment 3, the distinctiveness of the racial dimension was manipulated by having Black females appear in the context of either Black males or White females. The results indicated that conditions fostering categorization by race consistently produced automatic racial stereotyping and that conditions fostering nonracial categorization can eliminate automatic racial stereotyping. Implications for the relation between automatic stereotype activation and dimension of categorization are discussed.

AB  - Background: In Ethiopia, where HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are very common, little is known about the prejudice and misconceptions of rural communities towards People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) and TB.
   Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in Gilgel Gibe Field Research area (GGFRA) in southwest Ethiopia to assess the prejudice and misconceptions of rural and urban communities towards PLHA and TB. The study population consisted of 862 randomly selected adults in GGFRA. Data were collected by trained personnel using a pretested structured questionnaire. To triangulate the findings, 8 focus group discussions among women and men were done.
   Results: Of the 862 selected study participants, 750(87%) accepted to be interviewed. The mean age of the respondents was 31.2 (SD +/- 11.0). Of the total interviewed individuals, 58% of them were females. More than half of the respondents did not know the possibility of transmission of HIV from a mother to a child or by breast feeding. For fear of contagion of HIV, most people do not want to eat, drink, and share utensils or clothes with a person living with HIV/AIDS. A higher proportion of females [OR = 1.5, (95% CI: 1.0, 2.2)], non-literate individuals [OR = 2.3, (95% CI: 1.4, 3.6)], rural residents [OR = 3.8, (95% CI: 2.2, 6.6)], and individuals who had poor knowledge of HIV/AIDS [OR = 2.8, (95% CI: 1.8, 2.2)] were more likely to have high prejudice towards PLHA than respectively males, literates, urban residents and individuals with good knowledge. Exposure to cold air was implicated as a major cause of TB. Literates had a much better knowledge about the cause and methods of transmission and prevention of TB than non-literates. More than half of the individuals (56%) had high prejudice towards a patient with TB. A larger proportion of females [OR = 1.3, (95% CI: 1.0, 1.9)] and non-literate individuals [OR = 1.4, (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0)] had high prejudice towards patients with TB than males and literate individuals.
   Conclusion: TB/HIV control programs in collaboration with other partners should invest more in social mobilization and education of the communities to rectify the widespread prejudice and misconceptions.

AB  - This article offers new directions in measuring racial isolation in schools. The most widely used measurement approach is to examine the mean on the distribution of school percentage non-White across non-White students (the isolation rate) or the percentage of non-White students in schools with large shares of non-Whites (e.g., 90% or more) at a single point in time. Using data on New York City public school students, I discuss the complexity that is revealed when school officials and researchers consider the following three dimensions of racial isolation: between classrooms, over time, and among non-White students.

AB  - Objective: Relatively little research has investigated the connection between religiosity and physical child abuse risk. Certain aspects, such as specific religious orientation or beliefs, and cognitive schema, such as socially conformist beliefs, may account for the connection that some have claimed increase religious parents' abuse potential. The current study examined whether greater Extrinsic religiosity, but not intrinsic religiosity, was associated with elevated physical abuse potential. Those who hold a literal interpretation of the Bible and attend church More frequently were also expected to evidence increased abuse risk. Additionally, the role of social conformity in mediating or moderating the association between religiosity and abuse potential was investigated.
   Methods: Two hundred and seven regularly attending Christians of various denominations completed self-report measures of religiosity, social conformity, and child abuse potential.
   Results: Findings indicate that Extrinsic religiosity was associated with increased physical abuse potential, with greater social conformity further moderating this association. Intrinsic religious orientation was not associated with abuse risk. Further, those who consider the Bible to be literally true were more socially conformist and evidenced greater abuse risk.
   Conclusions: For those working with religious parents, the particular nature of religiosity needs to be considered when interpreting a connection between religiosity and abuse risk, as well as the potential attitudes the parent holds regarding the need for conformity. Given the complexity of religiosity, future research should explore other potential mediating and moderating factors that could further clarify its connection to physical abuse risk.
   Practice implications: Clarifying how religiosity relates to child abuse risk has implications for professionals working with the vast numbers of parents for whom religion is a visible force in their daily lives. Findings from the present study suggest that professionals should consider the underlying motivation for an individual's religion as well as the importance the individual places on conformity. Religiosity per se may not be as critical to predicting physical abuse risk as selected approaches to religion or particular attitudes the religious individual assumes in their daily life.

AB  - Past research demonstrates that when people are motivated to affiliate with another, their beliefs and implicit attitudes spontaneously adjust toward that person's apparent beliefs, a phenomenon dubbed affiliative social tuning. Two experiments examined the role of people's mood in regulating affiliative social tuning of implicit and explicit racial prejudice. Based on the idea that positive mood encourages and negative mood discourages pursuit of accessible goals, we predicted that when participants were in positive moods, interpersonal goals and the apparent beliefs of an interaction partner would interactively shape participants' racial prejudice. In contrast, when participants were in negative moods, interpersonal goals and the apparent beliefs of an interaction partner were not expected to impact racial prejudice. Results of two experiments supported these predictions. Other ways that mood may shape affiliative social tuning are discussed.

AB  - Many well-known psychological theories on diverse processes (e.g., moral and political judgment, prejudice, the self) ascribe vital roles to social values, but define values vaguely. The psychological functioning of values can be clarified by conceptualizing them as mental representations that operate at a system level, (abstract) value level, and an instantiation level. At the system level, values reflect motivational tensions described within Schwartz's [Schwartz, S. H. (1992). Universals in the content and structure of values: Theoretical advances and empirical tests in 20 countries. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 25, 1-65] circular model of values. These tensions are evident in correlations between values, the accessibility of values from memory, judgments of value coargumentation in rhetoric, feelings of ambivalence toward others, effects of value priming on behavior, and patterns of value change. At the value level, values are more strongly connected to feelings than to past behavior or beliefs, and the types of emotion depend on the values' roles as ideal versus ought self-guides. At the instantiation level, contemplation of concrete, typical instantiations of a value increase value-affirming behavior by affecting perceptual readiness to detect and apply the value. All three levels of representation are crucial for addressing key puzzles in the role of values in social psychological processes.

AB  - Intergroup contact is undoubtedly associated with lower levels of self-reported prejudice. In some situations, however, contact may have little or no association with prejudice. Studies conducted in apartheid South Africa rarely found such an association. Apartheid was overturned in 1994, but there have been few explicit tests of the relationship since then. The present study explored the relation between contact and prejudice in a large (N = 2,599) and diverse nonprobability sample of South Africans. Participants were recruited from four universities. In addition, factors were explored that might modulate the contact-prejudice relation, or have independent effects. The relation between prejudice and contact was larger for affective prejudice (r approximate to vertical bar.35 vertical bar) than for social distance (r approximate to vertical bar.2 vertical bar). Analysis showed that the effects of contact were not reducible to those of other variables, although the contact-prejudice relation was mediated in many instances.

AB  - Disgust specific to sexual stimuli has been thought to be an adaptation that serves purposes of pathogen-avoidance, partner selection and social dominance. While the link between disgust responses and homonegative and transnegative attitudes has been relatively established, it is not yet clear why. Literature using evolutionary psychology perspectives of these phenomena is scarce in areas with substantial LGBT-related violence like Colombia. This research aimed to study the interplay of predispositional (e.g. sociodemographic, reported contact), affective (e.g. disgust sensitivity) and cognitive (e.g. Right-Wing Authoritarian) variables in homonegative and transnegative attitudes of Colombian adults. Participants (N = 272) had a mean age of 26.38 (SD = 9.47), women comprised 72% of the sample and men 28%. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that increased sexual specific disgust sensitivity and greater RWA predicted stronger homonegativity and transnegativity. The relationship between sexual disgust and prejudice was partially mediated by RWA. Findings suggest that sexual disgust sensitivity adaptations in homonegativity and transnegativity may respond to selection pressures that differ from pathogen-avoidance perspectives, and that are associated with maintaining social hierarchy and social dominance. Anti-prejudice initiatives would benefit from targeting emotional responses of sexual disgust, especially within communities and institutions that have historically endorsed conservative and traditional values.

AB  - An increasingly common view is that 'racism' can be defined as prejudice plus power. However, this view is ambiguous between two interpretations. The first proposes a descriptive definition, claiming that a prejudice plus power account of 'racism' best accounts for our ordinary usage of the term. The second proposes a revisionary definition, claiming that we should adopt a new account of 'racism' because doing so will bring pragmatic benefit. In this paper, I argue that the prejudice plus power view is unsatisfying on either interpretation.

AB  - Written by a Polish-Russian scholar Tadeusz Zielinski, Our Debt to Antiquity (1903) was a successful attempt to combat the prejudiced view that classical education resists progress. Zielinski argued that Darwinian laws manifest themselves in his discipline in three aspects: (1) in the emergence of Greek and Latin languages as a result of the selection of word-forms and expressions that testify to certain features of national character; (2) in the persistence of classical education across many centuries as the 'fittest' educational system; (3) in the selection of schoolchildren for national elites. Although Zielinski's application of Darwinian laws of selection to human society may appear reactionary to a modern reader, this article argues that in doing so he defends classical education both from the left-wing populists and from attempts at abuse from the right. Moreover, his thoughts prompt modern scholars to reflect on the real presence of Social Darwinism in our present educational system.

Intergroup factors and social-cognitive skills were assessed as predictors. Findings revealed that adolescents were less likely to see bullying as acceptable and less likely to explicitly support the bully in intragroup interpersonal bullying compared to intergroup bias-based bullying. Further, adolescents with higher theory of mind and empathy were more likely to evaluate intergroup bias-based bullying as less acceptable and more likely to challenge the bully. Adolescents' prejudice and discrimination towards refugees were predictors of bystander judgments and responses to intergroup bias-based bullying. This study provides implications for anti-bullying intervention programs.

AB  - This essay offers a significant reconceptualization of Jane Austen's influence on political novelists of the mid-nineteenth century by examining Elizabeth Gaskell's extensive use of Pride and Prejudice (1813) in her novel North and South (1855). At a moment when the political dimensions of Austen's fictions were fading to obscurity, Gaskell drew on Austen's portrayal of domestic relationships to underscore their relevance to "public" problems. On this view, the Austenian courtship plot does not contain political anxieties so much as animate them, with the logic of complementary coupling providing a formal and thematic model for the dialectical engagements necessary for navigating social conflict. At the same time, Gaskell uses Austenian motifs to dramatize the "marriageability" of different generic frameworks during a time of regional fragmentation while also envisioning Austen as a parental figure whose legacy called for continuing negotiation.

AB  - A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at mAP(0.5) and mAP([0.50:0.95]), respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few- shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel.

AB  - The authors carry out a critical overview of the research on comics and the training of readers based on the analysis of the academic discourse generated around the subject of study. The research reviews the concomitances and intersections between comics and didactics of children's and youth literature. It reflects on the consequences, debates and prejudices that this interrelation has generated in relation to their academic and social status. Likewise, they rigorously examine the main problems that cross-sectional research on the comic strip, derived among others, from the complexity of its definition, its epistemological location and ascription to mass culture and the child receptor from the framework of reading and literary education.

AB  - Eliminating separation and viciousness against girl children has been on the global, local, and public plans for more than 10 years. Regardless, young girls keep on being oppressed due to their gender and are presented with many types of savagery. India's legal system guarantees equal rights to all citizens, regardless of gender. However, unequal power relationships between men and women have resulted in abuses of women's reproductive rights. The girl child has frequently been subjected to the most heinous types of discrimination. Many incidences of female feticide have occurred in the country as a result of gender bias, deep-seated preconceptions, and discrimination towards the girl child. With the growth of knowledge and economic prosperity, strong male preference has continued to increase rather than shrink, with the extreme consequence of the eradication of the female child. The advancement of science and technology has aided this trend even further. Modern procedures can now be used to determine the fetus's gender before or after conception. Female feticide has largely replaced female infanticide in most places. One of the most severe violations of the right to life is denying a girl child her right to live. It has been noted, however, that the moral guilt associated with the abortion of a girl child after she is born is not felt in the same way if the fetus is aborted while still in the womb. The current paper will frame issues for conversation at the gathering inside this general system.

AB  - Ethnic minority group members' responses to their prejudicial treatment can take several forms. One involves identity concealment (e.g., 'passing'). In order to understand such a response, we must explore participants' understandings of the interactional context before them, their meta-perceptions of the identity others ascribe to them, and the varied meanings that identity concealment/non-disclosure may have in that context. Our analysis of interview data (N = 30) obtained with Roma in Hungary reveals diverse forms of, and motivations for, the concealment of their Roma identity. Some participants reported examples of proactive identity concealment, others reported more reactive forms (in which they went along with others' mistaken assumptions concerning their identity). The motivations for identity concealment (whether proactive or reactive) included the desire to: secure material benefits; avoid conflict; take pleasure from seeing others' assumptions blinding them to the reality before them; test (and expose) majority group members' attitudes; allow themselves opportunities to experience the world in new ways. Our analysis highlights the importance of social identity researchers recognizing the diverse motivations for ethnic identity concealment: From the actors' perspective concealment is not always assimilatory, and in some contexts can be experienced as empowering.

AB  - People's automatic (unintentional, uncontrollable, and efficient) preference between social groups often determines their automatic preference between unknown individual members of these groups, a prominent example for automatic prejudice. What happens when the person making the judgment has long known the target individuals? Practice might automatize the deliberate judgment of the individuals. Then, if deliberate judgment is nonprejudiced, automatic prejudice might decrease. In 29 studies (total N = 4,907), we compared preferences between a famous member of a dominant social group and a famous member of a stigmatized social group on indirect measures of evaluation that were developed to measure automatic preference and on self-report measures. In most studies, we chose pairs based on prior self-reported preference for the member of the stigmatized group. The measures showed discrepancy, with indirect measures suggesting an automatic preference for the member of the dominant group. We replicated these results with various target individuals, two pairs of social groups (Black/White, old/young), two indirect measures, and in two countries (Studies 1-23). The indirectly measured prodominant preference was stronger when visual characteristics of the group were present rather than absent (Studies 24 and 25), suggesting a stronger effect of group characteristics on automatic than on deliberate preference between the individuals. On self-report and indirect measures, the preferences between individuals were related to the preferences between their groups (Studies 26 and 27) yet also to individuating information (Studies 28 and 29). Our results suggest that group evaluation plays a central role in the automatic evaluation of familiar (and not only novel) members of stigmatized groups.

AB  - Featuring an online experiment and content analysis of a research sample of 185 participants with different races/ethnicities, this study investigates how bridging and bonding capital online and offline (a) encourage targets of racial discrimination to seek support, (b) buffer targets' emotional distress, and (c) facilitate assertive coping behaviors. Hierarchical regressions indicate individuals bridging with a wider range of interpersonal networks offline are more likely to seek support than those with fewer bridging ties. Online bonding helps buffer emotional distress when targets perceive the prejudiced acts encountered as less severe. Maintaining connections with diverse people offline also helps targets cope with racial discrimination assertively when the supportive messages received fail to fully validate their feelings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - In a prior publication, I used structural equation modeling of multimethod data to examine the construct validity of Implicit Association Tests. The results showed no evidence that IATs measure implicit constructs (e.g., implicit self-esteem, implicit racial bias). This critique of IATs elicited several responses by implicit social-cognition researchers, who tried to defend the validity and usefulness of IATs. I carefully examine these arguments and show that they lack validity. IAT proponents consistently ignore or misrepresent facts that challenge the validity of IATs as measures of individual differences in implicit cognitions. One response suggests that IATs can be useful even if they merely measure the same constructs as self-report measures, but I find no support for the claim that IATs have practically significant incremental predictive validity. In conclusions, IATs are widely used without psychometric evidence of construct or predictive validity.

AB  - This study examined the role parasocial contact with a transgender character on an online TV show (Transparent) may play in reducing prejudice toward transgender people. An experiment was conducted with participants randomly assigned to view either a video depicting a transgender character, or a non-transgender character portrayed by the same actor. Results were consistent with predictions derived from the intergroup contact mediation model for explaining how intergroup contact reduces prejudice toward an outgroup. Critical to reduction of prejudice toward transgender people is the quality of the parasocial interaction with the transgender character. Poor quality of parasocial contact may have unintended negative effects on prejudice toward transgender people based on the data. Limitations and implications of the study for the use of entertainment media to reduce stigma toward transgender people are discussed.

AB  - LGB affiliate stigma, the prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes toward individuals who have close associations with LGB people, is a particularly harmful form of stigma against close others (e.g., family members, friends) of LGB individuals. Compared to individualistic cultures, affiliate stigma could be more prevalent in collectivistic cultures due to the heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationship and social harmony; however, only a limited number of cross-cultural and quantitative research is available on this topic. The current research effort looked to explore potential social-cultural predictors of gay and lesbian affiliate stigma using a sample recruited from two urban Chinese communities. Univariate regression analysis showed that female gender, more prior contact with gay/lesbian, higher levels of perceived biogenetic causes of sexual orientation, higher endorsement of Western culture, lower levels of perceived public stigma, and lower homophobia predicted lower levels of gay and lesbian affiliate stigma. However, only endorsement of Western culture, public stigma, and homophobia were significant in multiple regression analysis. The current findings shed light on the potential effects of culture and social influences on Chinese individual's perceptions of gay and lesbian affiliate stigma and highlight the importance of increasing exposure of sexual minority issues and education among the general public.

AB  - In Spain, housing is one of the main axes of social inequality. Its position within Spain's economic model and welfare system is key to understanding why its financialization at the beginning of the 21st century had such different consequences among residents as well as territorially. In this context, from 2001 to 2011, Madrid became one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in Europe. This article delves into how both housing and its location organise inequality in different social spheres and reproduce it over time. To this end, the geography of this inequality is analysed in different social residential trajectories, along with how segregation produces its own dynamics of inequality. The analysis is based on census data and applies a combination of factor and cluster analyses. The results reveal important processes of social residential marginalisation articulated by the interaction between high international immigration and the spatial manifestation of the housing bubble. The main socio-spatial result of this process is the disappearance of mixed social spaces in Madrid, previously located in the centre of the city. This dynamic produces opposite territories in terms of advantage and disadvantage in different spheres linked to social inequality such as education, health, leisure, care and even prejudice. In the process, impoverished immigrants disperse towards the neighbourhoods that concentrate the greatest disadvantages in each of these spheres.

AB  - Purpose The increase in autism prevalence and presentation in the media suggests a rise in public awareness. This paper aims to explore what factors (contact, knowledge and ethnicity) may be associated to positive attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Design/methodology/approach An online survey examined contact with and knowledge of ASD among Black, Asian and White ethnic groups to predict public attitudes to people with ASD. Findings In multiple regression models, the results suggested that the level of contact predicts positive attitudes towards autism when demographic factors were accounted. The level of knowledge about autism were significantly associated to attitudes, but not consistently when demographic factors were accounted. However, differences in knowledge and attitudes to people with ASD were identified amongst Black, Asian and White ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications These findings have implications for policy and public health and education campaigns, including ensuring contact and knowledge of autism among the public. Originality/value These findings have implications for policy and public health and education campaigns, including ensuring contact and knowledge of autism among the public. Additionally, further effort is required to target public knowledge and attitudes to autism, particularly among ethnic groups. Institutional support tailored to encourage structured and unstructured contact across public domains such as education, health, social and care practices could effectively reduce prejudice between the public and people with ASD over time.

AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

AB  - Amidst growing societal tensions, social media platforms become hubs of heated intergroup exchanges. According to social identity theory, group membership and the value we assign to it drive the expression of intergroup bias. Within the blooming scholarship on social and political polarization online, little attention has been paid to interreligious deliberations, despite the well-established relationship between religion and intergroup grievances. The present studies are designed to address the void in the scholarship of social identity and online religion by examining how religious identities, or the lack thereof, affect intergroup biases in the form of identity-specific topic preferences and topic-sentiment polarization. Drawing from social identity theory, five hypotheses were tested. The data for the study, a product of a natural experiment, are YouTube commentary sections featuring videos on two cases of interreligious debates between (1) Christian and Muslim or (2) Christian and atheist speakers. Using topic-sentiment analysis, a multistage method of topic modeling with latent semantic analysis and sentiment analysis, 24,179 comments, for the Christian-Muslim debates, and 52,607 comments, for the Christian-atheist debates, were analyzed. The results demonstrate normative content and identity-specific instances of topic-sentiment polarization. In terms of content, Christian-Muslim and Christian-atheist discussions are nearly completely preoccupied with theological or intellectual concepts. While interreligious polarization is robust in both debates, it appears more normative among Christians-Muslims and deeper among Christians-atheists, possibly indicating the higher stakes in the battle for moral authority. Interreligious debates on YouTube serve to uplift and defend the in-group and to delegitimize the outgroup in a broader battle for moral authority. Regardless of group affiliation, these debaters were concerned with 'big picture' questions of meaning and how best to address them. Stereotyping and cultural altercations appear mostly as a reaction to challenged identity characteristics, suggesting that issue-based social differences and cultural incompatibilities, often emphasized in self-report research, may be evoked as rationalizations of interreligious prejudice. Last, the successful application of topic-sentiment analysis lends support for the more systematic utilization of this method.

AB  - Research on coexistence and urban diversity (notably in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore) has demonstrated the ways individuals of diverse backgrounds routinely manage differences and interact meaningfully in multicultural societies, drawing on shared cultural knowledge and habits. This paper argues for a deeper exploration of societies where intercultural know-how is more limited and the capacity to negotiate difference has not been inculcated. This description fits several Southeast Asian societies wherein the politics of majority-minority is a dominant feature. This article investigates the possibilities of familiarity and friendship in a multiethnic town in southern Laos where the predominant ideology towards cultural diversity has been one of assimilation. In doing so, the paper reveals ways of creating a sense of belonging and community other than the practices of cultural accommodation. These processes draw on competences and dispositions which individuals have acquired through their mobility, producing a sense of togetherness, albeit contingent and fragmented.

AB  - Terrorist attacks, refugee movements from crisis regions as well as barriers to integration among immigrants have also been increasing fears of Islam in Austria, whereby Muslims are often regarded all too generally as outsiders to Austrian society. In this article the results of a representative study (Social Survey Austria 2018) are presented, which includes the first time a sophisticated scale on attitudes towards Muslims. In addition, a sequential multiple regression analysis will be used for a more detailed analysis of classical factors influencing critical attitudes towards Islam, whereby a new research gap will be addressed focusing on religious attitudes and practices of Austrians. The analysis of the extent of anti-Muslim sentiment in Austria reveals a dominant critical view. However, the influences of religious orientations are manifold: While conventional religious practice (such as church attendance and praying) as well as superstition reinforces animosities, inclusive religious attitudes and individual practices of spirituality lead to more tolerant attitudes. The results, which indicate a tendency towards greater tolerance among religious people, show that we are in Austria mainly confronted with cultural rather than interreligious conflicts, which are primarily centered around identity and recognition.

AB  - Counter-terrorism measures are often described as pre-emptive, punitive, and afford authorities exclusive and expanded powers. Yet they continue to attract public support. Why is this the case? A consistent finding in traditional crime control research shows a link between perceived threat from racial or ethnic minority groups and their perceived involvement in crime. This perceived relationship results in public support for punitive crime control measures for such groups. Similar connections can be made between terrorism and Muslims. It is thus possible that perceiving Muslims to be threatening may help explain enhanced public support towards harsh counter-terrorism measures. This study draws on survey data of a national sample Australian residents (N = 1199) to test this hypothesis. Findings show the importance of both identity processes and perceptions of Muslims as threatening in shaping support for punitive counter-terrorism strategies. Results also demonstrate how social identity can moderate the effect of perceived threat on support for such strategies. Theoretical and policy implications of this study are outlined.

AB  - Although scholars have long studied circumstances that shape prejudice, inquiry into factors associated with long-term prejudice reduction has been more limited. Using a 6-year longitudinal study of non-Black physicians in training (N = 3,134), we examined the effect of three medical-school factors-interracial contact, medical-school environment, and diversity training-on explicit and implicit racial bias measured during medical residency. When accounting for all three factors, previous contact, and baseline bias, we found that quality of contact continued to predict lower explicit and implicit bias, although the effects were very small. Racial climate, modeling of bias, and hours of diversity training in medical school were not consistently related to less explicit or implicit bias during residency. These results highlight the benefits of interracial contact during an impactful experience such as medical school. Ultimately, professional institutions can play a role in reducing anti-Black bias by encouraging more frequent, and especially more favorable, interracial contact.

AB  - The generalization of positive attitudes is a key consequence of intergroup contact. In this research, we examine how imagined contact with a specific individual animal (i.e., dog, cow) impacts on participants' positive attitudes toward this individual's animal subgroup (i.e., pets, farm animals) and also toward a more superordinate group (i.e., animals in general). We also investigate two potential moderators of these effects: social dominance orientation (SDO) and prior contact with animals. Whereas Study 1 focused on the effects of imagined contact with a dog as a member of a valued animal subgroup, Study 2 focused on these effects following imagined contact with a cow as a member of a devalued animal subgroup. Imagined contact with each of these animals induced greater inclusion of the animal subgroup in the self and more prosocial behavioral intentions toward animals in general. Following imagined contact, high SDO participants showed particularly strong improvement in their evaluations of both the animal subgroup and of animals in general (Studies 1 and 2), as well as on their behavioral intentions toward animals in general (Study 1). Following imagined contact with a farm animal (Study 2), participants who had high levels of prior contact with this specific animal subgroup also showed greater improvement in their inclusion of farm animals in the self and in their behavioral intentions toward animals in general.

AB  - 'Social frontiers' - places of sharp difference in social/ethnic characteristics between neighbouring communities - have largely been overlooked in quantitative research. Advancing this nascent field first requires a way of identifying social frontiers in a robust way. Such frontiers may be 'open' - an area may contrast sharply with a neighbourhood in one direction, but blend smoothly into adjacent neighbourhoods in other directions. This poses some formidable methodological challenges, particularly when computing inference for the existence of a social frontier, an important goal if one is to distinguish true frontiers from random variation. We develop a new approach using Bayesian spatial statistical methods that permit asymmetries in spatial effects and allow for spatial autocorrelation in the data. We illustrate our method using data on Sheffield and find clear evidence of 'open' frontiers. Permutations tests and Poisson regressions with fixed effects reveal compelling evidence that social frontiers are associated with higher rates of crime.

AB  - Social stereotypes impact how we remember people, but how stable is this influence? Inspired by the reversibility of the eyewitness misinformation effect through postwarnings about the planting of misinformation (enlightenment'), we explored if stereotype influence on person memory can be similarly reversed. Participants read person self-descriptions and subsequently answered memory test questions either with or without stereotype labels, establishing sizeable stereotype-induced memory distortion. One week later, the participants answered the same questions again, but half were enlightened about the earlier stereotype manipulation. This eliminated the stereotype effect and restored memory for the original information, whereas memory remained distorted without enlightenment. We discuss implications for memory distortion research and for (undermining) the self-perpetuation of stereotypes in society.

AB  - Superordinate identities, such as identification with all humanity (IWAH), may be considered the result of situational activation or as individual differences that can be measured using psychometric scales. Our research originates from this second approach. Why do some people feel connected only to narrow social groups like family and friends, while the social identifications of others cross boundaries, extending to people all over the world? We examined the possible psychological characteristics underlying this phenomenon in two cross-sectional studies (N = 334, N = 311). A structural model of the effects of openness to experience, empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking), and universalism-tolerance, mediated by right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and ethnocentrism upon IWAH is presented and tested. Results showed that openness to experience, empathy, and universalism-tolerance directly enhanced identification with all humanity. RWA, SDO and ethnocentrism were their partial negative mediators. SDO and ethnocentrism also directly reduced IWAH. These studies offer possible reasons for individual differences in levels of global human identification, by considering its psychological background.

AB  - Contemporary recognition theory overemphasizes the role of rationality in human relations and fails to adequately consider the pathological valences that influence psychological motivation and social dynamics, particularly those that are unconsciously mediated. In offering an alternative Hegelian revisionist perspective, I will examine how capacities for recognition are informed by early developmental contingencies in attachment, self-formation, social relations, and the negation of difference, thereby addressing the psychodynamics of how dysrecognition and refutation of alterity lead to insidious pathologies within society and the clinic. The systemic failure to develop recognition within social collectives is rooted, I suggest, in a lack of empathy for the other.

AB  - We examine a case of homophobic language online, specifically the deployment of the phrase no homo, shorthand for I'm not a homosexual. An analysis of 396 instances (comprising 1061 individual tweets) of the use of the phrase no homo on the social media platform Twitter suggests that the phrase is a gendered epithet that conveys cultural norms about masculinity. The first finding is that the phrase is used more often by male tweeters than by female tweeters. The second, as predicted by the literature on homophobia, is that the phrase is used in a negative emotional context to convey disapproval for men's homosexuality or behavior that is not gender normative. The third finding is that the modal use of the phrase no homo is in a positive emotional context, accompanying expressions of men's pleasure, desire, affection, attachment, and friendship. Our analysis suggests that the phrase no homo is a gendered one, primarily used by men to facilitate a particularly masculinized construction of positive emotional expression. Our research adds to and complicates findings on the relationship between homophobia and masculinity that suggests that homophobia is an organizing principal of masculinity in western cultures.

AB  - Spectator sports embody social group conflict, where consumers periodically interact with opposing fans, thereby providing outlets for negative brand affect in the form of acrimony toward rivals. To assess the regional nature of rivalry, this study compared 5,145 sports consumers across the four United States Census regions and Canada, including five professional leagues. Consistent with regional personality clustering, fans of Canadian teams harbor less acrimony toward rivals, and fans of teams in the Northeastern US generally exhibit the most acrimony. When developing events and promotional partnerships, sports marketers and sponsors should recognize regional differences in how consumers react to rivals.

AB  - Background: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a condition afflicting children born to women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy that can lead to secondary disabilities including cognitive and social deficits. Both, children with FASD, and their biological mothers, are targets of FASD stigma. This study seeks to identify stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination corresponding to FASD stigma.Methods: Nine stakeholders comprised a community based participatory research (CBPR) team to discuss logistics, identify focus groups, and develop a qualitative interview guide. Attitudes and beliefs regarding children with FASD and their biological mothers were obtained from four focus groups of people: adults with FASD, biological mothers, other relatives, and health care providers. In addition, three one-on-one interviews were completed. Responses were coded into themes by two independent raters.Results: Analyses yielded themes that distinguished between stigmatizing perceptions of children with FASD (e.g., immature, lazy, violent, socially inept) and biological mothers (e.g. child abusers, in denial, secretive, ignorant). Discrimination perpetuated by health care providers undermined services received by biological mothers and their children with FASD (e.g., lack of understanding, lack of identification, poor communication skills). Lastly, discriminatory behaviors specific to children with FASD and their biological mothers were identified (e.g., neglect, avoidance, abuse).Conclusion: Results described the stigma experienced by different stakeholders related to FASD by identifying specific candidates for stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. These findings can be used to inform further assessment of stigma and also the development of tailored anti-stigma interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Unemployment is one of the factors that contribute to homelessness and the actions for productive inclusion is recommended as strategic to increase autonomy, social participation and overcoming this situation. Objective: To identify productive inclusion actions carried out by Centros Pop (Centers of Specialized Reference for Population in Street Situation) of the state of Sao Paulo and the view of the coordinators of this equipment about this dimension of the work with the homeless people. Method: This is qualitative research, carried out through the application of a protocol of personal and professional identification and identification of equipment and a semi-structured questionnaire with coordinators of 13 Centros Pop in the state of Sao Paulo. The data were analyzed descriptively and for the open questions, the thematic analysis was used. Results: The productive inclusion was associated with the overcoming of the street situation to access to the labor market and income and to social belonging. The role of the Centro Pop in the provision of information, referrals, and intersectoral articulation, especially for professional qualification and training, as well as challenges such as prejudice, low qualification and schooling, and the use of psychoactive substances were highlighted. Conclusion: Collective and intersectoral actions are needed that recognize access to work as a right, in line with the desires, needs, and singularities of street people, where productive inclusion, through the articulation between different policies and services, can contribute to the vulnerability reduction and creation of autonomy. In this scenario, Centros Pop can play an important role

AB  - Background: Implicit biases are present in the general population and among professionals in various domains, where they can lead to discrimination. Many interventions are used to reduce implicit bias. However, uncertainties remain as to their effectiveness.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching ERIC, PUBMED and PSYCHINFO for peer-reviewed studies conducted on adults between May 2005 and April 2015, testing interventions designed to reduce implicit bias, with results measured using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) or sufficiently similar methods.
   Results: 30 articles were identified as eligible. Some techniques, such as engaging with others' perspective, appear unfruitful, at least in short term implicit bias reduction, while other techniques, such as exposure to counterstereotypical exemplars, are more promising. Robust data is lacking for many of these interventions.
   Conclusions: Caution is thus advised when it comes to programs aiming at reducing biases. This does not weaken the case for implementing widespread structural and institutional changes that are multiply justified.

AB  - Despite sharing physical space that supports contact with out-group members and institutional arrangements that encourage cross-group interaction, many university students still congregate within their own groups. To explain this phenomenon, this study examines the micro-level social processes that prevent or facilitate intergroup interaction. A qualitative study of Mainland Chinese and local university students in Hong Kong reveals that students lack opportunities for mutually engaging experiences across multiple points in time due to fragmented daily living space, defended interpersonal space, and politicized online space, which contribute to the absence of cross-group interactions. Cross-group friendships depend on external forces to remove inhibitions, which then allow emotional bonding. This study contributes to the understanding of cross-group interaction by pointing out the importance of daily routine activities and mutually engaging experiences in influencing cross-group interaction among students.

AB  - Aim of this study was to investigate the neural bases of stereotype representation, including the presence of gender bias. EEG was recorded from 128 sites in 38 Italian participants. While looking for rare animal words, participants read 240 sentences, half of which expressed notions congruent with gender stereotypes, and the other half did not (e.g., "Prepared the tomato sauce and then SHAVED", "The engineer stained HER SKIRT"). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to critical words. Findings showed enhanced anterior N400 and occipito-parietal P600 responses to items that violated gender stereotypes, mostly in men. The swLORETA analysis applied to N400 potentials in response to incongruent phrases showed that the most activated areas during stereotype processing were the right medial temporal and medial frontal gyri, as well as the TPJ. The data hint at a gender difference in stereotyping, with men being more prejudicial especially when the depicted character is a male.

I use qualitative data to frame how the young men experience schooling, and I show how the local community context facilitates the institutionalization of discriminatory sorting processes and racially prejudiced norms. I also show how the young men are excessively controlled and monitored via zero tolerance disciplinary practices, which effectively constrains their humanity and capacity to freely exist in their school and which inadvertently strengthens the connective tissue between schools and prisons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the in-class behaviors of information technologies teachers and the factors that lead to those behaviors in the context of hidden curriculum on the basis of the opinions of information technologies teachers. From the qualitative research methods, the 'phenomonology' research design was used in this study. A total of 15 information technologies teachers who were teaching at secondary schools in a central town of a city located in the West Blacksea Region, Turkey, participated in the study. From purposeful sampling method, criterion and maximum diversity samplings were used in selection of the sample. Data were collected by means of semi-constructed interview forms. The gathered data were analyzed through both descriptive and content analysis methods. As a result of the interviews made with teachers, it was observed that the teachers gave messages and responses which were not in the scope of the formal curriculum. In this direction, teacher behaviours were divided into seven sub-themes such as "power and authority", "prejudices and discrimination", "narratives", "communication", "role-model", "getting a profession", and "school culture". It was identified that most of the teachers were authoritarian and serious, discriminated among students according to individual diffferences, conveyed the ideas that they did not adopt in real life, made social, moral and ideological narratives suiting with their own thoughts and beliefs, preferred teacher-centered methods and techniques and were not able to create a democratical environment during lessons. In this study, it was understood that information technologies served to the hidden curriculum especially in terms of adoption of school culture, interaction with students was effective in occurance of hidden learnings, and status and economical advantages of a profession were of primary importance in teachers' professional guidance. Depending on the results of this study, some educational conclusions and recommendations for future studies were also included in this paper.

AB  - In this research, we systematically study multilingualism as a predictor of acceptance of ethnic out-groups. It is argued that people who speak more languages are more cognitively flexible, that is, they have an enhanced flexibility in understanding and representing information. Higher cognitive flexibility is in turn expected to be related to higher deprovincialization: a reevaluation of one's ethnocentric worldview. Deprovincialization is then expected to result in more openness toward ethnic out-groups, evidenced by a more inclusive notion of the national identity and reduced out-group dislike. Cross-sectional survey data among a representative sample of native Dutch participants from the Netherlands (N = 792) provide convincing support for these hypotheses and show that multilingualism is an important yet understudied factor in social-psychological research on prejudice reduction.

Research included textbook analysis, observation of practice, interviews with teachers and NGOs, and surveys of junior high school students' social identity. Multicultural education was found to help students understand the past and the multicultural situation in the present. However, two problems were identified: stakeholders' trauma and anxiety regarding teaching the negative past and critical thinking weaknesses, especially in terms of (re) producing prejudice and conflicts. Based on social identity analysis, this study recommends that multicultural education should be implemented under transformative citizenship education.

AB  - Tattoos are increasing in popularity, yet minimal research has examined implicit attitudes or the relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes toward tattooed individuals. Seventy-seven online participants (Mage = 36.09, 52% women, 78% white, 26% tattooed) completed measures assessing implicit and explicit attitudes toward tattooed individuals. Results revealed evidence of negative implicit attitudes, which were associated with less perceived warmth, competence, and negative explicit evaluations. However, implicit attitudes were not correlated with measures of disgust or social distance. In addition, age predicted implicit prejudice, but other individual difference measures-such as personal tattoo possession, political identity, and internal/external motivations to respond without prejudice-did not. These findings are discussed in terms of how attitudes toward tattooed individuals may be multifaceted, and research may benefit from measuring implicit and explicit attitudes.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the process of inclusion in the job market of people with visual impairment in the Londrina-PR region, highlighting the importance of special schools in the training and inclusion of these people and the role of the company. In addition, it was intended to theoretically tie the issue of corporate social responsibility to social inclusion. In order to answer the proposed question, a descriptive research was conducted, through semi-structured interviews, adapted from the studies of Soares (2006). Four interviews were conducted: two with special school students; one with a school employee and one with the employer of one of the students. Data were analyzed qualitatively through content analysis. The results of the research stand out as facilitating aspects for insertion in the labor market: the quota law; the resources of information technology and, above all, the will power of people with visual impairment individuals to seek a position and prove that they are capable of carrying out the assigned function. The challenging aspects highlighted by them were: lack of information and prejudice regarding the work capacity of people with visual impairment.

AB  - Arguments opposing same-sex marriage are often made on religious grounds. In five studies conducted in the United States and Canada (combined N = 1,673), we observed that religious opposition to same-sex marriage was explained, at least in part, by conservative ideology and linked to sexual prejudice. In Studies 1 and 2, we discovered that the relationship between religiosity and opposition to same-sex marriage was mediated by explicit sexual prejudice. In Study 3, we saw that the mediating effect of sexual prejudice was linked to political conservatism. Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b we examined the ideological underpinnings of religious opposition to same-sex marriage in more detail by taking into account two distinct aspects of conservative ideology. Results revealed that resistance to change was more important than opposition to equality in explaining religious opposition to same-sex marriage.

AB  - A series of field studies focused on the role of similarity as niche construction in friendships. Using a free-range dyad harvest method, we collected 11 independent samples with 1,523 interacting pairs, and compared dyad members' personality traits, attitudes, values, recreational activities, and alcohol and drug use. Within-dyad similarity was statistically significant on 86% of variables measured. To determine whether similarity was primarily attributable to niche construction (i.e., selection) or social influence, we tested whether similarity increased as closeness, intimacy, discussion, length of relationship, and importance of the attitude increased. There were no effects on similarity of closeness, relationship length, or discussion of the attitude. There were quite modest effects of intimacy, and a reliable effect of the shared importance of the attitude. Because relationship length, intimacy, closeness, and discussion can all serve as markers of opportunity for, or potency of social influence, these data are consistent with the "niche construction" account of similarity. In 2 follow-up controlled longitudinal field studies, participants interacted with people they did not know from their large lecture classes, and at a later time completed a survey of attitudes, values, and personality traits. Interacting pairs were not more similar than chance, but for the 23% of dyads that interacted beyond the first meeting, there was significant similarity within dyad members. These 2 lines of inquiry converge to suggest that similarity is mainly due to niche construction, and is most important in the early stages of a relationship; its importance to further relationship development wanes.

AB  - Here, representations of Black masculinity and emasculation are explored on NBC's Parenthood. We question whether depictions of Black masculinity represented through Parenthood's character, Alex, are empowering or stereotypical; how do they reflect, destabilize, and/or reinforce heteronormative depictions of Black community members? Two seasons were analyzed using Owen's thematic analysis. Ultimately, Black males are portrayed as being societal failures, criminals, violent, and hypersexualized through his character. This embodiment ultimately preserves long-held images of Black men as "Toms, coons. bucks. as oversexed, aggressive, violent, animalistic, or emasculated" (Jackson, R. L. II. 2006. Scripting the black masculine body: Identity, discourse, and racial politics in popular media. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press). Practical recommendations and suggestions for researchers and media practitioners are provided.

AB  - This article explores how Canadian youth who participate in Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality. Participants' perspectives on, definitions of, and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities. For GSA members, bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy. Despite these distinctions, both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility, mis/understandings, and prejudice in school. Findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity wasmore nuanced than their GSA advisors due to personal online research. GSA participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers, and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities. Although GSA involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities, this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs.

AB  - Background: More and more people of all age classes have a tattoo. Intriguingly, there are multiple prejudices in the general population and published data that concern tattooed persons, such as being criminals, having a low education, being alcohol or drug abusers, or more risky in their life style. Objective: To obtain and to evaluate sociodemographic data on tattooed persons, to investigate the incidence of tattoo-related cutaneous complications and to define personal risk factors and course of the persons after being tattooed concerning behavior of personal environment. Patients and Methods: We interviewed 426 participants with already existing tattoos and 20 participants just before getting a new tattoo by using an online questionnaire. The participators were asked about socio-epidemiologic aspects of tattoos in general and special aspects of their own tattoo(s) in particular. There were no exclusion criteria. Results: Tattoos are interesting for people seeking popular body art, esp. university graduates and financially-secure individuals. 446 persons participated in this study. Most of the persons were female with a mean age of 35. Local pruritus around the tattooed area was the most common cutaneous side effect among the participants. 93.5% of the participants did not want a tattoo removal. Intriguingly, most of the participants experienced no career problems related to the tattoo(s). Limitations: The study population is not representative as we included only persons being tattooed prior to or getting newly tattooed. Furthermore, there is a potential selection bias as the participation in this study was voluntary. Only persons that felt involved by the flyer did answer the questionnaire. Conclusion: The present data shows that common tattooed persons are not low educated criminals with any drug or alcohol abuse or with risky life style. Nowadays being tattooed encompasses a kind of body art and displays a certain kind of lifestyle habit.

AB  - This article analyses the influence of accent on discrimination against immigrants by examining the hypothesis that accent leads to discrimination only in more prejudiced individuals, merely because people speaking with a native accent are perceived to be better qualified than those whose accent is nonstandard. In Study 1 (N=71), we found that only prejudiced individuals use accent to discriminate against immigrants. In Study 2 (N=124), we replicated this effect and found that the influence of accent on discrimination is mediated by the perceived quality of the accent. Study 3 (N=105) replicated the previous results even after controlling for the effect of stereotyping. These results are the first experimental illustration of the hypothesis that accent triggers intergroup discrimination only among prejudiced individuals because they evaluate native accents as being qualitatively better than accents of immigrants, thereby legitimizing ingroup bias.

AB  - Amazon leads the market in ebooks with the Kindle brand, which encompasses a range of dedicated e-reader devices and a large ebook store. Kindle users are able to share the experience of reading ebooks purchased from Amazon by selecting passages of text for upload to the Kindle Popular Highlights website. In this article, I propose that the Kindle Popular Highlights database contains evidence that readers are re-appropriating commonplacing - the act of selecting important passages from a text and recording them in a separate location for later re-use - while reading public domain titles on the Kindle. An analysis of keyness in a corpus of 34,044 shared highlights from public domain titles suggests that readers focus on words relating to philosophy and values to draw an understanding of contemporary society from these classic works. This form of highlighting takes precedence over understanding and sharing key narrative moments. An examination of the top ten most popular authors in the corpus, and case studies of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and William Shakespeare's Hamlet, demonstrate variation in highlighting practice as readers are choosing to shorten famous commonplaces in order to change their context for an audience that extends beyond the original reader. Through this analysis, I propose that Kindle users' highlighting patterns are shaped by the behaviour of other readers and reflect a shared understanding of an audience beyond the initial highlighter.

AB  - Religion and morality have been deeply interwoven throughout human history. Although much research has investigated the role of religiosity (e.g., belief in God, prayer, religious attendance) in shaping moral concerns, only recently has research in psychology begun to delve deeper into the meta-ethical beliefs theists hold about the spiritual foundations of morality. The present research builds on moral-philosophical discourse on Divine Command Theory and recent work by Piazza and Landy (2013), who developed the 20-item Morality Founded on Divine Authority (MFDA) scale to measure Divine Command beliefs. We sought primarily to reduce the MFDA scale to increase its pragmatic utility; Confirmatory Factor Analysis revealed an optimal 5-item scale. Across four studies, this scale yielded levels of construct, convergent, and incremental validity equivalent to those of the 20-item scale. Compared with several other measures of religiosity and conservative thinking, the short MFDA was the strongest predictor of anti-atheist prejudice among U.S. religious believers and Indian Hindus (Studies la-lb) and largely explained religiosity's relationship with attitudes toward science (Study la) and moral cognitive outcomes including deontological reasoning (Study 2a) and prohibitive morality (Study 2b). We conclude with discussion about the practical utility of this scale in ongoing research into religion and moral cognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In July 1917 French legislators conferred a special legal status on those children whose parent(s) had died or been brutally mutilated while defending the patrie: pupille de la nation. In metropolitan France, the state, working closely with preexisting philanthropic organizations, would develop a system of provision for these children based on a legal right to full compensation for the loss they had endured. In the colonies, however, the application of the program would prove far more problematic. This article uses the correspondence between the Ministry of the Colonies and colonial administrators across the empire to trace the debate surrounding a possible colonial version of the program. It contends that colonial administrators mobilized racial prejudice and cultural particularism, to different extents in different colonies, in order to water down the state's duty of care to its child victims of war, the pupilles de l'empire.

AB  - The present research examines whether people use racial contact to signal positive and negative social attributes. In two experiments, participants were instructed to fake good (trustworthy/competent) or fake bad (untrustworthy/incompetent) when reporting their amount of contact with a range of different racial groups. In Experiment 1 (N = 364), participants faking good reported significantly more contact with White Americans than with non-White Americans, whereas participants faking bad did not. In Experiment 2 (N = 1,056), this pattern was replicated and was found to be particularly pronounced among those with stronger pro-White bias. These findings suggest that individuals may use racial contact as a social signal, effectively whitewashing their apparent contact and friendships when trying to present positively.

AB  - Strong social and legal norms in the United States discourage the overt expression of bias against ethnic and racial minorities, increasing the attributional ambiguity of Whites' positive behavior to ethnic minorities. Minorities who suspect that Whites' positive overtures toward minorities are motivated more by their fear of appearing racist than by egalitarian attitudes may regard positive feedback they receive from Whites as disingenuous. This may lead them to react to such feedback with feelings of uncertainty and threat. Three studies examined how suspicion of motives relates to ethnic minorities' responses to receiving positive feedback from a White peer or same-ethnicity peer (Experiment 1), to receiving feedback from a White peer that was positive or negative (Experiment 2), and to receiving positive feedback from a White peer who did or did not know their ethnicity (Experiment 3). As predicted, the more suspicious Latinas were of Whites' motives for behaving positively toward minorities in general, the more they regarded positive feedback from a White peer who knew their ethnicity as disingenuous and the more they reacted with cardiovascular reactivity characteristic of threat/avoidance, increased feelings of stress, heightened uncertainty, and decreased self-esteem. We discuss the implications for intergroup interactions of perceptions of Whites' motives for nonprejudiced behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Racial slurs are terms used primarily to disparage individuals belonging to the targeted social group. In two studies, we manipulated racial slurs ("nigger", "nigga") used by White individuals toward Black individuals in different situations (between friends versus between strangers) to assess different levels of perceived offensiveness in White third party observers. Consistent with our hypotheses, in Study 1 we found that the use of racial slurs between friends was perceived to be less offensive than between strangers, and "nigga" was perceived to be less offensive than "nigger". In Study 2 we replicated these results, and extended them by finding that ratings of offensiveness, consistent with hypotheses, were correlated with individual differences relating to the justification and suppression of prejudice. Our findings suggest that observers' reactions to racial slurs depend on the context in which the slur is used and perceivers' beliefs about the social appropriateness of expressing prejudice.

AB  - Topic: This column describes the experience of prejudice and discrimination that some mental health service users encounter in their interactions with service providers and organizations. Purpose: The intent of this column is to highlight potential action steps to address the negative beliefs and attitudes of service providers that contribute to prejudice and discrimination. Sources Used: This description draws from published material and the authors' experience. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: If the most effective approaches to reduce public prejudice and discrimination toward people diagnosed with a mental illness are education and contact, then those methods may be useful methods to help mental health service providers view and engage persons served from a strengths-based recovery and wellness orientation.

AB  - This study examined the nonverbal and verbal expressions of hostile and benevolent sexism. Hostile sexism is sexist antipathy and benevolent sexism is a chivalrous belief that women are warm yet incompetent. We predicted that hostile sexist men would display less affiliative expressions but benevolent sexist men would display more affiliative expressions during mixed-gender interactions. Twenty-seven pairs of U.S. male and female undergraduates from a private university in New England participated in this study. These mixed-gender dyads participated in two social interactions: a structured trivia game followed by an unstructured conversation period. During the trivia game, men with more benevolent sexism were perceived to be more patient overall when waiting for the woman to answer the trivia questions. Furthermore, we examined the men's nonverbal and verbal expressions during the unstructured interaction-na < ve raters made impression ratings of the men's nonverbal and verbal behavior, and trained coders counted the frequency of specific nonverbal cues (e.g., smiles). A word count software was used for verbal content analysis. As predicted, more hostile sexism was associated with less affiliative nonverbal and verbal expressions (e.g., less approachable, less friendly, and less smiling), but more benevolent sexism was associated with more affiliative nonverbal and verbal expressions (e.g., more approachable, more likely to smile, and more positive word usage). The effects held after controlling for men's personality traits and partners' nonverbal behavior. Differential behavioral expressions of benevolent and hostile sexism have theoretical importance as we can examine how sexism maintains the status quo at the interpersonal level.

AB  - This article probes how media representations of football in Scotland sustain the hegemonic ideologies associated with ethnicity and religion. The paper probes the football-related comedy output of one radio programme; radio output and football comedy are both neglected cultural material in studies of sport in Scotland. It argues that ambiguity and allusive language in comedy construct multiple interpretative possibilities that can demean the social and cultural identity of particular groups in society. The discussion analyses specific sketches from the Scottish radio comedy show Watson's Wind Up. It is concluded that although humorous, these sketches reveal how ideas, myths and stereotypes that coalesce round Celtic FC and the Irish-descended and Catholic communities in Scotland reinforce and sustain anti-Irish and anti-Catholic bigotry.

AB  - The future of a dementia-appropriate care rests on early diagnosis and treatment (also in terms of a timely information, counselling and assistance), developing mobile medical healthcare, integrating and coordinating all dementia care partners and stakeholders, appropriate assessments of the stages of care allowance, providing new forms of housing, addressing the migration issue, and reducing unnecessary administrative bureaucracy - as well as, last but not least, the fight against prejudice.
   People affected by dementia suffer not only from symptoms of their illness but also from society's reaction towards this illness. Stigmatisation of dementia prevents an early diagnosis and treatment which could improve the course of the illness and create a "better everyday life", a more of inclusion for the affected people and their environment.
   But Albert Einstein already knew: "It's harder to crack prejudice than an atom." Nevertheless, it is paramount to work towards it - for dementia can affect each and every one of us. Dementia matters, for all of us.

AB  - Drawing on a unique survey experiment in the 2011 Canadian Election Study data set, this paper examines the ways in which racial cues influence attitudes towards redistributive policy. While work in the USA points to a strong racialization of welfare attitudes, little research explores the ways in which racial cues may structure attitudes about welfare elsewhere. In the Canadian context, Aboriginal peoples have faced both historic persecution and continue to face severe discrimination. They also experience much higher levels of poverty than other groups in Canada. Our results examine the effect that (hypothetical) Aboriginal recipients have on public support for social assistance. Results suggest that respondents' support for redistribution is lower when recipients are Aboriginal rather than white. As we have seen in the USA, then, support for welfare is related to racialized perceptions about those who benefit from social assistance.

AB  - This paper is the first to apply the contact hypothesis, a social psychological theory of prejudice reduction, to the field of weight bias. It aims to investigate whether contact with overweight people is associated with the extent to which people report weight bias, as well as vigilance around their own bodies. In 2013 we recruited 1176 American participants to complete surveys regarding prejudice toward overweight people, as well as a suite of measures capturing people's relationships with their own weight (fat talk, drive for thinness, and body-checking behavior). Positive contact with overweight people predicted decreased prejudice, regardless of whether participants were overweight (p < .001) or not (p = .003). However, negative contact was a stronger predictor of increased prejudice (p < .001 for both samples). For non-overweight participants, any contact with overweight people (whether positive or negative) predicted increased body-checking behaviors (positive-p = .002, negative-p < .001) and fat talk (positive-p = .047, negative-p < .001), and negative contact predicted increased drive for thinness (p < .001). However, for those who were overweight a different picture emerged. While negative contact predicted increased body-checking behaviors (p < .001) and fat talk (p < .001), positive contact was protective, predicting decreased drive for thinness (p = .001) and body-checking behaviors (p < .001). This paper demonstrates that the interactions we have with overweight people are inherently tied to both our attitudes towards them and our relationship with our own bodies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sociologists and instructors who teach about community service share an affinity for understanding and addressing social problems. While many studies have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating community service into sociology courses, we examine the benefits of incorporating sociological content into community service classes. The authors supplemented a community service course at a large public university with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest that this integration increased student understanding of the social structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served, sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We argue that with the rapid growth of interest in community service across college campuses, sociologists are ideally situated to provide beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

AB  - This study seeks empirical justification for conceptualizing negative feelings towards the Roma as a distinct type of prejudice, as compared to common prejudice manifested in commonalities between Romaphobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-Chinese feelings. We conducted secondary analyses of Hungarian national representative data collected in 2002 by the TARKI Institute (Budapest), using face-to-face interviews. Principal component analyses revealed that respondents' feelings towards all four groups were partially explained by social distance at work and antipathy in general. However, the presence of a separate component, dealing specifically with all Roma, supports a notion of Romaphobia as a qualitatively distinct construct. Recommendations for future research and practical implications are presented.

AB  - Over the past two decades, sexual citizenship has emerged as a new form of citizenship coupled with increased interest in the challenges to citizenship and social justice faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people and, in particular, by sexual minority youth within education systems. In South Africa, the rights of LGBTI people have been institutionalised in legislation, and research has begun to consider how educators may facilitate a more inclusive school environment for LGBTI youth. Given the focus of the Department of Education on social justice, the present study examines how selected Life Orientation (LO) textbooks for Grades 7 to 12 in South African schools represent and construct LGBTI identities. The study generally finds inconsistency in the representation of these identities. Gay male identities are represented in some instances, lesbian and bisexual identities rarely so, and transgender and intersex identities not at all. Two of the four series examined are almost entirely silent about LGBTI identities. This invisibility negates the different 'ways of knowing' of LGBTI learners; tends not to facilitate students in critiquing the discrimination, prejudice and social injustices faced by many LGBTI people, and lessens the importance of social justice and citizenship education in this field in South Africa.

AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships.

AB  - Age is the only social category identifying subgroups that everyone may eventually join. Despite this and despite the well-known growth of the older population, age-based prejudice remains an understudied topic in social psychology. This article systematically reviews the literature on ageism, highlighting extant research on its consequences and theoretical perspectives on its causes. We then identify a crucial gap in the literature, potential intergenerational tensions, speculating how a growing-older population- and society's efforts to accommodate it might stoke intergenerational fires, particularly among the younger generation. Presenting both sides of this incipient issue, we review relevant empirical work that introduces reasons for both optimism and pessimism concerning intergenerational relations within an aging society. We conclude by suggesting future avenues for ageism research, emphasizing the importance of understanding forthcoming intergenerational dynamics for the benefit of the field and broader society.

AB  - This study explored how contact with gay and lesbian persons affects adolescents' attitudes toward them, and whether this association is mediated or moderated by one's acceptance of gender non-conformity. We analyzed survey responses from 456 Dutch adolescents aged 12-15 who reported having no same-sex attractions. Data were collected in 2008 at 8 schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Preliminary analyses showed that contact with lesbian/gay persons outside of school was positively associated with attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Multilevel analyses showed that acceptance of gender nonconformity mediated rather than moderated the relationship between intergroup contact and sexual prejudice in males. The effect of intergroup contact on females' attitudes toward lesbian women was no longer significant in multilevel analyses. The findings suggest that attention to both intergroup contact and acceptance of gender nonconformity would enhance our understanding of attitudes toward homosexuality in adolescents.

AB  - Room at the Top was unique among British social-realist films, not only in its depiction of upward mobility as opposed to social immobilization, but also in its choice of genre - high tragedy over popular melodrama. Paradoxically, Joe Lampton's working-class pride drove him to educate himself out of the working class, then compelled him to try to get a piece of the upper class. Tragically, the pride that enabled him to endure years of poverty and social humiliation is the same pride that undoes him spiritually in the end. In a sense, the class of his origin finally has its revenge on him for leaving it, while he proves that class is no barrier to someone with strength, ability and determination. But Joe pays a great price in order to prove his point - he 'wastes' the outsider Alice Aisgill for marriage to the moneyed Susan Brown. Alice may be the 'tragic waste' of this story, but one could argue that in killing herself she has also 'killed' Joe and thus had her revenge on him too. In short, far from cheapening its action by resolving it through melodrama, Room at the Top enriches that action throughout by consistently suggesting its tragic underpinnings. There are no black-and-white characters in the film, no heroes or villains, no defeat of the guilty and reward of the innocent: each of the central characters wins, and each one loses.

AB  - Allocating funding for research often entails the review of the publications authored by a scientist or a group of scientists. For practical reasons, in many cases this review cannot be performed by a sufficient number of specialists in the core domain of the reviewed publications. In the meanwhile, each scientist reads thoroughly, on average, about 88 scientific articles per year, and the evaluative information that scientists can provide about these articles is currently lost. I suggest that aggregating in an online database reviews or ratings on the publications that scientists read anyhow can provide important information that can revolutionize the evaluation processes that support funding decisions. I also suggest that such aggregation of reviews can be encouraged by a system that would provide a publicly available review portfolio for each scientist, without prejudicing the anonymity of reviews. I provide some quantitative estimates on the number and distribution of reviews and ratings that can be obtained.

Participants were Asian Indian immigrant college students as well as their parents. The early first-generation and late first-generation students were similar to each other in their major preferences; however, both groups had significantly greater preferences for science and math majors than the second-generation students. Parents' perceived prejudice and preferences for science and math contributed significantly to their second-generation children's preferences for science and math. Even though second-generation children preferred nonscience majors more than their first-generation parents, the majority reported that their actual majors were in science and math.

AB  - The present research examines the interplay between individual differences in need for structure, social beliefs, and gender. It is well documented that need for structure, that is, a preference for structure and simplicity in one's thinking, predicts authoritarianism and ethnocentrism. Further, women tend to score lower in authoritarianism and ethnocentrism than men. Although there seem to be no gender differences in need for structure, the present research hypothesizes that the association between need for structure and social beliefs is stronger for men than for women. This hypothesis comes from the observation that, all else being equal, men tend to think more about the domain of beliefs such as authoritarianism and ethnocentrism, which should strengthen the relationship between men's cognitive needs and their social beliefs. The hypothesis is also motivated by the finding that, more than men, women often give priority to caring and compassion when forming beliefs about outgroups. This should weaken the link between women's cognitive needs and their social beliefs. Three studies conducted in the USA (n = 398) and one study conducted in Germany (n = 112) examined whether gender moderated the influence of need for structure on authoritarianism and racism. Using a variety of measures, need for structure predicted authoritarianism and racism for men, but not for women. The discussion focuses on the implications of the present findings for the relationship between cognitive orientations and social beliefs. It is argued that research on cognitive orientation and social beliefs needs to take gender into account to improve its accuracy of prediction.

AB  - The cross-lagged effects of the Big-Five personality dimensions on Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were examined over 1 year (N = 112). Consistent with the Dual Process Cognitive-Motivational Model, SDO and RWA exhibited markedly different personality bases. Low Agreeableness and unexpectedly high Extraversion predicted change in the motivational goal for group-based dominance and superiority (SDO), whereas Openness to Experience predicted change in the motivational goal for social cohesion and collective security (RWA). Neuroticism and Conscientiousness did not predict change in SDO or RWA over time. These findings extend previous cross-sectional (correlational) research and indicate that key dimensions of personality (primarily Agreeableness and Openness to Experience) are an important temporal antecedent of the group-based motivational goals underlying individual differences in prejudice.

AB  - The use of non-motorized transportation and micro-mobility is increasing in many cities. Bicycle riding and e-scooter use are now more common and affordable than ever. However, users of these devices face certain key issues. These include their own risky behaviors as well as involvement in conflicts with other road users. Self-report data may not adequately capture these behaviors and interactions. Despite this, more objective data (i.e., how third parties perceive these users' road behaviors) is scarce. Aims: This study aimed to understand whether e-scooter riders have com-parable or different riding behaviors than cyclists. This was investigated using a mixed-method study. Methods: This paper is divided into two sub-studies. In Study 1, 950 Spanish non-cyclists and non-e-scooter riders (mean age 31.98 +/- 13.27 years; 55.3% female) provided external ratings (proxies) regarding the perceived behaviors of bicycle and e-scooter riders. In Study 2, collective Rapid Assessment Processes (RAPs; n = 23) were used to develop qualitative configurations of some of the key risky behaviors highlighted in Study 1. Results: There were significant differences in the perceived errors and violations rated by proxies for both types of riders (with e-scooter riders perceived as having higher rates of risky behaviors). However, there were also structural differences in the effects of external raters' risk perceptions, traffic rule knowledge, and traffic incidents with two-wheeled riders on how they rated the behaviors. Conclusion: The results of both studies suggest that external raters' perceptions provide further understanding of the causes, dynamics, and conflicts related to road behaviors performed by certain groups of road users. This is particularly apparent when there is no clear legislation and information on safe riding in urban areas. In this sense, improving infrastructure could promote safer interactions. Finally, road safety education could focus on promoting safer practices and interactions in order to improve how others perceive riders' behavior.

AB  - Background: Lingual microcystic lymphatic malformations (LMLMs) are rare congenital vascular malformations presenting as clusters of cysts filled with lymph fluid or blood. Even small well-limited lesions can be responsible for a heavy burden, inducing pain, aesthetic prejudice, or oozing, bleeding, infections. The natural history of LMLMs is progressive worsening punctuated by acute flares. Therapeutic options include surgery, laser excision, and radiofrequency ablation but all are potentially detrimental and expose to local relapse. Therefore, the management frequently relies on a "watchful waiting" approach. In complicated LMLMs, treatment with oral sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is often used. Topical applications of sirolimus on the buccal mucosae have been reported in other oral diseases with good tolerance and none to slight detectable blood sirolimus concentrations. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1 mg/mL sirolimus solution applied once daily on LMLM of any stage in children and adults after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of treatment compared to usual care (no treatment).
   Methods: This is a randomized, multicentric study using an individually randomized stepped-wedge design over 24 weeks to evaluate topical application of a 1 mg/mL sirolimus solution once daily, on LMLM, versus usual care (no treatment), the control condition. Participants begin with an observational period and later switch to the intervention at a randomized time (week 0, 4, 8, or 12). Visits occur every 4 weeks, either in the study center or by teleconsulting. The primary outcome will be the evaluation of global severity of the LMLM on monthly standardized photographs by 3 independent blinded experts using the physical global assessment (PGA) 0 to 5 scale. Secondary outcomes will include lesion size measurement and quality of life assessment, investigator, and patient-assessed global disease and specific symptoms (oozing, bleeding, sialorrhea, eating impairment, taste modification, aesthetic impairment, pain, and global discomfort) assessment. A biological monitoring will be performed including residual blood sirolimus concentration and usual laboratory parameters.
   Discussion: Given the disappointing state of current treatment options in LMLMs, topical sirolimus could become firstline therapy in treating LMLMs if its efficacy and safety were to be demonstrated.

TI  - Status, Prejudice, and Hierarchical Differences in the Communities of the Urban Burmese Spirit Cult
T2  - ASIAN MUSIC
LA  - English
AB  - This essay investigates how hierarchical differences and prejudices shape communities of nat kana pwe, urban spirit-possession ceremonies, in central Burma/Myanmar. Looking at the widespread ideas surrounding Buddhist religious values, gender roles, artistic status, and financial success in Burmese society, it argues that hierarchical thinking regulates the social interactions between professional spirit mediums (nat kadaw), musicians of the nat hsaing (drums and gongs ensemble), and spirit devotees. Drawing on the narratives of the participants themselves, the essay discusses how prejudice contributes to modeling the status and prestige of the ritual actors and how they are able to reverse the normal relationships of power.

AB  - The communicative component of the investigator's professional activities is a dominant one, as it demonstrates the employee's ability to organize work on the basis of professionally balanced communication with the objects of interaction. The stage of obtaining higher education in institutions with specific learning environment is a sensitive period for the development of the main sociogenic structures of personality and the development of professional identity of future professionals. This period is characterised by a purposeful mastering of the system of professional knowledge and skills, formation of a holistic view of the professional community, which results in awareness of professional readiness. The use of training technology in the training of investigators helps to increase the efficiency of the professional training process, based on the basic principles of personality-oriented education. The aim of our research is to study the process of formation of components of communicative competence in future investigators of prejudicial inquiry agencies with the help of training technologies. Appropriate psychodiagnostic tools were used to solve this purpose, which was tested during the training of specialists for prejudicial inquiry agencies. Most of the respondents stated the existence of satisfaction with participating in the training courses, awareness of the importance of its informativeness and practical orientation. Post-training testing emphasized the participants' rethinking of the value of interpersonal relations; growing desire to help and show warmth and friendliness in relations with others; the expediency and effectiveness of the use of cooperation and compromise in resolving conflict situations within a professional and personal environment.

AB  - Purpose Existing research on social inequalities in leadership seeks to explain how perceptions of marginalized followers as deficient leaders contribute to their underrepresentation. However, research must also address how current leaders restrict these followers' access to leadership opportunities. This conceptual paper offers the perspective that deficiencies in leaders' behaviors perpetuate social inequalities in leadership through an illustrative application to research on gender and leadership. Design/methodology/approach The authors situate existing research on gender and leadership within broader leadership theory to highlight the importance of inclusivity in defining destructive and constructive leadership. Findings Previous scholarship on gender inequalities in leadership has focused on perceptions of women as deficient leaders. The authors advocate that researchers reconceptualize leaders' failures to advance women in the workplace as a form of destructive leadership that harms women and organizations. Viewing leaders' discriminatory behavior as destructive compels a broader definition of constructive leadership, in which leaders' allyship against sexism, and any other form of prejudice, is not a rare behavior to glorify, but rather a defining component of constructive leadership. Practical implications This paper highlights the important role of high-status individuals in increasing diversity in leadership. The authors suggest that leader inclusivity should be used as a metric of leader effectiveness. Originality/value The authors refocus conversations on gender inequality in leadership by emphasizing leaders' power in making constructive or destructive behavioral choices. The authors' perspective offers a novel approach to research on social inequalities in leadership that centers current leaders' roles (instead of marginalized followers' perceived deficits) in perpetuating inequalities.

AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward the overweight, can lead to discriminatory practices, as well as increase overweight individuals' vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. We propose that a nostalgia induction can attenuate weight stigma. Participants identified an overweight individual, before writing about an interpersonal encounter with that individual, characterized by either central (e.g., "keepsakes" and "childhood") or peripheral (e.g., "wishing" and "daydreaming") features of the construct "nostalgia." Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported more positive feelings and beliefs toward overweight individuals in general. Moreover, nostalgia influenced behavior: Nostalgic (vs. control) participants reduced their social distance when anticipating an interaction with an overweight individual. The effect of nostalgia on all three outcomes (i.e., positive feelings, beliefs, and behavior) was mediated by greater social connectedness, which in turn was associated with higher inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust.

AB  - ABS T R A C T Low educational expectations for children placed in out-of-home care (OHC) are often proposed as a contributing factor to poor educational outcomes of children in OHC. However, very little empirical evidence exists on the association between educational expectations and educational outcomes of children in OHC, and the theoretical underpinnings of what drives a potential association are limited in the OHC literature. The purpose of this study is to contribute with theoretical and empirical knowledge about the relationship between educational expec-tations, individual characteristics and educational performance of children in OHC. We propose a theoretical model of the relationship between expectations and achievement and empirically test fundamental parts of the model using path analysis on survey, academic and psychometric data on 132-139 Danish children in foster care. Our findings show that educational expectations of teachers and foster mothers do matter for the children's academic performance in math, while only the foster mothers' educational expectations matter for reading performance. Educational expectations impact educational performance both directly and indirectly through the mediation of child characteristics. Importantly, our findings also show that the formation of the expectations of teachers and foster mothers draw on child age and observations of the children's abilities and functioning including their level of IQ and psychosocial adjustment. Hence, we argue, that raising educational expectations alone is an insufficient measure to increase the educational performance of children in OHC. Instead, we must work to find suitable interventions to overcome the excessive prevalence of developmental and learning diffi-culties among children in OHC.

AB  - Though popular culture is celebrated among people across the country, the admiration for folklore and performing arts is very limited. In the domain of folklore, performing art forms are categorized and stratified based on 'who is performing it' or 'who is eligible to perform' with a benchmark of the social status of purity and pollution. This article discusses and reflects the dilution of casteism and fabricated caste identities and prejudices in oppari, ancient folklore and a musical dirge song performed in Tamil Nadu, which is considered as a polluted, discriminated cultural outcome and custom to be performed and etched with people belonging to oppressed classes in society. It also keeps a close lens and discussion on change in oppari, the role of casteism and its revamp in the contemporary scenario and sociocultural aspects of oppari within the realm of caste and performance.

AB  - The expression of prejudice has mutated over the last century, and most Western countries now legally support equality. However, for ethnic minorities, work discrimination is one of the most evident challenges they have to face. Three preregistered experiments, with an overall sample of 1,507 participants, analyzed the effect of a job applicant's ethnicity and other characteristics (e.g., gender, attractiveness), which were manipulated with a CV, as well as possible moderator variables (tolerance and racism), on participants' judgments about the candidate: stereotypes (competence, sociability, morality, and immorality); emotions (admiration, contempt, compassion, and envy); and active and passive facilitation tendencies at work. The results indicated that tolerance and racism modulated the effect of ethnicity on the dependent variables in an administrative occupation (Studies 1 and 2) and in the hostelry industry (Study 3). A pooled analysis revealed that egalitarian participants (high tolerance or low racism) reported an unexpected positive bias toward a Moroccan candidate compared to a Spanish candidate. Non-egalitarian participants (low tolerance or high racism) showed the expected ingroup bias only for (im)morality: they perceived Moroccan applicants as less moral and more immoral than Spanish candidates. Studies 2 and 3 confirmed that the Moroccan candidate was perceived as less prototypical of his/her category than the Spanish applicant was. We discussed the primacy of (im)morality in social perception as well as the relevance of distinguishing between egalitarian and non-egalitarian people when trying to understand the complexity of new expressions of prejudice and to identify strategies to avoid discrimination in the workplace.

AB  - This paper evaluates an intervention in India that engaged adolescent girls and boys in classroom discussions about gender equality for two years, aiming to reduce their support for societal norms that restrict women's and girls' opportunities. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the program made attitudes more supportive of gender equality by 0.18 standard deviations, or, equivalently, converted 16 percent of regressive attitudes. When we resurveyed study participants two years after the intervention had ended, the effects had persisted. The program also led to more gender-equal self-reported behavior, and we find weak evidence that it affected two revealed-preference measures.

AB  - In this article, the several factors have been investigated relating to the poor mental health of the children in Punjab, Pakistan. Using the data of the survey conducted by the Punjab Bureau of Statistics, different determinants of child malnutrition and poverty were diagnosed based upon sufficient information of the children under 5 year of age. Logistic regression analysis methodology has been applied for screening the most influential factors of the study. It has been observed that the rise in poverty has prejudiced the nutritional position of the children, the mother's education, and the fitness of the youth. It has also been observed that male children are more at risk to poor mental health than female children. A number of policy issues came to light from the findings of the study. The wealth index of all three anthropometric measures, the child malnutrition status of uneducated mothers, and the child diarrhea menace are the significant areas.

AB  - Indian students in Britain before the Second World War were a sizeable social group who exerted noticeable influence on Indian nationalism and on British institutions and society. The politics of race and empire were mediated through British schools and universities in this period with consequences for Indian students, and their peers. This article discusses the ways in which Indian students were socially segregated in Britain, including facing a colour ban in some parts of the country, and the consequences of this racial prejudice. It argues that the mobility of colonial students during the time of empire not only had a personal effect on their lives, but encouraged them to become politically engaged in the politics of metropole and empire, engaging in nationalism, socialism and the female suffrage movement in both Britain and India.

AB  - Objectives: to identify and analyze nurses' patterns of knowing and experiences with the preparation of families for disclosure to children living with HIV seropositivity. Methods: thirteen pediatric nurses from Rio de Janeiro participated in the research using the sensitive creative method. Data were treated with Orlandi's discourse analysis and Carper's patterns of knowing. Results: nurses' speeches revealed socioculturally constructed imaginary and ideological formations. The personal pattern of knowing, under the influence of negative media about the disease in the 1980s, generated stigma and prejudice. Empirical, esthetic, and ethical patterns were built on training and professional practice of the 1990s-2010s.

Final Considerations: nurses'experience demonstrates knowledge to intervene and many challenges for their practical appropriation.

AB  - Previous research indicates that user comments serve as exemplars and thus have an effect on perceived public opinion. Moreover, they also shape the attitudes of their readers. However, studies almost exclusively focus on controversial issues if they explore the consequences of user comments for attitudes and perceived public opinion. The current study wants to find out if hate speech attacking social groups due to characteristics such as religion or sexual orientation also has an effect on the way people think about these groups and how they think society perceives them. Moreover, we also investigated the effects of hate speech on prejudiced attitudes. To explore the hypotheses and research questions, we preregistered and conducted a 3 x 2 experimental study varying the amount of hate speech (none/few/many hateful comments) and the group that was attacked (Muslims/homosexuals). Results show no effects of the amount of hate speech on perceived public opinion for both groups. However, if homosexuals are attacked, hate speech negatively affects perceived social cohesion. Moreover, for both groups, we find interaction effects between preexisting attitudes and hate speech for discriminating demands. This indicates that hate speech can increase polarization in society.

AB  - Anti-transgender policies and state legislative initiatives that focus on school bathroom use and hormone use have emerged in recent years. These policies are generally written by and voted on by cisgender people, and as such, it is crucial to understand influences on nonaffirming attitudes toward policies that can impact trans youth. The present study aimed to extend research on transphobic attitudes in general to attitudes toward policies that impact youth undergoing transition. Latent variable covariances and structural equation modeling were used to test the relations between transphobia, genderism, homophobia, need for closure, sexual orientation, social dominance orientation, attitudes toward sexual minorities, beliefs about gender roles, aggression, religious fundamentalism, and contact with sexual and gender minority individuals, as they are related to attitudes toward hormone use and bathroom use for trans youth. Analyses of data from a sample of 248 cisgender adults indicated that genderism and transphobia was associated with attitudes toward gender-affirming hormone use and bathroom use for trans youth; need for closure was associated with gender-affirming attitudes toward bathroom use, but was not associated with hormone use. Sexual orientation was linked to attitudes toward gender-affirming policies, such that nonheterosexual participants had more affirming attitudes toward trans youths' bathroom use, but not hormone use. Implications for future research, advocacy efforts to promote rights for trans youth, and clinical work with trans youth and/or parents/guardians of trans youth are discussed.
   Public Significance Statement This study advances the understanding of factors related to supporting affirming social and medical transition for transgender youth. It demonstrates the role of transphobia and the need for closure as they relate to nonaffirming attitudes.

AB  - In this article, the authors reflect on social consequences of the deagrarianization process, based on their study conducted in the Blaszki commune in central Poland. The study shows deagrarianization in the making, as the region is prone to land being concentrated among the largest farms and to the deactivation of the majority of smallholders. Our research indicates how farmers specialize, quit livestock farming, and endure work overload. It also shows attitudes among younger farmers, who in most cases reject farming as their future career. Among the social consequences of deagrarianization, we note the erosion of community life, conflicts between entrepreneurial farmers and smallholders, and growing distrust. We then reflect on the deagrarianization process's roots, which lie in anti-peasant prejudices and the modernization paradigm in Polish social sciences and in the public sphere.

AB  - Background: Students who will become health professionals should be educated according to universal standards of providing foreign patients with culturally satisfying health care, free from discrimination.
   Aim: This study aims to identify the relationship of intercultural effectiveness and awareness with xenophobia in undergraduate nursing students and vocational schools of health services students.
   Method: This descriptive study was conducted with undergraduate nursing students (N= 257) and vocational schools of health services students (N = 341) in a region with a high refugee population in Turkey. Data were collected through the "Intercultural Awareness Scale," the "Intercultural Effectiveness Scale," and the "Xeno-phobia Scale."
   Results: Of all the participants, 70.1% were females, and the mean age was 20.70 +/- 2.64 years; 57% of the students were from the vocational school students, and 43% from the undergraduate nursing program. Female students had significantly higher scores in intercultural effectiveness, behavioral flexibility, xenophobia (p = 0.036, p = 0.041, p = 0.001, respectively), interaction relaxation and interactant respect (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), while male students had significantly higher intercultural awareness (p < 0.001). The median intercultural effectiveness score of the students living in the rural area was low (p = 0.044), and the median xenophobia score of the students who lived abroad was significantly lower (p = 0.032). There was a negative correlation between the Intercultural Effectiveness Scale total and Intercultural Awareness and Xenophobia Scale total mean scores (r =-0.085, r = 0.182), and there was a weak, positive correlation between the Intercultural Awareness Scale total mean scores and the Xenophobia Scale mean scores (r = 0.113).
   Conclusion: Intercultural sensitivity is considered to be improved by including course content in the curriculum to improve students' intercultural effectiveness and awareness levels and decrease their xenophobic prejudices.

AB  - This paper investigates intersecting rights and ways of thinking in faith-based schools. It outlines current legislative attempts to manage anti-discrimination in Australian schools and proposes a dialogic model of reciprocal anti-discrimination for educational leaders and administrators. This paper proposes that reciprocal anti-discrimination will require rigorous clarity in organisational beliefs, values and philosophies of education. Differences of power, prejudice and assumptions are also addressed. The goal of the proposed model is to find a way forward where rights and values intersect while supporting student and staff wellbeing and preserving religious and moral conscience.

AB  - Education and intergroup contact are two of the most influential channels for reducing host society members' hostility toward immigrants, but recent studies suggest that these two channels are only able to shift their impressions. Yet, a shift in impression does not necessarily translate into endorsement of integration policies, resulting in a "principle-policy paradox" in multiracial societies. Little is known about whether this paradox holds in circumstances where racial boundaries are less salient and rigid. In this study, we examine whether such a paradox exists in urban China, where racial/ethnic hostility is negligible but the Hukou system has created institutional segregation between local residents and migrants. Using data collected from twelve middle-size cities and one metropolis, we examine urban residents' attitudes toward rural migrants from multiple domains. We find that education is positively associated with locals' positive judgments about rural migrants, with concern about social justice playing a mediating role. However, there is a lack of association between education and the endorsement of integration policy or social distance. Compared with education, social contact, in particular kinship contact, is associated with support in more substantive domains, ranging from integration policies to a closer social distance. Nevertheless, social contact does not lead to the support for the most pivotal policy change of granting Hukou. The findings indicate that both education and social contact are limited in engendering the extension of benefits to migrants across contexts, but intergroup contact is more capable of doing so in a society with a more fluid group boundary.

T2  - AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY
KW  - SUPPORT
KW  - MOBILIZATION
AB  - Does social protest following the police killing of unarmed Black civilians have a widespread "opinion-mobilizing" effect against the police? Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.

AB  - People living with mental illnesses and their families may conceal their conditions to avoid prejudice and discrimination. Stigma often prevents people from receiving adequate health care and other social support services which could exacerbate social and health consequences such as unemployment, homelessness, substance use, and compulsory hospitalization. In this paper, we discuss social contact as a promising anti-stigma strategy for enhancing social interactions among people with mental illnesses, their families, and those without mental illnesses. In particularly, we consider next steps for an approach that works to reduce the stigma-related burden of mental illness. For social contact to be effective in reducing mental illness stigma, it requires broad social buy-in as well as implementation within care systems. Engagement with this approach can be driven through diverse contact-based education using collaborative efforts of society, academic institutions, policy-makers, health professionals, media, and governments. Ultimately, this work aims to consider the next steps in enacting social contact as an anti-stigma strategy through direct interventions and contact-based education. The success of this approach requires pragmatic public policies to support its implementation.

AB  - Groups that have experienced collective suffering are sometimes more sympathetic toward outgroups, while other times they display higher outgroup prejudice. What can account for these contradictory observations? This study uses a unique historical episode of forced displacement to examine how perceptions of recognition of the ingroup's victimhood affect views toward outgroups. We collect data on descendants of ethnic Germans ousted from Central and Eastern Europe after the end of World War II, and examine their attitudes toward Syrian refugees today. Both observational data and an experiment are used to test the role of victimhood recognition. When they learn that their suffering is acknowledged by more Germans than they expected, descendants of expellees become more positive toward refugees. Interestingly, this effect is not symmetric. When recognition of suffering is revealed to be lower than respondents' expectations, their sympathy toward refugees does not decrease. This effect is not present among respondents without a family background of forced expulsion. Additional evidence documents the underlying mechanism at work.

AB  - How do early-life experiences shape political identity? We examine the end of race-based busing in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, an event that led to large changes in school racial composition. Using administrative data, we compare party affiliation in adulthood for students who had lived on opposite sides of newly drawn school boundaries. Consistent with the contact hypothesis, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of minorities in a White student's assigned school decreased their likelihood of registering as a Republican by 2 percentage points (12 percent). Our results suggest that schools in childhood play an important role in shaping partisanship.

AB  - Through two studies (N = 602) conducted in Italy between February and March 2020, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on biologization-a form of dehumanization that involves the perception of others as contagious entities-and outgroup prejudice. Overall, results showed that higher emergency perception was associated with greater biologization toward the groups most affected by the virus, namely the Chinese outgroup and the Italian ingroup. In turn, biologization toward the outgroup increased prejudice against that group. We also found that when the pandemic hit Italy, the greater emergency perception was associated with increased emotional closeness with Chinese people, resulting in reduced biologization and prejudice toward them. However, these results held true only for Italian respondents who reported higher levels of ingroup biologization. Taken together, our findings contribute to the knowledge gaps of biologization and prejudice by also providing relevant insights into the ongoing health emergency.

AB  - Youth of immigrant background are at risk of experiencing victimization due to their ethnic or cultural background. However, limited knowledge is available regarding why youth victimize their immigrant peers, and whether the factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization vary across adolescents of different background. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study aimed to elucidate the common or differential factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization among immigrant and native youth. The analytical sample included seventh grade students residing in Sweden from 55 classrooms (N = 963, M-age = 13.11, SD = 0.41; 46% girls; 38% youth of immigrant background). The results showed that being morally disengaged and engaging in general victimization are the common denominators of engagement in ethnic victimization for immigrant and Swedish youth. Low levels of positive attitudes toward immigrants provide a foundation for ethnic victimization among Swedish youth, but not youth of immigrant background. Classroom ethnic composition was not significantly related to engagement in ethnic victimization in either group. Predictors of engagement in ethnic victimization seem to have similarities and differences among immigrant and Swedish youth. The factors involved require further attention in developing strategies to combat bias-based hostile behaviors in diverse school settings.

AB  - An extensive literature documents racial discrimination in housing, focusing on its prevalence and effect on non-White populations. This article studies how such discrimination operates, and the intermediaries who engage in it: landlords. A fundamental assumption of racial discrimination research is that gatekeepers such as landlords are confronted with a racially heterogeneous applicant pool. The reality of urban housing markets, however, is that historical patterns of residential segregation intersect with other structural barriers to drive selection into the applicant pool, such that landlords are more often selecting between same-race applicants. Using interviews and observations with 157 landlords in four cities, we ask: how do landlords construct their tenants' race within racially segmented housing markets, and how does this factor into their screening processes? We find that landlords distinguish between tenants based on the degree to which their behavior conforms to insidious cultural narratives at the intersection of race, gender, and class. Landlords with large portfolios rely on screening algorithms, whereas mom-and-pop landlords make decisions based on informal mechanisms such as "gut feelings," home visits, and the presentation of children. Landlords may put aside certain racial prejudices when they have the right financial incentives, but only when the tenant also defies stereotypes. In this way, landlords' intersectional construction of race-even within a predominantly Black or Latino tenant pool-limits residential options for low-income, subsidized tenants of color, burdening their search process. These findings have implications for how we understand racial discrimination within racially homogenous social spheres. Examining landlords' screening practices offers insight into the role housing plays in how racism continues to shape life outcomes-both explicitly through overt racial bias, and increasingly more covertly, through algorithmic automation and digital technologies.

AB  - In this article, we review the most recent empirical research about the psychology of religion and intergroup prejudices based on race/ethnicity or religious identification. We highlight how social identity fusion, intergroup emotions, perceived value-conflict and threat, and system-justification contribute to degrees of prejudice. We also review connections between religiosity and attitudes toward-specific cultural groups (e.g. immigrants, atheists, and religious minority groups). Finally, we conclude with a few recommendations for ongoing research in this area, such as interdisciplinary and person-centered approaches.

TI  - Weapon Carrying Among Boys in US Schools by Race and/or Ethnicity: 1993-2019
T2  - PEDIATRICS
LA  - English
KW  - VIOLENCE
KW  - RACISM
AB  - BACKGROUND: High adolescent gun-related mortality, gun violence, pro-gun policies, white supremacy, and the long-term socioeconomic and other effects of racial oppression are intricately linked in the United States. Racist prejudice depicts male individuals of color as more prone to criminality than white male individuals. We described long-term patterns of weapon carrying in US schools among non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH Black/African American, and Hispanic boys, hypothesizing that in contrast to racist stereotypes, boys of color did not bring weapons into schools more often than NH white boys in recent years.
   METHODS: We conducted a time series analysis using 1993-2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data comparing boys' self-reported weapon carrying in a nationally representative sample of US high schools by race and/or ethnicity, age, and self-reported experience of safety and violence at school.
   RESULTS: Weapon carrying in schools has declined among all boys. Comparing all schools, we found no significant differences in weapon carrying (4%-5%) by race and/or ethnicity in 2017 and 2019. Boys who reported experiencing violence or feeling unsafe at school were at least twice as likely to bring a weapon into school, and such negative experiences were more common among boys of color (8%-12%) than among NH white boys (4%-5%). In schools perceived as safer, NH white boys have been more likely to bring weapons into schools than NH Black/African American or Hispanic boys in the past 20 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contradict racist prejudice with regard to weapon carrying in schools, particularly in more favorable school environments. Making schools safer may reduce weapon carrying in schools where weapon carrying is most common.

AB  - Since rape myths were codified in 1980 (Burt, 1980), scholars have shown that individuals who endorse rape myths perceive victims as less credible and more responsible for rape and perpetrators as less responsible. Studies also show that rape myths hinder successful adjudication of rape cases by influencing juries' assessments of perpetrator guilt (Dinos et al., 2015). While most of this research focuses on sexual assaults involving adult victims, some scholars have found that victims as young as 12 are blamed for rape. If rape myths influence the perceptions of sex offenses even when victims are children, then defense attorneys in child sexual abuse (CSA) cases may be motivated to highlight rape myth in CSA trials. In the current study, we conducted a content analysis of the cross-examinations of 122 children, aged 6 to 17, alleging CSA to determine if and how defense attorneys question children about rape myths. We looked for questions about force and resistance, motives to lie, victim precipitation, and character issues (e.g., habitual drug use). We found that defense attorneys commonly referenced rape myths in CSA trials. A total of 10% of all defense attorneys' lines of questioning referenced a rape myth, and attorneys asked 77% of children at least one rape myth line of questioning. Whether or not attorneys asked about different myths and the content of these questions varied by children's age. Our findings indicate that defense attorneys use rape myths strategically to undermine children's credibility in CSA trials, but they adapt (adult) rape myths in ways that are plausible in the CSA context. Policies formed to prevent the prejudicial impact of rape myths at sexual assault trials involving adults (e.g., rape shield laws) may not adequately prevent their impact in CSA trials. Prosecutors, therefore, should address rape myths at CSA trials.

AB  - With the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), the term disability is consolidated in its dynamic meaning as a condition that is defined by the interaction between personal factors and the environment in which one lives (WHO, 2001). The characteristics of the reference context that can be an obstacle or facilitation are evaluated with greater emphasis, including the perception of disability by teachers as a factor that will mediate the implementation of different behaviors and methodologies stemming from it. The purpose of the present survey, which includes 422 teachers attending a specialization course for support activities and was conducted through the administration of a questionnaire, was precisely to evaluate this perception. In particular, it evaluated the following: the differences in starting and finishing the specialization course for the achievement of the teaching qualification in support, the impact of previous experience with the disability, and the motivation to teach. Outcomes display a progressive normalization in the characteristics of a person with disabilities. The teaching strategies undergo a change between the beginning and the end of the course, with a focus from the general to the particular, becoming more targeted and detailed. In terms of opinions, emotions, and concerns, familiarity with disability seems to produce a less prejudicial and stereotyped representation, as does the teaching experience with a disabled pupil. The importance of active previous experience is confirmed in order to develop a better representation with a consequent reduction in prejudice. Further data emerge in terms of increased ability, at the end of the course, to verbally discriminate the concepts of inclusion and integration, with probable differences in approaches. The motivation for teaching is confirmed to be connected to job placement and therefore should be further investigated with scales that control the social desirability of the response. The present study shows the importance of both the perception of familiarity with disability and specialized education in supporting disabled students. We hope that future research might further investigate this area in order to improve the quality of life of disabled people through better relations with teachers and better academic outcomes.

AB  - The objective of this research was to analyze the role of mawali in the political developments in Kufa (Iraq). This article seeks to explain the role of the mawali people in the interactions and political and social developments of Kufa by referring to reliable resources and examining the words of historians. The method of this research was descriptive-analytical which was done in a documental method using the available sources. The results showed that due to its complex and heterogeneous social structure, this city hosted various social strata that played a key role in political developments, including the mawali. In the principle and theory of Islam, equality and brotherhood of Muslims are important. But this was not the case in practice and the mawali were exposed to insult, contempt and prejudices of the Arabs. The mawali were considered as slaves and second-class citizens by the Arabs because unlike the warlike Arabs, they farmed or worked as laborers, craftsmen, shopkeepers and merchants and tried to free them from slavery. Gradually, the mawali gained a relatively important role and place and high positions in the administrative and military pillars so that many famous commanders and early Islamic scholars were mainly from the mawali. These people made a great cultural influence on the Arabs.

TI  - ASFA: How Policy and Prejudice Undermine Immigrants' Rights
T2  - TEXAS LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Constitution protects parents' rights to make decisions regarding the raising of their children independent of state interference.(1) Because this right is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment-which applies to "any person within [a State's] jurisdiction "(2)-it shields both citizen and noncitizen parents. Despite this inalienable right, however, the law has overlooked undocumented parents, and as a result, noncitizens are having their children ripped from them-and their parental rights terminated(3)-at alarming rates.(4) And even though there is little information available regarding the frequency of these types of cases, experts "fear that the published instances [of separation] are merely the tip of the iceberg."(5)
   Although the reasons for the inequitable handling of citizen versus noncitizen parental rights cases are many and varied, this Note argues that two causes prevail over the others. First, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) throws hurdles in the way of undocumented parents that are nearly impossible to overcome amid detainment and deportation proceedings.(6) And second, even if these parents could meet the standards required by ASFA, courts' flawed application of settled law related to the termination of parental rights (TPR) makes losing custody of their children almost an inevitability for undocumented parents.(7) In response, Ipropose policy and legislative changes at the federal, state, and local levels that will help rectify this blatant flaunting of constitutional doctrine particularly addressing judicial cultural bias, which contributes heavily to this issue.

T2  - BILINGUAL RESEARCH JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - This qualitative case study investigates the functions of language use and underlying raciolinguistic ideologies in interactions between Latinx emergent bilinguals who are Spanish native speakers and mainstream students in the fifth-grade English classroom in a public elementary school in the U.S. Midwest. Data included audio and video recorded observations and field notes from students' interactions in different contexts of the school, as well as students' work samples and test scores, English curricula, and interviews with the students and their English teacher. Data analysis encompassed open coding followed by focused coding, and this work was informed by critical discourse analysis, resulting in the emergence of themes of two major language functions. These functions were to establish the legitimacy of knowledge source and disqualify a minoritized group. Unbeknownst to their well-meaning English teacher, the students displayed curious forms of social agency. Pervasive and important ideologies underlie language functions and language became the site of symbolic power struggles through students' hegemonic and counter-hegemonic discourses. This study is significant in the country's present social and political climate of racial tensions and prejudice against minoritized groups. The study ends with practical and research implications.

AB  - Should self-driving vehicles be prejudiced, e.g., deliberately harm the elderly over young children? When people make such forced-choices on the vehicle's behalf, they exhibit systematic preferences (e.g., favor young children), yet when their options are unconstrained they favor egalitarianism. So, which of these response patterns should guide AV programming and policy? We argue that this debate is missing the public reaction most likely to threaten the industry's life-saving potential: moral outrage. We find that people are more outraged by AVs that kill discriminately than indiscriminately. Crucially, they are even more outraged by an AV that deliberately kills a less preferred group (e.g., an elderly person over a child) than by one that indiscriminately kills a more preferred group (e.g., a child). Thus, at least insofar as the public is concerned, there may be more reason to depict and program AVs as egalitarian.

AB  - Gypsy often experience substandard social conditions, poorer health, and discrimination. However, little is known about Gypsies students' subjective wellbeing. This study aimed to compare Gypsy (n= 42) and non-Gypsy (n= 76) young-students (mean age= 13 years) in terms of composite Subjective Wellbeing (combining indicators of satisfaction with life, positive and negative affect, satisfaction with social support, and quality of life). A series of t-tests indicated that Gypsy and non-Gypsy students did not differ significantly in Subjective Wellbeing. A novelty and strength of the study were that we complemented mean difference tests with procedures for describing group similarities. Understanding similarity is important because it can lead to more accurate and positive perceptions of outgroups, including Gypsies. Across multiple dimensions of Subjective Wellbeing, the similarity between Gypsy and non-Gypsy students was greater than 92%. Although students gypsies experience several cultural specificities, they seem to register levels of composite wellbeing similar to non-gypsy peers. These results are relevant for inclusion practices and policies. as they suggest that research in quality of life is an important means to promote inclusion and equity and to reduce prejudice against ethnic minoritie.

AB  - Objective: Vignette research on binge-eating disorder (BED) stigma is limited and lacking methodological rigor. Existing studies lack control vignettes and typically present characters with overweight or obesity, introducing the confound of weight stigma. This study examined BED stigma while addressing these limitations.
   Method: Participants (N = 421) were assigned to read one of six vignettes describing a woman with either BED or no BED as well as either no mention of weight, a recommended weight, or an obese weight. Four questionnaires examined personality stereotypes, emotional reactions to the character, desire for social distance from the character, and blame attributions.
   Results: The character with BED was ascribed more negative personality characteristics and faced less positive emotional reactions than the character without BED, regardless of weight status. However, BED stigma did not emerge for social distance or blame attributions. Regarding weight stigma, evidence was limited and moderated by the presence of BED, suggesting no additive effect between BED stigma and weight stigma. In fact, blame attributions toward the character with obesity were reduced by the presence of BED.
   Discussion: The results reveal that BED is a highly stigmatized eating disorder and suggest that weight stigma may be driven by assumptions about a person's eating behavior rather than their body size per se. Future studies must consider the relationship between BED stigma and weight stigma when assessing either form of stigma. The results also indicate new information to be integrated into anti-weight stigma campaigns as well as policy and public health initiatives.

TI  - Reasonable Foundations for Happiness: The Pursuit of Self-Knowledge in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice
T2  - INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - In her novel Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen examines our hopes for happiness within the realms of friendship and marriage. Her characters embody an inquiry into the dilemma of self-deception, which is caused by the unexamined opinions that form the basis of our judgments about ourselves and others. Through the struggle of her main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, to overcome the obscuring effects of such deception and achieve knowledge of themselves and of each other, Austen portrays for readers the task of self-examination as essential to living a virtuous life and as the means to establish reasonable foundations for happiness in marriage. Because the action of the novel is a study of human nature and education in self-reflection, Pride and Prejudice dramatizes crucial aspects of the philosophic activity, from the longing for justice as a prompt to examine oneself and the role of anger and love in cultivating virtue, to the prospects for attaining self-knowledge and happiness through the mutual pursuit of companions equal in superiority.

AB  - The study of French textbooks on Moral and Hygiene, from the end of the 19th century to the second third of the 20th century, allows us to describe the prejudices and gender stereotypes linked to the various themes present in these works. The few ruptures identified in them are more associated with changes in didactic procedures than with the issue of gender. In this area, treatment is quite different according to gender. Equally distinct are the themes found when it comes to self-care, prescriptions and body prohibitions. In recommendations to girls, patience, cleanliness, temperance, moral courage, order, and sobriety in food and drink are frequent topics; in advice to boys, discussions on courage, drunkenness, alcoholism, physical prowess, suicide, mutilation, work, and laziness arise. The remarkable events regarding the situation of women in the 20th century do not seem to have impacted on school textbooks, both in terms of chosen texts and iconography, with very few exceptions.

AB  - Today's management of migration is strongly dependent on the role of reception centres. Despite their crucial role, scholars of the securitisation of migration have overlooked at how they affect the process. In the light shed by this special issue, the present contribution analyses non-state actors' cognitions and narratives in the management of reception centres, so as to explain their performative roles in securitising or de-securitising human mobility as a threat. Its findings prove that, when reception centres' managers hold prejudicial cognitions, they develop negative practices that produce hostile and stereotyped narratives. A multi-method comparative case study, including covert ethnography, field observation and in-depth interviews, shows that, differently from speech-acts, narratives do not need to be accepted by the audience to exercise their effects. The audience is impressed from the narratives, which in a performative act, make people feel and perceive what the narration stages [Alexander, J. 2004. 'Cultural Pragmatics: Social Performance between Ritual and Strategy.' Sociological Theory 22 (4): 527-573; Lyotard, J. F. 1979. La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savior. English Translation "The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge". Manchester University Press]. Akin accountings contribute to spiralling the process, by self-fulfilling and reinforcing the securitisation of migration.

AB  - Theories of recognition have received increasing attention in studies of children, young people and social care. However, the concept of misrecognition, as the opposite of recognition, is less featured. This article studies the experiences of misrecognition using evidence from the lived experience of underaged unaccompanied asylum-seeking boys in Finland. Drawing from conceptualizations of (mis)recognition and qualitative data created with 18 unaccompanied asylum-seeking boys living in residential care, we firstly look at how the boys articulate their experience of being seen as 'refugees'. Secondly, we study how they respond to the refugee label. The findings show that the refugee stigma is mainly experienced as misrecognition, which influences the ways the young asylum-seekers strive to construct agentic identities. Four ways of responding to this misrecognition are identified: adopting a diminished identity (resigning), standing up against misrecognition (resisting), acting to prove the prejudice they encounter wrong (conforming), and claiming ordinariness (performing). We argue that the misrecognition experiences of unaccompanied asylum seeking minors offer a valuable lens for deepening our understanding of young people's responses to adverse conditions. Their varying responses to misrecognition provide important insights into how social work and the care system can be more attentive to the experiences of marginalized children and young people.

AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new 'here'. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers' experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women's mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers' experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant's needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

TI  - The place of the unconscious in critiques of systematic prejudice: Lessons from MacKinnon and Critical Race Theory
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL FORUM
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper, I argue that so called "systematic critiques" of the liberal conception of law in Catherine MacKinnon and Critical Race Theory which have traditionally been seen to reject liberalism should really be understood as subjecting the liberal conception of law as impartial and just to an immanent critique. Critical Race Theory and MacKinnon both seek to unmask the seemingly neutral subject which authorizes law as in reality a hegemonic and oppressive subject. They also employ the tools of liberalism, demanding justice and equal protection under the law. I argue that the apparent contradiction of their demands can be understood by seeing the subject itself as combining these contradictions at the level of the relation between the unconscious and consciousness. The ego strives for rational self-organization while the unconscious contains sedimented socially transmitted prejudice. There is thus room within both for the struggle for freedom and justice espoused by liberalism at the conscious level as well as for the unconscious perpetuation of prejudice and domination. I conclude that MacKinnon's work and that of CRT show that liberalism must not be abandoned as post-structuralism does, but that liberals is in fact aided by its critics.

AB  - Sex education is considered a taboo in society. The dialogues that should, in short, support coherent information and debates about sexuality are transformed into a set of disagreements based on misinformation, revealing an informal sexual education that has been passed down through generations and supported by moral and religious dogmas. The research aims to analyze Netflix's Sex Education series and its relevance to the Sex Education debate. It is an exploratory study that allows us to reflect on the school as an organ inherent to society, which is reflected in a paradigm marked by the reinforcement of common sense linked to the themes of sexuality. Thus, it is noted that the school should be responsible for disseminating a formal sexual education, based on scientific studies about sexuality, but it tumbles on moral and misrepresented concepts of professionals, preventing, consequently, that there is a free discussion of dogmas and prejudices that, effectively, will solve the questions of the students of the current generation.

AB  - Head lice are exclusive human parasitic blood-sucking insects. Distributed worldwide among school-age children, this parasitosis generates scalp irritation and sometimes social prejudice. Understanding how head lice detect and perceive their human hosts is crucial to control transmission. Here, we describe the sensory structures present on the mouthparts of Pediculus humanus capitis and their possible contribution to the feeding decision-making process. On the anterior zone of the clypeus around the haustellum two morphological types of sensilla, invariable in location and number, were identified: fourteen short clypeus bristles (SCB) and six long clypeus bristles (LCB). During feeding these structures contact the host skin but not its blood. Located antero-dorsally on the everted haustellum and between the epipharyngeal teeth, a third sensillar type was identified: about four short peg epipharyngeal (SPE) sensilla. These structures are bathed with the incoming blood, when head lice feed, so may have a gustatory role. In behavioural experiments antennectomy of lice did not interfere with feeding behaviour, suggesting that the sensory structures on the mouthparts could be involved in host assessment.

AB  - Social change does not always equal social progress-there is a dark side of social movements. We discuss conspiracy theory beliefs - beliefs that a powerful group of people are secretly working towards a malicious goal - as one contributor to destructive social movements. Research has linked conspiracy theory beliefs to anti-democratic attitudes, prejudice and non-normative political behavior. We propose a framework to understand the motivational processes behind conspiracy theories and associated social identities and collective action. We argue that conspiracy theories comprise at least two components - content and qualities-that appeal to people differently based on their motivations. Social identity motives draw people foremost to contents of conspiracy theories while uniqueness motives draw people to qualities of conspiracy theories.

AB  - According to social identity theory, low self-esteem motivates group members to derogate out-groups, thus achieving positive in-group distinctiveness and boosting self-esteem. According to the Frankfurt School and status politics theorists, low self-esteem motivates collective narcissism (i.e.. resentment for insufficient external recognition of the in-group's importance), which predicts out-group derogation. Empirical support for these propositions has been weak. We revisit them addressing whether (a) low self-esteem predicts out-group derogation via collective narcissism and (b) this indirect relationship is only observed after partialing out the positive overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction (i.e., belief that the in-group is of high value and a reason to be proud). Results based on cross-sectional (Study 1, N = 427) and longitudinal (Study 2, N = 853) designs indicated that self-esteem is uniquely, negatively linked to collective narcissism and uniquely, positively linked to in-group satisfaction. Results based on cross-sectional (Study 3, N = 506; Study 4. N = 1,059; Study 5. N = 471), longitudinal (Study 6, N = 410), and experimental (Study 7, N = 253) designs corroborated these inferences. Further, they revealed that the positive overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction obscures the link between self-esteem and out-group derogation.

TI  - Community as the teacher on issues of social responsibility, substance use, and queer health in dental education

KW  - EXPERIENCES
AB  - Introduction In order to foster dental and dental hygiene practices that are inclusive, sensitive to diversity, equitable, and without prejudice, a call to broadly teach cultural diversity within dental and dental hygiene education has been made. The research question of this study was "to what extent can an interactive and open dialogue about substance use, queer health, and social responsibility foster transformative learning?" Methods A collaborative and interdisciplinary project engagedthe community as a teacherover the Summer and Fall of 2019 to address issues of substance use, queer health, and social responsibility and was delivered to 55 first-year undergraduate dental and 23 third-year dental hygiene students over three educational sessions. Dental and dental hygiene students were asked to reflect, in writing, on each session using between 200 and 400 words. Textual information from students' self-reflections and from the community's feedback were analyzed thematically for content (e.g., codes and themes). Results In total, 128 written reflections-for an average of 42 reflections per session-were gathered and analyzed interactively by the authors. Three major themes emerged: feeling privileged, breaking stereotypes, and coalescing learning. Feedback from the participating community members highlighted changes to be implemented in these sessions in the future, including more opportunities for small group activities in class. Conclusions The three major themes that emerged from the thematic analysis of the self-reflections and community member feedback (feeling privileged, breaking stereotypes, and coalescing leaning) further highlighted the impact of community-driven curricula on students' learning in regard to substance use, queer health, and social responsibility. Further work is critical to understand the impact of such a pedagogy on students' practices once they leave their undergraduate programs.

AB  - How does identity blind hiring, as opposed to sighted hiring, influence matching between high ability candidates and high value jobs? Job seekers might face constraints in signaling their abilities for lack of wealth and being denied education. Adding to this problem are the prejudices and biases of employers as some believe White (advantaged) applicants, on average with more wealth, contain a greater proportion of high abilities compared to Black (disadvantaged) applicants. Given such distorted beliefs, jobs/skills matching may improve or worsen under blind hiring, and there may co-exist unfilled vacancies and unemployment. The positive outcome, from job seekers' point of view, is when employers collectively view the blind pool of the uneducated applicants to have enough high ability candidates worth risking filling up their high value slots rather than leaving the positions vacant. The negative outcome occurs when the blind pool is perceived to contain a low percentage of high ability candidates, so the advantaged high ability candidates with no wealth remain unemployed while they would have been assigned to high value jobs under sighted hiring. Finally, if education is more than a mere signal and enhances productivity in the low value jobs, unemployment will be less. But there is also a possibility that the low ability workers of the employers-favored advantaged group choose not to educate themselves even when they have the necessary wealth. Identity neutral hiring may or may not eliminate such perverse incentives.

AB  - Introduction Prejudice toward sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals plays a significant role in SGM youth healthcare. This study examines relations between psychosocial predictors (spirituality, religiosity, SGM education, experience with SGM individuals) and SGM moral condemnation among three distinct samples. Methods This study utilized online questionnaires to assess moral condemnation toward SGM individuals, religiosity, spirituality, SGM experience, and education/training about SGM individuals. The questionnaires were distributed to a college sample, community sample, and pediatric healthcare provider sample. Data were collected in years 2016-2019. Results Religiosity positively predicted moral condemnation in all three samples. Spirituality positively predicted moral condemnation in the community and college samples, but not the provider sample. Education about SGM individuals, previous experience with SGM individuals, having a close SGM friend/family member, and self-reporting previous personal discrimination experiences, as a set, significantly explained additional variance in SGM moral condemnation within the community and college sample, but not within the healthcare provider sample. Conclusion This study lays groundwork for innovative research to further improve pediatric SGM healthcare and to increase the extent to which SGM youth disclose and discuss specific healthcare risks with their medical providers. Policy Implications There is a significant need for social policy focused on decreasing SGM stigmatization and discrimination within the healthcare environment.

AB  - Internationally, admissible incriminating evidence of uncharged acts by the accused is presumed unfairly prejudicial, and remains controversial. In an experimental study, 325 jury-eligible citizens were randomly assigned to a simulated trial in which the accused faced two charges. Juries were exposed to no evidence of uncharged acts or prejudicial evidence describing four uncharged sexual acts by the accused reported by the complainant or two independent witnesses. Jury inferences about the accused's sexual interest in children and his criminal intent were logically related to the source and type of evidence. While ratings of the likelihood of culpability increased with evidence of uncharged acts, juries were reluctant to convict solely on the basis of the complainant's word. Jury deliberations disclosed that prejudicial evidence did not induce impermissible reasoning or a lower threshold of proof. Multiple convergent measures revealed little danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse the emergence of the 'disabled subject' in contemporary Spain. In order to do this, the study undertakes a qualitative research, based on seventeen in-depth interviews conducted with subjects with an innate or acquired physical impairment, coming from different regions of Spain, and born in the interval between the years 1938 and 1962. These cases will be analysed in the light of three key social institutions: the family, the system of education and the national health system. The study involves, on the other hand, a theoretical framework based mainly on the oeuvre of Foucault, Bourdieu and the Second School of Chicago. The proposed cases will allow us to understand how people with physical impairments faced prejudices, stereotypes and oppressive forms of subjectivity, and how their subjective resistance allowed them to create new spaces of existence.Points of interest People with disabilities endure discriminatory experiences, which can lead to a certain stigmatization and a negative perception of the self. This article delves into life stories of seventeen individuals with physical disabilities in Contemporary Spain. In their passage through a myriad of institutions, people with physical disabilities often developed negative views of themselves, induced by the different agents and institutions around them. This type of research is important, because it allows us to understand, through particular cases, how people with physical impairments went through systematic discrimination, and what resources they could use to fight the prejudices and stereotypes, transforming their own perception and the social image of disability.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - SUICIDE
AB  - AIM: To consider the possibility of consequences beyond the alleviation of perceived individual suffering, for families left behind, communities and society as a whole should the End of Life Choice Act gain public support in the September 2020 referendum in New Zealand.
   METHOD: This study used the Yin case study approach to undertake a single semi-structured in-depth interview with a participant who self-identified as having first-hand experience of assisted dying from a relative's perspective (in a country where this is legal). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and trends from the interview transcript.
   RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the interview: the potential for assisted dying becoming an expectation for others to pursue when unwell and possibly facing a life-threatening illness; the notion of stigma being associated with the individual using assisted dying legislation and the family left behind; and that there may be the potential for such legislation to produce a contagion effect.
   CONCLUSION: The introduction of assisted dying legislation into New Zealand culture provides a potential hotspot for family, community and social discord that may not be easily remedied. Further study in New Zealand is required to investigate whether a contagion effect of assisted dying is possible, and how as a society, we negotiate what could become a conflicted pathway potentially complicated by prejudice, judgement and stigma.

AB  - In India, the "feminization of aging" is one of the areas in which prejudice most frequently occurs. Noticeably, poverty, isolation, changes in residential care, and weak institutional support push women into several vulnerabilities. This study demonstrates that elderly women are often denied basic rights and are compelled to reside in old-age homes; the situation is worse for elderly widowed women. We examine the claims that the lives of elderly women are more precarious due to their lower literacy, limited social exposure, and monetary dependence. Being women, old, and widowed, they are affected by triple vulnerabilities that require concrete policy implications.

AB  - As Spanish heritage courses multiply all over the United States, the need to reexamine the curriculum and pedagogical approaches that are most appropriate to meet instructional goals is becoming increasingly pressing. Although several researchers have called for developing students' critical language awareness (CLA) in the Spanish heritage classroom, this model has yet to make its way fully into the curriculum. A CLA approach is essential to help students become aware of issues of language and power and the privileging of certain dialects over others. Spanish language maintenance in the United States cannot be achieved unless learners develop this awareness in order to challenge dominant language ideologies that have been reproduced through education. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a four-module curriculum designed to develop Spanish heritage learners' CLA. The modules address (1) language variation and diversity; (2) language ideologies and linguistic prejudice; (3) Spanish in the United States and bilingualism; and (4) language maintenance. Pretest and posttest results show the curriculum effectively improved students' level of CLA. Pedagogical implications and recommendations are discussed.

AB  - The article presents research on extracurricular forms of club activity as one of the important components of educational activity of social work students at University of Ruse, Bulgaria. The purpose of the research is to identify the impact of this type of extracurricular activity on the formation of positive attitudes towards people of different ethnic background and towards persons with disabilities, stimulating their cognitive, professional and social development. A sample has been formed and research tools have been used that is consistent to the purpose and specificity of the research. The results of the statistical processing of empirical data and their analysis confirm the accepted purpose. They reveal the role and importance of extracurricular forms of club activity to create an interactive learning environment and conditions that form positive attitudes towards the target groups and stimulate students: integrate acquired values, knowledge, skills into curriculum activities with practical experience and detailed information about outside groups; consciously and motivated to includes in equal, tolerant and non-discriminatory interactions in different interpersonal systems; to enhance their cultural competence; to appreciate diversity in the community and society. In synthesis, the presented aspects contribute to the cognitive, professional and social development of social work students.

TI  - How confidently do students address patients with psychiatric conditions in the dental clinic? A service evaluation in a UK dental school
T2  - BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - HEALTH
AB  - Background Extensive literature covers the relationship between psychiatric and dental health, but little research explores the ability of dental practitioners to confidently address patient mental health. This paper explored self-reported confidence of dental students when addressing patient mental health in a university setting. Methods Mixed-method approach involving a quantitative scenario-based survey and focus groups. Research participants were from years three, four and five of the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. Results Survey data showed low confidence among dental students. Focus group themes included lack of education, prejudice and rejecting responsibility. Participants suggested communication skills workshops to help improve confidence. Discussion Self-reported confidence among dental students when addressing patient mental health was low, echoing wider literature findings. Focus groups highlighted an absence of patient mental health from the curriculum. Systematic reviews have recommended greater education around screening tools for 'assessing psychological comorbidity'. Using best practice, focus group data and psychologist guidance, we developed a communication skills case-based workshop for service improvement. Conclusion Low student confidence likely originates from limited focus within the BDS curriculum. The research will be expanded into other UK dental schools to explore the confidence of dental students nationally and to evaluate and trial the developed workshop.

AB  - Knee extension stiffness due to fibrous retraction of the quadriceps is a relatively uncommon condition in children but not so rare in developing countries. It is the result of iatrogenic intra-muscular injection. It is responsible for major functional prejudices in the child. A retrospective study was carried out over a period of 4 years. Twenty children were treated surgically for knee extension stiffness. In 100% of cases it was a severe retraction of the knee. The quadriceps-plasty described by Judet was used in 16 cases and a V-Y quadriceps-plasty in 4 cases. Immediate post-operative physiotherapy was performed every 6 hours with positioning in splint (with every 6-hour alternation between extension and 100 degrees-flexion splint).
   The average knee flexion degree was 5 degrees in preoperative period and improved to 103 degrees after the surgery. The final result was considered excellent in 30% and good in 70% of the cases.

AB  - Previous research investigating the under-representation of women in science and technology fields has identified various causes. These include, a lack of inspiring female role-models, limited exposure of girls to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, gender-biased stereotypes, and preferences for different learning styles between genders. Dedicated to the ideas of women and space, the "She Space" research project for high school girls was a joint effort of the Earth and Planetary Image Facility (EPIF) at Ben-Gurion University in the Negev and Beit Yatziv. The participants included 20 high-school aged female students and a predominantly female staff of up to eight university researchers and advanced degree students. The goal of this project was to advance and support female students engaging with various scientific fields and, in particular, the field of space science. The project emphasized the quality and development of the research process and used project-based learning to help participants learn to use a research-based approach when encountering challenging scientific concepts or subjects. This, together with active learning and teamwork was set as the educational framework to meet the different learning styles and motivational needs of girls. Furthermore, special attention was given to the suppression of gender stereotypes by 1) introducing women role models 2) overcoming self-induced prejudices related to STEM abilities by introducing new and unknown subjects (remote sensing), about which participants lack preconceptions. Using participant surveys, we found that self-reported confidence with and interest in STEM subjects increased after the project. We also found that participants' feelings about participating in an all-female program did not noticeably change after the program. However, the vast majority (87%) of participants did report that having a majority female staff was very important to them.

AB  - Large disparities in industrial air pollution exist between metropolitan areas in the United States, but we have little measurable sense of what shapes this inequality. Using data on industrial air pollution and social capital organizations, I show how metropolitan areas higher in "connected" social capital - where members have social ties that extend to other organizations in a metropolitan area - are associated with less pollution. Conversely, metropolitan areas higher in "isolated" social capital - where members' social ties are comparably insular - are associated with greater pollution. Implications center on how community connectedness links with environmental inequalities.

TI  - Barriers to Social Inclusion with the Egyptian Museums; New Approach Towards Disability
T2  - CURATOR-THE MUSEUM JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Each person in Egypt, including the 15 million with disabilities and more than 3.5 million who are 65 and older, - have the right to access museums without barriers. Egyption law, requires accommodations for each disabled person so they have equal opportunity to participate in the cultural life of the community. Unfortunately, Egypt's museums have not prioritized accessibility, despite the legislation that establishes these rights of access. This forum identifies the source of the problem as a problem of public discourse and political will rather than the legal principles that have laid the foundations for universal design in western cultures. The author proposes a new strategic vision for Egypt's museums to work within their enabling legislation to interpret state policy in ways that can accelerate inclusive practices. This strategy acknowledges that the Egyptian context where accommodation has focused on a medical model, and acknowledges that the cultural challenges with implementation of a social model requires a shift in thinking that is already been achieved in other nations. Moreover, by working within their governing systems, the author suggests that the museum can lead a shift in public discourse toward removing environmental barriers in ways that benefit all people in Egypt rather than the medical model that promotes prejudice and victimhood of those who require accommodation.

AB  - This article is part of a larger study investigating the perceived value of using comics as an information resource in the teaching and training of mental health and social care professionals in a higher education setting.
   We surveyed 108 library users at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which specialises in mental health and social care and is a centre for both treatment and training. The study showed that most participants believed that comics have a potential role to play in mental health care training, and that challenges remain in getting comics perceived in ways that are not limited by existing prejudices or socio-cultural assumptions.
   Amongst other findings, the study found no significant association between the age or gender of participants and their attitudes to comics in an academic context. Participants considered that the most useful application of comics within the mental health and social care domain was their potential use in medical or therapeutic settings with young people. Even when our sample was not dominated by participants who reported reading comics regularly, the study showed that recent experience of reading comics seems to positively influence how comfortable participants feel about using comics for teaching or learning.

More specifically, this article focuses on how school counselors can use photovoice as a tool to address the race-related struggles (e.g., racial prejudice and discrimination) that Black students experience both inside and outside of school. Photovoice empowers students to take photos capturing issues of shared concern in and around their school and use as the basis of critical dialogue and collective action plans. The key features and stages of this approach are outlined. Implication for practice and future research are discussed.

AB  - Research adopting the ideological-conflict hypothesis indicates that low religiosity, nonbelief, and antireligious sentiments predict prejudice toward ideological opponents. How to understand this, from an individual differences perspective, given that nonbelievers are typically open-minded and low in authoritarianism? We investigated, among 422 UK adults, social distance from antiliberals (antigay activists), fundamentalists, and religionists of major world religions (Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism). Nonbelievers showed prejudice toward all religious targets - but not toward an ethnic outgroup (Chinese). Furthermore, antireligious sentiment implied (1) valuing rationality and, in turn, social distance from fundamentalists and (2) low empathy and low belief in the benevolence of others and the world and, in turn, social distance from religionists. Finally, (3) valuing liberty predicted social distance from antiliberals but failed to mediate the effect of antireligious sentiment. Though general processes (e.g., perceived threat) explain all prejudices, specific individual differences seem to distinguish nonbelievers' and believers' prejudice toward each other.

AB  - Purpose Pharyngeal flap surgery used for treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) may be followed by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) especially if the patient has developed adenoid hypertrophy. However, adenoidectomy may adversely affect speech in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of transnasal endoscopic power-assisted adenoidectomy in relieving OSA in patients with adenoid hypertrophy who underwent pharyngeal flap surgery, and the impact of the procedure on their speech. Methods Transnasal endoscopic power-assisted adenoidectomy for nine children presenting with adenoid hypertrophy was performed. The patients had previously undergone pharyngeal flap surgery for treatment of VPI. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy was used in the diagnosis of adenoid hypertrophy. Pre- and postoperative polysomnography with measurement of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was done. Additionally, auditory perceptual assessment of speech (APA) and nasalance scores was measured pre- and postoperatively. Results All patients were shown to have OSA by polysomnography, and a larger adenoid size was significantly associated with a higher AHI. We achieved a significant improvement in AHI after adenoidectomy. However, six patients still demonstrated OSA, albeit with a reduced severity. Speech was not adversely affected postoperatively as the APA and nasalance scores showed non-significant changes. Conclusion Adenoid hypertrophy may be encountered in children who undergo pharyngeal flap surgery, which may cause OSA. Transnasal endoscopic power-assisted adenoidectomy is a safe and effective method for treatment of OSA in those patients without prejudicing the pharyngeal flap, and it has no adverse effect on speech.

AB  - This article presents the findings of 2,415 posts collected from two prominent Australian Football League message boards that responded to a racist incident involving a banana being thrown at Adelaide Crows player, Eddie Betts, in August 2016. It adopts Bourdieu' s concept of habitus to examine the online practice of fans for evidence of racist discourse and the extent to which this was supported or contested by fellow fans. The overall findings are that online debates about race in Australian Rules Football and wider Australian society remain divided, with some posters continuing to reflect racial prejudice and discrimination towards non-whites. However, for the vast majority, views deemed to have racist connotations are contested and challenged in a presentation centering on social change and racial equality.

AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora?s use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu?s theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants? references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by ?the wealthy? [Ruiz, 2008. ?Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy.? Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. ]. We analyse the term ?naco?, a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora.

AB  - Exposure to sexist humor creates a context in which some men feel comfortable expressing aggressive tendencies toward women (i.e., self-reported rape proclivity). This is in part because this type of humor makes it easier for men who have antagonistic attitudes toward women to express their prejudice without fear of social reprisal. Besides, previous research has demonstrated the influence of motivational variables such as autonomy (initiation or regulation of intentional behavior based on free choice) and control (acting under external pressure) on aggression. We conducted two experiments to explore the hypothetical influence of priming autonomy and control motivations on the relation between sexist humor and the expression of sexually aggressive tendencies toward women. Study 1 (N = 108) revealed that control-primed men with high (vs. low) scores in hostile sexism reported a higher rape proclivity when exposed to sexist (vs. neutral) humor. These results were partially replicated in Study 2 (N = 132), assessing the accessibility of aggressive sexual thoughts. This research contributes to our understanding of the influence of sexist humor and motivational orientations in sexist men on the expression of aggressive sexual behaviors directed against women.

TI  - Social Distance Reexamined: European Ancestry Groups in the Early Twentieth-Century United States
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA  - English
AB  - Emory Bogardus' 1926 social distance survey revealed, not surprisingly, that native-born Americans tended to view Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) Europeans as far less desirable than Northern and Western (NW) Europeans for most social relationships. This well-known finding has been attributed to both racial/ethnic prejudice and social class prejudice. The present study investigates the relative contributions of these two forms of prejudice to the total prejudice against SCE Europeans, testing the prediction that social distance attitudes toward European groups in Bogardus' pioneering survey were significantly influenced by group differences in socioeconomic status (SES), net of the NW-SCE European distinction. The prediction is supported in analyses that consider survey respondents' uniquely intense desires for social distance from those SCE Europeans that were visible because of their relatively high SES, notably, Russian-ancestry Jews. The study concludes that social class prejudice substantially affected divisions among European ancestry groups in early twentieth-century America.

AB  - Although well-documented in assorted research areas, early-years stereotyping has not garnered comparable attention. Under the assumption that stereotyping can be prejudicial to the development of children's critical thinking abilities, this paper reports on a study that examined how the pedagogical intervention of awakening to languages may develop children's critical thinking and instill a sense of cultural relativism that encourages them to challenge stereotypes from an early age. Based on a mixed-methods research design, a psychometric test was specifically developed to tap changes in participants' stereotyping behavior added to a follow-up interview to formulate a detailed picture of their questionnaire responses. Both the quantitative and qualitative results confirmed the hypothesized attitudinal change in the participants, turning cultural absolutes within their and across other cultures into cultural variations. In view of these findings, it follows that awakening children to languages have a transformative value of enhancing their cognitive capacity towards viewing the world critically.

AB  - Direct experience of social difference is crucial if lower levels of prejudice and greater social cohesion are to be achieved in our cities. Despite their key role of connecting places and people, transport infrastructures have scarcely been assessed as facilitators of encounters with social difference. Furthermore, urban contexts are progressively more complex due to the increasing relevance of transport multimodality along with the unequal degree of access to different transport modes. Building upon network analysis and consolidated accessibility measures, this study presents multi-accessibility as a concept and quantitative instrument to evaluate the potential encounter of difference in city spaces opened up by multimodal transport infrastructures. Multi-accessibility is also presented as a relevant and complementary policy avenue to enhancing social cohesion through transport planning and land use policies in the future. Two planning scenarios for the case of the Madrid metropolitan area illustrate the application, utility and interpretability of the instrument.

AB  - The ethnic match between teachers and students is widely believed to be beneficial for the achievement of ethnic minority students, who often lag behind their ethnic majority peers. In a quasi-experimental vignette study, we investigated whether preservice teachers who shared the same ethnic background as the student in the vignette had different judgments of the achievement, working and learning habits, and other social variables of the target student than ethnic majority preservice teachers and preservice teachers who had an ethnic minority background different from that of the student. Additionally, we asked about the causes of ethnic disparities. The preservice teachers who shared the same ethnic background as the target student more favorably judged the student's language proficiency in his mother tongue and perceived the student as more proficient in mathematics, science, and general competence than the two other teacher groups. Moreover, the causal attributions showed that the preservice teachers with the same background as the target student generally perceived the causes of the student's lower school success as multifaceted. The results reveal that simply having a teacher with an ethnic minority background is not sufficient for benefitting ethnic minority students. Only teachers who have the same ethnic background as the students might contribute to the reduction of ethnic disparities in school.

AB  - Multi-storey wood building (MSWB) provides options to enhance sustainable development. Despite this, no comprehension exists on how consumer perceptions differ regarding (1) willingness to live in modern houses made of timber or (2) prejudices against living in houses made of wood, although they play important role in marked demand of MSWB. In this research, views of consumers on the benefits of wood from technological, ecological, social and economic perspectives are being studied. The material of the study is based on data gathered in June-July 2018 by a postal survey sent for 1000 people living in Finland with a response rate of 25.6%. According to the factor analysis results, there are two main consumer categories based on their perceptions on sustainability benefits of wood, i.e. the ones favouring ecological and physio-technological benefits of wood and the ones favouring aesthetic and well-being benefits of wood. Additionally, according to binary regression analysis results, they differ from each other in their willingness to live in wooden houses and in their prejudices against the appropriateness of wood as a structural material. The results emphasize the need for deepening the understanding of the sustainability issues affecting the acceptability of wood among different types of consumers.

AB  - Malthus's views on the relative roles and importance of the social classes-higher, lower and middle-are presented. The view commonly expressed in the secondary literature that he was prejudiced in favour of the upper classes is questioned. The view that he was uncaring or unsympathetic toward the labouring classes is said to lack textual support. It is argued that the economic importance he attributed to the middle classes and to a greater equality in the distribution of property, income and wealth is an essential, although frequently neglected, feature of his political economy.

AB  - People with disabilities face multiple forms of social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression, including in the domain of sex and sexuality. From a critical psychoanalytic viewpoint, social responses to persons with impairments are strongly unconsciously mediated, and often dominated by projections based on archaic anxieties about dependency, vulnerability, and shame. Where disability meets sexuality, these defenses may be more prominent still, resulting, for one example, in the prejudiced myth that people with disabilities are disinterested in, or not capable of, sex. Using this theoretical stance, this paper examines how the developmental role of family and societal influences on the social constructions of sexuality and disability are internalized, resisted, and negotiated by two South Africans with physical disabilities. Data are drawn from interview material elicited via photovoice methodology. The interview narratives and photographic images are used to explore how sexual oppression may be internalized, creating intra-psychic barriers to inclusion for this already structurally disadvantaged group.

AB  - The authors searched for picture books that are useful for intercultural education and for discovering students' perceptions about the values and intercultural experiences conveyed through the books. To do so, the authors selected two books by following established criteria and analyzed students' responses through semistructured interviews. The data were obtained after reading the books aloud to 30 fifth-grade students in a school located in the south of Spain and reflecting on the books' contents. As a main conclusion, the authors found that students' answers revealed the presence of some positive values, such as helpfulness, friendship, and empathy, through questions about the experiences of characters in the books. Thus, prejudices were dismantled and positive intercultural experiences in school were fostered.

AB  - Immigrants' neighbourhood choices are key to understanding today's dominant socio-territorial dynamics, especially in urban areas. We analysed the factors involved in the housing search at the early stages of the economic migrant influx in Seville, Spain (Andalusia region, Europe's southern border) and their impact on the development of residential segregation in this city. Using a qualitative methodology approach based on focus groups, unstructured interviews and discourse analysis, the implicit and explicit social determinants that influence economic migrants' residential behaviours were examined. In line with previous studies, the results highlight the importance of socio-economic determinants and a trend towards self-segregation. Social discourse analysis reveals how the host society's ethnoracial preferences and prejudices - from the outset of the economic migrant influx - translate into barriers to accessing the housing market, which plays a crucial role in understanding economic migrant residential mobility and its impact on and consequences for the residential segregation process.

AB  - Rising hostility between members of opposing political factions has gained considerable attention in both academic and popular press. The adverse effects of this phenomenon are widely recognized, but its psychological antecedents remain the focus of ongoing debate in political psychology. Past research has honed in on two conflicting explanations: one highlights the extent to which people self-define as supporters of particular parties or candidates (the identity view), and another points toward the intensity with which they disagree on substantive matters of policy (the issues view). A nationally representative survey of 1051 eligible Spanish voters yielded support for both explanations. The perceived magnitude and nature of disagreement were associated with increased partisan prejudice, while controlling for partisan identification. Path analyses revealed that issue-based prejudice was more pronounced among ideologically extreme agents (beta = 0.237, 95% CI [0.174, 0.300]) than toward extreme targets (beta = 0.140, 95% CI [0.078, 0.201]), and replicated recent findings that identity-based prejudice is motivated primarily by non-instrumental factors (beta = 0.286, 95% CI [0.230, 0.337]). Together, these results indicate that discrimination across party lines responds to two fundamentally distinct, though at times co-occurring, imperatives: to coalesce in ideologically homogeneous communities, and to protect one's sense of partisan identity.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that, although moral distrust drives antiatheist prejudice, certain types of morality are central: Perceived atheist moral capacity for caring and compassion appears to be central, whereas perceived atheist moral capacity for fairness, in-group loyalty, deferential respect, or purity/decency is not (Simpson & Rios, 2017). Here, we extend this research. First, we conceptually replicated experimental effects: Manipulating the perception that atheists strongly versus weakly value morality affects antiatheist prejudice much more strongly if the type of morality relates to caring/compassion rather than purity/sanctity (N =162; U.S. Christian theists recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk). This finding was particularly strong among White participants. Second, we provide evidence for cross-national replication of correlational findings among Australian undergraduate theists (N =85; recruited from the University of Melbourne) as well as evidence to suggest that the type of perceived morality that predicts prejudice differs according to the social group in question. Specifically, only perceived atheist concern for caring/compassion reliably predicted antiatheist prejudice, whereas perceived Jewish concern caring/compassion and in-group loyalty predicted anti-Jewish prejudice. Results reinforce existing evidence that increasing perceptions of atheist benevolence will help reduce antiatheist prejudice and provide novel support for social-functionalist theories of prejudice.

AB  - Visual perception relies on stored information and environmental associations to arrive at a determinate representation of the world. This opens up the disturbing possibility that our visual experiences could themselves be subject to a kind of racial bias, simply in virtue of accurately encoding previously encountered environmental regularities. This possibility raises the following question: what, if anything, is wrong with beliefs grounded upon these prejudicial experiences? They are consistent with a range of epistemic norms, including evidentialist and reliabilist standards for justification. I argue that we will struggle to locate a flaw with these sorts of perceptual beliefs so long as we focus our analysis at the level of the individual and her response to information. We should instead broaden our analysis to include the social structure within which the individual is located. Doing so lets us identify a problem with the way in which unjust social structures in particular "gerrymander" the regularities an individual is exposed to, and by extension the priors their visual system draws on. I argue that in this way, social structures can cap perceptual skill.

AB  - Ethno-religious tolerance is crucial for establishing sustainable democracy, which is scarce in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This study provides an empirically grounded and nuanced critique of Orientalist studies simply pointing at Islam. It presents a systematic analysis of the impact of religious belonging, belief, and behavior on social tolerance in the MENA, based on 32 uniquely synchronized Arab Barometer and World Values surveys. This study's major contributions are that it (a) provides unique empirical insights into the multifaceted impact of religiosity on social tolerance in the region, (b) develops the 3-Bs approach to a context-sensitive framework, and (c) shows that and explains why Islam has both negative and positive influences. The analyses show (i) that the degree to which people identify with their religion has no negative impact on social tolerance, with exception of the few cases in which Islamist forces hold power; (ii) that under "normal" circumstances orthodox-literalist believers are more tolerant towards others, but less so if they feel repressed or threatened in society (which only holds for a few cases); and (iii) that mosque attendance has a negative impact on ethno-religious social tolerance, and this effect is particularly strong if conservative Islamist states coercively regulate religion and its content, such as communication via sermons. All things considered the multifaceted 3-B approach is found to hold well once the MENA-specific aspects and its diverse society-state-religion relations are incorporated as sources of both possible threats and socialization.

AB  - In this conceptual paper, we argue that social justice, morality, and healing must be at the core of an equity agenda for science education. When we view equity through this lens, teachers' and researchers' historically informed moral stances become just as important as the equitable distribution of teaching and learning resources and the achievement of excellent learning outcomes for all students. Without looking back to the history of science and its prejudices, we miss the reasons why equity in science education continues to be so hard to attain. Incorporating insights from critical race theory, we see ideas of social justice and morality overlapping as well as supporting our understanding of a new direction for equity in science education. We do not frame moral decisions as autonomous actions carried out on the basis of universal a priori principles; rather, we believe they are dialogically informed by culture and context. We therefore place emphasis on responsibilities rather than rules. In this article, we first describe equity through the lens of social justice and present an overview of recent equity research in science education. We next examine the idea of collective morality as we have conceptualized it as science educators and researchers. Then we discuss how morality and social justice intersect with histories of science and offer a different way to consider equity in science education. Finally, we propose some historical case studies that might be of use to the science education community to illustrate how morality and social justice could be a part of rethinking equity-oriented science education.

AB  - Racial and ethnic prejudice is one of the most pressing problems in modern societies. Although previous social neuroscience research has suggested the amygdala as a key structure in racial prejudice, it still remains elusive whether the amygdala activity reflects negative attitudes toward an outgroup or other unrelated processes. The present study aims to rigorously WA the role of the amygdala in negative prejudice toward an outgroup. Seventy Japanese individuals passively viewed images related to an ethnic outgroup (South Korea) inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA), we found that Japanese individuals' level of implicit (but not explicit) evaluations of South Korea could be predicted from neural signals in the left amygdala. Our result further suggested that the medial and lateral parts of amygdala play different roles in implicit evaluations. In contrast to the MVPA findings, conventional univariate analyses failed to find any reliable relationship between brain activation and both implicit and explicit evaluations. Our findings provide evidence for the amygdala's role in representing an implicit form of prejudice and highlight the utility of the multivariate approach to reveal neural signatures of this complex social phenomenon.

AB  - Psychological essentialism refers to a naive theory concerning fundamental elements that bring a category into its existence. The present study examined the structure of this lay theory as well as its implicitness, with a special focus on social categories. In Study 1, Japanese college students rated a number of categories that were natural-kind, social, or human artifacts, in terms of different elements of essentialist beliefs. A factor analysis revealed that entitativity and naturalness are the common underlying dimensions across these category domains. We also identified some natural-kind and human artifact categories that can be used as two extreme referent points for the examination of naturalness perceived in a whole array of social categories. Study 2 assessed implicit and automatic judgments on naturalness using a go/no-go task, and compared them to explicit judgments. Unlike natural kinds and artifacts, social categories were essentialized to a greater extent at the implicit level. These results suggest a dual process of intuitive and deliberate cognition, particularly involving social categories, with implications concerning the bases of stereotypes and prejudices.

AB  - This paper argues that Jane Austen reconfigures the dynamics of kin altruism and reciprocal altruism in Pride and Prejudice. The previous generation has in mind the welfare of the family and the household's dependents; however, Mr. Darcy, the Bingleys, the de Bourghs, and the Bennets prioritize the lineage family. The plot is further complicated by the social logic of tit for tat and the behavior of spiteful individuals. Austen highlights the pros and cons of kin altruism and reciprocal altruism, and ultimately likens social harmony to forgiveness and the triumph of a modified nuclear-extended kinship system.

TI  - Hume as a Social Theorist: Comments on Taylor's Reflecting Subjects
T2  - HUME STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Reflecting Subjects (abbreviated "RS") by Jacqueline Taylor is a book of genuine Hume scholarship and a delight to read. Central to this monograph is a reconstructive reading of Hume's moral philosophy, and of Hume's account of the way the indirect passions and sympathy shape the practical and social identities of human subjects. Starting from a meticulous analysis of Books 2 and 3 of the Treatise, Taylor integrates into her reading a challenging interpretation of Hume's Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals and some of his essays. Taylor presents us a Hume who is at the same time an anatomist and painter of human nature. In Hume's hands, Taylor argues, a naturalist account of the hwnan mind and its reflective capacity transforms into an innovative modern sentiment-based ethics of human dignity. For Taylor, the Second Enquiry forms the pitch of Hume's reformative and emancipatory moral discourse, from which we can still learn, despite its eighteenth-century prejudices and unavoidable blind spots.

AB  - One organization particularly dedicated to the understanding and well-being of foreign students in Canada was Friendly Relations with Overseas Students (fros). Active during the 1950s and 1960s, fros became a symbol for Canada to assert its openness and distinctiveness in North America. As an organization focused on counselling, accommodating, and, to some extent, integrating foreign students, fros also built bridges between Canada and the rest of the world. The experience of fros members thus allows us to both deepen our understanding of foreign students' agency and of the meaning and importance of their transnational experience for both themselves and Canada. In this article, I concentrate on the narrative about cultural exchange forged at fros by both its personnel and students. I propose that what I call the "fros narrative" was a discourse about the integration of foreign students on the University of Toronto's campus and in the larger Canadian society. It promoted intercultural connections and a form of globalism. It also had a transformative and even redemptive dimension, as it aimed to change people's worldviews and self-conceptions by abolishing ethnic prejudices.

AB  - Photography has often been considered tainted as a source of research data, even in tourism, its natural habitat. This situation is undoubtedly a legacy of the prejudice that many social scientists held toward the use of visual data when the academic study of tourism took off in the 1970s and 1980s. Tourism research has therefore persistently favoured textual data over visual data. This paper argues that the power of photography to prove and move can be harnessed to bridge this theoretical and practical cognitive gap. Issues relating to the performance of photography, including those of timing and intent, as well as the speed of information exchange, need however to be considered when designing and implementing research using photographic data. This implies a need to review the 'circle of representation' of tourism destination images, as well as to divide participant-generated image methods into two strands: found photographs and commissioned photographs.

AB  - Social role theory provides a framework to help understand the complexity of gender in the political sphere. We demonstrate how SRT both helps to explain extant research findings and to generate future research that will help explain the complicated ways in which gender shapes U.S. politics. This article considers two broad categories of behavior: the gendered opinions and engagement of the citizenry and the gendered evaluations of political actors by elites and voters. Within each category, we propose moving beyond the male-female binary and consider the effects of gender in conjunction with other key political identities, such as race, ethnicity, age, as well as examining the effects of (dis)ability, and class. As well, our work demonstrates how masculinity encompasses the U.S. political system and serves as a backdrop in front of which gender roles shape political behavior, and role incongruity can lead to prejudice. This project lays the groundwork for future work to apply theories from psychology to a gendered analysis of U.S. politics. Through a better understanding of sex, gender, and their combined effects with race and other intersectional identities, we contribute to a broader goal of creating a more inclusive U.S. politics.

AB  - Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) has engaged the interest of social and personality psychologists as it has deep implications for the psychology of intergroup conflict, particularly regarding factors such as prejudice and discrimination, as well as international conflict resolution. Nevertheless, few studies have directly assessed how SDO relates to intergroup reconciliation. This study (effective N = 819) measured participants' SDO along with their attitudes toward various governmental apologies to test the hypothesis that SDO is associated with unwillingness to issue intergroup apologies. The results showed that SDO was negatively correlated with supportive attitudes toward government-issued international apologies. This negative correlation remained intact after controlling for the effects of political conservatism and militarism.

AB  - Despite its popularity among students, terrorism is a sensitive and emotive topic that is difficult to learn, and challenging to teach. Given the lack of a simple definition, terrorism is hard to explain objectively and comprehensively. Perceptually value-laden and provocative, it can reinforce stereotypes and prejudices against a group of people generating conflicting emotional reactions in the classroom. The disturbingly violent nature of the subject can also be hard to communicate to students while staying calm and professional. Additionally, it is a subject where interactive methods cannot easily be incorporated, and the use of humor may come out as inappropriate and abrasive to different audiences. Taking these as a point of departure, this article draws on my experiences as a researcher and professor of terrorism to illustrate the ways in which these challenges can be mitigated. Overall, the article provides examples and strategies to help instructors not terrorize or be terrorized while teaching sensitive and controversial subjects such as terrorism.

AB  - The problem of cooperation remains one of the fundamental questions in the fields of biology, sociology, and economics. The emergence and maintenance of cooperation are naturally affected by group dynamics, since individuals are likely to behave differently based on shared group membership. We here formulate a model of socio-economic power between two prejudiced groups, and explore the conditions for their cooperative coexistence under two social scenarios in a well-mixed environment. Each scenario corresponds to an asymmetrical increase in the payoffs for mutual cooperation in either cross-group or within-group interactions. In the 'inter-dependence' scenario payoffs of cross-group cooperation are enhanced, while in the 'group-cohesion' scenario payoffs of within-group cooperation are enhanced. We find that stable cooperative coexistence is possible only in the inter-dependence scenario. The conditions for such coexistence are highly sensitive to prejudice, defined as the reduction in probability for cross-group cooperation, and less sensitive to privilege, defined as the enhancements to payoffs of cross-group cooperation.

AB  - The issue with most studies concerned with mate selection preferences in humans is that they rely on declarations and rational actions of experimental subjects, which are affected by their pre-conceived opinions and prejudices. Moreover, current research suggests that subcortical structures and processes, rather than the neocortex, play the principal role in actual partner choice behaviour. Consequently, we have only limited information on how relevant our current knowledge is in relation to real-life human ethology. To address these issues, we surveyed 2718 women and 4073 men between the ages of 16-50 and compared their declared and observed preferences for various properties in short-term and Long-term partners. We found differences between what the subjects declared to prefer and what they preferred in reality: for example, men declared that wealth was the second least desirable property out of eleven in short-term partners, but we observed that in reality, they considered wealth the third most important factor after charisma and sense of humour. Similarly, while women declared that dominance and masculinity were desirable properties in short-term partners, in the observational part of the study, they showed little preference for these traits. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the phase of the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception, pregnancy, and partnership and parenthood status on these preferences. We found some support for the good parents hypothesis and no support for the good genes and the immunocompetence handicap hypotheses when observed, rather than declared preferences were considered. We also detected that hormonal contraception, and parenthood and partnership status influenced declared preferences in considerable ways, but had only a small, if any, impact on observed preferences. We suggest interpreting the results of studies reliant on declarations and rational actions of experimental subjects with great caution.

AB  - Knowledge organization systems can have linguistic and conceptual formations of social oppression and exclusion. It is information science's role to be vigilant in perpetuating seditious discourses which end up reaffirming offenses, prejudices and humiliations to certain groups of people, especially those labeled as marginalized, that is, who are not part of the dominant group holding social power. In the quest for this diversity, this study reviews the literature of the area on how thesauri can become more inclusive and on the role of semantic warrant, specific to the philosophical, literary and cultural warrant. This research highlights the need to review thesaurus construction models so that they can be more open and inclusive to the cultural diversity of today's society, formed by social actors who claim their spaces and representations. To this end, guidelines are suggested for the construction of thesauri procedures that allow cultural warrant receptivity.
