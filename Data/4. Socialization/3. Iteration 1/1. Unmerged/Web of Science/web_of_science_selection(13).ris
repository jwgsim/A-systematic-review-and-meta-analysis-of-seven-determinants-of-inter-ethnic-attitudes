AB  - Purpose of investigation: To understand the sexual healthcare needs among cervical cancer survivors and identify important pre-disposing factors that may potentially influence their willingness to seek healthcare for sexual problems.
   Material and methods: Patients with cervical cancer attending Gynecological oncology clinic in a tertiary-care hospital for post-treatment examinations were consecutively recruited between January 2014 and December 2015. Participants were assessed for their interest in sexual healthcare services and likelihood of visiting physicians for sexual problems.
   Results: Among 173 consenting adult patients, 92 (53.2%) expressed interest in sexual healthcare services. However, 43 (24.9%) subjects were likely to see physicians to resolve sexual problems and only 5 (2.9%) did that in recent years. Older and diagnosed with advanced stage cancer patients had relatively less interest and willingness for seeking care for sexual problems compared to those younger and early-stage patients. Intention for seeking sexual healthcare was positively associated with time since last treatment. Social aspects expressed as 'feeling embarrassment or shame' and ` worrying about prejudices or stigma' appeared to be the commonest barriers for care-seeking for sexual issues.
   Conclusions: Among cervical cancer patients, there may be remained an unmet and needed regarding healthcare-seeking for sexual problems. Urgent interventions incorporating psychosocial support appeared to be the need of the hour.

AB  - Research about political science in Latin America shows good progress on issues such as the extension of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, the quality of academic production and the social recognition of the profession. Still, the status of women and diversity in the field has been scarcely contemplated. This fact is striking considering that Latin America is characterised by great inequalities, and scientific communities are not isolated from prevailing social prejudices. The article provides a first approach to the question of the status of women and diversity in the discipline in Latin America, examining women's presence in professional associations, universities and national research systems. Journals and congresses are also examined in order to assess the participation of women as authors and panellists, as well as the extent to which diversity and gender-related issues are addressed in academic production. The findings point to the existence of a 'critical mass' of women in the field, although they are outnumbered by their male counterparts. This feature makes the profession in Latin America more similar to political science communities elsewhere and less like other social sciences in the region, which are feminised disciplines.

AB  - Sexuality is a dimension that concerns human health with profound implications not only in the biological and psychological aspects, but also in the social and cultural dimensions, affecting all ages of life. Sexuality in old age is still conditioned by biases, prejudices and from a stereotyped vision, which considered older people as ''asexual'', in spite of several studies and surveys showing that older persons have sexual potential to express. In population surveys, a fair number of men and women aged over 60 years reported having sex at least once a month. The most influential predictor of sexual activity seems to be the physical health in older men, and the quality of the relationship in older women. The most common sexual disorders are erectile dysfunction and delayed ejaculation in older men, and reduced sexual interest, arousal disorder, female orgasmic disorder, genitopelvic pain and ailments of penetration in older women. A careful evaluation can identify the presence and severity of disorders in different phases of the sexual response cycle. The management of sexual dysfunction in older people may include reassurance, education, sex therapy and/or the use of drugs in specific cases. Sexuality in patients with dementia may arise as inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB) due to behavioural disinhibition. Manifestations of ISB can be very distressing for family members and other caregivers and can present substantial challenges for staff and health care providers in long term care. Although there is no established treatment algorithm for dementia-related ISB, there are various non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, which can help in the management of these patients.

TI  - The Promise of Anonymity: An Investigation of the Practices of ELA Teachers Facilitating Discourse About LGBTQ Topics
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA  - English
KW  - QUEER
AB  - Background/Context: As states and districts have begun adopting texts inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people, debates about how LGBTQ issues should be represented in the curricular canon have emerged. While existing research investigates curricular questions that are arising as a result of LGBTQ curricular inclusion, scholarship has been slow to address the instructional questions presented by the introduction of inclusive curricula.
   Purpose: This study explored how seven secondary English Language Arts teachers facilitated student engagement with LGBTQ-related topics. Analysis of data on teachers' instructional practice and related decision-making sought to (a) determine what instructional dilemmas arose for teachers as they taught LGBTQ-inclusive content and (b) analyze the instructional decisions that teachers made to address these dilemmas.
   Participants: Participants in this study were seven secondary English Language Arts teachers who (a) held strong reputations in their professional communities for supporting LGBTQ students and (b) had strong intentions to support LGBTQ students through LGBTQ curricular inclusion, reducing student prejudice, and advocating for and with LGBTQ students.
   Research Design: This comparative case study was embedded in a larger qualitative study that investigated the instructional practice of LGBTQ-supportive teachers. This article reports on findings from an analysis of all data from this project that pertained to how teachers engaged students when teaching LGBTQ content. Data was collected over a six-month period and includes 22 teacher interviews, 28 observations of classroom instruction, 70 teacher log entries, and 25 teacher questionnaires.
   Findings/Results: Analysis showed that participants felt a tension between a desire to make LGBTQ identity visible and a desire to offer LGBTQ students privacy. Participants employed two different approaches to navigating the visibility-privacy tension. Some created parallel engagement strategies for students, some public and some private, while others simultaneously allowed for privacy and visibility through the use of anonymity.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: As conceptions of diversity expand to include sexual diversity, this study has implications for teacher preparation and professional development aimed at supporting teachers to attend to the unique needs of LGBTQ students within instructional practice.

AB  - Based on the qualitative research of elite interviews and narrative analysis of Hungarian documents, the main aim of this article is twofold: (1) to elucidate the transformation of Jobbik from a marginal extra-parliamentary youth focused movement to an influential parliamentary party; (2) to discuss the impact of Jobbik's ascension on the main centre right Fidesz only as a pre-conclusion. It argues that the rise of Jobbik is not a protest phenomenon that simply demonstrates a social disenchantment with the transitional economy. Jobbik's transformation is a unique post-Communist political development that is rooted in elements of Hungarian nationalism. These national elements include underlying social prejudice against Roma and Jews, a preference for paternalistic economic systems, and even attraction to the historical narrative of mythic Turanism in the debate over the origins of Hungarian national identity. Jobbik manipulates all of these national elements for the transformation of its own party identity, emerging as a main challenger to the Fidesz.

AB  - Recent demographic changes in the forest-owner structure are suspected to have led to the increasing number of owners with no specific objectives for their forests. In addition, the continuous fragmentation of the forest holdings has increased the threat of the passiveness related to forest management. To decrease the tendency towards passiveness, new policy tools and initiatives have been suggested. In the Finnish context, the idea of an investor-based jointly owned forest has been introduced as facilitating the effective utilization of the forest resource. However, collective ownership has faced prejudice and scepticism among private forest owners. In order to expand, the forest owners need to see the idea of jointly owned forests as a socially legitimate. Thus, by adopting Van Leeuwen's framework for analyzing the legitimation of new social practices, we examine how Finnish forest owners legitimate their participation in jointly owned forests. The qualitative data of the study consist of 20 in-depth interviews with private forest owners who have joined a jointly owned forest. Our study contributes to the recent discussion on jointly owned forests. We show how a change in the type of ownership results in moral, authoritative and rational justifications over the decision while simultaneously renewing the identity of the forest owner. Accordingly, we suggest that forest ownership is not only driven by rational prospects, but the moral and emotional nature of ownership should be better taken into account at the policy level and in structural designs when discussing the promotion of new types of forest ownership.

AB  - Street-level professional workers' influence over Indigenous health policy implementation is an important variable in a contested policy environment distinguished by an Indigenous median age of death approximately 20 years less than for non-Indigenous citizens. Street-level workers are guided by personal political values in the ways that they prioritise their work and make decisions about the care that will be available to particular patients. The possibility that street-level workers may make decisions with reference to stereotypical or prejudiced judgements about Indigenous peoples makes their bureaucratic discretion a point of particular significance. Alternatively, their capacity to work on the assumption that they have the professional agency and a moral duty to make a substantive contribution to improving Indigenous health outcomes positions their work in the context of social justice. The street-level worker is, then, drawn into the politics of public policy and policy activism, where ideology sits alongside professional knowledge and skills as determinants of Indigenous health outcomes, and where public policy's intellectual and practical inconsistencies simultaneously constrain opportunities for bureaucratic discretion in some respects and provide new opportunities in others, such that the street-level worker is a central participant in the politics of Indigenous health.

KW  - METAANALYSIS
AB  - Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that religious people generally report more prejudice against homosexuality. However, previous research exploring the general mechanisms that underpin this relationship mostly relied on Christian samples in North America. Studies outside North America are few in number and limited in the forms of religiosity they address. Of all indicators that have been studied so far, a religious quest orientation was found to be the only one negatively related to anti-gay sentiments. This leaves open the question whether the mechanisms for different forms of religiosity can also be found outside North America. Against that background this research note assesses how religious quest orientation, self-rated religiosity, religious behavior, and authoritarianism are related to prejudice against homosexuality among Christian and Muslim youth aged 14-23 in Flanders (N = 2,834). This study is the first that investigates the relationship between religious quest orientation and anti-gay sentiments among Muslims. For both Christians and Muslims, we found that even taking into account a wide range of social background and religious characteristics, having a religious quest orientation is related to less prejudice toward homosexuality.

AB  - Background
   Public attitudes to mental illness could influence how the public interact with, provide opportunities for, and help people with mental illness.
   Aims
   This study aims to explore the underlying factors of the Attitudes to Mental Illness questionnaire among the general population in Singapore and the socio-demographic correlates of each factor.
   Methods
   From March 2014 to April 2015, a nation-wide cross-sectional survey on mental health literacy with 3,006 participants was conducted in Singapore.
   Results
   Factor analysis revealed a 4-factor structure for the Attitudes to Mental Illness questionnaire among the Singapore general population, namely social distancing, tolerance/support for community care, social restrictiveness, and prejudice and misconception. Older age, male gender, lower education and socio-economic status were associated with more negative attitudes towards the mentally ill. Chinese showed more negative attitudes than Indians and Malays (except for prejudice and misconception).
   Conclusions
   There is a need for culture-specific interventions, and the associated factors identified in this study should be considered for future attitude campaigns.

AB  - In modern societies there is strong belief in scientific progress, but, unfortunately, a parallel partial regress occurs because of often avoidable mistakes. Mistakes are mainly forgetting, erroneous theories, errors in experiments and manuscripts, prejudice, selected publication of "positive" results, and fraud. An example of forgetting is that methods introduced decades ago are used without knowing the underlying theories: Basic articles are no longer read or cited. This omission may cause incorrect interpretation of results. For instance, false use of actual base excess instead of standard base excess for calculation of the number of hydrogen ions leaving the muscles raised the idea that an unknown fixed acid is produced in addition to lactic acid during exercise. An erroneous theory led to the conclusion that lactate is not the anion of a strong acid but a buffer. Mistakes occur after incorrect application of a method, after exclusion of unwelcome values, during evaluation of measurements by false calculations, or during preparation of manuscripts. Co-authors, as well as reviewers, do not always carefully read papers before publication. Peer reviewers might be biased against a hypothesis or an author. A general problem is selected publication of positive results. An example of fraud in sports medicine is the presence of doped subjects in groups of investigated athletes. To reduce regress, it is important that investigators search both original and recent articles on a topic and conscientiously examine the data. All co-authors and reviewers should read the text thoroughly and inspect all tables and figures in a manuscript.

The article also examines the rather surprising descriptions of agency, personal strength and coping offered by the research participants when discussing their reactions to experiences of hate crime and prejudice. An examination of these reactions was informed by emerging psychological and sociological literatures concerning the concept of resilience.

Social representations of TB focus on aspects associated to feelings and manifestations awakened by the disease, sometimes reinforcing stigmas and prejudices about the way of perceiving TB. TB is a historic disease now reborn with a deeper social stigma. Despite the modest reduction in TB incidence worldwide, its incidence is still rising in certain crisis-affected populations like refugees, and in those bearing high prevalence of HIV, persisting poverty, especially in the developing world. Fear and stigma may appear justified with the increasing rates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, and now extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB. However, stigmatization of TB poses serious obstacles to current TB control efforts, as socio-cultural aspects can influence adherence to TB treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Physical health disparities by sexual orientation are widespread yet under-investigated. Drawing upon theories of biological embedding of social adversity, we tested whether minority stress (in the form of perceived discrimination) is associated with salivary interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory mediator. Furthermore, we examined whether covering, a strategy involving downplaying a stigmatized social identity, modified this association. A community sample (N = 99) of gay men (n = 78) and lesbian women (n = 21) completed self-report measures of minority stress and identity management and provided saliva samples which were assayed for IL-6. Among gay men, results from generalized linear models supported a hypothesized interaction between perceived discrimination and covering, such that perceived discrimination was predictive of higher levels of IL-6 for those who engaged in less covering but not for those who engaged in more covering. This interaction was robust to a number of potential covariates (alcohol, medication, body mass index, race and age). Results for lesbian women suggested a different pattern: the only statistically significant association detected was between greater perceived discrimination and lower levels of IL-6. Findings from the current study point to an important role for inflammatory processes in understanding and remediating health disparities based upon sexual orientation that stem from exposure to prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Background: Not many of the studies on the pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood of drug-using women that have been conducted in Central and Eastern Europe, including Slovenia, have demonstrated the marginal position such groups hold in research. There is not much knowledge about experiences of drug-using mothers, their needs or risk behaviours, as almost all studies focus on the harm undergone by new-born children. Aim: The goal of this study was to explore and better understand the experiences of women using illicit drugs during pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, and to recognize their needs and the obstacles they have to face. Methods: The in-depth semi-structured interviews with fifteen mothers who had used opioid drugs during their pregnancy and labour served as the source of information. All subjects were included in various addiction treatment programmes The methodology used was qualitative. Results: Apart from the problems that are physically linked with drug use, pregnancy involves various psychosocial risks. The pregnancies of most of the mothers in this study (all of them were opioid users) had been unplanned and were detected at quite a late stage. When the mothers realized they were pregnant, they began to follow various harm reduction strategies that they believed would benefit their child, such as discontinuing illicit drug use and taking part in an agonist opioid maintenance treatment. The involvement of supportive partners and other relatives, as well as the comprehensive management of pregnancy and drug use, demonstrated positive effects on prenatal care. However, prejudice and various stereotypes prevented care and health workers, governmental and non-governmental institutions alike and individuals from applying effective strategies. This study has investigated severe features of these women's lives when they came to the term of their pregnancy and then childbirth. Conclusions: Pregnancy is a period that allows changes to happen in pregnant women's lives, and therefore calls for support strategies to benefit both mothers and their children.

AB  - The conventional wisdom regarding the impact of discrimination on political behavior is that the perception of prejudiced treatment motivates individuals to take political action. This study challenges this common conception by demonstrating that the source of discrimination can play a significant role in whether perceived or experienced injustice leads to activism or withdrawal from sociopolitical life. Drawing from political science and social psychology literature, this study provides a new perspective on the potential effects of discrimination on a relatively new marginalized group in the United States. Specifically, an important distinction is drawn between political (systematic) and societal (interpersonal) discrimination in analyzing the sociopolitical behavior of American Muslims in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The results will hopefully encourage scholars to take a deeper look at the nexus between discrimination and democratic engagement, which is an important, complex, multidimensional, and understudied topic.

AB  - Despite the growing visibility and acceptance of transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals, TGNC older adults experience many barriers in accessing competent and affirming health and social services due to anti-TGNC prejudice, discrimination, and lack of competent healthcare training on the part of healthcare workers. Clinical gerontologists and geriatricians will likely encounter TGNC adults in their practice given population aging and greater numbers of TGNC people who are living in their affirmed gender identities. The American Psychological Association recently published its Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People, which document the unique needs of TGNC individuals and outlines approaches for competent and affirming service provision (APA, 2015). We interpret these Guidelines using a gerontological lens to elucidate specific issues faced by the TGNC older adult along with the practice and policy implications for this population.

AB  - The present research investigates the humanity attributions to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). In three studies, professional educators, who worked in day-care or community centers, were examined. Humanity attributions were assessed using emotion-based and trait-based measures. As expected, individuals with IDD were denied a fully human status: they were perceived as having more non-uniquely than uniquely human attributes. Furthermore, a lower human status was assigned to individuals with IDD in relation to educators. We also discovered that humanity attributions, but not attitudes, were related to approach/avoidance responses. Altogether, findings show the importance of considering humanity perceptions in the study of social relationships of individuals with IDD. Dehumanizing perceptions can explain the differential treatment these individuals face in various social settings.

AB  - The Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act (2015) targets immigrants suspected of engaging in polygamy. While polygamy is already illegal in Canada and non-immigrant polygamous arrangements exist within Canadian borders, the framing of polygamy as a foreign practice portrays this familial arrangement as a threat to Canadian national values. Effects on women and children have traditionally provided a convincing argument for state regulation of polygamy; however, the combination of state underand overenforcement suggests that relying solely on a harm framework inadequately captures the complexities of state treatment. In this paper, I argue that the state's primary motivations for defending monogamy are not necessarily rooted in the avoidance of harm but in the preservation of a particular type of citizenship.
   Resume La Loi sur la tolerance zero face aux pratiques culturelles barbares (2015) cible les immigrants soupconnes de pratiquer la polygamie. Alors que la polygamie constitue deja une pratique illegale au Canada et que des arrangements polygames visant des non-immigrants existent a l'interieur des frontieres canadiennes, l'encadrement de la polygamie en tant que pratique etrangere depeint cet arrangement familial comme une menace aux valeurs nationales canadiennes. Les effets sur les femmes et les enfants ont fourni un argument convaincant en faveur d'une reglementation de la polygamie par l'Etat ; toutefois, la combinaison d'une application de la loi, << insuffisante >> d'une part et << excessive >> de l'autre, suggere que le fait de miser uniquement sur un argument de prejudice cerne de facon insuffisante les complexites du traitement de l'Etat. Dans cet article, j'avance que les motivations premieres de l'Etat pour la defense de la monogamie n'ont pas necessairement pour fondement d'eviter tout prejudice, mais la preservation d'un type particulier de citoyennete.

AB  - This article explores Hijra communities, attempts to understand what it means to take on the Hijra role, and describes the process involved in becoming a Hijra. It is based on an ethnographic study of the Hijras living in Delhi, India and investigates the birth of a Hijra as a social body. The Hijra community has always been on the fringes of society, dwelling in abject poverty and excluded from the process of normalization. Being victims of various forms of prejudices and intolerance, the Hijra community lives in fear and isolation, often in clandestine, ghettoized locations. The problems confronting these groups of people have not been adequately explored, primarily as a result of the hidden nature of the community. By addressing exclusionary practices, the article draws out intersections between identity politics and the reproduction of social difference triggered by existing inequalities and inequities of class, gender and sexuality.

AB  - Antiprejudice norms and attempts to conceal racial bias have made Whites' positive treatment of racial minorities attributionally ambiguous. Although some minorities believe Whites' positivity is genuine, others are suspicious of Whites' motives and believe their kindness is primarily motivated by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced. For those suspicious of Whites' motives, Whites' smiles may paradoxically function as threat cues. To the extent that Whites' smiles cue threat among suspicious minorities, we hypothesized that suspicious minorities would explicitly perceive Whites' smiles as threatening (Study 1), automatically orient to smiling Whiteas opposed to smiling Blacktargets (Study 2), and accurately discriminate between Whites' real and fake smiles (Study 3). These results provide convergent evidence that cues typically associated with acceptance and affiliation ironically function as threat cues among suspicious racial minorities.

KW  - ATTRACTION
AB  - In1903, Underwood&Underwood published Italy through the Stereoscope: Journeys in and about Italian cities, a multimodal set that provided an immersive travel experience by combining the use of a visual device (the stereoscope and stereoviews), localisationtools (the maps), anda written commentary on each view. The paper argues that this medium', which was introduced as a realistic and immersive visual reproduction of the world, was an innovative forerunner of modern virtual-reality technologies. The visual three-dimensional effect obtained by the stereoviews is just one of the characteristics meant to enhance the virtual' experience of the viewer. The author analyses the rhetorical means, strictly intertwined with the photographic representations, to reinforce the impression and emotion and to replace the physical experience of a tour with that of an armchairtraveller. The framing of the picture, the choice of the points of view, and the style of staging and posing the people reveal an international standard. In spite of their claim of realistic representation, this vision is not ideologically neutral, and the analysis of this set reveals the biases and prejudices towards not only strangers but also the old' technology of 2D photography. For social and economicreasons, the ancientpracticeof taking thegrandtourfaded, but the conspicuous consumption of this medium allowed the middle class to gain cultural capital with a 3D visual tour in order to claim refinement.

AB  - Just world research has shown that observers derogate victims more for their misfortunes if the perpetrator is not harshly punished (Lerner in J Personal Soc Psychol 1(4):355-360, 1980). However, few studies have investigated minority group derogation as a just world preservation strategy after instances of intergroup harm-doing. This study is among the first to demonstrate the derogation of both individual victims and of the victim's minority group experimentally, using the context of a racist hate crime in Australia. In the present experiment, participants (N = 110) read a news article describing a hate crime against an Aboriginal Australian teenager and were informed that the perpetrator was harshly or leniently punished (secure vs. justice threat condition). Our results show that in the justice threat condition, participants not only derogated the individual Aboriginal Australian victim more after his death, they also expressed greater racism toward the victim's group. An indirect effect of the justice threat condition on modern racism via individual victim derogation was observed, along with moderating effects of individual differences in belief in a just world. These findings provide support for the alarming hypothesis that racist hate crimes are not only the manifestation of a racist society, but may also bolster racial prejudices if leniently treated. The results highlight the important role of political and judicial authorities, whose response or non-response to a hate crime can exacerbate or ameliorate existing prejudices.

AB  - The welfarist account of enhancement and disability holds enhanced and disabled states on a spectrum: the former are biological or psychological states that increase the chances of a person leading a good life in the relevant set of circumstances, while the latter decrease those chances. Here, I focus on a particular issue raised by this account: what should we count as part of an individual's relevant set of circumstances when thinking about enhanced and disabled states? Specifically, is social prejudice relevant to an individual's circumstances in regards to how disabled or enhanced they are? For instance, if an individual is discriminated against on the basis of their skin colour, and this leads to a reduction in their well-being, the welfarist account suggests that their skin colour is a disability. To avoid such a seeming mislabel, Savulescu and Kahane have argued for excluding social prejudice from counting as a relevant circumstance to their welfarist definition of disability. I argue, however, that this exclusion of social prejudice is unsatisfactory and incompatible with the goals of this account.

AB  - Because stigmatized individuals are viewed as incongruent with commonly held implicit leadership theories, they are often deemed less fit to lead than their nonstigmatized counterparts (Eagly & Karau, 2002). This suggests consumers might use such views to discredit not only stigmatized leaders, but also the companies they represent. However, cognition based on social categories (1 potential form of stigma) may be more likely when there are readily available alternative factors to account for one's decisions via casuistry. Across 2 complementary studies (field and experiment), we find that customers react negatively to stigmatized leaders only when the physical state of the company venue provides an ostensible defense to mask their biased behavior. When facilities are of lower quality, consumers appear to use a leader's stigma to infer lower product quality, coinciding in less patronage for companies with stigmatized as opposed to nonstigmatized leaders. Thus, consumers penalize companies with stigmatized leaders only when doing so can easily be attributed to an alternative factor (e.g., a lower quality venue) not involving the leader's stigma.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward bisexuals have been documented among heterosexuals as well as lesbians/gay men, and a common theme is that bisexuals would not be suitable romantic or sexual partners. While gender, sexual orientation, and attitudes toward bisexuality influence people's willingness to engage in romantic or sexual activities with a bisexual partner, there are other individual differences that may contribute. The current study examined the associations between four types of conservative beliefs and willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with a bisexual partner in a sample of heterosexuals and lesbians/gay men (N= 438). Attitudes toward bisexuality were examined as a mediator of these associations. In general, results indicated that higher social dominance orientation, political conservatism, and essentialist beliefs about the discreteness of homosexuality were associated with lower willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with a bisexual partner. Further, more negative attitudes toward bisexuality mediated these associations. There were several meaningful differences in these associations between heterosexual women, heterosexual men, lesbian women, and gay men, suggesting that influences on people's willingness to be romantically or sexually involved with abisexual partner may differ for different gender and sexual orientation groups. Implications for reducing stigma and discrimination against bisexual individuals are addressed.

AB  - Local people's sense of place identity might feel threatened in the midst of rapid social change or at a time of crisis, they come into collective consciousness and are particularly likely to assert and highlight their local place identity. Languages (including scripts) become one way for them to maintain an authentic claim to a place and give it a social meaning that in turn authenticates their status as true' residents of this place. The use of a simplified Chinese sign by McDonald's in Macao in May 2012 has sparked a debate on the protection of traditional Chinese characters against simplified Chinese characters. With the application of the ideology of linguistic authenticity to netizens' comments, this study reveals the sociolinguistic imagination of a homogeneous Macao speech community and illustrates how Macao people discursively negotiate and construct their identities under the tension of One Country' and Two Systems'. It also discusses some of the contextualizing factors that help situate the debate in a broader sociopolitical context. Small as it is, Macao serves as an illustration of the ways in which local-national tensions play out in languages and has wider resonance beyond the site under investigation.

AB  - Objective: Attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) has recently been included in the appendix of DSM-5 as a condition for further study. This study compared public stigma associated with four mental health conditions among study participants in Hong Kong.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study involved 204 participants (154 members of the general public general public and 50 health care professionals) recruited through a public awareness campaign and the e-mail network of the University of Hong Kong. Participants read four vignettes describing persons with schizophrenia, depression, APS, or psychosis-like experiences. For each vignette, they used a scale to rate their level of stigma in seven domains: social distance, traditional prejudice, exclusionary sentiments, negative affect, perceptions of dangerousness, treatment carryover, and disclosure carryover. Analyses compared ratings within and across vignettes.
   Results: Schizophrenia received the highest public stigma ratings, followed by APS, depression, and psychosis-like experiences. Total stigma scores were higher for the general public than for health care professionals. Public stigma associated with APS was similar to that associated with depression. Ratings of treatment carryover indicated that participants believed that being known to have received treatment for APS or depression would have lasting consequences.
   Conclusions: Stigma should be considered in the development of mental health services and research in China, particularly in regard to people with schizophrenia and those at risk of psychosis.

AB  - Archaeological theorists have identified elites of priests and elders who established social dominance through manipulating ritual access to the sacred, as seen in monuments with outer boundaries and secret chambers. This theory is based on tacit ideas about religion which have their own history beginning with early Christian doctrines about the Veil of the Temple in Jerusalem, and descending through Reformation theology, the Deist controversy, and the imaginary priestcraft of the Druids. By bringing this genealogy of ideas to light, we can take a fresh view of concealment in sacred architecture, without being fettered to an inheritance of subliminal prejudice.

AB  - The main goal of this research was twofold. First, we aimed at determining how acculturation preferences and emotions were related to specific intergroup behavioural tendencies towards majority and minority groups. Second, we aimed at developing an intergroup behavioural tendencies scale that differentiates between valence ( facilitation and harm) and intensity ( active and passive). The role of intergroup contact was also examined, as it is a known predictor of intergroup prejudice. In order to fulfil these goals, we carried out two studies. In Study 1, Spanish participants ( N=279) answered a questionnaire about Moroccans ( a devalued group) or Ecuadorians ( a valued group) by reporting their acculturation preferences for immigrants, their positive and negative emotions, quantity of contact with them and behavioural tendencies towards them. In Study 2, Moroccans ( N=92) and Ecuadorians ( N=87) assessed Spaniards on these measures. Results confirmed the structure of the new behavioural tendencies scale across four groups of participants. Overall, findings also showed that acculturation preferences and quantity of contact indirectly predicted behavioural tendencies through positive emotions. This research contributes to knowledge on how the majority and minority's acculturation preferences are related to their emotions and specific dimensions of intergroup behavioural tendencies, confirming the predominant mediating role of positive emotions in this process.

AB  - The user in psychological distress needs a service that provides a targeted assistance, that welcomes when required, acting as originator care device to the user on the network of health care. This study aimed to describe how people in psychological distress are perceived by the community in the voice of the community health worker. It is a qualitative research conducted with eighteen Community Health Agents, a Primary Care Unit Health (UAP) located in BE IV, in Fortaleza, Ceara. We used a semi-structured and individual interview. Data processing was due to the content analysis. Ethical and legal aspects on the advice No. 957,595. Through the speeches of ACS, it describes how the community perceives the person in psychic suffering and how it positions itself in the face of your everyday problems, as regards the rejection, prejudice, discrimination ne loss of identity. However it is emphasized that, because of being inserted in the community, the community health worker realizes more accurate way in which this social group is the person in mental distress. The rejection of the person who became ill is seen as a fairly common reaction, accompanied by prejudice and discrimination, marginalizing her from society.

AB  - A 1x3 experiment (N=99) investigated the effects of the Band Aid 30 music video on psychological processes underlying the willingness to volunteer to combat Ebola. As expected, exposure to the Band Aid music video moderated the relationships among identification with the national or human community and willingness to volunteer. Identification with the national community was a stronger predictor of willingness to volunteer among participants in the two comparison conditions (i.e., the conditions of no exposure to the music video) than among participants in the music video condition. Conversely, identification with the human community was a stronger predictor of willingness to volunteer among participants presented with the music video than among participants in the two comparison conditions. In addition, two individual orientations emerged as positive predictors, namely, motivation to control prejudice (in the comparison conditions), and empathic concern (in the music video condition). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The hip-hop culture has evolved from the ghettos of The Bronx, New York in the 1970s, into a global phenomenon. Despite such prominence there is an absence of academic research on the hip-hop culture element: breakdance. Through eight months of participant observations and 17 qualitative interviews, this study investigates the identity construction process among breakdancers with diverse ethnic backgrounds in Norway. The aim is to provide an insight into the lives of young people and their impression management in constructing a breaker identity. The analysis highlights the complex and contested nature of breakdance as it is experienced and viewed by young people performing breakdance in Norway. Through deliberate impression management the breakdancers construct an alternative identity detached from other social categories. As a result, breakdance seems to counter social oppression and to have an empowering and liberating potential different from the common stigmatization and stereotypical prejudices regarding gender and ethnicity that many have experienced.

TI  - Vice Epistemology
T2  - MONIST
LA  - English
AB  - Vice epistemology is the philosophical study of the nature, identity, and epistemological significance of intellectual vices. Such vices include gullibility, dogmatism, prejudice, closed-mindedness, and negligence. These are intellectual character vices, that is, intellectual vices that are also character traits. I ask how the notion of an intellectual character vice should be understood, whether such vices exist, and how they might be epistemologically significant. The proposal is that intellectual character vices are intellectual character traits that impede effective and responsible inquiry. I argue that situationist critiques of virtue epistemology pose no significant threat to this proposal. Studies by social psychologists of belief in conspiracy theories suggest that it is sometimes appropriate to explain questionable beliefs by reference to intellectual character vices. Neither 'regulative' nor 'analytic' epistemology has any good reason to question the epistemological significance of such vices.

AB  - As LGBTI issues become visible within society there is a growing belief that society is ready to confront prejudices around sexuality and gender. But who is represented in these processes of visualization? The LGBTI agenda has focused on the defense of marriage, Don't Ask Don't Tell, federal hate crime statutes and the Employment Non-discrimination Act. The political strategy around these issues has been defined by a moderate approach based on demanding inclusion into existing institutions. A look at the normalization of sexual politics reveals that minorities remain at the margins. I approached activists from QUEEROCRACY and immigration activist Felipe Baeza to discuss: What are the social issues young people care about ? What forms of activism do young people favor and what motivates them to organize? What forms of visuality do young queer activists use and how do these relate to the strategies of the previous generations?

AB  - Nightlife settings both facilitate urban sociality and act as sites of social conflict, however little research has focused on experience and encounter in these places. This paper addresses this gap in the context of night-time economic planning and recent research on encounter. The use of mobile methods in nightlife spaces is shown to garner a more nuanced understanding of how forays into planned night-time spaces are experienced and understood by people using those spaces. I argue that emplaced, mobile methods unveil complex narratives of place, revealing prejudices and discourses at play in place. These narratives begin to erode privileged images of the city shaped by increasingly neoliberal governance and other cultural intermediaries, and draw out the potential of these methods to improve the lived inclusivity of place.

TI  - Understanding the Humanities crisis: an argument for Humanities' national value
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - What justifies the negative perception of the Humanities? What justifies budget cuts and curricula changes in schools and universities that prejudice the Humanities? In this article I argue that what is meant to justify the crisis narrative as well as curricula and budget cuts is the following argument: education has national value if and only if it positively contributes to the economy. The Humanities do not and cannot positively contribute to the economy. Therefore, the Humanities fail to contribute anything of national value. Therefore, governments are justified in cutting the Humanities from curricula and reapportioning funding away from the Humanities. In addition to defending this argument as the argument against the Humanities, I argue that the first premise is false. I argue that there are non-profit-seeking national goods that the Humanities are ideally placed to meet and promote. Therefore, the argument against the Humanities fails.

AB  - The figure of the female student epitomized, for many German-speaking writers around 1900, the intellectual and social freedom supposedly enjoyed by the New Woman. After World War One, these freedoms were more likely to be represented by a white-collar worker or woman in public life, with university now being just one of the many possibilities beyond the domestic sphere. This comparative study of texts by women about female scientists examines how far the figure of the Akademikerin had lost her radical potential by the interwar era. The examples of pre-war fiction considered here (Aimee Duc's Sind es Frauen? and Ilse Frapan's Arbeit) foreshadow the politics of location as practised in the academy in the late twentieth century by questioning hierarchies, challenging women's outsider status, and carving out new space for collective endeavours. By contrast, in the two novels from the interwar era (Grete von Urbanitzky's Eine Frau erlebt die Welt and Vicki Baum's Stud. chem. Helene Willfuer), the scientific setting serves mostly to heighten the presentation of a gifted woman in the male domain' of science. Earlier prejudices about female students are reprised as a foil for the clever, life-affirming heroine, yet her emancipatory potential may be undermined by the ultimate emphasis on her maternal instinct.

AB  - BackgroundContact is seen as a key route to tackling stigma and discrimination. Contact theory states that the quality and type of contact, as well as circumstance of the contact experience, influence the effect of contact on prejudice. The majority of research in intellectual disabilities though has focused on contact as present or absent only.
   MethodA total of 1264 adult members of the UK general population completed measures of symptom recognition, social distance (as measure of external stigma) and causal beliefs in response to a diagnostically unlabelled vignette, depicting someone with intellectual disabilities.
   ResultsA nuanced contact variable, including frequency of contact and closeness and nature of the contact relationship, explained more of the variance in social distance, compared to the binary variable (contact as present or absent). Only the closeness of the relationship was individually predictive though, and the models explained only relatively small amounts of the variance. Structural equation modelling of contact, recognition, social distance and causal beliefs demonstrated that the model including the nuanced variable was an adequate fit for the data.
   ConclusionsFuture research aimed at increasing our understanding of intellectual disability stigma should avoid assessing contact as a binary variable only, but consider other factors, particularly the closeness of contact relationships. Anti-stigma interventions may benefit from focussing on causal attributions as a method of reducing stigma.

TI  - From homo oeconomicus to homo emotivus: The elusive quest for paternalism in the age of diminishing rationality
T2  - BETRIEBSWIRTSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND PRAXIS
LA  - English
AB  - Behavioral economics argues that if left free to identify and pursue their wellbeing, people will often fail to achieve it because the neoclassical axiom of perfect rationality is never met in practice. On the contrary, people's thinking is infected by a variety of biases and cognitive distortions and they are unable to escape from the unconscious universe of their own emotions and prejudices. Consequently, this is supposed to present an opportunity for a positive state intervention. The main message of the present paper is that there is a danger to throw out the free market baby with the neoclassical bath water. While it is true that people do not behave according to the prescriptions of perfect rationality models, the case for paternalism is no better now than before the import of psychology in economics. Judgment biases and emotional impulses notwithstanding, social planners do not enjoy a comparative advantage in allocating resources.

AB  - In 2005, in response to growing concern about the exposure of cases of wrongful conviction in China, the Institute of Evidence in the Law School of Renmin University embarked upon an "Empirical Study of Wrongful Convictions" that collected over 100 cases of wrongful conviction exposed by the media, analyzed representative cases and survey data, and held panel discussions to review research. It found that wrongful convictions are generally the result of several interconnected factors, mainly in the investigation stage of criminal proceedings. These factors include the "from confession to evidence" model of criminal investigation, the setting of inappropriately tight deadlines for solving criminal cases, the prejudicial collection of evidence, the misinterpretation of scientific evidence, and the continued use of torture to extract confessions. Acknowledging and avoiding such practices is a crucial step toward preventing wrongful convictions in China.

AB  - North Korea is waging psychological warfare, through the internet, to erode the morale of the South Korean combatants. This study aims to examine whether the widespread use of the internet among the South Korean combatants has a significant effect on their belief in rumors allegedly originating from North Korean propaganda, for two reasons. First, South Korea's psychological counter-operation has been accused of inducing South Korean combatants to promote hatred and prejudice against the progressive political parties that support North Korean regime, causing harm to South Korea's democracy. Second, there is little empirical research on the effects of South Korea's psychological counter-operation on the individual's rumor belief and transmission. Results from a survey conducted among 707 South Korean combatants indicate that military education aimed to refute North Korea's propaganda, statistically speaking, significantly decreased their belief in rumor, but it did not decrease the likelihood of rumor transmission. What was found to be conducive to rumor transmission was the individual's social relations. Our analysis implies that internet use has a significant effect on the belief in and transmission of North Korean propaganda, but its effect can be moderated by various intervening factors.

AB  - Background In this study, we investigated the powerlessness of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and described the structure of powerlessness that these individuals experienced. In order for patients to recover from this state, we recommend that they take steps to regain their power.
   Methods Fifteen Japanese adults with T1D participated in this study. Data were collected from all subjects between July 2013 and March 2014 via in-depth semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data analysis was conducted according to a grounded theory approach. Finally, the core category was identified, which allowed us to build a new powerlessness structure for T1D.
   Results The results suggested a core category, 'Wandering a tangled path,' comprising four categories, eight subcategories, and twenty-six concepts. These four categories were as follows: 'being burdened by T1D,' 'suffering from insulin-related troubles,' 'being unable to cope with difficulties in self-management,' and 'facing social prejudice.' In the state of powerlessness, negative emotional experiences snowballed, with patients feeling more and more depressed until they ultimately reached 'rock bottom.'
   Conclusion We found that as negative emotional experiences related to powerlessness increased, negative feelings intensified until the patients reached rock bottom. Powerlessness is like 'wandering a tangled path,' a state in which T1D patients struggle to cope with reality on their own when faced with both internal and external events. 'Wandering a tangled path' is at the core of powerlessness. A primary characteristic of the structure of powerlessness is suffering from confusing experiences. To help patients cope with T1D without being crushed by powerlessness, nurses must pay attention to signs of powerlessness. Powerlessness is not just an emotional state, but a combination of feelings, perceptions, and thoughts; therefore, it is important to comprehensively understand patients' narratives.

AB  - Objective In Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, members of the Bennet family are either sensible or silly, and males are under-represented. This study searches for an underlying medical diagnosis that explains these features.
   Design Very retrospective literature review.
   Participants Mrs Bennet, her five daughters (Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia), her brother (Mr Gardiner) and her sister (Mrs Phillips).
   Main outcome measures Family tree and associated phenotypes
   Methods The author read Pride and Prejudice. A Bennet family tree was constructed. The number of male and female descendants was analysed using a binomial model. For each character, evidence of behaviour was collected, and members of the Bennet family were categorised as either sensible or silly.
   Results Males are under-represented in Mrs Bennet's family. Assuming an equal probability of male or female offspring, this reaches statistical significance (binomial model, P=0.03). Approximately 50 % of females in the family are silly. Silly behaviour is more prevalent during social gatherings.
   Conclusions The family tree suggests an X-linked genetic disorder, fatal in utero or in early life to affected males, explaining the paucity of male offspring. Female carriers survive, but with cognitive difficulties, explaining the approximate 50-50 distribution of sensible and silly females in the family. The exacerbation of silliness during social gatherings may suggest an effect of protein intake, raising suspicions of a disorder of protein metabolism. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is one such condition. Unfortunately, there remain significant challenges in performing genetic testing on fictional characters, so definitive evidence remains elusive. Jane and Elizabeth Bennet do not show signs of the disorder. However, carriers may be asymptomatic; they should be offered genetic counselling before Bingley or Darcy offspring are considered.

AB  - Sexual racism can be thought of as a specific form of racial prejudice enacted in the context of sex and dating. It is a contentious issue among gay and bisexual men looking for partners online. This study draws upon 14 in-depth interviews conducted between August and October 2012 with gay and bisexual men of colour in Australia. Data were thematically analysed to identify interpretations and experiences of, and reactions to sexual racism online. Understandings of online sexual racism were diverse, ranging from clear ideas about racist and non-racist practices to more ambiguous and contextual interpretations. Nevertheless, all participants described experiences of sexual racism while seeking partners online, which were, in some cases, largely indistinguishable from generic forms of racism. Most described experiences of subtle racism, but there were also cases of blatant and aggressive racial prejudice. Finally, men reacted in a range of ways when confronted with online sexual racism, with strategies ranging from disconnection to adaptation through to confrontation. Our findings highlight that sexual racism - as an expression of racism generally - is an ongoing issue for men who seek out other men online, and that men engage in a range of strategies for mitigating the negative effects of racial prejudice in this domain.

KW  - Technology
AB  - Many practices of contemporary DJ-driven electronic dance music derive from 1970s club scenes in the United States, which were welcoming spaces for people who otherwise encountered prejudice for their gender identities and sexual orientations. Through their prominence in dance music literature, these scenes, along with British rave culture, have come to represent a broader conception of a global alternative dance music culture' that incorporates various communitarian ideologiesincluding non-discriminatory and non-patriarchal gender relations. In this paper I offer a critique of such celebratory interpretations. First, I suggest that these scenes, often framed as formative of dance music cultures worldwide, are exceptional rather than typical, and that their politics have been projected onto other scenes. Second, I highlight how troubling gender discrimination is present even in alternative' settings where participants are more conscious of political and social issues, including gender. I illustrate these points through interviews in a number of countries with women DJs who describe numerous instances of gender-related prejudice, and through interviews with men, who articulate some of these prejudices. The interviews reveal a series of dimensions of the gendering of DJ-oriented dance cultures, and how they are suffused with problematic attitudes towards gender. My research therefore challenges the celebratory interpretations of many DJ music scenes.

AB  - Objective: Wright (1983) described 20 "value-laden beliefs and principles" that form the foundational principles of rehabilitation psychology, and the education and training of rehabilitation psychologists necessitates that they acquire the specialty-specific knowledge and attitudes/values related to these principles. This article addresses 2 questions about how these principles can be taught in rehabilitation psychology training: (a) What are the core theories and evidence supporting these foundational principles, and what should be the content of a "core curriculum" for teaching these?; and (b) What is known about the most effective methods for teaching these foundational principles, including questions of how to teach values? Method: The foundational principles were grouped into 3 categories: individual psychological processes, social psychological processes, and values related to social integration. A literature review was conducted in these 3 categories, and the results are summarized and discussed. Results: A core curriculum is discussed for teaching about disability-specific individual psychological processes, social psychological processes, and values related to social integration, including methods to reduce group prejudice and promote values relevant to the foundational principles. Specific suggestions for training program content and methods are provided. Conclusions: It is hoped that effective teaching of Wright's (1983) value-laden beliefs and principles will help rehabilitation psychology trainers and trainees focus on the key knowledge and attitude-value competencies that are to be acquired in training.
   Impact and Implications
   This article reviews the existing literature relevant to teaching the foundational principles of rehabilitation psychology, both in terms of teaching content and teaching methods. It provides information regarding concepts and practices that can be used to effectively teach Wright's (1983) value-laden beliefs and principles, and to help rehabilitation psychology trainers and trainees focus on the key knowledge and attitude-value competencies that are to be acquired in training.

AB  - Human security as a people's perspective on security with a focus on human well-being and relationship-building offers promising alternative concepts to state-centered and structure-focused security strategies. Security is more than increasing weapons, fences and survey cameras. To our understanding, it is something else and involves entirely different mindsets. It demands a people's perspective on security in which citizenship includes the capacity to create secure surroundings. People can be supported to "learn" security and to focus on their capacities. The subjective dimensions of security, including a person's emotional management, can be trained.
   This is why we argue that three dimensions of training have to be integrated into educational approaches. First among these dimensions is tackling cultural violence through working on stereotypes and prejudices by delivering knowledge and information. Second is fostering knowledge about relationship-building and building relationships across the social divide. And third is strengthening the self-esteem of the citizens and focusing on their personal development and well-being. Hence, new approaches of experience-based learning and group work have to be integrated into the formal and informal curricula.
   Thus, we advocate for enriching formal and informal education with training modules in "peace and security"-training for everybody, so that our education of today makes us ready for the threats of tomorrow. We argue further that this can only be accomplished if experience-based methodological tools, such as interactive theater, are included in these trainings.

AB  - Objective: To explore the views of senior doctors on mental illness within the medical profession.
   Background: There has been increasing interest on the issue of doctors' mental health. However, there have been few qualitative studies on senior doctors' general attitude towards mental illness within the medical profession.
   Setting: Large North London teaching hospital.
   Participants: 13 hospital consultants and senior academic general practitioners.
   Methods: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and reflective work. The outcome measures were the themes derived from the thematic framework approach to analysis.
   Results: Four main themes were identified. (1) 'Doctors' attitudes to mental illness'-doctors felt that there remained a significant stigma attached to suffering from a mental illness within the profession. (2) 'Barriers to seeking help'-doctors felt that there were numerous barriers to seeking help such as negative career implications, being perceived as weak, denial and fear of prejudice. (3) 'Support'-doctors felt that the use of support depended on certainty concerning confidentiality, which for occupational health was not thought to be guaranteed. Confiding in colleagues was rare except among close friends. Supervision for all doctors was raised. (4) 'General Medical Council (GMC) involvement'-doctors felt that uneasy referring colleagues to the GMC and the appraisal and revalidation process was thought not to be thorough enough in picking up doctors with a mental illness.
   Conclusions: Owing to the small size of this study, the conclusions are limited; however, if the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they suggest that greater efforts are needed to destigmatise mental illness in the profession and improve support for doctors. Additional research should be carried out into doctors' views on occupational health services in managing doctors with mental illness, the provision of supervision for all doctors and the effectiveness of the current appraisal and revalidation process at identifying doctors with a mental illness.

AB  - Among minority members, positive contact with the majority was previously found to improve not only the attitudes toward the majority but also the attitudes toward minority outgroups (the secondary transfer effect; STE). However, the roles of negative intergroup contact and minority groups' social status in the STE have not been yet examined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the association between both positive and negative contact with the national majority group (Finns) and mutual attitudes among high-status Estonian (n = 171) and low-status Russian (n = 180) immigrants in Finland. Two mediators of the STE were tested: attitudes toward the majority (attitude generalization) and public collective self-esteem (diagonal hostility). While positive and negative STEs emerging via attitude generalization were expected to occur among both immigrant groups, the mediating effect of public collective self-esteem was assumed only for members of the low-status group. In both immigrant groups, the relationship between positive contact with the majority group and attitudes toward the other immigrant group was positive and indirect through more favorable attitudes toward majority group members. The same mechanism characterized negative contact, where the indirect effect was mediated by less positive attitudes toward Finns. As predicted, public collective self-esteem mediated the effects of positive and negative contact with majority group members on attitudes toward the other minority only among low-status Russian immigrants. The results call for the acknowledgement of different mechanisms explaining the STE among minority groups enjoying different social statuses in host society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dialects of English spoken in rural, Southern Appalachia are heavily stigmatized in mainstream American culture, and speakers of Appalachian dialects are often subject to prejudice and stereotypes which can be detrimental in educational settings. We explored the experiences of rural, Southern Appalachian college students and the role speaking a stigmatized dialect has in their interactions with others on campus. Semistructured interviews were conducted with students from rural, Southern Appalachia attending a 4-year university in a Southern city, and sociolinguistic analysis of participants' speech was performed to provide detailed linguistic description that helped explain the influence of language on these interactions. Findings suggest that interactions with peers and faculty are influenced by students' dialect on several levels. The findings have implications for improving diversity and inclusion programming on campus as well as highlighting the importance of research that considers language as a differentiating student characteristic in higher education research and practice.

AB  - Purpose: To use mini-ethnographies narrating patient illness to improve the cultural competence of the medical students.
   Methods: Between September 2013 and June 2015, all sixth-year medical students doing their internship at a medical center in eastern Taiwan were trained to write mini-ethnographies for one of the patients in their care. The mini-ethnographies were analyzed by authors with focus on the various aspects of cultural sensitivity and a holistic care approach.
   Results: Ninety-one students handed in mini-ethnographies, of whom 56 were male (61.5%) and 35 were female (38.5%). From the mini-ethnographies, three core aspects were derived: 1) the explanatory models and perceptions of illness, 2) culture and health care, and 3) society, resources, and health care. Based on the qualities of each aspect, nine secondary nodes were classified: expectations and attitude about illness/treatment, perceptions about their own prognosis in particular, knowledge and feelings regarding illness, cause of illness, choice of treatment method (including traditional medical treatments), prejudice and discrimination, influences of traditional culture and language, social support and resources, and inequality in health care.
   Conclusions: Mini-ethnography is an effective teaching method that can help students to develop cultural competence. It also serves as an effective instrument to assess the cultural competence of medical students.

AB  - This article shows accounts of Norwegian immigrants and their encounter with various ethnic groups in America including Native Americans, African-Americans, Chinese, Irish, and Yankees in the period between 1840 and 1870. The article presents several regions in the United States, namely the Upper Midwest, Texas, and California. The use of primary source material including newspapers, guidebooks and letters provide good insights into thoughts and attitudes, and not the least prejudice, among this Old immigrant group toward the ethnic "Other." The Norwegian immigrant group aimed at becoming good citizens through a negotiating process between the group, the dominant native-born American group and other ethnic groups in the United States. By characterizing several other ethnic groups based on race, Norwegian-Americans employed whiteness in a double negotiation, both tied to the creation of a Norwegian-American identity and in finding their place in the social hierarchy in America.

AB  - After people experience social rejection, one tactic to restore a sense of belonging is to selectively attend to and readily perceive cues that connote acceptance. The multimotive model of responses to rejection suggests that contextual features of the rejection are important determinants of how people are motivated to respond. According to this model, when rejection is construed as pervasive and chronic, people will be less likely to adopt strategies that promote belonging. Across two studies, we found that chronic rejection-in the context of stigmatization-predicted a slower response time to smiling faces and less recognition of affiliation-related words as compared to a nonstigmatized control group. These results suggest that, unlike more transitory forms of rejection, stigmatization leads to slower detection of signs of acceptance. These responses may hinder belonging repair and thus have important negative implications for health and well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depression is a global concern and it is well known that certain segments of the population are at greater risk. Sexual minorities are recognized as being more likely to suffer from depression due to social stigma and prejudice. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between sexual orientation and depression in the Canadian population.
   METHODS: The study used the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health data. The sample comprised 24,788 Canadians living in the ten provinces. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of depression and sexual orientation.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for known risk factors for depression, there was no difference in prevalence of past 12-month or lifetime major depressive episode between sexual minorities and heterosexuals. Bisexuals did have a near significant trend towards higher prevalence of both past 12-month and lifetime depression as a combined group, but there were not clear differences when stratified by sex.
   CONCLUSION: This study supports important emerging trends in the relationship between sexual orientation and depression. Research on the mental health of sexual minority people must take into account differences between sexual minority groups and avoid aggregating mental health disorders into broad categories. These findings have implications for public health planning and clinical recommendations.

AB  - Does government stability shift the way White and Black Americans represent and make voting decisions about political candidates? Participants judged how representative lightened, darkened, and unaltered photographs were of a racially ambiguous candidate ostensibly running for political office (Studies 1-3). When the governmental system was presented as stable, White participants who shared (vs. did not share) the candidate's political beliefs rated a lightened photo as more representative of the candidate, and Black participants who shared (vs. did not share) the candidate's political beliefs rated a darkened photo as more representative (Studies 1-3). However, under conditions of instability, both Whites and Blacks who shared (vs. did not share) the candidate's political beliefs rated a lightened photo as more representative (Study 3). Representations of (Studies 2 and 3) and actual differences in (Studies 4a and 4b) skin tone predicted intentions to vote for candidates, as a function of government stability and participants' race. Further evidence suggested that system stability shifted the motivations that guided voting decisions (Study 4a and 4b). When the system was stable, the motivation to enhance one's group predicted greater intentions to vote for lighter skinned candidates among Whites, and greater intentions to vote for darker skinned candidates among Blacks. When the system was unstable, however, lacking confidence in the sociopolitical system predicted intentions to vote for lighter skinned candidates among both Whites and Blacks. Implications for political leadership and social perception are discussed.

AB  - Did Italian anti-Slavism at the at the turn of the 19th and 20th century turn into racism? Or did the Fascist ideology, which was formed in Italy's eastern border after World War I, merely adopt prejudices against Slovenes and Croats that had been aired and spread from the second half of the 19th century onwards by the Italian nationalist discourse? We searched for answers to these questions both in texts written by liberal-national irredentist authors but also in works by ideologists of the Italian fascism in the border area, and promoters of forced Italianisation of the Slovene and Croatian population living in the former Austrian Littoral, i.e. in the Venezia Giulia, in the area which was after the end of World War I annexed to the Kingdom of Italy.
   The rise of the Slovene national community in Gorizia and Trieste, as well as that of the Croatian community in Istrian and Dalmatian cities at the end of the 19th century, resulted in the spread of fear of the Slavic invasion, particularly among the irredentist intelligentsia. Ruggero Timeus (1892-1915), the initiator of the "new irredentism", anticipated Italian supremacy in the entire Adriatic. According to him, the Adriatic question was to be solved outside of Austria with Italy's return to the former Venetian territories, whereupon Italy would become the sole ruler of the Adriatic. Unlike his colleagues in the publication La Voce (Stuparich, Slataper, Vivante), he was convinced that a reconciliation with the German and Slavic world was not possible. He considered the national struggle to be the only important phenomenon in the Venezia Giulia, as there could be no other common interest outside of it. Timeus stated in the periodical L'Idea Nazionale that inequality among members of the Italian race and individuals of the Slavic race was self-evident and that conflicts between them were unavoidable. The national struggle, which is understood as a fate that could not be avoided, is complete with the disappearance of one of the conflicting races. The foundation of Timeus' anti-Slavic paradigm was the fear of being surrounded and dominated, the same fear is typical of the French nationalism at the end of the 19th century and was defined as the essence of the racist ideology by Herve Le Bras. Timeus feared the Slavic invasion, the attrition of the Italian capability of assimilation, loss of monopoly in Italian schools, the Slavic infiltration, which altered Trieste's "true" Italian nature. His political programme, which was criticised by his colleagues in La Voce, received a warm reception in irredentist circles, it was particularly well received by nationalists, who in Italy equally frowned upon the Italian mission in countries of the eastern Adriatic and the Italian conquest of Africa.
   Timeus' political writing set ideological foundations for Italy's imperialistic policy in the Balkans and became the main basis for the policy of the regime in the eastern border, which after Mussolini's rise to power led to the abolishment of national rights of theSlovene and Croatian population and, subsequently, to the suppression of any attempt of its defence. In these writings, Timeus praises the supremacy of the Italian civilisation and justifies the conquest of the Balkans. They became reference points for ideologists of Fascism in the border area, e.g. Attilio Tamaro, who in his work La lotta delle razze nell'Europa danubiana (1923) stated that the territorially limited conflict between the Italian and Slavic race would become a general one. Timeus' approach is clearly noticeable also in the Fascist journalism in the border area of the thirties, which in articles such as were those written by Giuseppe Cobol strived for a radical solution of the question of ethnic minorities in the Venezia Giulia. It stated that it not only favoured various forms of forced assimilation but also methods for a definite removal of that part of the Slovene population from its territory - teachers, priests, lawyers, who were considered to be an enemy and posed too great a threat to the Italian supremacy.

AB  - This paper focuses on determinants of public attitudes in Israel toward two policy questions. First, should immigration policy measures be more restrictive toward overseas labor migrants? Secondly, should overseas labor migrants be replaced with Palestinian workers? Based on an attitudinal survey administered to a representative sample of the Israeli population, the findings indicate that support for a restrictive immigration policy is quite prevalent among Israelis. However, the survey reveals only moderate consent for replacing overseas labor migrants with Palestinian commuters. Attitudes toward a restrictive immigration policy are explained by the perceived threat posed by overseas labor migrants to social and economic interests. This threat is explained by the respondents' socio-economic characteristics. Attitudes toward the replacement policy are partially explained by the sense of threat to the Jewish character of the state posed by overseas migrants, but are also attributed to several personal characteristics. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scholarship on homophobia has been critiqued for being individualistic and psychological, failing to account for structural inequalities, experiences of homophobia and discursive manifestations of homophobia. This Economic and Social Research Council funded study attempts to address some of these concerns by focusing on the experiences of lesbians, gay men and bisexuals (LGBs) in relation to bullying, harassment and discrimination in the British workplace. We examine what homophobia is understood to be and how psychological and organisational discourses make it difficult to make sense of negative experiences and how anti-homosexual attitudes and work environments are sustained and left unchallenged through the claim 'it's not personal'. Drawing on theories of selective incivility and modern discrimination, we illustrate how ambiguous anti-homosexual sentiments are, and argue that the term 'homophobia' not only prevents people from challenging negative experiences, but it further masks inequalities based on sexuality at work.

AB  - Psychopathy has a long history in both criminal forensic psychology research and clinical practice, with a diverse range of anti-social attitudes and behaviours regularly found to coexist with psychopathy. Racist attitudes are considered anti-social and share several commonalities with psychopathic personality traits, including in their development and their manifestation. Both psychopathy and racism have significant and pervasive detrimental impacts on society; enhancing understandings of each construct and the potential ways to reduce their societal impact would therefore be useful. Using two measures of racist attitudes, the present study aimed to provide the first exploration of psychopathic personality traits and racist attitudes in 402 adolescents and adults (M = 23.24 years, SD = 9.72 years) from the Australian community. The results provide strong support for the existence of a relationship between psychopathy and racism, and provide additional validity evidence for RACES as an effective measure of racist attitudes in Australia. These findings provide impetus for future work into racism and psychopathy, and highlight the potential for integrating existing knowledge about both constructs to address the impacts of each simultaneously. This research also underscores the merit of further research on the relationship between criminal behaviour and racist attitudes.

AB  - Post-disaster reconstruction relies on, and is shaped by, the good intentions of states, non-governmental organizations, and donors. These intentions, however, are inescapably framed by historical circumstances and cultural values. Consequently, post-disaster interventions can reinforce patterns of prejudice, injustice, and disadvantage that were entrenched in pre-disaster settings. Focusing on the experiences of Indigenous Rukai communities in southern Taiwan during recovery and reconstruction following Typhoon Morakot in 2009, this article explores the challenges faced in addressing Indigenous-specific concerns in post-disaster reconstruction and community development. We argue that institutional capacity (and capacity deficits) and the procedural vulnerability created in post-disaster responses are components of the risk landscape which require greater attention to diverse cultural values, protocols, and experiences in fostering resilient and inclusive disaster recovery approaches. In Taiwan, the particular complexities of Indigenous geographies, colonial and postcolonial circumstances, and contemporary political dynamics make developing approaches that are respectful of Indigenous cultural values, social aspirations, and political processes not only more difficult but also more important in shaping post-disaster community at multiple scales. Attentiveness to these values, aspirations, and processes generates opportunities for decreasing vulnerability to the extraordinary and the everyday disasters that communities confront.

AB  - This paper explores Shakespeare's literary and theatrical devices used in Romeo and Juliet to overcome the bias against the lovers inherent in Elizabethan mores.The Elizabethans might need more convincing than us because of their inbred prejudice against secret marriages for love. To divert the attention of the audience from concentrating upon the plight of Juliet's parents, which of course would have ruined his design, Shakespeare employs stagecraft in such an unobtrusive way that the nature of the accomplishment of its goal lends itself to being misunderstood or undetected.

AB  - In order to check whether (un)civilised behaviour can be a valid indigenous intergroup comparison dimension for Chinese people, three studies were conducted based on stereotypic explanatory bias (SEB). Study 1 examined the media representation of Chinese and Western (un) civilised behaviours, and the SEB results suggested ingroup derogation of Chinese people regarding civilised behaviour. Study 2 aimed to use a more empirical approach to further analyse Chinese intergroup bias for civilised behaviour at both implicit and explicit levels. Chinese participants' SEB results indicated ingroup derogation and outgroup favouritism were at the implicit level; however, ingroup favouritism and outgroup derogation were at the explicit level. Study 3 was designed to examine how stereotypes that were verified in Study 2 would be changed by manipulating the presentation of extreme, stereotype-relevant information in the form of an internet blog. These findings suggest that (un) civilised behaviour can be a valid indigenous intergroup comparison dimension for Chinese people who perceive themselves as a disadvantaged group compared to Westerners on this dimension. Finally, theoretical contribution and practical implications for social change are discussed.

AB  - Researchers studying a range of psychological phenomena (e.g., theory of mind, emotion, stereotyping and prejudice, interpersonal attraction, etc.) sometimes employ photographs of people as stimuli. In this paper, we introduce the Chicago Face Database, a free resource consisting of 158 high-resolution, standardized photographs of Black and White males and females between the ages of 18 and 40 years and extensive data about these targets. In Study 1, we report pretesting of these faces, which includes both subjective norming data and objective physical measurements of the images included in the database. In Study 2 we surveyed psychology researchers to assess the suitability of these targets for research purposes and explored factors that were associated with researchers' judgments of suitability. Instructions are outlined for those interested in obtaining access to the stimulus set and accompanying ratings and measures.

AB  - Posthumous diagnoses are not uncommonly given to notorious public and historical figures by applying retrospectively, and typically in the absence of the individual being diagnosed, contemporary diagnostic criteria. Although this may be relatively easy and free of consequences when it concerns clear-cut medical conditions, it may have unintended repercussions in the case of psychiatric disorders by creating myths and perpetuating stigma. The case of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is a typical example where a somewhat facile and almost syllogistic application of perhaps over-inclusive criteria may have contributed to the legend of solitary murderers as possibly suffering from an autism spectrum condition. Although there may be an understandable human need to explain abominable and heinous behaviors, the lack of the possibility to verify a diagnostic theory and the ill-advised attempt to make a diagnosis fit may de facto be the basis of prejudice and profiling that do not correspond to clinical reality. Although there is no doubt that the brain is the organ of behavior, the authors caution against a budding neo-Lombrosian approach to crime and criminality and against the all too common use of widely differing terms in the study of deviance, such as crime, delinquency, and aggression, the operational use of which, often used interchangeably even in association studies, often erroneously leads to further confusion.

TI  - The impact of biologic therapy in chronic plaque psoriasis from a societal perspective: an analysis based on Italian actual clinical practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - BURDEN
KW  - COST
AB  - Objective Psoriasis is one of the most common forms of chronic dermatitis, affecting 2-3% of the worldwide population. It has a serious effect on the way patients perceive themselves and others, thereby prejudicing their quality of life and giving rise to a significant deterioration in their psycho-physical well-being; it also poses greater difficulties for them in leading a normal social life, including their ability to conduct a normal working life. All the above-mentioned issues imply a cost for the society. This study proposes to evaluate the impact on societal costs for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis with biologics (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) in the Italian clinical practice.
   Method A prospective observational study has been conducted in 12 specialized centres of the Psocare network, located throughout Italy. Direct and indirect costs (as well as the health-related quality of life of patients with plaque psoriasis undergoing biologic treatments) have been estimated, while the societal impact has been determined using a cost-utility approach.
   Results Non-medical and indirect costs account for as much as 44.97% of the total cost prior to treatment and to 6.59% after treatment, with an overall 71.38% decrease. Adopting a societal perspective in the actual clinical practice of the Italian participating centres, the ICER of biologic therapies for treating plaque psoriasis amounted to (sic)18634.40 per QALY gained - a value far from the (sic)28656.30 obtained by adopting a third-party payer perspective.
   Conclusion Our study confirms that chronic psoriasis subjects patients to a considerable burden, together with their families and caregivers, stressing how important it is to take the societal perspective into consideration during the appraisal process. Besides, using data derived from Italian actual practice, treatment with biologics shows a noteworthy benefit in social terms.

AB  - It is well known that emotions intersect with obvious social categories (e.g., race), influencing both how targets are categorized and the emotions that are read from their faces. Here, we examined the influence of emotional expression on the perception of less obvious group memberships for which, in the absence of obvious and stable physical markers, emotion may serve as a major avenue for group categorization and identification. Specifically, we examined whether emotions are embedded in the mental representations of sexual orientation and political affiliation, and whether people may use emotional expressions to communicate these group memberships to others. Using reverse correlation methods, we found that mental representations of gay and liberal faces were characterized by more positive facial expressions than mental representations of straight and conservative faces (Study 1). Furthermore, participants were evaluated as expressing more positive emotions when enacting self-defined "gay" and "liberal" versus "straight" and "conservative" facial expressions in the lab (Study 2). In addition, neutral faces morphed with happiness were perceived as more gay than when morphed with anger, and when compared to unmorphed controls (Study 3). Finally, we found that affect facilitated perceptions of sexual orientation and political affiliation in naturalistic settings (Study 4). Together, these studies suggest that emotion is a defining characteristic of person construal that people tend to use both when signaling their group memberships and when receiving those signals to categorize others.

AB  - This study focuses on the cultural consumer environment of brands considered as nostalgic. The research questions are thus the following: what is the impact of culture on the consumer relationship with brands considered as nostalgic? In which cases are these relationships positive, and in which cases are they negative? To answer these questions, a longitudinal data collection was conducted, consisting of interviewing the same sample of respondents three times, at more or less one-year intervals. The results were analysed taking into account three dimensions of culture: time, place and social aspects. In the time-based approach, brands are associated with traditional celebrations and rites of passage. Thus, they give rise to traditional purchase' and consumer loyalty. In the place-based approach, brands evoke original authenticity and myths. They offer protection to reduce perceived risks and therefore facilitate consumers' trust. In the social approach, brands are associated with symbolic icons and attract communities of fans. Finally, this article shows that culture involves sweeter rather than bitter nostalgic brand relationships. This article brings to light four cases when the consumer cultural environment may induce a rejection of the nostalgic brand: (1) the corrupted' brand; (2) the immoral' brand; (3) the precarious' brand; and (4) the stereotypical' brand. It shows that only one case - the corrupted' brand - may be particularly prejudicial due to its unwelcome role in History.

T2  - TEXTILE HISTORY
LA  - English
KW  - KASHMIR
AB  - Indian Cashmere shawls were costly accessories in nineteenth-century Britain, and they were 'imitated' in Edinburgh, Norwich and Paisley. This article argues that shawls were at the centre of a key debate within the design reform movement, which viewed imitations as clumsy copies of a perfectly designed textile. It examines Victorian texts such as design reformers' publications and works of fiction, to suggest that their understanding of shawls that imitated Indian designs was linked, in part, to class prejudices. Paisley shawls' stereotyping as an article emblematic of bad taste and a lower-class desire for social mobility was thus not limited to the writings of a small coterie of design reformers, but was found also reflected in works of best-selling writers such as Charles Dickens, Walter Scott and Wilkie Collins.

AB  - This qualitative study investigates underprivileged students' perceptions of their future, their health, and the relevance of a career counseling process. Interviews regarding career guidance were conducted during a workshop with nine eleventh-grade students from a public high school in Brazil's capital. The data were analyzed according to Gonzalez-Rey's constructive-interpretive method and three zones of senses emerged from this process: (1) the need to offer a supportive and safe space, (2) the challenges faced by participants and facilitators, and (3) the benefits from the intervention. The results suggested that this population has specific needs beyond career-related needs. They have limited sources of leisure and suffer from cultural and socio-economic prejudices.

TI  - "Red Mecca"-The Communist University for Laborers of the East (KUTV): Iranian Scholars and Students in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s
T2  - IRANIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The Communist University for Laborers of the East (KUTV), established in Moscow in 1921 and closed in 1938, presents a unique experiment in Soviet Orientalism. KUTV was the first communist educational institution set up specifically for students from the Orient to study their own countries in their native languages through a Marxist lens. Its purpose was not only to train teachers and revolutionaries for work in their native countries but to bring about a paradigm shift in the study of the East. Orientalism was to be freed from the imperialist prejudices of the past by redistributing the tools of Orientalist scholarship to Orientals themselves and by emphasizing contemporary social and economic history over an idealized and nationalistic antiquity. Iranians made up a strong presence at KUTV among both students and teachers, some of whom returned to Iran to spread learning and revolution, while others remained in the Soviet Union as scholars of Iran, influencing the development of Soviet Orientalism and often serving simultaneously in the Soviet political apparatus. With their students, they produced research and compiled massive collections of reference materials that formed the foundation for future Soviet scholarship and foreign policy. By the second half of the 1920s, KUTV developed into one of the most important centers of Soviet Orientalism, spawning a parallel Research Institute (NIA) that offered graduate programs and published its own periodical, Revolutionary East. With its aim of empowering the oppressed while simultaneously projecting Soviet influence, its attempt to rise above nationalist conceptions while at times succumbing to them, and the repression of its faculty in the Stalinist purges, KUTV exhibits many of the contradictions of the Soviet project itself. Among other sources, this paper uses Soviet case files on Iranian students and teachers at KUTV to shed light on their motivations and backgrounds.

AB  - Previous research revealed that one way by which members of minority groups resist disadvantage is through strategic self-group distancing by evaluating this group negatively, describing themselves according to outgroup stereotypes and supporting the status hierarchy, hereby limiting societal change. Drawing upon recent work on the Queen Bee phenomenon among women at work, we explain self-group distancing as a coping response of low identified minority employees who experience social identity threat. Whereas queen bee behavior is often discussed as a response typical for women, new experimental data are presented revealing similar responses among ethnic minority employees. In parallel to queen bees, low identified Hindustanis reported less positive ingroup affect and presented themselves as more stereotypically Dutch when reminded of ethnic biasbut not in a control condition. This suggests that the Queen Bee phenomenon exemplifies a more generic individual mobility response to group disadvantage experienced by minority groups at work.

AB  - Do people attribute emotions differently to members of various social groups? If so, do these differences have any bearing on formal and informal forms of social recognition? Using data from a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine whether American heterosexuals differentially attribute love to lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples. We also examine the relationship between how in love lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples are perceived to be and attitudes toward (1) granting them partnership benefits (formal rights); (2) the acceptability of their public displays of affection (informal privileges); and (3) marriage. Three main findings suggest that heterosexuals differentially attribute love to different types of romantic couples and that these differences are related to willingness to grant social recognition. First, gay couples are viewed as less loving than both heterosexual and lesbian couples; lesbian couples are seen as equally loving as heterosexual couples. Second, perceptions of love are related to willingness to grant social recognition. Third, perceptions of love matter more for gay and, to a lesser extent, lesbian couples than for heterosexual couples regarding informal privileges and marriage. In contrast, love matters equally for same-sex and heterosexual couples regarding formal rights. The results show that gay couples are penalized most in terms of perceptions of love and social recognition, whereas lesbians occupy a liminal space between heterosexual and gay couples. Collectively, these findings suggest that sexual identity and gender shape emotional attributions, which in turn play a key role in explaining inequalities that same-sex couples face.

AB  - Specific social categories differently affect the motivation to resist the disadvantage among the members of low-status groups. While subgroup identity instigates collective action, common identity inhibits support for societal change. We propose that individuals who construe their disadvantage in terms of group relative deprivation (GRD) rather than individual relative deprivation are less prone to the demobilizing force of common identity salience. The moderating role of GRD in responding to superordinate category (i.e., Poles) was demonstrated in two studies conducted in the Polish LGBTQ community. In Study 1 (N = 125), GRD moderated the effect that common identity (relative to subgroup identity) exerted on in-group pride, which translated into support for social change. Study 2 (N = 165) confirmed GRD as the moderator of common identity influence. Both studies showed that LGBTQs who exhibited low but not high level of GRD were susceptible to the quieting effect of superordinate category.

AB  - Herder's This Too a Philosophy of History for the Formation of Humanity (1774) is known for its pioneering use of the word 'nationalism', and for its scathing critique of various Enlightened narratives of European history and their corresponding ethical views (cosmopolitanism). This article seeks to reconstruct this critique and Herder's account of the process of civilization, so as to uncover the possible moral and political message of this work. Tracing the evolution of Herder's early philosophy of history, and positioning it in his contemporary debates on the development of the human mind and sociability, the article argues that Herder posited a distinctive natural dynamic of mental and moral development in human history. For Herder, human languages and thinking gradually became ever more abstract and refined, which, however, led to the weakening of the intensity of feeling and undermined the efficacy of moral motivation. In This Too a Philosophy, Herder specified the spiralling pattern of European history, identifying two crucial cycles in it: in the first stage, nations followed only the natural dynamic of mental and moral development, while the second and 'higher' one was initiated through the adoption of the universalistic Christian religion by the barbarous Germanic tribes conquering the Roman territories. Herder's famous defence of national prejudices and antagonism concerned the first (pre-Christian) period specifically, while he identified the rise of a Christian ideal of the 'brotherhood of nations' in the second. With the continuing progress of abstract thinking and social differentiation in modern Europe, however, various modem moral and political pathologies emerged, including the development of an entirely abstract 'love of mankind'. While remaining pessimistic about the chances for Europe's moral and political regeneration, Herder advocated the pursuit of a distinctively modern 'pure' and sociable virtue, which would seek to avoid the various pitfalls of abstract cosmopolitanism.

AB  - The Festival of Britain in 1951 was a political and cultural landmark, a Labour government announcement of the 'brave new world' that was coming after war-time sufferings and continuing post-war austerity The Festival has been much studied by social, political, architectural, design historians and others. Relatively little attention has been given, however, to the thirteen-volume series of About Britain regional guidebooks, an integral part of the Festival itself but one by its very utilitarian purposes designed to outlast it. The origins, rationale, planning and design, editing, writing, publication and content of the guidebooks are carefully explained here. Above all they are analysed as a deliberate exercise in cultural mapping. Further attention is given to the often unselfconscious attitudes, assumptions, priorities, gender bias and prejudices embedded within their discourse.

AB  - Americans have become increasingly tolerant of controversial outgroups in results from the nationally representative General Social Survey (1972-2012, N = 35,048). Specifically, adults in the 2010s (versus the 1970s and 1980s) were more likely to agree that Communists, homosexuals, the anti-religious, militarists, and those believing Blacks are genetically inferior should be allowed to give a public speech, teach at a college, or have a book in a local library. Cross-classification hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses separating the effects of time period, cohort/generation, and age show that these trends were driven by both a linear time period effect and a curvilinear cohort effect, with those born in the late 1940s (Boomers) the most tolerant when age and time period were controlled. Tolerance of homosexuals increased the most, and tolerance of racists the least. The increase in tolerance is positively correlated with higher levels of education and individualistic attitudes, including rejecting traditional social rules, but is negatively correlated with changes in empathy.

AB  - Hierarchy and dominance are ubiquitous. Because social hierarchy is early learned and highly rehearsed, the value of hierarchy enjoys relative ease over competing egalitarian values. In six studies, we interfere with deliberate thinking and measure endorsement of hierarchy and egalitarianism. In Study 1, bar patrons' blood alcohol content was correlated with hierarchy preference. In Study 2, cognitive load increased the authority/hierarchy moral foundation. In Study 3, low-effort thought instructions increased hierarchy endorsement and reduced equality endorsement. In Study 4, ego depletion increased hierarchy endorsement and caused a trend toward reduced equality endorsement. In Study 5, low-effort thought instructions increased endorsement of hierarchical attitudes among those with a sense of low personal power. In Study 6, participants' thinking quickly allocated more resources to high-status groups. Across five operationalizations of impaired deliberative thought, hierarchy endorsement increased and egalitarianism receded. These data suggest hierarchy may persist in part because it has a psychological advantage.

TI  - Why Do We Need to Bother? Public Library Services for LGBTQI People
T2  - LIBRARY TRENDS
LA  - English
AB  - In considering social justice, many commentators overlook (or disregard) the needs of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer/questioning, or intersex (LGBTQI), assuming, for example, that they do not require any particular support or recognition, or that they "self-exclude" by "choosing" to be LGBTQI. This article aims to challenge these perceptions. Young (and not-so-young) people may find it easier to come out today and, indeed, the necessity to have life framed by coming-out stories may be fading. Nevertheless, we know that many people still struggle and still have to face hostility, threats, even violence. Suicide rates among young LGBTQI people, often the result of bullying, are unacceptably high. The cultural sector, including public libraries, can play a huge part in combating prejudice by providing safe, informed (and informative) spaces where people can explore who they are, and be who they are as well. However, not all public libraries understand this, or want to play this role. This article identifies some of the needs and demands of LGBTQI people, demonstrates the good practice that public libraries have developed, and examines gaps where this is not happening. The focus will be primarily on public libraries' work in the UK. It looks at some of the key background issues (prejudice against LGBTQI people, for example), then focuses on the ways in which the public library can intervene, concluding with practical examples of the range of work that is being undertaken and some suggestions of what still needs to be done.

AB  - In a series of experiments we examined heterosexuals' reactions to the timing of disclosure of a gender-matched confederate's same-sex dating partner. Disclosure occurred in a naturalistic context-that is, it occurred when meeting, or expecting to soon meet, a same-sex attracted individual, who voluntarily shared this information with the participant as a natural part of a broader topic of discussion. The confederate, when disclosing early rather than later, was approached more closely (Prestudy) and liked more (Studies 1-2). Those experiencing early disclosure, compared with later, were less drawn to topics of lower intimacy (Study 1), were happier and more excited about meeting the confederate, and more likely to choose to be alone with the confederate for a one-on-one discussion (Study 2). Further, women experiencing early disclosure were more willing to introduce the same-gender confederate to their friends (Study 2). The benefits of knowing sooner, rather than later, continued to apply even when participants were given further time to process the disclosure. To explore the underlying reasons for the more favorable experiences of upfront disclosure, we examined participants' memory of the information shared by the confederate (Study 3). Results revealed that those who experienced delayed disclosure were more likely to incorrectly recall and negatively embellish information related to the confederate's sexual orientation, suggesting that early disclosure resulted in a reduced tendency to focus on the confederate's sexuality as a defining feature. These positive findings for early timing are discussed in light of previous studies that have found benefits for delayed disclosure and those that have failed to investigate the effects of timing of 'coming out' under conditions of contact.

AB  - Contact-based anti-stigma programs delivered by people with lived experience yields stigma change. This study examined psychometrics and sensitivity of the California Assessment of Stigma Change (CASC). CASC assesses prejudicial beliefs, affirming attitudes, and willingness to seek mental healthcare. Four samples, two high school groups, college students, and hotel desk clerks, completed CASC immediately before and after a contact-based program. Two samples completed follow-up: one of the high school groups and the college students. CASC assesses stigma with a 9-item Attribution Questionnaire (AQ9), personal empowerment with a 3-item scale (ES), recovery orientation with a 3-item scale (RS), and psychological help seeking willingness with a 6-item questionnaire (CSQ). Internal consistencies ranged adequate to satisfactory for AQ9, ES, and CSQ. Concurrent validity was partially supported. Change sensitivity was demonstrated among at least half of each construct's analyses. CASC seems a psychometrically valid way to efficiently monitor attitudinal and care seeking intentions changes. Outcome monitoring can strengthen contact-based anti-stigma programs, an emerging evidence-based practice.

AB  - This paper describes an action research study that illustrates the potential of group discussion to enhance reflexivity on professionals' theoretical and technical models that foster a change in their practice when facing contemporary family diversity. Focus groups were carried out with thirty-five experienced professionals (females, N = 22; males, N = 12; mean age = 45 years) working in the Italian Health Care System (IHCS). Group discussions centered on clinical cases involving same-sex families, an emerging phenomenon in Italy and still subject to social stigma. Our results showed that group discussion allowed professionals to develop a communicative process through which they changed their initial prejudiced positions. This process was named the group re-orienting process and four progressive phases were recognized: (a) defense (b) familiarization with novelty (c) self-reflection and (d) generation. Each phase is described in detail using extracts from focus group data. Implications for training and intervention are discussed.

AB  - Citizenship has been associated with members of a community that engage in paid work (Painter and Philo, 1995; Desforges et al., 2005). This idea constructs remunerated work as a key determinant of citizenship (Brown and Patrick, 2012). The outcome in terms of mobility is the provision of infrastructure and technologies that potentially privilege the movement of those considered to be 'productive bodies' between their workplaces and homes at specific times, while disadvantaging disabled people and their everyday mobility practices (Imrie, 2000). This paper explores the ways in which the formation of citizenship and movement, as embodied and sensory practices, and wheelchair use may be constrained by infrastructures, means of transport and social practices that are often insensitive to the needs of disabled people. In particular, the paper contributes to fleshing out the notion of 'embodied citizenship' in relation to women wheelchair users and the role played by their devices and other mobility technologies in their citizenship struggles. The paper is divided into three sections. First, I set out a framework for exploring the relationships between citizenship, mobility and disability with a focus on wheelchair users. Second, drawing on original qualitative research data, the paper concentrates on the embodied mobility practices of women wheelchair users who live in Greater London and Leicestershire, United Kingdom. Here I highlight the prejudices, barriers, discrimination and exclusions that they face, which, potentially, impact on their claims to citizenship. Finally, the paper concludes that an approach based on the subjective experience of the wheelchair user in context is useful in revealing the complexities of citizenship. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Legitimising and Contesting Exclusion: Discussions about Shiminhua in Urban China
T2  - CHINA-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - In the past decade, Chinese officials, scholars and journalists have made the term "shiminhua" a buzzword in discussions of the country's urbanisation. An innovation of writers from the People's Republic of China (PRC), the term relates to the problem of turning new urban residents into full members of the community, in legal, sociological, attitudinal and/or economic senses. The term is cited to legitimate or contest policies directed at those on the margins of cities. Rather than offering a definition, or even a single English translation, this article tries to make sense of shiminhua by linking it to several themes. Laden with ambiguities, problematic assumptions and elite prejudice, the term is of little analytic value. Nonetheless, rhetoric about shiminhua cuts to the core of conflicts over legitimate membership in urban communities. The term's use offers a window into debates over major issues in China's political and social development, including the extent of police control, legitimation of social stratification and the sort of welfare regime the country should build.

TI  - Putting Policy into Performance Studies?
T2  - PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - With this essay, my hope is to contribute to recent conversations about art and its supporting infrastructures - discussions that are working, I believe, to unsettle a kind of anti-institutional prejudice that has haunted performance studies. As the rather polemical title hints, I enter these discussions by revisiting an older set of debates that arose in the annals of cultural studies in the 1990s. I argue that Tony Bennett's controversial claim - that we put policy into cultural studies - unintentionally invites us to examine how policy' itself might continue to serve as a generative term to further unravel unhelpful dichotomies and persistent predispositions. By tracking a critical genealogy of these so-called policy debates,' I contend also that we move beyond the acknowledgement - or avowal - that arts of institutional thinking are essential in and for performance studies. Ultimately, I want to suggest that performance as policy has a unique capacity to inspire experimental modes of social organization and perhaps even an overhaul of our institutions of public life. My hope is that an examination of the ways a notion of what I call institutional (dis)avowal' is already embedded in the history of contentious conversations about culture and administration will both bolster this claim and open avenues for further inquiry.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGIST

AB  - The Untouchables in India are still at the bottom of the caste hierarchy in terms of poverty index, unemployment, housing and health matters. The caste system has reproduced itself in the Indian diaspora (indeed in people of South Asian origin) in the UK and elsewhere in the West through endogamy, early socialisation, social networking and, paradoxically, places of worship.
   There is evidence that the Untouchables are facing a double discrimination - high-caste prejudice and white racism. They are, however, raising their caste status through education, socioeconomic advancement and 'religiosity'. This is in line with the predictions of modern theories of identity formation and its functioning in the social world.

AB  - Two experiments investigated effects of perceived ingroup acculturation norms. Majority members read an article about their peers having specific acculturation preferences for minority members in public and private domains, which was the experimental manipulation. Dependent variables were liking for ingroup members, majority members' own preference for culture maintenance relative to their preference for culture adoption for public and private domains, and their investment in cultural maintenance relative to their investment in contact with the minority. In England (N=237) we focused on attitudes towards Muslims, while in Chile (N=291) the focus was on attitudes towards the indigenous Mapuche. Results reflect the political climates of the two countries: Chileans showed more reactance against their peers demanding assimilation from minority members than English people did - by increasing their preference for maintenance relative to adoption. Yet, in both countries, peers who demanded assimilation were liked the least. In England, responses on public acculturation preferences and acculturative investment were the same, whereas they differed in Chile. Overall, Chileans valued culture maintenance of Mapuche more than culture adoption for both public and private domains. For English people however, this was only the case for the private domain, while for the public domain they had opposite overall preferences. Finally, regardless of country, the more people preferred culture maintenance relative to adoption in the public domain, the higher their support for multiculturalism was too, highlighting the importance of investigating relative acculturation preferences.

AB  - Most people seem to believe that it is wrong to cause needless suffering and death to non-human animals, and yet most people also contribute to the needless suffering and death of a great many animals. If speciesism is understood as a psychological prejudice-the tendency of an individual human agent to disregard the interests of animals-then this fact is extremely difficult to explain. I argue that once speciesism is understood structurally-as a matter of injustice rather than a matter of interpersonal wrongdoing or individual prejudice-the project of explaining how so many humans are implicated in animal suffering becomes much more tractable. Drawing on the work of feminist theorists such as Sally Haslanger and Catharine MacKinnon, I suggest a way of reconceiving the question of the moral status of animals as a political question about the construction of animals and animality through our social, cultural, legal, and linguistic practices.

AB  - How time and place are constructed in the novel and how readers perceive these features have been studied extensively. Less attention has been devoted to how communicative devices, such as letters, electronic messaging, or telephone calls, can influence both time and place by connecting characters in different locations. This article argues that the technical capabilities of different communication systems, when represented within a novel's story world, help determine the forms of plot, characterization, and narrative voice that a novelist can feasibly present. To demonstrate this, the argument compares three novels that share the generic conventions of romantic fiction: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Helen Fielding's modern adaptations of Austen, Bridget Jones's Diary (1996) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (1999). Each novel depicts potential lovers who are initially seen as socially incompatible in that they live or work in dissimilar places. In all three texts, communication systems help connect the characters and bridge the environments in which they normally reside, thereby allowing romance to develop. However, the speed, reliability, and materiality of the different types of technology available in their respective historical periods radically affect how their plots are expressed. Letters, instant messaging, and mobile telephony are "semiotic resources" that the novelist can use to structure her plot and narrative voice.

AB  - Purpose Between 30 and 60 % of the societal cost of depression is due to losses related to decreased work productivity. To date, only a few studies have focused on union perspectives related to factors influencing the return-to-work of employees absent due to depression, despite evidence of the importance of these perspectives. The purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of union perspectives on the factors surrounding the return-to-work of employees who were absent from work due to depression. Methods In this qualitative study, conducted in Canada (Qu,bec), 23 individuals (union representatives and peer workers) from the three largest unions (mixed industries) in Quebec took part in one of three focus groups. Results Fourteen emerging themes (e.g., work environment, attitudes toward depression) were distributed over five categories of stakeholders involved in the return-to-work of employees on sick leave (i.e., employers and immediate supervisors, co-workers, employees on sick leave due to depression, general physicians, and unions). We observed four major cross-cutting themes that arose beyond these five categories: (1) organizational culture in which mental health issues and human aspects of work are central, (2) support and follow-up during the work absence and the return-to-work, (3) lack of resources to assist the employee in the return-to-work, and (4) stakeholders' prejudices and discomfort regarding depression. Conclusions Our results clarify the factors, from a union perspective, that may facilitate or hinder the return-to-work of employees absent from work due to depression.

AB  - Stigma is a common problem among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, little is known about HIV/AIDS-related stigma in older PLWHA over the age of 50. This study described the stigma of HIV/AIDS and its factors based on 120 PLWHA aged 50 or older in an area of high HIV prevalence in south rural China. Each participant completed a face-to-face questionnaire that collected information on demographic characteristics, AIDS-related events and experience of HIV/AIDS-related stigma. Finally, only 18.1% reported experiencing external stigma compared with 64.3% feeling internal stigma. Regression analysis indicated that social support and health status were the two variables that were significantly predictive of both external and internal stigma. Whatever, the more support were received from family members by PLWHA, the less external stigma was perceived. Negative marital situation was also related to external stigma. Reducing HIV/AIDS stigma requires a supportive environment, positive attitude and correct knowledge of AIDS. Health workers and policy makers should take practical approaches to reduce prejudice.

TI  - Against withdrawing government and insurance subsidies for ARTs from fertile people, with special reference to lesbian and gay individuals
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA  - English
AB  - One way to help ensure the future of human life on the planet is to reduce the total number of people alive as a hedge against dangers to the environment. One commentator has proposed withdrawing government and insurance subsidies from all fertile people to help reduce the number of births. Any proposal of this kind does not, however, offer a solution commensurate with current problems of resource use and carbon emissions. Closing off fertility medicine to some people-or even to all-would have only negligible effects on environmental protection. Moreover, the proposal to withdraw financial subsidies from fertile individuals would have prejudicial effects on lesbian and gay people, who must always reach beyond their same-sex relationships for help in having children. It is, moreover, entirely unclear why some people turning to fertility medicine for help in having children should have to pay their own way even though they contribute to the pool of money available for government and insurance subsidies. Entitlements based on an alleged moral difference between the 'fertile' and the 'infertile' cannot support such a conclusion.

AB  - This personal essay reflects on my family's relationship to the Holocaust and how this shaped my work. It shows the conflicts of a Catholic-raised German historian, from a working-class family, whose relationship and attitude to the Holocaust is in no way exceptional but rather ordinary in comparison to the majority of German society. Indifference, silence, and refusal mixed with feelings of guilt and shame characterize the ambiguous relationship with National Socialists and the Nazi Party. My work on Holocaust testimonies is shaped by the sense of continued othering inside German society towards the formerly persecuted, as well as against those who take an interest in these minorities. In addition, it is a struggle for an integrated and shared historical perception. These deliberations also address aspects of prejudices and othering from my side. With the intention of preventing prejudice and the fusion of history between Jewish and non-Jewish narratives in a tradition of disquieting differentiation, I describe the difficulties that exist in a shared history of genocidal events.

AB  - Betsey Stockton was a missionary to the Sandwich Islands from 1822 to 1825, serving under the ABCFM. As the first single woman and the first African American to serve with the American Board, she provides a unique nexus of gender and race within a Caucasian missionary society. Betsey's relationship with the Board was a 'peculiar case' that was regulated by an ambiguous contract, which claimed, on the one hand, that she was 'like any other missionary', yet on the other hand, was to be 'treated neither as an equal nor as a servant, but as a humble Christian friend'. With regard to her race, Betsey experienced both acceptance by fellow missionaries and racial prejudice. As a single woman, Betsey contributed to the mission endeavour through domestic help for the Charles Stewart family and through teaching native Hawaiians, both commoners and nobles. She fulfilled ministries commensurate to gender-specific expectations, similar to her other female missionary colleagues.

AB  - Supervised training periods in primary care have been used as spaces for teaching and extension in the area of health, making it feasible to include undergraduates in concrete teaching-learning scenarios. The aim of this study was to analyze the perceptions of dental students about the importance of supervised training periods in Family Health Units to their professional education. The sample consisted of 185 students who answered the question: What is your opinion about the importance of this training period in SUS to your professional education? Comment on this experience and its positive and negative aspects The responses were analyzed by the quali-quantitative Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) technique. The students appreciated learning through practice in the service; contact with professionals from other areas; opportunity for technical-operative improvement and demonstrated sensitivity in the face of social reality, although they appeared to be concerned about being absent from the faculty, arguing that they were being prejudiced as regards their intramural clinical productivity, exhaustively demanded of them. It was concluded that students placed value on the extramural experience, however, it was perceived that there was still a predominant influence of focus on intramural clinical training.

AB  - The challenges of facilitating conversations on racial inequality, whiteness, and privilege in classrooms include student disengagement and students' accusations of prejudice among instructors, particularly instructors of color. Moreover, the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 has promoted the claim that we are now "post-race" and thus no longer need to talk about race. Both students and instructors who believe otherwise and are committed to bringing up these topics in class risk facing ridicule or hostility and for instructors, even threats to their job security or life. However, in a public university where, ideally, racial inequality and privilege intersect, the classroom can be a space for critical dialogue and coalition building around racial justice. I discuss two pedagogical strategies that build opportunities to help students and instructors overcome "post-race paralysis"-the difficulty talking about race in the post-Obama era-and instead practice conversations towards anti-racism.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence indicates the extreme forms of violence and acute and longer-term mental health consequences associated with trafficking and exploitation. However, there has been little research on post-trafficking mental health and psychosocial support services for survivors. This study explored the availability and accessibility of mental health and psychosocial support services in Cambodia for women, men and children trafficked and exploited for sex or labour purposes.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample of representatives from seven service organizations providing mental health and psychosocial support services for people who have been trafficked. This qualitative method was selected to gain insights into the service approaches and challenges faced by the small number of post-trafficking service providers in Cambodia. A conceptual framework outlining access dimensions associated with service provision guided the structure of the study.
   Results: Findings indicate that among the available post-trafficking services, there are few trained mental health specialists, an over-representation of shelter services in urban versus rural areas and limited services for males, people with disabilities, individuals exploited for labour (versus sexual exploitation) and those with more serious mental illnesses. Providers believe that discrimination and stigma related to both mental health and human trafficking hinder trafficked people's willingness to access services, but suggest that awareness-raising may reduce these prejudices. Care in this sector is precarious due to over-reliance on financial support by donors versus government. Recent increases in newly qualified professionals and providers suggest potential improvements in the quality and availability of psychological support for trafficking survivors.
   Conclusions: Psychological support for the growing number of identified trafficking survivors in Cambodia will depend on improved geographical distribution of services, more mental health support professionals and growing acceptability of mental health service use among trafficked people and the Cambodian public.

TI  - Authors as Creators of Art: The Collaborative Shaping of Literary Writers in Ch'angjo
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In the early 1920s, when aspiring writers still strived to conceptualize modern literature in Korea, the ideas and images of a literary author were not firmly established. Facing the recalcitrant prejudice against art as vulgar entertainment, those writers tried to settle into the idea of modern literature as "divine" art by adapting Romanticism to Korea. Coterie magazines, such as Ch'angjo (Creation, 1919-21), played an important role in circulating modern aesthetics. Yet they also provided a platform for those writers with aspirations to collaboratively perceive what kinds of writers they were. By examining discourses on art, essays about the writers themselves, and prose fiction on artists in Ch'angjo, I argue that the figure of the writer as a creator of art was socially made in 1920s Korea through coterie magazines, which connected the members' shared practice of portraying artists to their collective projects of self-making.

AB  - Group-based relative deprivation (GRD) is a critical predictor of support for social change. Because resistance to change and acceptance of inequality are core features of a conservative ideology, we predicted that GRD would negatively correlate with conservatism. Moreover, given the central role affect plays in bridging the association between experiences with inequality and group-based responses, we expected that this hypothesized relationship would be mediated by intergroup emotions. We tested these hypotheses in a large national sample of MAori (N = 685)-the indigenous peoples of New Zealand. As predicted, GRD was indirectly associated with conservatism through participants' warmth toward the majority outgroup (i.e., New Zealand Europeans) and the minority ingroup (i.e., MAori): whereas GRD was negatively correlated with warmth toward outgroup members, GRD was positively correlated with warmth toward the ingroup. In turn, warmth toward the (a) outgroup and (b) ingroup was positively and negatively associated with conservatism, respectively. Similar results were obtained when replacing conservatism with participants' (a) satisfaction with the government and (b) support for New Zealand's main center-right political party. Our findings demonstrate the complex relationship between GRD and political beliefs, while also highlighting the crucial role of emotions in connecting GRD with group-based attitudes.

It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

AB  - The stress of migration as well as social factors and changes related to the receiving society may lead to the manifestation of psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals after migration. The diversity of cultures, ethnicities, races and reasons for migration poses a challenge for those seeking to understand how illness is experienced by immigrants whose backgrounds differ significantly from their clinicians. Cultural competence represents good clinical practice and can be defined as such that a clinician regards each patient in the context of the patient's own culture as well as from the perspective of the clinician's cultural values and prejudices. The EPA Guidance on cultural competence training outlines some of the key issues related to cultural competence and how to deal with these. It points out that cultural competence represents a comprehensive response to the mental health care needs of immigrant patients and requires knowledge, skills and attitudes which can improve the effectiveness of psychiatric treatment. To reach these aims, both individual and organizational competence are needed, as well as teaching competence in terms of educational leadership. The WPA Guidance on Mental Health and Mental Health Care for Migrants and the EPA Guidance on Mental Health Care for Migrants list a series of recommendations for policy makers, service providers and clinicians; these are aimed at improving mental health care for immigrants. The authors of this paper would like to underline these recommendations and, focusing on cultural competency and training, believe that they will be of positive value. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - We examine 575 randomly selected articles on Zimbabwean immigrants from the South African Media (SAM) database to expose discourses of exclusion and the production of the psycho-social condition - moral panic. We use critical discourse analysis, notions of remediation and immediacy to scrutinize discourse structures and other discursive strategies designed to conceal mediation and authorial prejudices, and to make the reader experience' the actual content. In addition to making the anti-immigrant rhetoric appear legitimate, and the danger immediate and real, we argue that the apparent seamless content is often biased by selection and structured in such a way as to deny voice to immigrants and their advocates. Among other things, we conclude that since the readers' interpretations are filtered through lenses of subjectivities defined by communicative contexts characterized by job scarcity, poverty, crime and wanting healthcare, the news content heightens anxiety and miseducates more than it enlightens readers on migration issues. Hence there is a danger of SAM becoming unwitting conveyors of the same vices they preach against.

AB  - The unfolding of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) incident in spring 2006 led to lively exchanges and debates among scholars on the US-based Asian studies listserv, H-Asia, which lasted from early May to mid-June. They were the most rapid, intense exchanges and debates on a single topic in the more than two decades' history of the listserv, providing a small window onto the mentality of the academic world mostly dominated by US scholars regarding the MIT incident and other relevant issues. Some commentators on H-Asia were thoughtful and open minded. But a number of the posts, critical of the MIT students, quickly framed the debate as Chinese nationalism vs. US academic freedom. They implied that the MIT Chinese students were motivated by Chinese nationalism because of the Chinese Communist Party's indoctrination. According to those critics, the MIT Chinese students failed to appreciate the nuance of humanities and social sciences and the spirit of US academic freedom. This article takes a critical look at the H-Asia debate on Chinese nationalism and US academic freedom over the MIT incident. It raises a number of issues, including academic freedom; nationalism; academic hierarchy; culture of victimization; scholars' responsibility; racial, political, and cultural prejudice; and some Western scholars' own aversion toward "Chinese nationalism." It questions whether the threat to academic freedom is not within each of us because of our own prejudices.

AB  - As members of a nationally accredited research project (I + D+i) InterMED (ref.: FF2011-25500) being carried out in the field of Intercultural Mediation, we are aware of the mediator's delicate role in communicative interactions between health professionals and foreign population. Sales has pointed out the dangers of stereotyping minorities and thus has warned Western citizens 'to assume that they are unaware of people's reality coming from other cultures, that prejudices are built due to lack of knowledge and the fear that ignorance entails'. For all these reasons, we aim at informing learners enrolled in English for Physical Therapy at the University of Alcala about the importance that nowadays immigration has in public health settings and the role that mediators play in these contexts. This objective can be attained with the help of class blogs, a web 2.0 tool available at the Blackboard online platform, whose teaching and learning uses are currently being researched by the teaching innovation group FILWIT (Filologias, Wikis y Traduccion; Philology, Wikis and Translation) in the framework of the ALCES (Aprendizaje de Lenguas y Cultura en Entornos Sociales; Learning Languages and Culture in Social Networks) project. The interdisciplinary spirit guiding the present teaching experience strives to show that students can learn a foreign language at the same time as they come into contact with multiculturalism in public health services.

AB  - The Israeli-Polish Mental Health Association (IPMHA) was founded in 2000. It is a unique organization as it is not only one of the many associations for mental health professionals but also a platform for people from distant countries who share an important and traumatic past. IPMHA members have been engaged in studies of consequences of massive trauma, intergenerational transmission of trauma and help for trauma survivors. Keeping in mind the obligation of mental health professions to contribute to an enlightened and tolerant society, the IPMHA members have been tryingto deal with "the past in the present," investigating the roots of the harm caused by racial and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism and other forms of social prejudice.
   The IPMHA activities included symposia with discussions facilitated by the use of the dynamic group formula. Some of the materials presented in the meetings were published in Polish professional journals. This article reports on the activities of the. IPMHA with special focus on the accompanying emotionally loaded problems.

AB  - Aim: qualitative study, which aimed to identify the barriers that influence nursing care practices related to the sexuality of women with gynecological and breast cancer. Methods: the study was conducted with 16 professionals of the nursing area (nurses, nursing technicians and nursing assistants) from two sectors of a university hospital situated in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The data was collected using semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews. All the interviews were recorded and the participants' responses were identified and categorized using Content Analysis. Results: three major themes were identified. These are as follows: 1) barriers related to the biomedical model; 2) barriers related to institutional dynamics and 3) barriers related to the social interpretations of sexuality. Conclusions: the results of this study showed that the systematized inclusion of this issue in nursing care routines requires changes in the health paradigm and in the work dynamic, as well as reflection on the personal values and social interpretations related to the topic. A major challenge is to divest sexuality of the taboos and prejudices which accompany it, as well as to contribute to the nursing team being more aware of the difficulties faced by women with gynaecological and breast cancer.

AB  - People with mental illness (PWMI) are faced with a number of social and health-related challenges especially stigma and discrimination which tend to have negative effects on their lives. This paper presents narrative monologues portraying the experiences and effects of psychiatric stigma and discrimination on PWMI in South Africa. These narratives voice out the concerns of the stigmatizers (specifically family members and significant others of PWMI) and the stigmatized in a poetic fashion. The society is still not very sympathetic to the plights of PWMI and this affects their general health and well-being. Traditional beliefs and prejudice still drive public attitude towards PWMI especially in African settings. These narratives presented in a poetic fashion in this paper highlight some salient issues relating to the experience and effects of stigma and the desires of PWMI to be treated with love and respect and helped to lead healthy normal lives.

AB  - This paper describes the first phase of an ongoing education and research project guided by three main intentions: (1) to create opportunities for phronesis in the classroom; (2) to develop new understandings about phronesis as it relates to nursing care generally and to caring for specific groups, like formerly incarcerated adults; and (3) to provide an opportunity for formerly incarcerated adults and graduate nursing students to participate in a dialectical conversation about ethical knowing. Gadamer's writings on practical philosophy, phronesis, and the Socratic dialectic provide the philosophical foundation and framework for the project. The first phase in the project was a 4-h class within a graduate-level health promotion course during which 30 nursing students and three formerly incarcerated panelists engaged in a dialectic conversation about what it means to care for formerly incarcerated adults in a meaningful way. After the class, two focus groups were conducted, one with the students and one with the formerly incarcerated panelists. Findings articulated participants' prejudices and assumptions prior to the class, expanded sense of phronesis, and ability to consider nursing practice within a larger ethical framework. Panelists and students left the class with a deeper understanding of one another and expressed an openness towards continued dialectic conversations together. Use of the Socratic dialectic within nursing curricula reflects a current and critical trend in nursing education to bring non-epistemologic forms of knowledge into the classroom.

AB  - Background: A balanced sex ratio is essential for a stable society.
   Objective: The main objective of the present research was to study the perceptions of women attending the antenatal care (ANC) facility regarding their gender preferences and family composition.
   Method: In this cross-sectional study 132 antenatal women were interviewed in their preferred language using a predesigned semi-structured questionnaire. The collected information was analyzed using SPSS version 11.5.
   Results: The mean age of the study participants was 27.2 +/- 4.1 years. The majority of the antenatal women (60.6%, n=80) did not have any gender preferences. Among those who had a gender preference (39.4%, n=52), male and female preference was reported by 55.7% (n=29) and 44.3% (n=23) of the participants respectively. The overall son preference index was observed to be 1.3. No consistent relationship could be established between the socio-demographic factors and the preference for gender. The mean preferred family size in our study was 1.85 +/- 0.531 and more than half of the participants had a balanced gender preference. The majority of the participants were aware that the adverse sex ratio can lead to fall in the number of brides and that it would bring about a social imbalance.
   Conclusion: As a developed society we need to ensure that both the genders get equal respect and are free from any sort of preferences and prejudices. To achieve this, more and more people need to be made aware of the consequences of gender imbalance and adverse sex ratio in a society.

AB  - Background: A number of psychiatric patients experience stigma connected to prejudices about mental disorders. It has been shown that stigma is most harmful when it is internalized. Most of the studies were performed on individuals either with psychoses or with mood disorders, and hence, there are almost no studies with other diagnostic categories. The goals of this research were to identify factors that are significantly related to self-stigma in patients with anxiety disorders and to suggest possible models of causality for these relationships.
   Methods: A total of 109 patients with anxiety disorders and possible comorbid depressive or personality disorders, who were admitted to the psychotherapeutic department participated in this study. All patients completed several psychodiagnostic methods, ie, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Version, Adult Dispositional Hope Scale, Dissociative Experiences Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, and Clinical Global Impression (also completed by the senior psychiatrist).
   Results: The overall level of self-stigma was positively associated with a comorbid personality disorder, more severe symptomatology, more intense symptoms of anxiety and depression, and higher levels of dissociation and harm avoidance. Self-stigma was negatively related to hope, reward dependence, persistence, self-directedness, and cooperativeness. Multiple regression analysis showed that the most significant factors connected to self-stigma are harm avoidance, the intensity of depressive symptoms, and self-directedness. Two models of causality were proposed and validated. It seems that the tendency to dissociate in stress increases the probability of development of self-stigma, and this relationship is entirely mediated by avoidance of harm. Conversely, self-directedness lowers the probability of occurrence of self-stigma, and this effect is partly mediated by hope.
   Conclusion: Patients with anxiety disorders accompanied with or without comorbid depressive or personality disorders may suffer from self-stigma. Individuals with greater sensitivity to rejection and other socially aversive stimuli are prone to the development of self-stigma. Other personality factors, such as hopeful thinking and self-acceptance serve as factors promoting resilience concerning self-stigma.

AB  - The Editorial Board of the journal is rightly proud that it managed to persuade Professor Maureen Perrie, the eminent British historian of Russia, to write this memoir, intriguingly entitled 'From Poetry to Peasantry: my Early Adventures in Russian Studies'. The memoir is written with such candour, and in such a lively and entertaining style, that its appeal will extend beyond specialists in the humanities. The reader is presented with a portrait of an entire generation, with its insights and its delusions, its loyalty to its parents' moral code and its aspiration towards new visions of humanity. Maureen Perrie's remarkable memory for detail enables her to create a complex and dynamic picture of the attitude of British society towards Russia, of cultural interactions and the cruel political prejudice that played such a pernicious role. At the same time we have a valuable account of her youthful enthusiasms, heartfelt experiences and the role of personal relationships in her development as a historian. The author followed a complex path, beginning with an interest in Russian literature and the Symbolists (her favourite poet was Alexander Blok), and leading on to research on the Russian peasantry, pretenderism and the Russian monarchy. This trajectory provides evidence of her inquiring mind and her desire to get to the very heart of a phenomenon - because a true understanding of Russia involves first and foremost an understanding of the patriarchal mindset, the peasant world, popular utopias and the cruelty of the regime towards its own people. Maureen Perrie has brilliantly succeeded in her task. Her publications make a major contribution to international Russian Studies; and this autobiographical essay, which is so revealing of the author's personality, provides entertaining and moving reading for all lovers of Russian culture.

AB  - The idea of cohousing is alive in many industrialized countries today. It is seen as an interesting alternative way of living in late modern cities, where a majority of people live in families, couples or single households, but since there is a general lack of knowledge of what it means to live in a cohousing unit there are also prejudices. In cohousing units, the members are bound up to each other not by family ties but as separate persons with different relations. The inhabitants are living in different households and flats and with common spaces. Architecture is important as well as the organization of cooperation and everyday life. This article presents results from a study on cohousing for second half of life in the capital city of Sweden. The main question is: What does it mean to live in a cohousing unit and who is living here? Through in-depth interviews, we found that the residents in this type of dwelling underscore the possibility of both autonomy and dependency, privacy and togetherness. Theoretically, the relations in a cohousing unit can neither be characterized as Gemeinschaft nor Gesellschaft but at the same time it could be both/and. This evokes a third social relationship of the Bund - a theoretical concept beyond the dichotomy of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft.

AB  - Greek rhetoric makes the most of its relation with myth, poetry, and philosophy. Of course, this is no surprise at all. For any emergent cultural space, mixing myth with reason, vision with ideation, ecstatic experience with the sobriety of rigorous thinking, must be confronted with its foundational strives, as well as with its idiosyncrasies. The Greek approach on rhetoric seems to favor both. It is a means to a cultural development paradigm, as well as a subject for dismissing the outward appearance that rhetoric may be suitable for a Greek way of life. Between Homer and Plato, what is at stake may amount to a sound philosophy of rhetoric that sifts through Greek energy, valor, wisdom, even prejudice. Does Greek rhetoric embody the road to a necessary social and intellectual (trans)formation, or perhaps the vitiated instrument of the morally corrupt? Or maybe a little bit of both.

AB  - Gender-focused college courses seek to increase understanding of the systematic advantages associated with dominant group membership. These courses attempt to reduce prejudice and raise awareness of male and heterosexual privilege. Inclusion of privilege content within gender-focused courses has increased, but research to test interventions to increase privilege awareness and reduce prejudice remains sparse. The current studies provide experimental information about awareness of heterosexual privilege (Study 1) and male privilege (Study 2) and specific interventions for use in education, professional development, and community settings. Study 1 found the video intervention was effective in increasing heterosexual privilege awareness and internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Study 2 found that male privilege awareness was significantly increased and modern sexism was reduced by the video intervention. Findings provide information for applied practices such as pedagogical strategies when designing diversity courses and training workshops.

AB  - People with schizophrenia live their lives in the midst of misunderstanding and stigma from both the public and health-care providers, often fueled by media reports. Both laypersons and professionals believe that those with schizophrenia are egocentric, lack insight and empathy, and are without the capacity for trust and attachment. Individuals with schizophrenia themselves are people who are unheard, especially in regard to their identities beyond the illness. The Schizophrenia Oral History Project was initiated in 2011 to provide a platform for persons with schizophrenia to speak directly to mental health professionals and the public, in order to counter existing prejudices. To date, twenty-two narrators have offered their stories, and this article provides excerpts from nine of those. These interviews highlight the strength and courage of people who suffer from schizophrenia and reveal their essential humanity. We present these stories in opposition to prevailing beliefs, and we discuss contributions they can make to social, cultural, and professional changes that could improve the lives of those with the condition.

AB  - Despite literature emphasizing the importance of their presence on college campuses to minority student success, African American administrators are severely underrepresented in higher education. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the lived experiences of successful African American student affairs administrators at predominantly White institutions and factors that serve as enablers of and barriers to their career success. Beginning with a conceptual framework derived from the scholarly literature, 3 constructs were identified: (a) adjustment issues, (b) institutional factors, and (c) career dynamics. Following IRB approval, the authors identified a purposive sample of 14 successful African American student affairs administrators-4 women and 10 men-from predominantly White institutions. Length of experience in the field ranged from 5 to 27 years. Long semistructured interviews were conducted with the research participants. Data were coded to the conceptual framework with a phenomenological approach used to account for unanticipated and emerging issues. Findings for adjustment issues/enablers included the importance of mentoring relationships, healthy self-image and motivation, and social networks and family support. Adjustment issues/barriers included perceptions of prejudice and feelings of separateness or difference. Institutional factor/enablers are commitment to diversity (including recruitment strategies) and compensation/work conditions/resources. The institutional factor/barrier was discrimination. Career dynamics/enablers included professional preparation and undergraduate involvement in student affairs. The career dynamics/barrier was advancement opportunity. Implications for institutions wishing to increase African American administrator representation are presented.

AB  - White Americans higher in prejudice were less likely to vote for Barack Obama than other Americans. Recent research also demonstrated that supporters and opponents of Mr. Obama engaged in skin tone biases, i.e., they perceive Mr. Obama's skin tone as lighter or darker in line with more positive or negative views of him. Across two studies we hypothesized that skin tone biases occur as a function of two independent sources: racial prejudice, which is always related to skin tone bias, and political partisanship, which is related to skin tone bias primarily during elections. Study 1 assessed perceptions of Mr. Obama's skin tone shortly before and after the 2008 Presidential election, and shortly after the first inauguration. Study 2 assessed perceptions in the middle of his first term, immediately prior to the 2012 Presidential election, and 1 year into his second term in office. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that partisan skin tone bias was limited to the election period, whereas prejudice-based skin tone biases occurred independent from any election.

TI  - A Dictionary without Definitions: Romanticist Science in the Production and Presentation of the Grimm Brothers' German Dictionary, 1838-1863
T2  - SCIENCE IN CONTEXT
LA  - English
AB  - Between 1838 and 1863 the Grimm brothers led a collaborative research project to create a new kind of dictionary documenting the history of the German language. They imagined the work would present a scientific account of linguistic cohesiveness and strengthen German unity. However, their dictionary volumes (most of which were arranged and written by Jacob Grimm) would be variously criticized for their idiosyncratic character and ultimately seen as a poor, and even prejudicial, piece of scholarship. This paper argues that such criticisms may reflect a misunderstanding of the dictionary. I claim it can be best understood as an artifact of romanticist science and its epistemological privileging of subjective perception coupled with a deeply-held faith in inter-subjective congruence. Thus situated, it is a rare and detailed case of Romantic ideas and ideals applied to the scientific study of social artifacts. Moreover, the dictionary's organization, reception, and legacy provide insights into the changing landscape of scientific practice in Germany, showcasing the difficulties of implementing a romanticist vision of science amidst widening gaps between the public and professionals, generalists and specialists.

AB  - Objective: This study compared the attitudes of mental health and primary care providers toward persons with schizophrenia at 5 Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Method: This study utilized a cross-sectional anonymous survey, including clinical vignettes describing identical patient scenarios for a hypothetical patient with and without schizophrenia, to examine the differences in attitudes of primary care and mental health providers. The survey was distributed in 3 waves from August 2011 to April 2012. Participants included 351 VA providers from 5 VA medical centers, including 205 mental health providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, and mental health nurses) and 146 primary care providers (nurses and physicians). Providers' attitudes were assessed on 3 domains, including social distance, stereotyping, and attribution of mental illness. Results: Primary care providers had significantly more negative attitudes toward the vignette patient with schizophrenia compared with the patient without schizophrenia on 2 of 3 attitude measures (stereotyping and attribution of mental illness); however, this difference was not observed for mental health providers on the 2 measures. Conclusions and Implication for Practice: Primary care providers' negative attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia represent a potential target for interventions to reduce disparities in care for individuals with schizophrenia.

AB  - One of humanity's most pressing problems is the inequality between people from developed and developing countries, which counteracts joint efforts to combat other large scale problems. Little is known about the psychological antecedents that affect the perception of and behavioral responses to global inequality. Based on, and extending, Duckitt's dual-process model, the current research examines psychological antecedents that may explain how people in an industrialized Western country respond to global inequality. In two studies (N-1 = 116, N-2 = 117), we analyzed the relationship between the Big Five and justice constructs, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and behavioral intentions to reduce global inequality. Two-group path analysis revealed support for the dual-process model in that RWA and SDO were important predictors of behavioral intentions and partially acted as mediators between personality and such intentions. Moreover, justice sensitivity explained variance beyond the classic DPM variables. In Study 2, we additionally assessed individuals' global social identification and perceived injustice of global inequality that explained additional variance. Extending previous work on the dual-process model, these findings demonstrate that individual and group-based processes predict people's responses to global inequality and uncover potentials to promote behavior in the interest of global justice.

AB  - This article examines the lived experiences of women in Ethiopian higher education (HE) as a counterpoint to understandings of gender equity informed only by data on admission, progression and completions rates. Drawing on a critical qualitative inquiry approach, we analyse and interpret data drawn from focus group discussions with female students and academic women in two public universities in Ethiopia. Individual accounts and shared experiences of women in HE revealed that despite affirmative action policies that slightly benefit females at entry point, gender inequality persists in qualitative forms. Prejudice against women and sexual violence are highlighted as key expressions of qualitative gender inequalities in the two universities. It is argued that HE institutions in Ethiopia are male-dominated, hierarchical and hostile to women. Furthermore, taken-for-granted gender assumptions and beliefs at institutional, social relational and individual levels operate to make women conform to structures of disadvantage and in effect sustain the repressive gender relations.

AB  - A wide gap persists between the health of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians despite a recent Federal government commitment to close the gap by 2030. The complex underlying factors include socioeconomic and environmental disadvantage, inadequate education, underemployment, racial prejudice, high-risk health-related behaviours and limited access to clinical services and health promotion programmes. Over recent decades some aspects of Aboriginal health have deteriorated badly, largely from a surge in chronic lifestyle' diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disorders plus the effects of tobacco smoking, alcohol and drug abuse and high rates of violence and trauma. To correct these inequities will require improving many social and environmental factors. These include education, living conditions, vocational training, employment, closer cooperation between government and non-government agencies, access to affordable and nutritious fresh food, with better access to high-quality medical treatment, health promotion and disease prevention programmes. Indigenous people must be encouraged to become more involved in activities to improve their health and have more responsibility for the decision-making processes this will entail. Governments must support these changes to help close the Aboriginal health gap.

AB  - This study offers an alternative interpretation to Banville and Landry's (B&L, 1989) Can the Field of MIS Be Disciplined?, the canonical text that argued persuasively against the adoption of the Kuhnian view of scientific progress for the information systems (IS) field. Much has transpired in the quarter of a century since its publication, which provides us with new sources of understanding about paradigms and how they relate to the challenges faced by the IS field. On the basis of the hermeneutical principles of tradition, prejudice, temporal distance, history of effect and application, this study describes the context from which B&L was written, its dependence on Whitley's (1984) The Intellectual and Social Organization of the Sciences, and examines several of its claims and assertions. In contrast to B&L, this study finds the Kuhnian model of scientific progress well suited for a multidisciplinary and pluralistic field like IS and concludes with guidelines on how to reclaim the more transformative aspects of the paradigm concept, engender a culture of contextual borrowing from reference disciplines, and encourage conceptual development and autonomous theory construction.

AB  - The aims of this paper were to predict membership to a group of attitude of acceptance or ambiguity-rejection toward homosexuality, and describe the attitude levels. The Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay men (ATLG) scale was applied to a non-probability sample of 239 single heterosexual men. All of them were students of health sciences. 15% expressed rejection (including 4% extreme) based on the ATLG total score. Rejection toward gay men (28% including 7% extreme) was higher than toward lesbians (9% including 2.5% extreme). Not having homosexual friends and having adscription to Christian or Catholic religions were significant predictors of belonging to the group with an ambiguity-rejection attitude. It is concluded that the percentage of rejection toward homosexuality is significant. For this reason it is encouraged to implement workshops for promoting an acceptance attitude, and consider these risk variables in their design.

TI  - Sociolinguistic correlates of negative evaluation: Variable concord in Rio de Janeiro
T2  - LANGUAGE VARIATION AND CHANGE
LA  - English
KW  - FUTURE
AB  - Variable agreement in Brazilian Portuguese is subject to social stigma. It was brought to the general public's attention in 2011 in a heated nationwide sociolinguistic debate triggered by TV Globo, the principal network. In order to isolate objective factors underlying this debate, we examine the variable education in a trend study of Rio de Janeiro speech. Relying on logistic model relative weights and their corresponding ranges, we use polarization to designate the magnitude of these ranges. Polarization of the education variable in 1980 was moderate, whereas in 2000, polarization becomes extreme in an increasingly uneven social distribution of standard marked forms. The increased effect of education is also reflected in a comparison with the statistical effect of mass media: in 1980, media contact had a stronger effect than education did, whereas in 2000, education exhibits a stronger effect. The results reveal objective correlates to speakers' subjective reactions, suggesting that public discussion of linguistic prejudice would be useful to the community, which can profit from results of sociolinguistic research in a humanistic and emancipatory way, as foreseen by Sankoff (1988a).

AB  - PurposeTo assess the applicability of the systematization of nursing care (NCS) to outpatient nursing appointments using the NANDA-I and Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) taxonomies.
   MethodsData were collected from 40 patients who had appointments with a nurse who specialized in mental health. Nursing diagnoses (NDs) and interventions were classified using the NANDA-I and NIC taxonomies, respectively.
   FindingsA total of 14 different NDs were detected (minimum of one and maximum of three per appointment). The most frequently made diagnoses were impaired social interaction (00052), anxiety (00146), and ineffective self-health management (00078). A total of 23 nursing interventions were prescribed (approximately two per appointment), of which the most frequent were socialization enhancement (5100), self-care assistance (1800), and exercise promotion (0200). Significant associations were found between the most frequently detected NDs and the most commonly prescribed interventions (p > .05).
   ConclusionsThe NCS through the use of classification systems allows mental health nurses to better identify and assist poorly adjusted patients.
   Implications for Nursing PracticeThe assessment of the applicability of the NCS to different areas of health care and types of medical assistance contributes significantly to the quality of nursing care.

AB  - Members of groups with low societal status can pursue individual upward mobility to improve their status. We examine the conditions under which ingroup and outgroup members are most inclined to support such upward mobility attempts. Whereas both ingroup and outgroup supports are important, there may be tension: dissociation from the low status group may lower ingroup support, whereas association with the low status group may lower outgroup support. Ingroup association can be expressed by communicating one's affective involvement or by behaving in line with typical ingroup practices. As predicted, studies 1 and 2 show that support from the low status ingroup depends more on affective involvement than on behavioral identity expression (BIE). In contrast, studies 3-5 show that support from the high status group is more driven by the upwardly mobile individual's BIE. Mediational analyses show that these opposite patterns are driven by differential processes, prompted by the group's respective positions in the social hierarchy. The findings provide insight into how members of low status groups negotiate the competing demands of the high and low status groups as they pursue upward mobility. Moreover, they show how affective involvement and BIE differentially affect ingroup support and outgroup opposition. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Moral judgments are often biased against members of groups stereotyped as immoral (e.g., gay men, African Americans). We propose that these biases can be influenced by the framing of moral judgments. Building on the shifting standards model, we hypothesized that minimum (vs. confirmatory) standards judgments, which may elicit lower expectations for groups stereotyped as immoral, would induce people to make more lenient moral judgments for these groups. Furthermore, we predicted that people higher in Social Dominance Orientation, who tend to express negative attitudes toward stigmatized groups, would be more likely to demonstrate such group-based biases in moral judgments. Across three studies, framing judgments in terms of minimum (vs. confirmatory) standards influenced moral judgments regarding gay (vs. straight) men and Black (vs. White) men, and this effect was observed primarily among higher-SDO participants. However, leading people to develop a more expansive circle of moral regard eliminated these group-based moral biases.

AB  - Ever since the Cuban Revolution challenged the Monroe Doctrine by asserting a right to independence and mutuality between the United States and Cuba, no effort has been spared to gain control of the island. The National Endowment for Democracy, which has long pursued regime change in Cuba in the guise of democracy promotion, has recently "discovered" Cuban black people and manipulated the discourse of nonviolent civil disobedience to charge Cuba with racism. In 2009, an open letter from the esteemed Abdias do Nascimento and a document signed by 59 respected U. S.-based public figures of African descent became part of this effort. This process was enhanced in 2013 with visits to the United States by Afro-descendant Cuban dissidents and the increase of the reward for the capture of Assata Shakur, an exiled political activist currently living in Cuba. The original charge was countered by Cuban artists and writers and by U. S. Afro-descendants in support of Cuba's history of mobilization against discrimination and racial prejudice. If there is one way in which Cubans are taking to heart what Fidel Castro once called "the monopoly of knowledge," it is combining the full-throated struggle against racism with the objective to improve socialism at all levels of society.

AB  - The 2013 general elections in Kenya entailed no recurrence of the 2007-08 post-election violence. Closer examination at the local level, though, indicates that the experiences of violence continue to influence the social sphere. Divisions between a long-established population and newcomers are blatant especially at places with high levels of immigration. This paper addresses how experiences of violent conflict over identitary and territorial belonging affect and transform socio-spatial organisation. The analysis is based on an empirical study at one of the venues of the post-election violence, a poor and heterogeneous workers' settlement in Naivasha in Kenya's Rift Valley. Naivasha area is internationally known for its horticultural production and massive labour immigration. After the 2007 elections, radical individuals of the local Kikuyu ethnic majority claimed Naivasha as their territory as a reaction to the displacement of Kikuyus from other parts of the country. Migrants of unwanted ethnic identity or political positioning were murdered or forcibly evicted from the place. Yet, due to poor job opportunities, especially in western Kenya, job seekers continue to migrate to Naivasha. The repercussions of the violence are expressed in the lack of acceptance, on the part of the long-established population at the place, of the presence of labour migrants. Experiences of ethnicised prejudice, mistrust, and fear between the self-described autochthonous population and labour migrants are tenacious. Kikuyus perceive Naivasha as their place of refuge and are willing to defend it if necessary. Migrants barely develop feelings of belonging to Naivasha, seeking rather to enhance their own security during their stay at the place. This study illustrates that memories of the violence still regulate socio-spatial realities and reinforce and accelerate processes of spatial and societal division.

AB  - Early human food cultures were plant-based. Major religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism have recommended a vegetarian way of life since their conception. The recorded history of vegetarian nutrition started in the sixth century BC by followers of the Orphic mysteries. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras is considered the father of ethical vegetarianism. The Pythagorean way of life was followed by a number of important personalities and influenced vegetarian nutrition until the 19th century. In Europe, vegetarian nutrition more or less disappeared during the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance era and in the Age of Enlightenment, various personalities practiced vegetarianism. The first vegetarian society was started in England in 1847. The International Vegetarian Society was founded in 1908 and the first vegan society began in 1944. Prominent vegetarians during this time included Sylvester Graham, John Harvey Kellogg, and Maximilian Bircher-Benner. A paradigm shift occurred at the turn of the 21st century. The former prejudices that vegetarianism leads to malnutrition were replaced by scientific evidence showing that vegetarian nutrition reduces the risk of most contemporary diseases. Today, vegetarian nutrition has a growing international following and is increasingly accepted. The main reasons for this trend are health concerns and ethical, ecologic, and social issues. The future of vegetarian nutrition is promising because sustainable nutrition is crucial for the well-being of humankind. An increasing number of people do not want animals to suffer nor do they want climate change; they want to avoid preventable diseases and to secure a livable future for generations to come.

By exploring the available statistical data and relevant surveys, this article attempts to examine how, on the one hand, groups of non-Greek nationals fare at different stages of criminal justice within the broader social and political context and whether, on the other hand, the prejudice and stereotyping against the foreign population affects directly or indirectly the attitudes of stakeholders of social control and how this escalates, in extreme cases, into hostility, racism, and xenophobic violence against them during the years of crisis.

It also offers resources designed to empower healthcare professionals to provide timely and accurate referrals, diagnosis, or collaborative management of BPD in primary care.
   Data sources: Review of the literature examining background, epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and available resources regarding BPD. Content analysis conducted on data obtained from 1109 postings on three different public online forums/blogs specifically for BPD.
   Conclusions: BPD is characterized by unstable moods, behaviors, and relationships. While navigating a healthcare system fraught with health disparities, BPD sufferers may have their feelings of abandonment and hopelessness reinforced. Four core themes emerged (a) a reliance on online blogging to cope; (b) a quality of life that is impacted by debilitating effects of condition; (c) coping mechanisms that encompass healthy and destructive measures; and (d) social injustices that include stigmatization, prejudice, delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, limited healthcare access, and lack of cure.
   Implications for practice: Knowledgeable, nonjudgmental primary healthcare providers can play a key role in providing BPD sufferers and their loved ones with accurate and timely diagnosis, referral, treatment, resources, and support. Internet blogging may have important implications in care.

AB  - Background: There is extensive evidence of health inequality across ethnic groups. Inequity is a complex social phenomenon involving several underlying factors, including ethnic discrimination. In the field of health care, it has been established that ethnic discrimination stems partially from bias or prejudice on the part of doctors. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that patient ethnicity may affect doctors' social cognition, thus modifying their social interactions and decision-making processes. General practitioners (GPs) are the primary access point to health care for ethnic minority groups. In this study, we examine whether patient ethnicity affects the relational and decisional features of doctoring.
   Methods: The sample was made up of 171 Belgian GPs, who were each randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions. One group were given a hypertension vignette case with a Belgian patient (non-minority patient), while the other group were given a hypertension vignette case with a Moroccan patient (minority patient). We evaluated the time devoted by GPs to examining medical history; time devoted by GPs to examining socio-relational history; cardiovascular risk assessments by GPs; electrocardiogram (ECG) recommendations by GPs, and drug prescriptions by GPs.
   Results: We observed that for ethnic minority patients, GPs prescribed more drugs and devoted less time to examining socio-relational history. Neither cardiovascular risk assessments nor ECG recommendations were affected by patient ethnicity. GPs who were very busy devoted less time to examining medical history when dealing with minority patients.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence that GPs discriminated against ethnic minority patients when it came to medical decisions. However, our study did identify a risk of drugs being used inappropriately in some ethnic-specific encounters. We also observed that, with ethnic minority patients, GPs engage less in the relational dimension of doctoring, particularly when working within a demanding environment. In general practice, the quality of the relationship between doctor and patient is an essential component of the effective management of chronic illness. Our research highlights the complexity of ethnic discrimination in general practice, and the need for further studies.

AB  - Research Highlights and Abstract
   The article explores attitudes to New Labour in particular and politics in general through analysing their dramatization on TV.
   It indicates that such dramatizations are almost wholly negative, focusing on sleaze, spin and betrayal.
   The article explains the character of such dramas as being the result of the producers ' desire to present politics in terms their audiences will accept.
   It suggests that, as a consequence, popular hostility to politics is reinforced by television drama and so indicates that culture has an independent part to play in this process.
   Echoing Plato's banishment of artists, mainstream political scientists have excluded serious consideration of art from their discipline. Yet, there are grounds for believing that it can help address what Gerry Stoker suggests is one of social science's greatest failings: understanding 'what politics means to citizens'. This study of New Labour's television dramatization suggests it can help political scientists better appreciate the dynamics underpinning the much-noted decline of popular trust in representative politics. It looks at the reasons for the narrowing of the public's picture of politics by focusing on the changing production context for television drama during the New Labour period, something that led it to emphasise 'sleaze'. The article suggests such dramas consequently helped make more credible the public's pre-existing prejudices about what they supposed was the corrupt nature of Britain's political class.

AB  - Courts and commentators routinely assume that "bias" on the jury encompasses any source of influence upon jurors that does not come directly from the evidence presented at trial. This sweeping conception of juror bias is flawed because it fails to distinguish the prejudices and affinities that infect jury decisionmaking from the experiences and perspectives that enrich it. This Article uses a thought experiment informed by the neuroscience of bias to illuminate the complexity of juror influences that go by the name of bias. I distinguish four distinct categories of juror influence: personal interests, community interests, case-specific beliefs, and case-general beliefs. I apply this spectrum of juror bias to provide a sounder way to think about what kind of juries we want.
   I argue that trial courts should limit the interrogation and disqualification of prospective jurors to personal interests in the case whether social or financial and to case-specific beliefs arising from pretrial facts or rumors about the parties or events. By contrast, I would permit no such wholesale exclusion, either for community interests, which range from principles of justice to desires for vengeance, or for case-general beliefs about social causes or groups, which span scruples to dogmatism, and empathy to bigotry. My proposal to abolish challenges for these latter categories of outside influence raises the serious concern that accommodating their presence on the jury risks facilitating unjust outcomes, jury nullification, and hung juries. Trial courts should mitigate these risks by adopting two bias-tempering measures. First, jury pools should be diversified in ways that social cognition research suggests would attenuate the influence of unreflexive or objectionable attitudes. Second, judges should instruct deliberating jurors to express, along with their own position, the strongest counterarguments to it, so as to disrupt exaggerated assumptions of division and facilitate openness to persuasion.

AB  - This article investigates consequences of spatial contexts on interethnic contact. Despite the acknowledged integrative effects of pleasant interethnic relationships, several unresolved issues remain in this research field: investigations at two contextual levels simultaneously-i.e. neighbourhood and municipality levels; investigations of several contextual characteristics simultaneously, e. g. ethnic concentration, physical contact opportunities, population size; investigations on different kinds of interethnic contact, for example, contact with neighbours, with friends or in general. The present study contributes to these issues by analysing interethnic contact from a native's perspective using a German nation-wide dataset. A considerably high proportion of Germans (72 per cent) have contact with foreigners in at least one out of four measured types. Ethnic concentration is the strongest contextual predictor for all kinds of interethnic contact. Physical contact opportunities in the immediate neighbourhood foster interethnic contact in the neighbourhood only, while municipality size mostly diminishes interethnic contact.

AB  - The performance of indirect trust computation models (based on recommendations) can be easily compromised due to the subjective and social-based prejudice of the provided recommendations. Eradicating the influence of such recommendation remains an important and challenging issue in indirect trust computation models. An effective model for indirect trust computation is proposed which is capable of identifying dishonest recommendations. Dishonest recommendations are identified by using deviation based detecting technique. The concept of measuring the credibility of recommendation (rather than credibility of recommender) using fuzzy inference engine is also proposed to determine the influence of each honest recommendation. The proposed model has been compared with other existing evolutionary recommendation models in this field, and it is shown that the model is more accurate in measuring the trustworthiness of unknown entity.

AB  - The nature of mental disorders, the attitudes and prejudices of the social community towards psychiatric patients, the behavior and treatment of mental patients, all bring about numerous dilemmas and prejudices. When a patient is diagnosed with a mental disorder, he may suffer restrictions in the field of general human rights. However, the biggest problems in clinical practice occur in the treatment of patients who, besides their mental disorder also have a somatic disease. We report a 56-years-old female with a severe renal failure who refused to undergo dialysis. Following the patient's refusal to sign an informed consent, a psychiatrist was called in for consultation and diagnosed an acute psychotic reaction. To manage the delusions and acute psychotic reactions, risperidone in the dose of 2 mg was started. After 22 days, the patient still had marked psychotic symptoms. A psychiatrist, a nephrologist and an anesthesiologist, in the presence of the spouse on the grounds of her life-threatening condition, decided to apply the necessary medical procedures even without the patient's consent. A day after the start of dialysis the patient still had delusional ideas, but without the presence of anxiety, and the patient no longer offered resistance to dialysis. Four days after the first dialysis, the patient was calm, had vague memories about the entire previous period, and signed the informed consent concerning her further treatment.

AB  - Bisexual behaviours are relatively common among men who have sex with men in China. This pilot study aims to reveal the complex processes through which such men manage their sexuality, family responsibilities and sexual behaviours in a rural Chinese setting. A total of 15 men who have sex with men were recruited by purposive sampling. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted to explore participants' views about their sexual experiences and practices. The Chinese traditional moral code, family values and gender roles that form the crucial components of Confucianism were reflected in the participants' efforts to maintain familial and social harmony through a compromised form of sexual partnership. Most study participants demonstrated a mixed experience of social stigma, sexual naivete and ignorance of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Under cultural and family pressure, men who have sex with men entered heterosexual marriages with the intention of maintaining a balance between their collectivist (familial) obligations and their individualistic (same-sex sexual) desires. However, the opaque nature of their concurrent sexual relationships may endanger their personal health and accelerate HIV and STI transmission. Reducing the stigma and social prejudice associated with male same-sex sexual relations is essential for any culturally sensitive HIV-prevention programme to succeed in rural China.

AB  - This secondary data analysis examined the impacts of human capital, child care, fringe benefits, child support, ethnicity, county economy, and county minority-population size on participation in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) by parents living at or below the federal poverty threshold. Longitudinal records of 1,789 such parents were extracted from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1996-2008). Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression showed that having personal/family problems, being African American, and residing in a county with widespread unemployment were associated positively with TANF receipt. TANF receipt was associated negatively with employment offering a retirement plan, full-time employment, part-time employment, and residence in a county with a large Hispanic population. Future research might explore the relationship between subpopulations' sizes and states' TANF policies.

AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: "empathy," "cultural openness," "in-group bias," and "intergroup anxiety." British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed.

T2  - DENVER UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW

KW  - REALISM
KW  - GENDER
AB  - Sonia Sotomayor's famous "wise Latina" quote provoked a conservative critique. The first part of the critique proposes that Judge Sotomayor's gender and racial background would affect her judicial decision making The second part fears that her Latina background would result in bias, prejudice, and unfair judicial decisions.
   This Essay explores this conservative critique and discusses it more generally. It reviews the realism model of judicial decision making, social science research on salience theory, and empirical research on judges' race and gender ultimately concluding that the first part of the conservative critique is correct: judges' gender and racial backgrounds affect their decision making, at least in some cases. The Essay, however, discusses why the second part of the critique is problematic. It argues that we should have the same positive associations, and the same anticipation of judicial insights, about judges' gender and racial backgrounds that we do about the other biographical details of judges' backgrounds. It suggests that judges engaging in "deep analysis" of alternative gender and racial perspectives would move them toward empathic understanding rather than fear of bias, prejudice, and unfair results.

AB  - This study set out to examine native Dutch adolescents' tolerance (N = 1,139) of Muslim immigrants in relation to the endorsement of assimilation, national identification, and contact with ethnic minority peers. The focus was on two dimensions of tolerance: the acceptance of practices by Muslim actors, and Muslims persuading co-believers to engage in the same practices. Tolerance was found to be higher for the practices than for persuading others. Higher endorsement of assimilation was related to lower levels of tolerance, and this relation was stronger for higher compared to lower national identifiers. Assimilation mediated the positive relationship between intergroup contact and tolerance. These effects did not differ for the two dimensions of tolerance. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This review of women's participation in the legal system as expert witnesses examines the empirical literature on the perceived credibility and persuasiveness of women compared with men experts. The effects of expert gender are complex and sometimes depend on the circumstances of the case. Some studies find no differences, some find favorable effects for women and others for men, and still others find that expert gender interacts with other circumstances of the case. The findings are interpreted through social role theory and the role incongruity theory of prejudice. Future directions for research are identified and implications are considered for attorneys who select and prepare expert witnesses. Suggestions for men's and women's behavior as expert witnesses are provided. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

LA  - English
AB  - This essay discusses the central role that health and disability prejudice played in the passing of the American and Canadian Chinese exclusion laws, which barred the entry of Chinese laborers from the 1880s through the 1940s. Lawmakers justified these policies in part by referring to scientific and public health reports that characterized Chinese immigrants as "feeble-minded" and prone to sickness and therefore as a threat to the health of white North Americans. Using this historical backdrop as a critical context for interpreting the literature of Sui Sin Far, a founding figure of Asian North American literature, I demonstrate the ways her writings on disease and disability challenge the racism, sexism, and health-related prejudice underlying the exclusion laws. Specifically, she reminds readers through her essays and short fiction that the living and working conditions that awaited immigrants in North America were the more genuine threats to health. Further, she critiques the imposition of white Western medical practices and standards on the bodies of Chinese immigrants, particularly women, and theorizes disability as an opportunity for non-heteronormative social formations among Chinese immigrant women.

AB  - In spring 2011, a study was initiated to investigate the nature and extent of gender issues in clinical dental education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Dentistry. Surveys were sent to 236 dental students in the second, third, and fourth years; eighty-six (36.4 percent) responded. Surveys were also sent to seventy-one full-time dental faculty members who had clinical contact with students, and thirty-four (47.9 percent) responded. Of the student respondents, fifty-one were female and thirty-five were male; the faculty respondents were ten women and twenty-four men. A significantly greater proportion of female than male student respondents reported that issues related to gender affected clinical training. The female students also responded that mentorship was less available and less in content for them compared to males, and significantly more female than male students reported lower self-confidence in clinical settings. Among faculty respondents, a higher proportion of women than men reported insufficient awareness of gender issues. These faculty members also reported thinking that female students showed more empathy toward patients than males. Both faculty and student respondents said that female faculty members received less respect from students than did male faculty members. Forty-eight percent of the students reported experiencing or witnessing gender-based prejudice in clinical settings, and 7.0 percent reported experiencing or witnessing unwelcome sexual advances or conduct. A more robust study to include other dental institutions is needed. With confirmation of specific gender issues, corrective measures could be recommended to improve the climate for both females and males in the clinical component of dental education.

AB  - Introduction Nurses represent an important link in mediating between the potential donors and their relatives'consent to organ and tissue transplantation.The message of the Health Department to potential donors about the importance of organ donation was supported by the Serbian Orthodox Church, the army and other institutions through media campaigns. Nurses could contribute to this action by their personal example.
   Objective The aim of this study was identification and bivariate analysis of nurse attitude about organ donation, their knowledge about the importance of transplantation as treatment methods, as well as the connection between work experience and education level with the formation of attitudes and new skills.
   Methods In this cross-sectional study, 291 nurses from the Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, filled in the questionnaire on the effect of correlation between the length of the service and level of education on knowledge and attitudes toward organ transplantation and organ donation.
   Results Out of 291 respondents, 67.4% have completed the nursing school and 32.6% have higher education. The majority (63.9%) of respondents knew that the EEG was the most valid method for determining brain death. The question regarding the possibility of buying organs was answered correctly by 68.7% of respondents. A large majority (91%) would accept organ transplant, if needed, but only 32.0% would be organ donors, and only 0.3% owned a donor card. In contrast, one third of nurses were already blood donors.
   Conclusion In case of necessary transplantation, nurses would accept someone else's organ, though they do not possess donor cards, but just few would donate their organs. It is possible that prejudice arises from ignorance and distrust in the health policy of the Republic of Serbia. However, besides negative attitude, nurses have expressed interest in learning and professional development in the area of transplantation.

AB  - Green building (GB) is an emerging topic in research. However, few studies have directly linked wood materials with the concept of GB. Here, we attempt to increase our understanding of GB and the potential for using wood to enhance this concept from the market point of view, with emphasis on experts in the UK construction sector, using qualitative analysis of interview data. The main results support Abidin's broader concept of GB (2005) and suggest that there is potential for integrating GB and corporate social responsibility in the construction sector; thus we add affordable housing as an additional element in the economic dimensions. Our results further verify the crucial role that the UK government has played in GB formation, promotion and development and showed a positive increase in using wood in the UK construction sector, supporting the notion that the environmental performance of wood is the major driver in embracing wood in the GB concept. In addition, we showed that experts who have sound knowledge of wood as a building material agree on its superior environmental credentials; however, end users who may lack information and knowledge of wood products often show strong prejudice against its use. Finally, we demonstrated that the major drivers promoting wood as a sustainable solution for GB in the UK construction sector include legislation, environmental awareness, attitudes and traditions, market and competition, promotion and communication, and technology and know-how.

AB  - This article examines the symbolic function of hate crime law. By challenging the norms that sustain and promote prejudice, hate crime law seeks to contribute to claims for social justice on behalf of victim groups. This symbolic function cannot be achieved by legal rules alone. Drawing upon theories of emotional thinking, the article argues that the moral work of hate crime laws is dependent upon the capacity of victim groups to engender compassionate thinking that helps reconfigure perceptions of them as dangerous, illegitimate or inferior Others. This analysis seeks to contribute to our understanding of the processes through which some minority communities fall short of the image of ideal victims capable of contributing to the moral claim embedded in hate crime law.

AB  - Overtly racist statements are socially and politically unacceptable in the USA. Yet black people in the USA continue to experience discrimination and prejudice at both the individual and institutional levels. This paper examines white people's talk about race in focus groups from the North Carolina Traffic Violation Study. The participants discussed race obliquely, by talking about hypothetical behaviour related to crime and police profiling while largely avoiding direct mention of race. At the same time focus group members voice different expectations for white people and black people. By differentiating between behaviours expected from individuals perceived to belong to different racial groups, they reproduced racial difference. Focus group members legitimized racial profiling and did so using language that was largely colour-blind' and socially acceptable by attributing the disproportionately high rate of stops for black drivers to ostensibly non-racial factors. The groups used mostly colour-blind language, but the result was racializing discourse.

AB  - Background: Currently, there is no consensus regarding iron supplementation dose that is most beneficial for maternal and offspring health during gestation. Recommended iron supplementation dose does not preempt anemia in around 20% of the pregnancies, nor the risk of hemoconcentration in 15%. This deficit, or excess, of iron prejudices the mother-child wellbeing. Therefore the aims of the study are to determine the highest level of effectiveness of iron supplementation adapted to hemoglobin (Hb) levels in early pregnancy, which would be optimum for mother-child health.
   Methods/Design: Design: Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) triple-blinded Setting: 10 Primary Care Centers from Catalunya (Spain) Study subjects: 878 non-anemic pregnant women at early gestation stage, and their subsequent newborns Methods: The study is structured as a RCT with 2 strata, depending on the Hb levels before week 12 of gestation. Stratum # 1: If Hb from 110 to 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 80 mg/d. Stratum # 2: If Hb > 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 20 mg/d. Measurements: In the mother: socio-economic data, clinical history, food item frequency, lifestyle and emotional state, and adherence to iron supplement prescription. Biochemical measurements include: Hb, serum ferritin, C reactive protein, cortisol, and alterations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D). In children: ultrasound fetal biometry, anthropometric measurements, and temperament development. Statistical analyses, using the SPSS program for Windows, will include bivariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for variables associated with the relationship under study.
   Discussion: Should conclusive outcomes be reached, the study would indicate the optimal iron supplementation dose required to promote maternal and infant health. These results would contribute towards developing guidelines for good clinical practice.

TI  - Opening Borders, Closing Nations: How 'Generation Nothing' Stages Polish Migration
T2  - CONTEMPORARY THEATRE REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - It is regularly noted that the first generation of theatre makers in Poland to produce work after the demise of communism have emphasized a concern with the fate of the individual over the collective that was markedly absent in previous generations. Maria Janion has argued that this generation represents the conclusion of the Polish romantic paradigm, comprised of common values around which cultural identity was constituted during the partitions and occupations of the country in nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Referred to in the 1990s as the JPII generation, a designation given to those born around 1978 when John Paul II began his papacy, Generation NIC (Nothing) is often cited as a more accurate term as no singular set of shared principles has replaced the romantic tradition. While many critics have lamented this breakdown of social cohesion, there is no doubt a nascent pluralism and the cultivation of distinctive and personalized attitudes to national character, accepted morality and public discourse have led to striking innovations in contemporary Polish theatre. The opening up of European borders and the prospect of easy emigration have been major contributors to changes in artistic output and are perhaps some of the most influential factors in the shaping of this generation's cultural outlook. This article considers the transnational influences recent shifts in inter-EU migration have engendered in Poland and the UK, focusing on recent theatre productions that have grappled with intercultural tensions, growing prejudices and an increasing trend to identify between, rather than with, nations.

AB  - This article focuses on online assessments of a controversial British television advertisement. Across blogs, websites and forums, a range of stances emerged in debates about its possible 'sexism', 'humour', 'misogyny', or 'realism'. The analytic interest here is in the ways that assessors invoked 'f-' categories (e.g. 'feminism', 'feminist') as part of their assessments: across the data corpus, people would locate themselves or others in relation to 'feminism', where 'feminism' was variously old-fashioned, modern, prejudiced, vital, dogmatic, complex and/or many other things besides. To account for this variability, the article pursues an ethnomethodologically oriented policy of treating categories not as vectors for in-the-head social attitudes, but as resources for on-the-screen social actions. Categories thus became analysable not for what they revealed about their authors' real thoughts vis-a-vis feminism, but for how they functioned as crucial components of recipient-designed online assessments. Studying examples of positive and negative assessments, the paper subsequently shows that and how users claimed or denied their own (or some others') allegiance to 'f-' categories as a method for strengthening their own (or undermining others') assessments. A concluding discussion considers the wider applications of a categorial approach to feminism in a world of increasingly mediated interaction.

AB  - A 63-year-old patient, with no psychiatric history, was admitted in the psychiatric department with depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, apathy, insomnia, attention deficit, irritability, social withdrawal, prejudice and abandon delusions. Cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan was normal but the general physical examination revealed a voluminous tumor in the inguino-pubic-ano-genital area measuring 350/80/40 mm, which appeared 15 years ago and grew gradually leading to local rickety hygiene and also to depression, especially in the last time period when the tumor grew faster. The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic was affective disorder due to general medical condition. Surgical exams concluded it was a giant exophytic tumor and was recommended a pre-operative abdominal CT scan, which did not revealed metastatic spread. The treatment consisted in wide radical excision into the tumor-free resection margins. Anatomopathological exam concluded condyloma acuminatum - Buschke-Lowenstein tumor (BLT), a very rare borderline tumor. In post-operative period, progress of depression was spectacular, with the full mental recovery by decreasing the antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, fact that strengthen the initial diagnostic of depression due to a general medical condition. Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with BLT may develop mental disorders especially with devaluation and low self-esteem, social withdrawal and secondary functional impairment. Due to the malignancy risk in such tumors and also the psychiatric unfavorable recovery prognostic in case of continuous general medical condition, the only effective treatment is tumor resection with surgical, oncological, psychiatric postoperative revaluation.

KW  - Ecological philosophy of science
KW  - Ecological language philosophy
AB  - Beginning with three preliminary considerations - on the factual role of prejudices (Section 1), on the relation of nature and culture (Section 2) and on the importance of logic (Section 3) - I compare the logical point of view with the ecological point of view for a new understanding of the philosophy of science (Section 4), the core of which is a theory of knowledge. In this view science is an evolutionarily late type of the Batesonian ecosystems of the mind that nevertheless follow many of the old systemic structures developed in the earlier ecosystems of matter. A problem is that in the past decades we have become used to the Kuhnian description of sciences as paradigmatic or longing for a paradigm-change. This entails the mistake of replacing the overall important value of truth by the concept of power (Section 5) which is unacceptable for an ecological point of view. In the ecological view we gain a new criterion for the dependency of science from the surrounding systems (as politics or economics) by judging its relative intactness in pursuing its scientific goals (Section 6). Language is a most important means for structuring human knowledge and science, but linguistics has not yet contributed much to its theory because of the deficits of the language sciences (Section 7). The ecology of language could repair that by resuming and developing ideas of the Humboldtian tradition (Section 8) which have been lost by the Saussurian and Chomskyan schools, especially that of restoring the environments of the language-systems to its important rights. Unfortunately, many ecolinguists do not recognize the importance of the ecological ideas for a progress in the theory of language and even grammar (Section 9). Therefore the power of change that is included in the ecolinguistic perspective - not only to supply a growing core of linguistic knowledge by some ecological additions but to replace it by a better linguistics (Section 10) - is often underrated.

AB  - The recent public outcry following a brutal gang rape of a young woman in India's national capital was a watershed moment in the world's largest democracy. It generated widespread public and political support for strengthening legal provisions to punish sex offenders. Although the legal response is a useful deterrent against such heinous crimes, women continue to suffer due to deeply rooted social prejudices that make them vulnerable to violence and discrimination in society. In this commentary, we aim to analyse the current developments with respect to gender violence in India within a background of the social position of women in Indian society. Using secondary data related to sex-selective abortions and crimes against women, and a critical review of the portrayal of women in Indian cinema, we reflect on the role of health workers, researchers and public health professionals in shaping a social response towards improving gender parity in our country.

AB  - Objectives: Prejudice against transgender people is evident around the world with discrimination in many aspects of life, including access to health care. Even in Thailand, where male-to-female (MTF) transgender people are particularly visible and society is reputedly accepting, barriers to attaining appropriate health care still exist. The vast majority of MTF transgender people in Thailand are reported to be taking hormone therapy; however, most do not seek medical advice regarding these regimens, with the initiation and tailoring of medication often being guided by sympathetic peers instead. The objectives of this review are to consider hormone therapy in the context of the Thai population and provide recommendations regarding ways to improve practice and reduce health risks. Methods: The data analysis in this article represents a comprehensive literature review regarding hormone therapy for MTF transgender people including the guidelines for initiation, prescribing, and monitoring of hormone therapy, risks for serious adverse events and reported hormone use by the MTF transgender population in Thailand. Results: There is a notable lack of published research regarding hormone therapy in the transgender population. Guidelines, whilst relying considerably on expert opinion, do provide clear recommendations on the initiation, maintenance and monitoring of hormone therapy. Comparison of endocrine guidelines with reported practice in Thailand reveals significant opportunities for improvement in MTF transgender hormone therapy. Conclusions: The incautious use of hormone therapy may represent a considerable health risk behavior undoubtedly contributing to the morbidity and mortality in MTF transgender people. Although there is currently considerable focus on sexually transmitted infections in the MTF transgender population, a more comprehensive approach to health care is required, including education for transgender people and the health professionals who attend to them regarding appropriate hormone therapy.

Method: This is a qualitative inquiry based on data collected after informed consent from five female informants using in-depth interviews and focus groups. Presentation of results and discussion: The data revealed that our informants experienced social, physical/verbal and sexual abuse to which they adopt coping strategies such as help-seeking, avoidance, confrontation, confidence building and an exchange of sympathy. Conclusion: Disabled women in Ghana still face various forms of abuse that appear to be generally accepted because of cultural beliefs and norms, and they employ various strategies to cope with abuse and sustain their female identity. There is the need for awareness programmes at all societal levels to eradicate prejudices and practices that expose disabled women to abuse.

AB  - In four studies we examine the associations between religiosity, global citizenship identification, and various kinds of values (e.g., exclusionary, prosocial). Across the studies, general trends emerged showing that religiosity is unrelated to global citizenship identification, and positively related to exclusionary values (e.g., sexual prejudice, ethnocentrism, restricting outgroups). However, examination of the varied motivations to be religious (i.e., intrinsic, extrinsic, quest) showed that quest religious motivation is positively related to global citizenship identification, as well as inclusionary and prosocial values. Furthermore, quest religious motivation was found to positively influence the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification.

AB  - There has been intense debate in Australia regarding how asylum seekers who arrive by boat should be treated. Some call for compassion towards those prepared to risk their lives to seek protection, whereas others believe 'boat people' should not be allowed into the country. This article uses data from a large representative sample of young people in Queensland, Australia, to understand the acceptance of asylum seekers by young people in Australia. The findings suggest that young Australians are more accepting than the Australian adult population. Several social and political background factors were also found to be associated with the belief that 'boat people' should be permitted into Australia. Fewer factors, however, are associated with the trust young Australians have in people from another country. This suggests that while some young Australians may believe boats carrying asylum seekers should not be turned away, fewer might be prepared to enter into trusting relationships with 'boat people' should they resettle in Australia.

AB  - Much published research indicates that voting behavior in the 2008 presidential election and evaluations of Barack Obama were importantly influenced by anti-Black sentiment. Various psychological theories made opposing predictions as to whether exposure to the first Black president during his first term would strengthen or weaken the alignment between general attitudes toward African Americans and evaluations of the president in particular. Using data from national surveys conducted in 2008, 2009-2010, and 2012, we compared the associations of prejudice toward Blacks with presidential approval in those years and with electoral choices in 2008 and 2012. As predicted by theories of individuation, attitudes toward Blacks became increasingly disconnected from evaluations of Mr. Obama and from people's electoral choices over time. However, levels of prejudice against Blacks rose between 2008 and 2012. Because of this increased prejudice and the diminishing individual-level influence of attitudes toward Blacks on electoral choices, prejudice toward Blacks seems to have reduced Mr. Obama's vote share in the 2012 election by about the same extent as in 2008.

AB  - Heterosexism and heteronormativity are pervasive in the South African society, but to what degree are they present in Life Orientation (LO) textbooks? This question, explored through a content analysis of widely used Grade 10 LO textbooks, was framed by queer theory. The paper quantitatively examines the coverage of sexualities, and qualitatively examines how sexualities are constructed and projected in the texts. The quantitative analysis reveals a low percentage of statements devoted to sexuality overall and the normalisation of heterosexuality mainly through the exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) sexualities but also through techniques of differentiation, hierarchisation and homogenisation. The qualitative analysis reveals inadequate information about sexualities and in its place a simplistic, moralistic ideological approach. Furthermore, discussions of the family, dating, safe sex and marriage assume heterosexuality as the norm. Nineteen years after the democratisation of South Africa and 17 years after the ratification of South Africa's constitution which explicitly forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, LGBT sexualities are largely invisible in school LO curricula. Since this is a subject that is compulsory for all learners and its express aim is to prepare young South Africans for participation as citizens in a just and democratic society, the absence of LGBT issues and identities helps perpetuate prejudice and violence towards LGBT communities.

AB  - Background: People who identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) have specific health needs. Sexual orientation and gender identity are social determinants of health, as homophobia and heteronormativity persist as prejudices in society. LGBT patients often experience discrimination and prejudice in health care settings. While recent South African policies recognise the need for providing LGBT specific health care, no curricula for teaching about LGBT health related issues exist in South African health sciences faculties. This study aimed to determine the extent to which LGBT health related content is taught in the University of Cape Town's medical curriculum.
   Methods: A curriculum mapping exercise was conducted through an online survey of all academic staff at the UCT health sciences faculty, determining LGBT health related content, pedagogical methodology and assessment.
   Results: 127 academics, across 31 divisions and research units in the Faculty of Health Sciences, responded to the survey, of which 93 completed the questionnaire. Ten taught some content related to LGBT health in the MBChB curriculum. No LGBT health related content was taught in the allied health sciences curricula. The MBChB curriculum provided no opportunity for students to challenge their own attitudes towards LGBT patients, and key LGBT health topics such as safer sex, mental health, substance abuse and adolescent health were not addressed.
   Conclusion: At present, UCTs health sciences curricula do not adequately address LGBT specific health issues. Where LGBT health related content is taught in the MBChB curriculum, it is largely discretionary, unsystematic and not incorporated into the overarching structure. Coordinated initiatives to integrate LGBT health related content into all health sciences curricula should be supported, and follow an approach that challenges students to develop professional attitudes and behaviour concerning care for patients from LGBT backgrounds, as well as providing them with specific LGBT health knowledge. Educating health professions students on the health needs of LGBT people is essential to improving this population's health by providing competent and non-judgmental care.

KW  - Authoritarism
AB  - Racism and racial prejudice, considered a relic of obsolete and outdated social systems, is emerging in the depths of ultra-modern Western societies with different characteristics from the past but with a surprising and worrying virulence. These waves of prejudice and racism testify to the many fears that fill the horizons of advanced societies, undermining not only their internal reliability, but also just their democratic settings. This paper presents a critical review of Islamophobia as a racial prejudice, showing that two main definitions are at work: Islamophobia as xeno-racism or linked to the so-called clash of civilizations. Then, it presents the outcomes coming from a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) survey led among a representative sample of the Italian population (n = 1,523) on Antisemitic and Islamophobic attitudes. The cogency and structure of anti-Muslim public discourse and connected mass attitudes, revealed by our investigation, confirm the emergency of these two relevant dimensions of Islamophobia, which claim for a more accurate definition of Islamophobia. Moreover, the distribution of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic attitudes illustrate an interesting overlapping of Islamophobia and Antisemitism which claims that racism is multi-targeted and that there is not so much options between Antisemitism and Islamophobia. Finally, we use three main variables-anomie, ethnocentrism, and authoritarianism-as predictors of Islamophobia and Antisemitism. We tested the strength of these three predictors with the aid of path technique based on multiple regression analysis, which helps to determine the direct and indirect impacts of certain independent variables on dependent variables in a hypothetical causal system.

AB  - Income inequality undermines societies: The more inequality, the more health problems, social tensions, and the lower social mobility, trust, life expectancy. Given people's tendency to legitimate existing social arrangements, the stereotype content model (SCM) argues that ambivalence?perceiving many groups as either warm or competent, but not both?may help maintain socio-economic disparities. The association between stereotype ambivalence and income inequality in 37 cross-national samples from Europe, the Americas, Oceania, Asia, and Africa investigates how groups' overall warmth-competence, status-competence, and competition-warmth correlations vary across societies, and whether these variations associate with income inequality (Gini index). More unequal societies report more ambivalent stereotypes, whereas more equal ones dislike competitive groups and do not necessarily respect them as competent. Unequal societies may need ambivalence for system stability: Income inequality compensates groups with partially positive social images.

AB  - Using a mixed-method approach of econometric and ethnographic field research, this article examines the social and economic costs and benefits of increases in soybean production in the Brazilian Amazon. Statistical analysis suggests that increased soy production both reduces poverty indicators and raises median rural incomes, but is also associated with increased measures of inequality. Qualitative fieldwork sheds light on the wider political and social causes and consequences of this increasing inequality, pointing to ethnic differences between large soy farmers and local populations that raise long standing prejudices and tensions.

TI  - The Specter of "Godless Jewry": Secularism and the "Jewish Question" in Late Nineteenth-Century Germany
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - When asked to provide his own solution to the Jewish Question for a 1907 survey, the journalist and philosopher Fritz Mauthner responded, I do not know how to give an answer to your question, because I do not know which Jewish question you mean. The Jewish question is posed differently by every questioner, differently at every time, differently at every location. While untypical for its time, Mauthner's viewpoint is shared by many scholars who write todaynot one but a myriad of Jewish Questions proliferated in nineteenth-century Germany and, indeed, across the globe. The dramas they framed could be transposed onto many stages, because talk about the purported virtues and vices of Jews had the remarkable ability to latch onto and thereby produce meaning for a wide range of public debates. By plumbing this excess of meaning, scholars have teased out some of the key dynamics and antinomies of modern political thought. No longer focusing solely on conservative antisemitism, they have examined the role of the Jewish Question in other political movements, such as liberalism and socialism, and in the conceptual elaboration of the state, civil society, and the nation. Cast in ambivalent roles at once powerful and vulnerable, familiar and foreign, the figure of the Jew acted as a lightning rod for imagining such collectivities. Opposing parties shared common assumptions, such as the tacit understanding that integration into the nation, state, or civil society required a self-transformation of Jews, something historians have referred to as the emancipation contract. Generally speaking, it was the terms of this contract rather than its form that divided liberals from conservatives, philo- from antisemites, and Jews from non-Jews in the nineteenth-century. Accordingly, scholars now increasingly approach the Jewish Question not merely as an example of prejudice, but rather as a framework through which multiple parties elaborated their positions.

AB  - Background: American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women have lower breast cancer (BCA) screening and 5-year survival rates than non-Hispanic Whites. Understanding reasons for low screening rates is important to combatting later stage diagnoses. The purpose of this study was to assess mammography experiences and satisfaction among AI/AN women.
   Methods: Nine focus groups were held with rural (N = 15) and urban (N = 38) AI/AN women 40 years and older in Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, living both near and far from Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal facilities, to examine experiences and satisfaction with mammography. Transcripts were coded and themes identified using a community-based participatory research approach.
   Findings: Themes were classified under knowledge, communication, and awareness of BCA; barriers to mammography; mammogram facility size; impressions of mammogram technologist; motivations for getting a mammogram; and how to improve the mammogram experience. Participants had knowledge of prevention, but described cultural reasons for not discussing it and described better experiences in smaller facilities. Participants indicated having a mammogram technologist who was friendly, knowledgeable, respectful, competent, and explained the test was a determining factor in satisfaction. Other factors included family history, physician recommendation, and financial incentives. Barriers included transportation, cost, perceptions of prejudice, and time constraints. Participants on reservations or near IHS facilities preferred IHS over mainstream providers. Suggestions for improvement included caring technologists, better machines with less discomfort, and education.
   Conclusions: Interventions to enhance the professionalism, empathy, and cultural awareness of mammogram technologists; reduce barriers; and provide positive expectations and incentives could improve satisfaction and compliance with screening mammography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Contact with the dominant group can increase opposition, among the disadvantaged, to social policies that would benefit their group. This effect can be explained in terms of contact promoting support for an ideology of meritocracy, which privileges the distribution of societal resources based on individual merit, rather than group-level disadvantage. We tested this ideological mechanism in a large, nationally representative sample of Maori (a disadvantaged group in New Zealand; N = 1,008). Positive intergroup contact with the dominant group (New Zealand Europeans) predicted increased opposition to a topical reparative policy (Maori ownership of the foreshore), and this was fully mediated by increased support for the ideology of meritocracy. Intergroup contact may enable the ideological legitimation of inequality among members of disadvantaged groups, engendering political attitudes that are detrimental to their group's interests. Contact with ingroup members had the opposite effect, increasing support for reparative policy by reducing subscription to meritocratic ideology.

AB  - Building on an integration of research findings on intergroup behavior from multiple fields of scientific inquiry (biological and cultural paleoanthropology, social psychology), as well as research on the HEXACO personality framework (e.g., Ashton & Lee, 2007), 3 independent studies (total N = 1,007) were conducted to introduce and test a fresh personality perspective on human xenophilia. Even though the studies focused on different criteria (Study 1: favorable attitudes toward contact with immigrants, Study 2: habitual cross-cultural exploration, Study 3: favorable attitudes toward contact with indigenous people) and employed different operationalizations of major personality traits (the HEXACO Personality Inventory Revised [HEXACO-PI-R], the 10-item Big Five Inventory [BFI-10]) results were remarkably similar. First, path analyses confirmed that major personality traits were significant and direct predictors of xenophilia that were independent of the contributions of individual differences commonly predicting xenophobic reactions across studies. Second, and in line with the authors' more specific hypotheses, hierarchical regression analyses also corroborated that individual differences in the levels of endeavorrelated personality traits (i.e., eXtraversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness) had a substantially greater power in predicting individual differences in xenophilia than individual differences in levels of altruism/cooperation-related traits (i.e., Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, and Agreeableness). The implications of these findings for more general psychological theorizing on human sociality are discussed.

AB  - Constructive dialogues on race have been proposed as a means to heal racial and ethnic divides, reduce prejudice and misinformation, increase racial literacy, and foster improved race relations. Studies on the psychology of racial dialogues indicate social and academic norms that dictate against race talk between White Americans and persons of color: (a) the politeness protocol, (b) the academic protocol, and (c) the color-blind protocol. These protocols discourage race talk and allow society to enter into a conspiracy of silence regarding the detrimental impact oppression plays on persons of color. Facilitating difficult dialogues on race requires educators to recognize what makes such discussions difficult. For people of color, engaging in race talk exposes them to microaggressions that invalidate and assail their racial/ethnic identities. For Whites, honest discussions are impeded by fears of appearing racist, of realizing their racism, of acknowledging White privilege, and of taking responsibility to combat racism.

AB  - This article underlines and draws attention to critical insights that Esposito makes regarding the prospects of rethinking community in a globalized world. Alongside Agamben and Nancy, Esposito challenges the property prejudice found in mainstream models of community. In identity politics, collective identity is converted into a form of communal property. Borders, sovereign territories, and exclusive rights are fiercely defended in the name of communal property. Esposito responds to this problem by developing what I call a deontological communal contract where being and ethics are prioritized over having and economics. I examine this new perspective on community in relation to mainstream models found in contemporary and classical social theory.

AB  - Late in the twentieth century public opinion began to turn against the Australian suburb, as its enemies began to outnumber its friends. For more than 150 years, Australia was itself a mental suburb of England, taking many of its ideas ready-made from the world's metropolis, London. This article identifies the main ideological strands of the suburban idea as it first appeared in EnglandEvangelicalism, Romanticism, Sanitarianism, and Class Prejudiceand examines how they were reproduced, with occasional variations, in the colonial city. Critics of the suburban idea, it is argued, shared many of the tacit assumptions of its friends, differing only in the value they assigned to each component. Anti-suburbanism, even in its contemporary forms, continues to reproduce many features of its nineteenth-century antecedents.

AB  - Two complementary explanations have been offered by social psychologists to account for the universal hold of national identity, first that national identity is ideologically assumed, as it forms the "banal' background of everyday life, and second that national identity is "hotly' constructed and contested in political and everyday settings to great effect. However, "banal' and "hot' aspects of national identity have been found to be distributed unevenly across national and subnational groups and banality itself can be strategically used to distinguish between different groups. The present paper develops these ideas by examining possible reasons for these different modes and strategies of identity expression. Drawing upon intergroup theories of minority and majority relations, we examine how a group who see themselves unequivocally as a minority, Irish Travellers, talk about their national identity in comparison to an age and gender-matched sample of Irish students. We find that Travellers proactively display and claim "hot' national identity in order to establish their Irishness. Irish students "do banality', police the boundaries and reputation of Irishness, and actively reject and disparage proactive displays of Irishness. The implications for discursive understandings of identity, the study of intra-national group relations and policies of minority inclusion are discussed.

AB  - The non-conventional spellings found in letters written in French before the 19th century by people whose business was not writing tend to be summarily dismissed as fautes d'orthographe, attributable to the ignorance and even lack of intelligence of the writer. Such attitudes have led to the discarding of potentially valuable material for investigating language variation in the past and for deepening our understanding of the multi-facetted process of sound change. Happily, linguists concerned with variation and change are now overthrowing this prejudice and have begun assembling corpora of such letters from the 17th and 18th centuries. Few texts of this type survive from earlier periods, but we shall see here that some are to be found in the personal letters sent to Marie de Guise, when she was queen and queen-regent in Scotland (1538-1560). In this essay we will look at one of them in detail, focusing on the non-conventional spellings we find there, to discover what they might tell us (a) about the writer's spoken language and (b) about her approach to vernacular spelling. It looks as though the writer deliberately elaborated her own eclectic but highly coherent spelling system, through which she sought to express her individual social identity, in the same way as people seem always to have done with their personal hand-writing.

AB  - We introduce a novel ageism scale, focusing on prescriptive beliefs concerning potential intergenerational tensions: active, envied resource succession, symbolic identity avoidance, and passive, shared-resource consumption (SIC). Four studies (2,010 total participants) were Used to develop the scale. Exploratory factor analysis formed an initial 20-item, 3-factor solution (Study 1). The scale converges appropriately with other prejudice measures and diverges from other social control measures (Study 2). It diverges from antiyouth ageism (Study 3). The Study 4 experiment yielded both predictive and divergent validity apropos another ageism measure. Structural equation modeling confirmed model fit across all studies. Per an intergenerational-tension focus, younger people consistently scored the highest. As generational equity issues intensify, the scale provides a contemporary tool for current and future ageism research.

AB  - This study examines the interrelationships amongst and between news attention, education, and political tolerance. Based on the theoretical presumption that the mainstream news media tend to reflect the prejudices and ideologies of the dominant groups in a society, news portrayal of groups regarded as deviant and/or controversial can be expected to be negative in valence. Hence, news attention is expected to lead to more negative attitudes toward such groups, which in turn breeds intolerance toward them. Meanwhile, education may moderate the relationship between news attention and tolerance. Research questions and hypotheses are examined through analyzing the data from a representative survey conducted in Hong Kong. The findings confirm the negative, indirect effect of news attention on tolerance through attitude toward deviant groups. Education is also found to relate to tolerance in a complicated and contradictory manner: while education has a direct positive effect on tolerance, it also strengthens the negative impact that attitude toward deviant groups has on tolerance. The theoretical and social implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - This study assesses and compares, in an Australian context, four explanations which have emerged to explain punitive attitudes. Each purports these attitudes have different origins: concerns over crime and a lack of trust in the state to deal with it (crime-distrust' model); a desire to reinforce social cohesion or express discontent with society (social discontent' model); an outlet for dissatisfaction over one's own life (personal discontent' model); and a wish to suppress or express prejudice towards disliked racial minorities (racial animus' model). The study finds support for each of the crime-distrust, social discontent and racial animus models (but not the personal discontent model). Despite rarely being considered in Australia, it also suggest that social discontent and racial animus may have as great, if not greater, an impact on punitiveness as concerns over crime and the state's response to it.

AB  - Previous work has documented that humans categorize robots as members of different social groups, thereby using socially relevant cues such as a robot's alleged gender or nationality. Importantly, these social categorization processes affect impressions people form about robots. In an experiment with N = 45 participants, we utilized a minimal-group paradigm and tested whether categorizing the humanoid robot NAO as an in-group member vs. an out-group member based on socially non-relevant features would result in higher levels of anthropomorphism and more positive evaluations of the robot. Innovatively, to assess anthropomorphism, we utilized an implicit measurement procedure. Results support our hypotheses: Perceived in-group membership with the robot resulted in a greater extent of anthropomorphic inferences about the robot and more positive evaluations. Moreover, compared to the out-group condition, participants who perceived NAO as an in-group member showed greater willingness to interact with robots in general.

AB  - Recent work demonstrated that whereas high-status and low-status group members seek to address cross-group commonalities during intergroup contact, members of low-status groups show a greater desire to discuss status differences between the groups. Drawing on social identity theory, the current research investigated the combined influence of status legitimacy and status stability on these contact preferences. In Study 1, perceived stability and perceived legitimacy were measured among members of a high-status ethnic group in Israel. In Study 2, group status, status stability, and status legitimacy were experimentally manipulated in a U.S. sample. Although they generally preferred to discuss commonalities over status differences, across studies high-status group members' willingness to discuss status differences increased when they perceived the hierarchy as illegitimate but stable. By contrast, low-status group members were particularly inclined to address status differences and least interested in discussing commonalties, when the hierarchy was illegitimate and unstable.

AB  - Purpose
   Anti-obesity prejudices affect the quality of care obese individuals receive. The authors sought to determine the prevalence of weight-related biases among medical students and whether they were aware of their biases.
   Method
   Between 2008 and 2011, the authors asked all third-year medical students at Wake Forest School of Medicine to complete the Weight Implicit Association Test (IAT), a validated measure of implicit preferences for fat or thin individuals. Students also answered a semantic differential item assessing their explicit weight-related preferences. The authors determined students' awareness of their biases by examining the correlation between students' explicit preferences and their IAT scores.
   Results
   Of 354 medical students, 310 (88%) completed valid surveys and consented to participate. Overall, 33% (101/310) self-reported a significant (moderate or strong) explicit anti-fat bias. No students self-reported a significant explicit anti-thin bias. According to the IAT scores, over half of students had a significant implicit weight bias: 39% (121/310) had an anti-fat bias and 17% (52/310) an anti-thin bias. Two-thirds of students (67%, 81/121) were unaware of their implicit anti-fat bias. Only male gender predicted an explicit anti-fat bias (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.8-5.3). No demographic factors were associated with an implicit anti-fat bias. Students' explicit and implicit biases were not correlated (Pearson r = 0.03, P = .58).
   Conclusions
   Over one-third of medical students had a significant implicit anti-fat bias; few were aware of that bias. Accordingly, medical schools' obesity curricula should address weight-related biases and their potential impact on care.

AB  - Between 1820 and 1900 about 48,500 English-born spent at least some of their lives in Fall River, Massachusetts. The big attraction was the cotton mills, which, at their peak (1875-1900) were regarded as the textile production centre of the world. The majority of the English born hailed from Lancashire and Cheshire and accounted for almost every member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE) branch at the time. The branch existed for only six years, the shortest lifespan of any in the USA, and the reasons for its closure form the focus of this paper. These are identified as: a lack of branch secretary training, a high turnover of secretaries and other internal administrators, and, probably the most significant, the industrial and social turmoil branch members and their families found themselves in, with the parallel effects on members' motivation and willingness to remain in the locale. Fall River during the last quarter of the century witnessed a very high population turnover and by the 1880s some people were staying only three or four months. The social turmoil manifested itself in poverty, prejudice, appalling housing conditions, sanitation and constant hunger. The industrial conflict was principally due to the determined power of the industrialists to kill off English-style trade unionism before it got established in New England. A contributory factor to the friction was also the fact that the Lancashire workers in Fall River were treated with a mixture of contempt, arrogance, and fear by the mill managers, and in turn regarded the Fall River mill owners as 'shoddyites' as they flooded the market with cheap goods, paid the lowest wages in the locale and supported appalling working conditions. The Fall River strife, however, may have reflected a wider problem. One estimate suggests that in the United States business was disrupted, usually by strikes, on 22,793 occasions between 1875 and 1900. The work provides biographical details of (English) ASE individuals who, having emigrated from the UK, found themselves embroiled in the environmental turmoil, with its parallel consequences for assimilation, acculturation, and the decisions of whether to stay or not.

AB  - Objective: to explore research knowledge about lesbian women's experiences with health-care providers in the birthing context.
   Method: a systematic search for relevant qualitative studies in selected databases identified 13 articles of sufficient quality. The findings were synthesized using a meta-ethnographic approach as described by Noblit and Hare.
   Synthesis and findings: issues related to covert or overt homophobia and prejudice were demonstrated and were sometimes mediated by subtle mechanisms that were difficult to understand and to manage. On the other hand, small gestures of support were described to make a huge difference. A lack of knowledge was demonstrated, contrasted by staff showing a positive and informed attitude. Disclosure was an important issue, but due to the risk involved the women demonstrated a need to be in control. Finally, being acknowledged, both as individuals and as family were considered vital. In this regard, it was essential to recognize and include co-mother as equal parent and to look upon lesbian sexuality as normal and natural.
   Key conclusions: midwives' emotional involvement in the situation is significant for moral perception of the women's intimate citizenship, even when they are distressed by lesbian sexuality.
   Implications for practice: our findings reveal the importance of including sexuality as an issue deserving reflection in maternity wards, whether or not this might cause unrest in midwives who do not feel comfortable with intimate citizenships beyond mainstream.

AB  - Brazil has had high indices of traffic injuries and deaths since the 1950s, mostly related to the increasing and irresponsible use of the automobile. Upon approval of the Brazilian Transit Code (CTB) in 1997, traffic injuries and deaths began to diminish, despite an increase in vehicle fleet size, a phenomenon that had never occurred previously. Concurrently, starting in 1991 and with a great intensity after 1996, there has been a sizeable increase in motorcycle production and use, facilitated and encouraged by public officials. Between 1995 and 2000 annual sales figures for motorcycles doubled and reached 2 million units in 2008. Traffic deaths associated with motorcycles increased exponentially, rising from 725 in 2006 to 10,143 in 2010, eliminating the advances gained by the CTB in reducing auto-related injuries. This article analyses the process and its impacts on road safety. The first part summarises the main public policy decisions related to the theme. Part two analyses changes in traffic safety after the introduction of this new technology. Part three looks at the possible political, economic and social motives that lie behind this process. The final part suggests solutions to the great prejudice caused to society and the nation.

AB  - The Chronic Illness Anticipated Stigma Scale (CIASS) was developed to measure anticipated stigma (i.e., expectations of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination) among people living with chronic illnesses. The CIASS is a 12-item scale with three subscales differentiating among sources of anticipated stigma, including friends and family members, work colleagues, and healthcare workers. Results support the reliability, validity, and generalizability of the CIASS in two samples of people living with chronic illnesses. The CIASS was correlated with other stigma-related constructs as well as indicators of mental health, physical health, and health behaviors. The CIASS can help researchers gauge the degree to which people living with chronic illnesses anticipate stigma, better understand the processes by which anticipated stigma contributes to the health and behavior of people living with chronic illnesses, and compare the extent to which people living with different types of chronic illnesses anticipate stigma.

AB  - Past research suggested that the strong relationship between having high levels of religiosity and/or political conservatism and harboring a high level of negativity toward homosexuals often is accounted for by the strength of individuals' authoritarian views. In an effort to build upon this extant research, the goal of this study was to examine the way in which components of authoritarianism mediate the relationship between religiosity and political conservatism and homonegativity. To achieve this goal, a recently developed modality of path analysis that allows for the effect of one independent variable on another to be controlled was used. Because preliminary analyses indicated that attitudes toward same-sex marriage and homonegativity demonstrated multicollinearity, a composite measure was created. Results suggested that the overall strength of the relationship between religiosity and political conservatism with homonegativity remains statistically significant, even after accounting for three components of authoritarianism and the potential effect of social desirability. These authoritarianism components also had a significant indirect effect on the strength of the relationship between religiosity and homonegativity, with authoritarian submission and conventionalism fully mediating this relationship. Implications of these findings were discussed.

AB  - It is impossible to consider the impact of anti-discrimination law on persons with mental disabilities without a full understanding of how sanism permeates all aspects of the legal system - judicial opinions, legislation, the role of lawyers, juror decision-making - and the entire fabric of society. For those unfamiliar with the term, I define "sanism" as an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry,(1) that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: litigants, fact finders, counsel, and expert and lay witnesses.(2)
   Notwithstanding over two decades of anti-discrimination laws(3) and, in many jurisdictions, an impressive corpus of constitutional case law and state statutes,(4) the attitudes of judges, jurors and lawyers often reflect the same level of bigotry that defined this area of law half a century ago.(5) The reasons for this are complex and, to a great extent, flow from centuries of prejudice - often hidden prejudice, often socially acceptable prejudice(6) - that has persisted in spite of prophylactic legislative and judicial reforms, and - at least superficially - an apparent uptick in public awareness. I have railed multiple times about the "irrational," "corrosive", "malignant" and "ravaging" effects of sanism, but its "pernicious power" still poisons all of mental disability law.(7)
   The recently-ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is the most revolutionary international human rights document - ever - that applies to persons with disabilities. The Disability Convention furthers the human rights approach to disability and recognizes the right of people with disabilities to equality in most every aspect of life. It firmly endorses a social model of disability - a clear and direct repudiation of the medical model that traditionally was part-and-parcel of mental disability law. It calls for "respect for inherent dignity" and "non-discrimination." Subsequent articles declare "freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," "freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse," and a right to protection of the "integrity of the person."
   In this paper, I consider the impact that the Convention is likely to have on sanism. First, I will briefly discuss both our sanist past and our sanist present. Then, I will consider how the CRPD has the greatest potential for combating sanism, and for changing social attitudes. In this latter inquiry, I will also draw on the tools of therapeutic jurisprudence. Then, I will offer some brief and modest conclusions.

AB  - People cope with social exclusion both by seeking reconnection with familiar individuals and by denigrating unfamiliar and disliked others. These reactions can be seen as adaptive responses in ancestral environments where ostracism exposed people to physical dangers and even death. To the extent that reactions to ostracism evolved to minimize exposure to danger, alleviating these foundational concerns with danger may lessen people's need to cope with exclusion. Three studies demonstrate how a novel physical invulnerability simulation lessens both positive and negative reactions to social exclusion. Study 1 found that simulating physical invulnerability lessened exclusion-triggered negative attitudes toward stigmatized groups, and demonstrated that perceived invulnerability to injury (vs. imperviousness to pain) accounted for this effect. Studies 2 and 3 focused on another facet of social bias by revealing that simulating physical invulnerability lessened rejected participants' desires for social connection. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Interest in religion within the field of community psychology has steadily emerged within the last three decades. This interest has focused almost exclusively on the social benefits of religion, glossing over the often-contentious nature of religious life and the ways in which religious individuals and institutions can disrupt healthy human and community development. Considering the recent surge of interfaith conflicts and discriminatory practices targeting religious minorities in communities across the United States, it is imperative that community psychologists begin to examine relevant trends in interfaith relations and potential directions for action research and intervention. This paper serves as the beginning point of just such an examination, proposing a multilevel model for addressing the microsystemic, mesosystemic, and macrosystemic levels of interfaith phenomena. More specifically, I present interfaith contact, congregation-based community partnerships, and theological belief systems as particularly relevant to interfaith community research and intervention. Finally, I detail an interfaith organization that embodies these dimensions of interfaith relations and provides a concrete example of how a multilevel action research model may be effectively employed.

AB  - Psychological research on beliefs, values, worldview, and ideology has been limited by inadequate structural models to organize the plethora of constructs. The present studies investigate the potential of a dimensional model based on lexical, dictionary-represented -ism concepts to form an organizing structural model. Four isms factors found previously in college samples are shown to replicate in community-sample data with better controls for acquiescent responding. But analyses also reveal a 5th factor involving egalitarianism and inequality-aversion, increasing the comprehensiveness of the structural model. Relations of frequently used constructs (values, authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) to the isms dimensions are detailed, demonstrating both the integrative and value-adding potentials of the model. The possibility of potential additional nonlexical factors (Trust in Government, Ethnocentrism, Xenophobia, and Nativism) is evaluated. Factors identified in these studies are demonstrated to show interesting relations with political-party preference, subjective well-being, and change over time in the Big Five personality dimensions.

AB  - People's understanding of their own situation, ideas about a better life and strategies for achieving their visions are influenced, among other things, by religious values and beliefs, with implications for the objectives and strategies of state and non-government development actors. Semi-ethnographic research in two slum settlements in Pune, Maharashtra, sought to understand whether and how religion influenced and shaped people's ideas about how to pursue development. The research focused on poor Hindu and Buddhist Dalit communities. Unsurprisingly, the people interviewed linked their lack of social and economic development to caste prejudice. Despite agreement that caste was a barrier to equality, however, different responses to it were expressed. Building upon ideas put forth by Appadurai (2004), we analyse the ways in which people exercise varying forms of non-economic capital to achieve social recognition and equality, which are believed to underpin development more generally.

AB  - Consistent with current emotion theory, we should note that contempt is not a homogeneous category but rather shows intracategorial variability. Previous research on Spanish samples shows a communicative structure in which contempt is felt towards intimate, social or abstract receivers, for reciprocal, altruistic or prejudiced reasons. Our objective was to test, on a large and heterogeneous sample, the previously found structure and variations of the experience of contempt as well as its spontaneous facial expression. Testing the association of contempt varieties with certain subject attributes was a secondary goal. Results from 130 participants from the Spanish general population corroborated the previously found structure and varieties, as well as the associations between contempt receiver and attribution. No relation was found with sex, age or emotion recognition ability. As to spontaneous facial expression, disgust was more often expressed by those who narrated their personal episodes of contempt for reciprocal reasons, and was less often expressed by the people who described prejudiced scenarios. This result indicates that the conventionally considered facial expression of contempt is not the only one, as already stated by Darwin, and should not be considered as such by experimental and psychometric procedures.

KW  - SEX WORK
AB  - In the last decades of the twentieth century, a major change has occurred in the public understanding of prostitution, with the focus shifting from the sex worker to the client. On the social scientific side, studies on clients have growingly shed light on motivations and behaviors of men who buy sex. On the juridical-political side, in many countries across the globe a trend has emerged towards the criminalization of clients, represented as responsible for the perpetuation and proliferation of the sex market and for its oppressive and victimizing effects on sex workers. The aim of this paper is to retrace this turn and to discuss its political and cultural meaning, showing how the discourse on male responsibility in prostitution involves the risk of unilateral stances and partial views on the sex market. What I argue is that new gender-sensitive thinking on prostitution is needed, context-rooted and free from prejudicial understandings.

AB  - This essay interrogates the nature, limits, and effects of the juxtaposition of Great Britain and Melanesia that takes place in Pat Barker's The Ghost Road (1995), the final installment of the much-lauded Regeneration trilogy. Published two years before the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China, which marked the unofficial end of the British Empire, and four years after the end of the neocolonial charade of the first Gulf War, The Ghost Road brings its readers back to the beginning of the twentieth century, cannily meshing a carefully researched portrayal of the First World War with its protagonist's dreams and memories of a Melanesian society suffocating under the oppressive weight of colonial law. Drawing on Paul Gilroy's concept of postcolonial melancholia, we read the success of the Booker Prize-winning novel as reflecting a deep-seated anxiety about the downfall of empire(s) that continues to characterize political life in the West. The novel's strength lies in the way it highlights the insidious workings of class prejudices on the front lines, the complex matrix of sexuality, duty, and friendship that defined relationships between men in the trenches, and the reshuffling of traditional gender roles that the war brought about both at home and abroad. In spite of its merits, however, the transformative and challenging confrontation with the human cost of Britain's imperial transgressions that The Ghost Road offers is consistently deferred and masked behind its more visible portrayal of the melancholic fantasy of a racially homogenous, tragic, and exclusively Western First World War.

KW  - TAXES
AB  - This article explores the effectiveness of legal interventions to promote healthier eating/drinking and exercise in responding to obesity. Undue emphasis on weight loss and prevention of excess gain have largely been failures and have fueled prejudice against fat people. A major challenge lies in shifting norms: away from stigmatization of the obese and towards more nutritious eating/drinking and increased activity with acceptance of bodies in all shapes and sizes. Part of the enormity of this challenge lies in the complex effects of law and its relationship with norms, including unintended consequences of regulation. To illustrate such complications, the paper examines two interventions and the actual effects that they have produced (or could under differing conditions): junk food taxes, particularly on SSBs (sugar sweetened beverages), and restriction of advertising to children, especially the ban in Quebec.

AB  - Diverse measures are used as proxies for judicial ability, ranging from the college and law school a judge attended to the rate at which her decisions are cited by other judges. Yet there has been little examination of which of these ability measures is better or worse at predicting the quality of judicial performance including the management and disposition of cases. In this article, we attempt to evaluate these measures of ability by examining a rich group of performance - indicators. Our innovation is to derive performance measures from judicial decisions other than case outcomes (which are inherently difficult to evaluate): the decisions to preside over a securities class action, to reject a motion for lead plaintiff, to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, and to reject a request for fees. In each case, an affirmative decision requires more work from the judge, and thus may be an indicator that the judge works hard and, all else equal, performs well. Using a database of securities class action cases, we find that judges who publish frequently and are highly cited are more likely to dismiss with prejudice but no more likely to make the hard choice in the other cases. Other proxies for judicial ability (attended top law school, judicial experience, earlier position as judge, prior private practice, heavy business caseload, and senior status) are more mixed in terms of their predictive power.

AB  - Researchers in marketing have long recognized that current populations of customers can influence the behavior of prospective customers. This paper draws on existing marketing theories to empirically examine how changes in student body demographic segments influence future demand for MBA programs. Using a longitudinal analysis of data spanning 18 years, we find that higher proportion of female students leads to significant increases in future applications. This implies a marketing rationale for business schools in encouraging gender diversity. In contrast, we find evidence of prejudice towards minority and international students among business school applicants. We discuss the results of the analysis in the context of the current affirmative action debate and changes in demographic trends.

AB  - Faces are inherently social, but the extent to which social group information affects early face processing remains unknown. To address this issue, we examined cortical activity associated with structural encoding of novel ingroup vs. outgroup faces. Participants were assigned to one of two arbitrarily-defined groups using the minimal group procedure, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants categorized faces of people identified as members of their novel ingroup vs. outgroup. Our analysis focused on the N170 component of the ERP, which peaks 170 ms following face onset and reflects face structural encoding. Ingroup faces elicited larger N170 amplitudes than outgroup faces, suggesting that mere group information affects this initial stage of face perception. These findings show that social categories influence how we "see" faces, thus providing insight into the process through which categorizations may lead to biased intergroup perceptions.

AB  - This article considers an experience of Gypsy identity in order to critique the convention that focuses on the benefits of community, while downplaying the inherent tensions between individual expression, freedom and the constraints and limitations of community life. The critique of community will be furthered via an exploration of cultural/ethnic identity formation, looking at self-ascription and intersectionality. Related to this, story telling as a means of transmitting identity and how this relates to truth is also addressed. This analysis will be the basis of a proposal that marginality, via identity, although a powerful space, maintains what Hall (1991) described as weak power; marginality becomes an asset that is gained at the cost of confirming and extending marginality. I will move from the particular identity example (Gypsies) and examine the wider prevalence of weak power, looking at how the social construct that is community, while propagating solidarity and fraternity, promotes social insularity and forms of discrimination and prejudice.

AB  - In this article, I examine computer game addiction as a social phenomenon, analyzing the consequences of using the term in order to express a concern about high frequency consumption or even a problematic usage of computer games. I argue that while it is obviously very important to take seriously these concerns about young people "at risk,'' there is a gap between the phenomenon as a suggested psychiatric diagnosis and young people's reflections on the matter. Following the work of Goffman and Becker, computer game addiction is not necessarily something negative in the eyes of the player and other young people. It is shown that the classification can be a positive element in young people's identity work. On the other hand, a high consumption of computer games is also considered as "culturally unacceptable.'' From this perspective, computer game addiction becomes a question of how to construct the boundaries between normality and deviance and how prejudices are governing and controlling young people's lives. All this suggests more caution in classifying frequent and problematic computer game play as a disorder in itself. We need a more complex understanding of computer game addiction than research so far has offered us.

AB  - People are reluctant to admit they harbor implicit biases. Students (N = 68) from four social psychology courses completed an assignment designed to raise awareness about implicit biases. After completing an Implicit Association Test (IAT), students answered six essay questions, read two articles on the IAT, and answered five additional essay questions. Before the readings, students showed uncertainty about the IAT's ability to measure their implicit attitudes. The main reason students gave in support of or against the IAT's validity was the congruency between their implicit and explicit attitudes. After the readings, more students agreed that the IAT measured prejudice. This assignment was a useful tool in raising students' awareness about their unconscious biases and teaching them about implicit attitudes.

AB  - Exploitation of solar energy is becoming increasingly popular thanks to the potential saving on energy costs and to widespread environmental friendly policies. In this context, solar cooling is particularly interesting since greater cooling loads are usually needed in areas where the solar radiation is more abundant and during sunny seasons.
   The present work aims to evaluate the potential benefits of integrating a traditional vapour compression cycle with a solar powered ejection cycle, in order to take advantage of solar energy without prejudicing the possibility of cold production during night or cloudy days. A numerical model is implemented in order to simulate the behaviour of solar capitation circuit, ejection cycle and traditional cycle. Considering weather data and global plant performance, the model is thereafter used to estimate a set of global performance parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA  - English
AB  - This article examines religio-ethnic humor on the Indonesian island of Bali, with a special emphasis on the transformation of improvisational theatre as an arena for social and political commentary. Analysis focuses on the character of a hare-lipped Muslim 'buffoon' (bondres), whose antics echo and amplify a range of both comic and chauvinistic sensibilities that are prevalent in present-day Balinese society. On first sight, the prejudice embodied in this character appears to reflect Balinese frustrations in the face of continued economic hardship following the nightclub bombings of 2002 and 2005. As the island's leading celebrity-priest famously put it, the Balinese have been forced to sell their land so they can buy satay, while Muslim 'outsiders' are selling satay in order to buy Balinese land. Add to this both the increasingly prominent role of Islamic piety in Indonesian public life, and the recent attacks on perceived heterodoxy (e.g., Ahmadiyah), and one might think the Hindu Balinese have some reason for concern. But are Muslim 'outsiders' really the cause of Balinese hardship? Or, in targeting 'newcomers' to the island, have actors and their audiences helped to cover over a series of more intractable inequities?

AB  - This discourse analytic study examines how violence can be constructed as an honourable course of action, using the example of a leaflet circulated in the loyalist Donegall Pass area of Belfast urging the removal of the minority Chinese population. Starting from the assumptions that racism is an ideological practice that naturalises social categories and devalues members of some of them so that their subjugation and exclusion is legitimised ( Miles and Brown 2003; Billig 2002), and that violence is a human activity imbued with meaning through discourse, we applied guidelines set out by Parker ( 1992) to consider language as a social practice that achieves specific discursive effects by constructing its objects in a particular way. Two interrelated discourses were identified: a community-focused discourse construed the Chinese immigrants as morally and culturally bereft and negated their worth, while a martial discourse focused on defending the locality against foreign invasion. An examination of themes in loyalist culture revealed ways in which the text reconstructed resonant fears, and we argue that the way the in-group constructs its character defines the racist construction of the other.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the significance of academic accusations of magical practice towards marketing communication, asking what might motivate such accusations and what meaning they have for marketing's relationship with persuasion.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the ways in which four distinguished scholars (Raymond Williams, Judith Williamson, Sut Jhally, and Stephen Brown) have accused marketing of either sharing its transformative power with the social effect of magic or in some way offering a metaphorical parallel with the manner in which magic works to cast a glamour over the "reality" of the world. The paper outlines a rhetorical understanding of magic and uses it to construct a reading of these accusations which focuses around a discomfort with the pursuit of persuasion. The analysis is then extended to contemporary marketing theory, particularly the communicative aspects of service-dominant logic and the broader service perspective.
   Findings - The argument is advanced that understandings of marketing as "magical" are largely dependent upon a prejudicial view of the role of persuasion and rhetorical technique in mass media marketing communication. The paper demonstrates that this view of persuasion has also become manifest in the contemporary service perspective and limits the "dialogue" approach to marketing communication.
   Originality/value - The paper warns against the counter-productive demonisation of persuasion in contemporary marketing theory and seeks to highlight the manner in which accusations of magic have been used to deflect clear debate around the place of persuasion in marketing communication.

AB  - Few social psychological investigations have focused on the potential active role of the majority in integration. The present study examines the relationship between intergroup perception and majority attitudes toward the proactive integration of immigrant minorities in Norway. It assesses how and whether perceived entitativity of immigrants, endorsement of counterstereotypic portrayals of immigrants and metaperspectives along the appraisal dimensions of warmth/competence predict the integration attitudes of majority members in Norway as measured by the Majority Integration Efforts (MIE) scale. Correlational and multiple regression analysis yielded two strong (perceptions of positive immigrant integration intentions and perceived entitativity) and two moderate (perceptions of high immigrant competence in Norwegian society and metawarmth) predictors of these attitudes. Further analysis indicated that the main effect of perceived immigrant entitativity on MIE attitudes was partially mediated by perceptions of counterstereotypic intentions and competence. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. We conclude by highlighting how the perception of immigrants' positive integration intentions and their heterogeneity as a group may best promote majority support for proactive integration efforts.

AB  - In Europe, the increasing transnationalization of borders has given rise to a new economy of xenophobia and nationalist sensibilities. Muslim women bear the brunt of Europe's orientalizing epistemologies that tokenize their bodies as sites of gender and cultural otherness. One of the challenges for Women's Studies is not only how to dismantle such epistemologies, but also how to celebrate women's differences without homogenizing their experiences. Rosi Braidotti has recently proposed a transpositional approach that highlights the importance of creative and ethical insight in engendering other, alternative ways of knowing. This article argues that fostering alternative ways of knowing, being and becoming lies at the heart of Amulya Malladi's novel, The Sound of Language (2008). Set in Denmark, the novel tells the story of an Afghan refugee, Raihana, who feels traumatized by the war being waged in her country, but also by the Danish integration programme that strives to assimilate her to Danish culture via the so-called praktik (involving three years of language and vocational training). Through Raihana's encounters with various inflections of racism, but also through her growing friendship with Gunnar, a Danish beekeeper, Malladi not only debunks the traditional epistemologies underpinning European multiculturalism, but also exposes the Muslim community's own prejudices, whilst simultaneously creating bridges across cultural and gender divides. Read against the background of Danish immigration policies, Malladi's novel provides valuable lessons about the role literature can play in transforming stale multicultural positions into transpositions that are not only ethical, but also feminist and political.

AB  - In an effort to identify effective strategies for reducing prejudice, this research tested whether stigmatized individuals can evoke a common identity to deflect discrimination. In an initial survey, gay/lesbian/bisexual participants reported a preference for evoking common identity in intergroup interactions. In two experiments, straight male perceivers in a managerial role-playing paradigm were more likely to select a gay man for an interview if he had primed a common identity. Evoking a common identity did not similarly benefit straight candidates. Findings suggest that integrating prejudice reduction and persuasion research can identify strategies that empower targets to effectively cope with prejudice.

AB  - Much more is known about attitudes toward mental illness and social stigma, the viscious cycle of its consequences and how to fight the social stigma in public, but much less is known about how to combat the stigma and self stigma in clinical practice. Stigma theories have not been enough to understand the feelings and experience of people with mental illness. Conceptual framework that understands stigma as consisting of difficulties of knowledge (ignorance or misinformation), problems of attitudes (prejudice), and problems of behaviour (discrimination) have not been enough to understand stigma dynamics in the patient therapist interaction. Understanding the psychodynamic aspects of internalized stereotype of mental illness in the patient-therapist relationship may improve our competency to deal with stigma and self stigma in clinical practice.

KW  - repetitive exercise
KW  - Agamben
KW  - potentiality
KW  - pure means
AB  - This article is concerned with the educational value of raising the human body at school. Drawing inspiration from the work of Giorgio Agamben, I develop a new perspective that explores the possibility of taking the concept of physical education in a literal sense. This is to say that the specific educational content of physical education (in contradistinction to organized sporting life outside school) resides in its concentration on the physical 'as such'. This is not an obvious path to explore, because defenders of physical education as a rule have to compete against the (dualist) prejudice that this discipline is merely an instrument to train the body or to keep it fit, and that it therefore should not be considered as a serious endeavour. Therefore, more often than not, apologists try to justify the relevance of physical education on the very ground that it is a practice that is concerned with something 'beyond' the merely physical that is at stake in movement activity. I argue, however, that this line of thought excludes the possibility of conceiving an alternative approach that relates the concentration on 'entirely physical' activities (as opposed to 'merely physical' activities) to an experience of potentiality. I develop this idea on the basis of an analysis of repetitive, rhythmical and collective body-exercise (e.g. running in a group or basic callisthenics).

AB  - How can recent findings indicating that perspective-taking fosters negative behavior and defensiveness be reconciled with ample evidence that perspective-taking can have beneficial effects on individuals' evaluative and behavioral reactions to other people? I argue that perspective-taking tends to prompt positive reactions in contexts where the potential for evaluation by the target is low and where individuals thus focus their attention squarely on understanding the target when perspective-taking. In contrast, perspective-taking prompts more negative reactions in contexts where the potential for evaluation by the target is high and where individuals thus focus their attention back on themselves when perspective-taking. I further argue that the relevance of individuals' concerns about their social standing with others moderates perspective-taking effects because it determines which of two distinct forms of egocentrism arises. A beneficial form involves individuals projecting themselves onto the target, whereas a detrimental form involves individuals becoming preoccupied with the target's evaluation of them. I also maintain that perspective-taking is more likely to foster favorable treatment of targets when it is easy for individuals to identify what constitutes positive versus negative treatment. Because most experiments examining perspective-taking have been conducted in contexts involving low potential for evaluation and clear behavior response options, which may not be representative of the contexts in which individuals most often engage in perspective-taking in their everyday lives, negative effects might be more common than traditionally believed. I review the research literature and find general support for this conceptual framework. Apparent counter-examples and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristic of girls with Turner syndrome (TS) and to search for associations between phenotype and birth weight or karyotypes. Subjects and methods: Subjects included 60 TS girls underwent growth hormone (GH) stimulation testing for short stature. All patients performed provocative tests with a combination of at least two of the following: arginine, levo-dopa or insulin. Cytogenetic finding, height, weight, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, peak GH after stimulation were collected. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 10.9 +/- 3.5 years. Thirty-one cases had 45,X, which accounted for 51.7% of total group. The patients were divided into two groups by their karyotypes: 45,X group and miscellaneous karyotypes (MK) group. There were no differences in age at diagnosis, weight, body mass index (BMI), height of their parents, incidence of GM deficiency (GHD), birth weight, basal luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels between two groups. However, height standard deviation scores (SDS) at diagnosis were -4.13 +/- 1.44, -3.12 +/- 1.3 for 45,X and MK group respectively (P=0.014). The incidence of ovaries absence in 45,X group was higher than MK group (33.3% vs. 12.5%, P=0.046). There was no correlation between height SDS and GH peak values (r=-0.182, P=0.182), IGF-1 (r=-0.075, P=0.583)and IGFBP-3 (r=-0.019, P=0.891). Birth weight was positively related to their height SDS and weight SDS (r=0.364, P=0.007; r=0.378, P=0.005) respectively. There were no correlations between birth weight and BMI, IGF-1 and other indexes. Conclusions: Karyotypes and birth weight have important impact on height SDS in TS girls.

   Methods: This is a quality research study based on the social representation theory. Data were collected through interviews with 7 nurses and 11 nursing assistants using a semistructured questionnaire and two analyses of daily situations.
   Results: Testimonials revealed that nursing professionals perceived sexuality as sexual orientation, sexual role, or a manifestation disorder. Discipline and surveillance were the techniques used to control sexual behavior in the hospital environment.
   Conclusion: Nursing professionals perceived the sexuality of people with mental disorders according to their own values, taboos, and prejudices, which indicated unpreparedness of nursing professionals concerning the sexuality of individuals receiving care for mental illnesses.

AB  - Addiction is widely recognized as a health problem with increasing prevalence. Treatment programs are growing in number, but many forms of addiction remain high and some lack treatment regimens. The total costs to society for addiction treatment programs and associated complications are staggering and continue to rise. This illuminates how frequently individuals affected by addiction encounter the healthcare system. Stigmatization or social disqualification of individuals affected by addiction is an increasing phenomenon in the healthcare arena. The negative consequences experienced by persons affected by stigmatization may include limited access to health care, poor health outcomes, prejudice, and other social disadvantages. The focus of this article is to examine addiction and stigma as obstacles to accessing and obtaining quality health care. It introduces the phenomenon addiction-stigmatized. This concept was developed to increase nurses' awareness and knowledge of the negative effect stigma has on the health of individuals with addiction.

AB  - The present research aimed to show that the mixed stereotype content of persons with disability observed at an explicit level does not manifest itself using implicit measures. Two experimental studies were conducted to analyse the stereotype content of persons with a disability at the implicit level. The procedure used in this study was the concept priming paradigm. Furthermore, Study 2 also included an explicit measure. Results show important discrepancies between implicit and explicit measures. At an explicit level, previous work supporting the mixed stereotype content of persons with disability was replicated: participants judged these persons as warmer but less competent than persons without a disability. At an implicit level, a quite different pattern of results emerged: persons with a disability were associated not only with less competence than persons without disability, but also with less warmth. These findings suggest that the mixed pattern between warmth and competence generally observed at an explicit level may be based on societal pressures against prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Previous studies indicate that childhood sexual abuse can have extensive and serious consequences. The aim of this research was to do a qualitative study of the consequences of childhood sexual abuse for Icelandic mens health and well-being. Phenomenology was the methodological approach of the study. Totally 14 interviews were conducted, two per individual, and analysed based on the Vancouver School of Phenomenology. The main results of the study showed that the men describe deep and almost unbearable suffering, affecting their entire life, of which there is no alleviation in sight. The men have lived in repressed silence most of their lives and have come close to taking their own lives. What stopped them from committing suicide was revealing to others what happened to them which set them free in a way. The men experienced fear- or rage-based shock at the time of the trauma and most of them endured the attack by dissociation, disconnecting psyche and body and have difficulties reconnecting. They had extremely difficult childhoods, living with indisposition, bullying, learning difficulties and behavioural problems. Some have, from a young age, numbed themselves with alcohol and elicit drugs. They have suffered psychologically and physically and have had relational and sexual intimacy problems. The consequences of the abuse surfaced either immediately after the shock or many years later and developed into complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Because of perceived societal prejudice, it was hard for the men to seek help. This shows the great need for professionals to be alert to the possible consequences of childhood sexual abuse in their practice to reverse the damaging consequences on their health and well-being. We conclude that living in repressed silence after a trauma, like childhood sexual abuse, can be dangerous for the health, well-being and indeed the very life of the survivor.

AB  - China's rural-urban dual society system is instituted by its unique hukou system. This system causes inequalities in social status between permanent urban and rural residents, and discrimination against rural-to-urban migrants is thus prevalent. A series of studies, based on system justification theory, sought to address the impact of the hukou system on the discrimination against rural-to-urban migrants. Study 1 showed that the justification of the hukou system could predict discrimination operationalized using a social distance measure. Study 2 found that priming of the proposed abolishment of the current hukou system led to reduced social distance. Study 3, using a recruiting scenario, further demonstrated that priming of the proposed abolishment of the system led to reduced discrimination in salary decision. Consistent with our predictions, discrimination against rural-to-urban migrants could be triggered by justifying the current hukou system, while priming of the abolishment of the system serves to decrease discrimination. The present research thereby sheds light on China's reform of its hukou system to achieve social justice and equality from a psychological perspective.

AB  - In multi-player games, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) profile concept deserves a team for selecting strategies during a match, so no player - except in own prejudice - individually deviates from the team selected strategy. By using NE strategy profiles, the way a baseball team increases the possibilities to a match victory is payoff-matrices-based analyzed in this paper. Each matrix entry arrange each player's strategies by regarding the ones from mates and adversaries, and posterior to a NE-profile-selection, the matrix from all players strategies can support the manager's strategic decision-making in the course of a match. A finite state machine, a formal grammar and a generator of random plays are the algorithmic fundament for this collective strategic reasoning automation. The relationships to e-commerce, social and political scopes, as well as to computing issues are reviewed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates the ethnographic methodological question of how the researcher observes objectively while being part of the problem they are observing. It uses a case study of ABC Pool to argue a cooperative approach that combines the role of the ethnographer with that of a community manager who assists in constructing a true representation of the researched environment. By using reflexivity as a research tool, the ethnographer engages in a process to self-check their personal presumptions and prejudices, and to strengthen the constructed representation of the researched environment. This article also suggests combining management and expertise research from the social sciences with ethnography, to understand and engage with the research field participants more intimately which, ultimately, assists in gathering and analysing richer qualitative data.

AB  - Autism involves core impairments in social cognition. Given that social learning underlies the acquisition of stereotypes, it was hypothesized that use of stereotypes would be reduced in autism. Contrary to this prediction, previous studies found the same use of stereotypes in autistic individuals as in controls. Measurement of stereotypes, however, can be biased by effects of social desirability, which previous studies did not account for. In the current study we therefore employed an implicit approach, using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which assesses more automatic components of stereotypes, in nineteen individuals with autism and nineteen controls. The data suggest that while both groups do show the use of stereotypes to some extent, autistic individuals have less stereotypical attitudes against the investigated minority.

AB  - In the present research, we provide evidence that the Affect Misattribution Paradigm (AMP) does not simply measure pre-existing attitudes. Instead, this task can also create new response biases that systematically alter participants' future judgments. In the following experiments, we replicate prior research on implicit contrast effects, which have shown that neutral stimuli elicit significantly more favorable automatic responses when they are presented in an implicit task along with other negative, as opposed to positive, stimuli (Scherer & Lambert, 2009a). We then extend that research by demonstrating that automatic contrast effects can carry over into future judgments, affecting both implicit and explicit evaluations of the prime stimuli. These effects are first established using nonsocial prime stimuli (Experiments 1 and 2), and then are replicated in the domain of implicit prejudice toward the elderly (Experiment 3). Implications for implicit attitude malleability, attitude measurement, and the Response Mapping model of priming are discussed.

T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - This article explores the positive contribution that community development (CD) can make to mental well-being by providing close but critical support to individuals and community-led initiatives. The emphasis on self-determination, collective action and empowerment within the CD approach inspires hope and recovery from mental distress. Drawing on a recent study of CD practice across varied UK settings, we demonstrate how practitioners use their skills to break down barriers, build relationships, manage group dynamics and tackle prejudice. They oconnect and include' people experiencing mental health difficulties with community activities and mainstream services, increasing opportunity and choice. We note that a skilfully balanced, empathetic but bold CD approach requires professional capabilities, flexible management and participative forms of evaluation. It fits the current UK policy emphasis on empowerment and engagement and responds to the growing evidence that personal networks and social equality correlate with health and well-being. However, its impact tends to be limited by workplace context, insufficient resources and a failure by health providers and others to recognize its potential.

AB  - In Europe, legislation exists to ensure that infrastructure facilities and services are accessible to all. This may not work perfectly, but there is no longer a need to debate the principle of access for all. In low-income countries it is a different story. Improving accessibility to water and sanitation is technically straightforward and low cost. Greater challenges are posed by institutional and social barriers. However, evidence shows that increased advocacy and information, together with training of engineers about inclusive design, can reduce prejudice and increase understanding of different needs and solutions. Drawing on examples from Africa and Asia, this paper describes water and sanitation in low-income countries, explaining the barriers that prevent access for vulnerable users and gives an overview of inclusive design for latrines and water points.

AB  - When forming impressions about other people, stereotypes about the individual's social group often influence the resulting impression. At least 2 distinguishable processes underlie stereotypic impression formation: stereotype activation and stereotype application. Most previous research has used implicit measures to assess stereotype activation and explicit measures to assess stereotype application, which has several disadvantages. The authors propose a measure of stereotypic impression formation, the stereotype misperception task (SMT), together with a multinomial model that quantitatively disentangles the contributions of stereotype activation and application to responses in the SMT. The validity of the SMT and of the multinomial model was confirmed in 5 studies. The authors hope to advance research on stereotyping by providing a measurement tool that separates multiple processes underlying impression formation.

AB  - Is the same person perceived as more dangerous if the perceiver is induced to think about Arab and Muslim categories versus no category? Using the shooter paradigm, this study investigated the effects of the accessibility of ethnic (Arab) versus religious (Muslim) categories versus no category on spontaneous aggressive responses toward a target with an ambiguous appearance. Results demonstrated that shooting reactions toward armed targets were faster than non-shooting reactions toward unarmed targets, especially if the target was a man. Despite these main effects, participants made faster decisions to shoot an ambiguous armed target if primed with the category Arab or Muslim (versus no category priming). The findings indicate that the mere priming of these social categories is sufficient to facilitate aggressive responses, even if the targets themselves are ambiguous.

AB  - This study examined the proportion of people who held ambivalent versus univalent sexist attitudes, that is, those who simultaneously endorsed benevolent sexism (BS) and hostile sexism (HS). We examined this by capitalizing on recent innovations in latent class analysis to model latent types of sexists, or response profiles to BS and HS, in a nationally representative New Zealand sample (n?=?6450). Our results show, for the first time, that by far, the most common pattern was for people to hold similar levels of BS and HS. Strongly ambivalent sexists, however, constituted only 8%9% of the population. Most were classified as mild or moderate ambivalent sexists (28% and 44%, respectively). Univalent sexism was exceedingly rare, with between 2% and 5% of people solely endorsing HS but not BS, or BS but not HS. We validated the model by showing theoretically predicted differences across sexist types in demographics (gender, age), ideology (social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism), and relationship satisfaction. Strongly ambivalent sexists also held the highest levels of gender-specific system justification, invariant of gender. This provides novel evidence for the premise that strong sexist ambivalence promotes support for and faith in the patriarchical system. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Microcredit strategies combine the logic of business, progressive approaches to learning from experience and the key aim to reduce poverty, especially amongst women. The focus in such interventions on the independent, entrepreneurial citizen suggests not only new ways to generate economic growth and sustainable development, but an important recalibration of the repressive social relations thought to be at the root of women's persistent 'under-development'. This article explores women's experiences of their roles as entrepreneurs, and reflects on how the learning processes and outcomes associated with microcredit schemes 'shape the self, often in quite unpredictable ways. The article is based on an ethnographic study of disadvantaged women in Dar es Salaam, and follows them as they participate in NGO-based training schemes, 'practise' entrepreneurship in a range of income-generating settings, and negotiate the consequences of the new subjectivities on which the independent, entrepreneurial citizen is based. Like many microcredit programmes, the majority of women in the study were full time housewives before joining the scheme. Others had left their jobs following retrenchment, prejudice or gender discrimination. In all cases, they started their own businesses with little or no business experience or education. Whilst some appear to have embraced the new opportunities, others have struggled. In all cases, microcredit and the associated learning processes produced contradictory and ambivalent feelings of success and failure, hope and disappointment, progress and exclusion. The article explores these ambivalences in order to critique development initiatives that are based on universal notions of autonomy and self-determination in contexts shaped by dependence and structural inequality.

AB  - This study examined the conditions affecting the math performance of French female student nurses in a setting where they were likely to experience stereotype threat (supposedly poor scientific skills), but in a context which enhanced their status as women and strengthened their self-affirmation. We hypothesized that self-affirmation through their nursing identity would deflect the negative impact of the stereotype threat on performance and would reduce the threat's harmful impact on attentional processes, as reflected in perceived stress, perceived concentration and self-estimate of performance. Ninety-five female students enrolled in a nursing school in France carried out a dosage calculation-a typical nursing task-which drew directly on their math skills. They were assigned to one of four experimental conditions: 2 (threat: task presented as being diagnostic of women's difficulty in math calculation compared to men vs. no threat: task presented as a typical nursing-school exercise) x 2 (self-affirmation: choosing from a list and describing the most important characteristics for them as women and as nurses vs. control condition: same task but for the characteristics that were least important for them but important for other people). As expected, under stereotype threat relating to their math skills, women performed better under the self-affirmation condition than under the control condition. However, this improved performance was associated with a lower self-estimate of their performance. We discuss the consequences, in this specific occupational and cultural context, on the way women can overcome the negative impact of gender stereotypes.

AB  - In recent years mankind has greatly extended its knowledge of living things, in general, and of itself in particular. Such a wide-ranging body of knowledge has consequently led to the need for a theory to encompass it, that is, a coherent framework in which to systematically arrange mankind's understanding of itself, not only with regard to its physical nature, but to its individuality and sociality as well. Such a theory would moreover provide the means to mediate between the various domains of scientific and technological enquiry, on the one hand, and the cultural dimensions of human society, on the other. Already in the 18th century, Immanuel Kant strove to establish a discipline that was systematic, yet at the same time accessible. It was due to his efforts that philosophical anthropology was introduced into university curricula, to the benefit not only of philosophers, but of physicians and jurists as well. Kant's position is by no means prejudicial towards science. To the contrary, he was quite careful to appraise the impact of the sciences on the overall cognitive horizons of mankind and therefore on their potential to influence humankind's idea of itself. Clearly such a perspective is relevant to today's strongly felt need to reconcile modern neuroscience's revolutionary findings on the biological bases of the mind - of man's experience and behaviour - with the idea man needs of himself in order to orient his actions not only as individual but also as "citizen of the world" as well - something on which Kant worked with unremitting commitment throughout his entire research career. This article traces Kant's anthropological conception with regard to four specific issues: (1) its relation to science; (2) the relationship between empirical and transcendental in the speculative use and in practical use of reason; (3) the dialectic between what nature does and what human beings do, in the construction of humanity itself; (4) and finally about the character of the person and the character of the human species.

AB  - This study explores how family therapy educators from privileged social locations understand issues of privilege and the process by which they integrate their personal and professional journeys to create and model equity in family therapy training and professional development. These educators developed awareness about issues of privilege and oppression and owned their privilege. Increased awareness involved personal struggles with guilt and managing internalized voices of prejudice that are constantly reinforced in society. These educators adopted a stance of action and accountability for equity. We hypothesize that the process leading to owning one's privilege involves the ability to be compassionate for others suffering and one's own limitations.

AB  - Divorce by parliament in the 18th and early 19th centuries was long considered to be the preserve of the wealthy and the upper ranks of society. But while social standing has guided historians' analysis of those who obtained divorce, the standing of those who failed to obtain divorce has been largely overlooked. If rank or status is to serve true analytical purpose, the successful must be set against the failed. Juxtaposing the successes and failures by group across the period reveals that the upper echelons of society were by no means preferred. Even distinctive cases for instance of multiple failure were not decided on rank. Status is ultimately shown to be of limited significance. Although the sources are not at all explicit, from the analysis of certain specific cases, it would appear that moral and legal judgments (for example, on collusion) far outweighed any social prejudices.

AB  - This paper aims to offer a new perspective on two fifth-century texts: Martianus Capella's De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii and Macrobius' Saturnalia. Both were transmitted and received throughout the Middle Ages as methodical sources containing an account of the ancient sciences and disciplines, and highly criticised in modern times for their supposedly poor level of scientific knowledge. Setting aside the recent focus on the Neoplatonic ascription of some of their content, I claim that these texts still contribute to a traditional educational ideal. They put forward a kind of amateur, dilettantish encyclopaedic lore as the appropriate 'further education' for young Latin men of the higher class that would allow them to acquire material for excellence in discourse within the framework of a basically rhetorical education. With their literary sophistication and informal approach, they also illustrate the means of acquiring this broader knowledge in a non-professional way, by individual reading/listening and excerpting, as something distinct from the formal schooling available in grammar and rhetoric. Such an approach could help us to avoid the still rather widespread and sometimes undeservedly excessive criticism of the level of their 'science' and, especially, blaming this dubious characteristic on the prejudiced assumption of the decline of science in the 'obscure times' of Late Antiquity.

TI  - Building a Barometer of Gay Rights (BGR): A Case Study of Uganda and the Persecution of Homosexuals
T2  - HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - Few countries in the world actually embrace homosexuals as valuable members of their society and even fewer bestow full human rights on their homosexual citizens. The Barometer of Gay Rights (BGR) attempts to systematically quantify how rights protective and respective a country really is. This article will apply the BGR methodology to the Ugandan case study to measure the degree to which Uganda is an "active persecutor" of homosexuals. The BGR measures the constitutional protections afforded homosexuals, their civil, political, and socioeconomic rights, the presence and efficacy of gay rights organizations, and the degree of societal persecution.
   It is not called the partial declaration of human rights. It is not the sometimes declaration of human rights. It is the Universal Declaration, guaranteeing all human beings their basic human rights-without exception. Violence will end only when we confront prejudice. Stigma and discrimination will end only when we agree to speak out. That requires all of us to do our part, to speak out-at home, at work, in our schools, and communities-to stand in solidarity.

AB  - In the current research we investigated social settings through which attributions to discrimination are undermined. Drawing on work linking intergroup contact to perceptions of inequality, we tested the prediction that experiences of commonality-focused contact would reduce disadvantaged group members' tendency to attribute negative treatment of fellow group members to discrimination. In Study 1 students were randomly assigned to either a commonality-focused, differences-focused, or no-contact condition, ostensibly with a student from a higher status university. Commonality-focused interactions led participants to view the status hierarchy as more legitimate, and consequently, to be less likely to attribute negative treatment to discrimination. In Study 2 this effect was replicated among Ethiopian-Jews (a disadvantaged minority in Israel) who reported the amount of commonality-focused contact they experience with non-Ethiopian Jews. Theoretical and practical implications regarding intergroup contact and perceptions of inequality are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was conducted to test experimentally whether majority members' perceptions of which acculturation strategies minority members prefer would causally impact on majority members' own acculturation preferences, especially their preference for integration. Participants (N = 113) were exposed to videos in which actors who posed as Pakistani minority members voiced different acculturation preferences (integration, assimilation, separation or control condition). Their views were presented as representative of their ethnic group. The effect of this on white British majority participants' own acculturation preferences was measured. As expected, perceived acculturation preferences significantly impacted on own acculturation preferences. In line with predictions, participants' level of prejudice significantly moderated these effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Much of the early literature on 'cultural competence' focuses on the 'categorical' or 'multicultural' approach, in which providers learn relevant attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors of certain cultural groups. In essence, this involves learning key 'dos and don'ts' for each group. Literature and educational materials of this kind focus on broad ethnic, racial, religious, or national groups, such as 'African American', 'Hispanic', or 'Asian'. The problem with this categorical or 'list of traits' approach to clinical cultural competence is that culture is multidimensional and dynamic. Culture comprises multiple variables, affecting all aspects of experience. Cultural processes frequently differ within the same ethnic or social group because of differences in age cohort, gender, political association, class, religion, ethnicity, and even personality. Culture is therefore a very elusive and nebulous concept, like art. The multicultural approach to cultural competence results in stereotypical thinking rather than clinical competence. A newer, cross cultural approach to culturally competent clinical practice focuses on foundational communication skills, awareness of cross-cutting cultural and social issues, and health beliefs that are present in all cultures. We can think of these as universal human beliefs, needs, and traits. This patient centered approach relies on identifying and negotiating different styles of communication, decision-making preferences, roles of family, sexual and gender issues, and issues of mistrust, prejudice, and racism, among other factors. In the current paper, we describe 'cultural' challenges that arise in the care of four patients from disparate cultures, each of whom has advanced colon cancer that is no longer responding to chemotherapy. We then illustrate how to apply principles of patient centered care to these challenges.

AB  - A questionnaire study addressed the intergenerational transmission of benevolent sexist beliefs (BS) from mothers to adolescent daughters and influences of BS on daughters' traditional goals, academic goals (i.e., getting an academic degree), and academic performance. In addition, the role of mothers' educational level and job status as predictors of their BS was explored. One hundred sixty-four pairs of female adolescents and their mothers from Granada (Spain) completed questionnaires independently. Hypotheses were tested in a path model. Results suggest that mothers' BS is negatively predicted by their education but not their job status. Mothers' BS predicted daughters' BS, which in turn negatively predicted daughters' goal to get an academic degree and positively predicted daughters' traditional goals. Daughters' academic performance was positively predicted by their goal to get an academic degree and negatively predicted by mothers' BS. Results are discussed in terms of the socializing influence of mothers' sexist ideology on their daughters and its implications for the maintenance of traditional roles that perpetuate gender inequalities.

AB  - People sexually abused in childhood are at higher risk than non-abused people of medically unexplained symptoms such as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic pain, with mental ill health and high healthcare use. Friction and frustration, with high, unproductive healthcare costs, can often develop between these patients and healthcare professionals such as general practitioners and nursing staff. The aim of this integrative literature review was to seek a sound evidence base from which to develop helpful interventions, improve relationships and identify gaps in knowledge. It found some theories about interconnections among childhood sexual abuse mental health and medically unexplained symptoms, such as 'somatization' or 'secondary gain', were used prejudicially, stigmatizing survivors. Conflicting theories make more difficult the search for effective interventions. Researchers rarely collaborated with sexual abuse specialists. Emphasis on identifying key risk factors, rather than providing support or alleviating distress, and lack of studies where survivors voiced their own experiences, meant very few targeted interventions for this group were proposed. Recommendations to enable effective interventions include making abuse survivors the prime study focus; qualitative research with survivors, to assist doctors and nursing staff with sensitive care; case histories using medical records; prospective studies with sexually abused children; support for the growing field of neurobiological research.

AB  - The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. Pondering problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, such as, climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The higher frequency of El Nio and La Nia seems to have strong influence on rainfall in Amazonia. They are becoming more lasting and intense in the course of the last 20 to 30 years compared to the past 100 years. This paper may confront the scientific knowledge of the relations of climate and water resources in Amazon with the points of vulnerability that anthropic societies present in the region. The impact of climate change is not uniformly borne by different regions and populations. Actually, individuals, sectors and systems are affected to varying degrees and, besides, they may be prejudiced to a greater or lesser extent. These impacts vary in magnitude and intensity in accordance with certain aspects, for instance, geographical location, time, the prevalent social, economic and environmental conditions and the infra-structure of a given location. A comprehensive description of these extreme climate events is one of the first steps to a regional vulnerability approach.

AB  - Background: In Western countries, caring for older people was viewed as an unattractive area by nursing students. The literature reported a number of barriers, including ageism that contributed to this undesirable situation.
   Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting nursing students' intention to work with older people in a university in China.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 622 nursing students enrolled in a 4-year Bachelor of Nursing programme at the university. Data analysis methods mainly included Chi-Square test, Mann-Whitney test, factor analysis and logistical regression.
   Results: Working with older people was ranked as the second to least preferred area by nursing students. Ageist attitudes described as Prejudice was negatively associated with intention to work with older people; while students aged under-20 were more positively associated with an intention to work with older people.
   Conclusion: Nursing curriculum should be designed to target ageist attitude, by promoting socialisation with older people and creating more supportive learning environments in the care setting of older people. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Culture and diversity among occupational therapists in Ireland: when the therapist is the 'diverse' one
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

KW  - Cultural diversity
KW  - ethnicity
KW  - disability
KW  - COMPETENCE
AB  - Introduction: Literature in occupational therapy, although paying increased attention to cultural differences and diversity, has largely ignored the situation of therapists who are themselves members of social and cultural minority groups. 'Difference' is assumed to be exclusively an attribute of the client.
   Method: This qualitative study explored the professional experiences of 12 occupational therapists in Ireland who self-identified as disabled or ethnic minority group members.
   Findings: Participants reported challenges with colleagues and managers, which revolved primarily around cultural differences in the norms and expectations guiding social interactions, communications and practice styles. Overt discrimination was reported only by disabled therapists. With clients, again there were clashes of cultural values, but participants also experienced overt and covert prejudice and intolerance. This was particularly difficult to respond to in the context of client-centred practice.
   Conclusion: Cultural competence, as the prevailing approach to diversity, emphasises suspending one's own values to facilitate those of clients. This demand may be inappropriate for minority therapists who may face prejudice and discrimination. In contrast, cultural humility and critical reflexivity emphasise negotiating values in the context of social power relations, an approach that may better position occupational therapy to benefit from a diverse workforce.

AB  - This study uses a tripolar model of minority influence to investigate social category constructions of extreme right politicians. The analysis focuses on Geert Wilders, leader of the extreme right Party For Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands. It is examined how this popular politician construes the interdependent relations between himself, the population, and mainstream politicians, and discursively manages his controversial standpoints and proposals. Four parliamentary debates are analysed. The analysis shows that by defining national identity, Wilders invokes a self-image as a prototypical member of the population. Furthermore, and in contrast to other politicians, Wilders works up a self-image of a responsible and realistic politician who is group oriented. In addition, the analysis suggests that being a minority can be of strategic political value and therefore a position to foster. The relevance of the analysis for social psychological approaches to leadership and political minorities is discussed.

TI  - Opening the Phosphoric "Envelope": Scientific Appraisal, Domestic Spectacle, and (Un)"Reasonable Creatures" in Edgeworth's Belinda
T2  - EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FICTION
LA  - English
AB  - Maria Edgeworth's novel Belinda (1801) has received increasing attention in recent years from scholars interested in the author's pedagogical methods (introduced by Edgeworth and her father Richard Lovell Edgeworth in the treatise Practical Education [1798]). Yet there has been little sustained critical assessment of the novel's scenes of empirical inquiry, specifically the two phosphoric spectacles, or attention to how these scenes reflect late-Enlightenment debates and Edgeworth's call for a significant revamping of the period's didactic scientific literature. Far from disavowing the value of all emotional response in favour of a frigid adherence to empirical inquiry, Edgeworth's characters show that empiricism can bolster domestic harmony and strengthen emotional bonds within the household. Edgeworth responds to contemporary debates regarding the use of spectacle in teaching science, suggesting that proper scientific education liberates those benighted by superstition and societal prejudices. The scientific method's appeal lies in its transformative effect on the novel's characters, as it generates a shared empirically grounded discourse, fostering communication between characters differing in race, social rank, education, or age.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression affects parents of newborns. Major depression causes cognitive prejudice. Nothing is known about memory impairment in those affected of postpartum depression. This study has a purpose to assess working and short-term memories during the postpartum period in mothers and fathers in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil and also to correlate the changes in memory with postpartum depression, sociodemographic factors and possible confounding factors.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study includes families assisted by the public health system. The sample consisted of fathers and mothers of live births, born from March to December 2008. The participants were evaluated during home visits using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the word span test. The cutoff point for depression in the EPDS scores was >= 13. and the word span scores were evaluated as discrete variables.
   Results: The sample consisted of 395 individuals (222 women and 173 men). The prevalence of depression was 16.2% among mothers and 5.2% among fathers. Depressed individuals performed worse on the memory test.
   Limitations: The number of men evaluated was smaller than that of women. That's a transversal study, so we have the prevalence bias.
   Conclusions: This study shows that postpartum depression affects both men and women, and the symptoms of depression affect the working and short-term memories of affected individuals. Given that this was a larger study than those in the literature, the results emphasize the importance of detecting and treating postpartum depression and helping affected families.

AB  - Stigma by association represents the process through which the companions of stigmatized persons are discredited. Conduits for stigma by association range from the strong and enduring bonds of kinship to the arbitrary occasions of being seen in the company of someone who is stigmatized. A theoretical model is proposed in which both deliberative and spontaneous processes result in the spread of stigma to the companions of stigmatized persons. Support for this model was found across 3 studies that examined how explicit and implicit stigma-relevant attitudes moderate stigma-by-association effects. When social relationships were meaningful (e.g., kinship), both explicit and implicit attitudes moderated the devaluation of stigmatized persons' companions. On the other hand, when social relationships appeared coincidental only implicit attitudes moderated companion devaluation.

AB  - Many poor neighbourhoods, home to both socially disadvantaged populations and to foreigners, are characterised by a strong perception of insecurity. The purpose of this article is determine the origin of this perception. To do so, two possible causes are dissociated: racial prejudice and racial proxy (the ethnic minorities are perceived in terms of the negative social characteristics that are often associated with them). More specifically, it is shown that the 'ethnic' variable captures the effects of an overconcentration of poverty, approximated here by the concentration of unemployment, but that these two variables act separately. This result should be taken into account in the policies implemented by public authorities and local actors. In this study, an original methodology is applied based simultaneously on individual geocoded data, the proportion of foreigners, the unemployment rate at the neighbourhood level and an indirect indicator of perceived insecurity.

TI  - T. F. Torrance on Scripture
T2  - SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Although it was never completed and has had only slight impact, T. F. Torrance's work on the nature and interpretation of scripture is a primary element in his theology, though largely unstudied. For Torrance, a theology of scripture and its interpretation derive from a theology of revelation; revelation takes creaturely form in the incarnate Word, out of which is generated the apostolic community and its witness, which in turn generates scripture, the human word which ministers the divine Word. Scripture is the divine Word accommodated to human form, and so a sacrament or sign which refers to revelation; its social location is the life of the apostolic community. Interpretation of scripture is properly 'depth-interpretation', following the semantics of scripture by which reference to divine reality is made, rather than terminating on scripture's syntactical surface. Fitting interpretative practice follows the text's reference, penetrates to the thing signified, indwells its subject matters and listens to the divine Word. The interpreter is summoned to mortification of prejudice and constantly renewed attentiveness. Torrance's most impressive contribution to bibliology and hermeneutics was his insistence that both are ingredients within a theology of God's economic presence. There are some historical limitations to his work, along with a lack of interest in the Christian literary culture and lack of extended exegesis. However, his writings in the field constitute one of the most impressive Protestant accounts of the field in the last half-century.

KW  - inclusive education
AB  - In this article, I ask how university students with disabilities negotiate with staff arrangements for alternative assessment practices. I draw on three case studies using a personal pronoun perspective to challenge the conventional view that educational policy and teaching practice are forms of rational action. I demonstrate how the lives of students and staff are typically characterised by unexpected events, disorder, emotion and prejudice. The analytic perspective offered here establishes how meanings, intentions and different viewpoints and alliances emerge as social actors work to create specific faculty and institution cultures. The case studies also reveal what does and what does not work - some of the obstacles - and what needs to be done if we are serious about equity and inclusive education. They include practical assistance in recognising the specific requirements of students with disabilities and how to design alternative assessment for students with specific 'conditions'. I argue that professional development and specific techniques in curriculum design are needed. Some staff also require help in recognising their policy and legal obligations. A cultural change which identifies and challenges prejudice is a larger task if universities are to become places in which equal opportunity principles and inclusive education are present and actively practised.

AB  - XXI Century requires new approach to mutual relations of civilizations, if we wish to avoid the fate predicted by Samuel Huntington. We have to study carefully and without prejudice our respective achievements and see whether we can run better each our own civilization. One such case is Europe and India or better the whole of South Asia. An oxymoron definition of their mutual relationship is suggested. They are "twins-unlike" civilizations, being similar on many counts but dissimilar as their 'personalities' go. The most fascinating confrontation in their respect is provided by comparison of two social entities: the European 'nation' and the India 'caste' as well as ammo and qaum. The conclusion of this comparison is strikingly political. European Union could solve its problems with supra-national integration if Europeans remodel their sense of mega-tribal identity putting more stress on competence of their respective nations as the main national identity factor while the peoples of South Asia could solve the problem of painful division of the Subcontinent by bestowing paraphernalia of sovereignty upon the constituent parts of both India and Pakistan.

Recent studies, however, defy many of the common prejudices about game or community users. As an extension of recent research, this study looks at gender differences in Virtual Worlds and finds that female users are actually a driving force behind the recent success of online communities. The study results indicate that female users more actively participate in social life, information seeking, and building activities in Virtual Worlds than their male counterparts. Similarly, female users have greater appreciation for the value of Virtual Worlds, although both male and female users recognize Virtual Worlds as a highly useful entertainment tool.

KW  - CONTACT
AB  - This study aims to provide a more complete and exhaustive perspective on the whole range of potential strategies to fight stigma by considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. Delegates to a Canadian conference were invited to participate in a survey that focused on stigma, from which the responses to the following question were analyzed: tell us briefly what you do to reduce prejudice and stigma toward people with a diagnosis of mental disorder? From 253 participants, 15 categories of strategies to fight stigma were identified from the verbatim (e. g., sharing/encouraging disclosure). These categories fell under six main themes: education, contact, protestation, person centered, working on recovery and social inclusion, and reflexive consciousness. The occurrence of these themes was different among stakeholders (clinical, organizational, and experiential knowledge). For example, people with mental disorders (experiential knowledge) often mentioned contact and person centered strategies, while mental health professionals (clinical knowledge) preferred education and working on recovery and social inclusion strategies. The results from this study highlight the need to pay more attention to the concept of disclosure of mental disorders in the process for de-stigmatization. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of the emerging strategies to fight stigma in the community.

AB  - This paper examines the predicament of prejudice that women face in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It explores the social and economic factors that militate against the integration of women into senior administrative and political leadership positions in the continent. It contends that if women are under represented in Africa because of open or indirect mechanism of exclusion and discrimination, then educating women and girls is not enough. Equity for women and girls will only change if the public and private sectors' institutions are galvanized to change simultaneously. Further it stresses that the public, private sectors and NGOs in Africa need to introduce diversity management programs as a policy at the national and regional government levels in order to engage talented women in its process of seeking sustainable development.
   The paper also argues that in offering women the opportunity to access economic resources as well as to disentangle their identities from those of their families they will contribute immensely in the sustainable development process of Africa. It contends that no development process will be totally beneficial to a nation if it does not involve women. The concluding section recommended some policies that would effectively reduce discrimination against women in the public service as well as stimulate and integrate talented women interests in the social, economic, leadership, and political development of Africa.

AB  - The progressive recommendations of the National Health Service Commission of 1942-1944 have attracted historical attention but the three and a half million words of evidence given to it have hardly done so. This article reviews this testimony, which gave unrivalled detail on the fragmented state of South Africa's healthcare structures and on the variety of its personnel. In addition it supplied insights into social attitudes and prejudices related to health and medicine in a racially segregated society on the eve of apartheid. The paper analyses the problems that this ground-breaking commission encountered, and explores whether there were 'lions in the way' of its reforms, as was suggested in an encounter with an influential witness. The article probes whether there was a tangential relationship between the evidence, and the commission's conclusions on new health centres as the basis of a radical new national health system. In evaluating whether these reforms were stultified by the election of an apartheid government in 1948 (as others have argued), it concludes that the Gluckman recommendations had already failed before this because they ignored political and professional interest groups. The article also assesses reasons for the contrast between the commission's grandiose recommendations and its modest effects.

AB  - Historians usually consider medieval confraternities as lay religious communities involved in devotional and charitable practices which carried out a socializing function as well. Confraternities, when seen through this lens, fundamentally appear to be inclusive communities which helped strengthen the identities of good believers and good citizens by focusing on the solidarity created among the members of the association itself. This ecumenical vision depends essentially on a positive prejudice which is automatically ascribed to the concept of solidarity, and which often leads one to forget that, though solidarity in some cases may have rationales for inclusion, in many others it can be a source of exclusion. Yet, these opposite characteristics only seem to conflict, because to exclude someone means including someone else at the same time. The aim of this short paper is to discuss these aspects, especially with respect to northern late medieval Italy, along the lines of the question posed in these preliminary remarks: were medieval confraternities inclusive communities or exclusive institutions?

AB  - Recent work on social change has complicated the picture regarding the influence of intergroup contact with majority groups on minority group members' perceptions of inequality and willingness to engage in social action. The present research investigated the ability of a commonality-focused message to inspire political solidarity between minority groups, as well as the potential moderating role of intergroup contact with a majority group on the efficacy of this message for political solidarity. Across two experiments, as hypothesized, political solidarity from one minority group to another was highest within a commonality condition, relative to group-boundaries salient and control conditions, which was explained by increases in commonality perceptions. As expected, however, these effects were moderated by majority group contact, such that those with high levels of contact with majority group were less likely to show the commonality-to-political solidarity relation. Implications for intergroup contact and more broadly social change are discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc.

KW  - sport and gender
KW  - women's soccer
KW  - mass communication
KW  - Italy
AB  - The paper presents sport as an important cultural model in modern Italian society, fully integrated into the logic of consumption, communication and spectacularisation. In this sense, sport emerges as a field in the Bourdieuan sense, or rather, 'a socially defined independent sphere with strong frameworks of sense and meaning'. Sport creates social and cultural capital, often objectified in the result (record), and it also reproduces and reinforces social distinction within each particular sport. An example is provided by the case study presented here on Italian women's soccer over the past ten years. The research, carried out on a representative sample of one hundred female players, shows that stereotypes and social prejudices associated with gender dominate the game. At the same time, it can be observed that the dynamics of communication and consumption, closely related to one another in the sphere of sports over the last ten years, reproduce and subsequently reinforce the separation of men and women in social relationships also found in society. For a long time the history of sport was characterised by a clear male predominance, and even today sports are marked by deep gender differences: men participate more in sports in general and at the same time male sports are more relevant economically and culturally.

AB  - This essay explores the critique of 1980s' multiculturalism in Caryl Phillips's 1986 screenplay Playing Away, which depicts a cricket match held between a black British team from Brixton and the well-to-do white villagers of the fictional town of Sneddington. It proceeds by considering Phillips's long-standing commitment to sport as an opportunity where new social and cultural relations can be built which question established prejudices and divisions, captured in the notion of 'sporting tribalry', before turning to a close engagement with the film's key elements. Rather than depict two teams, one black and urban, the other white and rural, at loggerheads both on and off the cricket pitch, Playing Away attends to the many overlappings and similarities shared across communities that are discerned as a way of challenging prevailing models of multicultural difference. Phillips shows how these shared challenges may bring communities together through 'sporting tribalry', where they might learn from each other and move forward from entrenched and divisive notions of difference or 'race relations'. Ultimately, the remoulded model of multiculturalism suggested by Playing Away exists more as a promise than an achieved reality: as is indicated by the vexed cricket match between the teams which forms the climax of the film, the tensions of class, culture, race and gender are not easily erased in the late 1980s.

AB  - Interethnic contact is considered a potent tool for the generation of interethnic understanding and tolerance. This faith has engendered countless social projects that seek to stimulate contact between members of different ethnic groups under 'optimal conditions'. However, the academic literature does not stipulate how, if at all, these optimal conditions can be realized in real world interventions. This article investigates how the organizers of a number of Dutch projects for 'contact under optimal conditions' conceived of such contact and how these conceptualisations informed how projects were set up, executed and experienced. The analysis demonstrates that organizers conceived of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' as a natural autonomous process. Optimal conditions for this natural process were assumed to be guaranteed when project workers interfered as little as possible with the contact between participants. The 'natural' processes thus engendered were assumed to lead to the recognition of fundamental sameness between two ethnic groups and/or the recognition of the superficiality of their differences. In practice, however, projects were set up in ways that privileged the exchange of uncontroversial information on personal tastes and ethnic differences. Moreover, the emphasis on the dual recognition of fundamental sameness and superficial difference produced a discursive context in which the exploration of conflicts of interest was foreclosed. These results suggest that the notion of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' may in practice have connotations that lead to practices that reinforce, rather than challenge, existing prejudices and misunderstandings.

AB  - The concept of truth is one of the pivotal elements in Mary Wollstonecraft's works. In line with her philosophical treatise, Maria: or the Wrongs of Woman (published posthumously in 1798) it becomes a paradigmatic expression of her thought. The author textualizes the obfuscation of the truth and the repression of the heorine's self because of her unconventional conduct not judged in consonance with the social rules that govern patriarchal institutions. The novel might be read as a profound reflection on any form of prejudice and intellectual confinement of its time in which woman strives to regain her role as individual.

AB  - Studies on ethics in information organization have deeply contributed to the recognition of the social dimension of Information Science. The subject approach to information is linked to an ethical dimension because one of its major concerns is related to its reliability and usefulness in a specific discursive community or knowledge domain. In this direction, we propose, through an exploratory research design with qualitative and inductive characteristics, to identify the specific terminology that Brazilian indexing languages allow for terms relating to male homosexuality. We also analyzed the terms assigned to papers published in the Journal of Homosexuality, Sexualities and Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health between the years 2005 to 2009. From this analysis of terms and the Brazilian indexing languages, we see (1) the Brazilian context, (2) imprecision in the terminology, (3) indications of prejudices disseminated by political correctness, (4) biased representation of the subject matter, (5) and the presence of figures of speech.

AB  - Romani women, both immigrant and native, face a greater risk of social exclusion because of the prejudices that mainstream society has about the Roma, and especially because they are women and some of them immigrants as well. This paper analyses how Romani immigrant and native women are building pan-ethnic identities, sharing alliances and developing common strategies in Spain. Previous studies on Romani women have tended to see them as passive and not active agents. Thus, very few have focused on the specific case of Romani immigrant women and on their modes of incorporation in their new contexts of reception. Drawing on data from two qualitative studies of Roma immigrant women and Gitanas in Spain, the authors demonstrate how everyday-life interactions and shared interests at informal and formal encounters lead to building solidarity alliances and sharing transnational narratives, thus overcoming subgroup ethnic boundaries and stereotypes. The analysis is carried out from the 'other women' approach, taking into account the voices of all types of Romani women, illiterate and literate, in the whole research process.

T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Middle- and upper-class Jewish women enjoyed less equality within their faith communities than Christian counterparts. They were represented in every strand of the suffrage movement, and in 1912 formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage (JLWS), modelled on similar Christian leagues. A study of the origins of the JLWS, and its relations with parallel organisations, shows religious difference to have been no barrier, and even conducive to, cross-denominational collaboration. The JLWS confounded (largely male) communal expectations that it would not influence London's East End, and would exacerbate prejudice against Jews. Post-1918, Jewish women were denied the level of equality within their faith congregations achieved by their Christian peers.

TI  - Victims of the Rhodesian Immigration Policy: Polish Refugees from the Second World War
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - On the surface, Southern Rhodesia was a melting pot into which people of European origin were absorbed, mixed with one another and forged new identities. In reality, Rhodesia failed to permit non-British Europeans such as Poles, their fair share of the Rhodesian dream. Behind this lay not only British Rhodesians self-perception of their superiority to other Europeans but also the fear that other European immigrants might have communist connections. The British placed different white ethnic groups on a scale based on their perceived distance from white British cultural and political values. Polish people found themselves near the bottom of the scale because British whites suspected them of being communists or Jews and of holding different cultural values, such as greater liberality about race relations. British Rhodesian discrimination against the Poles was revealed especially in the reception Polish refugees received upon arriving in Rhodesia during the Second World War, evidenced in the placement of refugee settlements and the provision of social services, as well as discrimination in the employment sector. Although ethnic prejudice lay at the centre of Rhodesian discrimination, the immigration policy and treatment of the Poles also reflected conflicting concerns. On the one hand the Rhodesian government had an obligation to accommodate war refugees on behalf of the Imperial government, while, on the other hand, they did not want a deluge of non-British whites which might dilute British ethnic purity and spread communist ideas. We examine the nature, application and impact of this discriminatory policy on Polish refugees during and immediately after the Second World War, arguing that ambivalence towards Polish refugees constituted a larger feature of Rhodesian society.

AB  - Despite frequent suggestions that dominance-subordination relationships in infancy can affect subsequent agonistic potential during adult life, to our knowledge no explicit test has been made. Experiments have shown that adverse conditions during early development can have long-term effects on a variety of traits ranging from growth to competitive behaviour. In many vertebrate species, the main social setting in which the infant develops is a sibling group where competition is often mediated by a dominance hierarchy. Here, we show in a long-lived marine bird that subordination to an aggressive sibling throughout infancy does not compromise aggressiveness years later during adult life. Former junior and senior chicks of the blue-footed booby, whose typical brood of two chicks exhibits a consistent dominance-subordination relationship with strong 'trained winner' and 'trained loser' conditioning effects, did not differ in their aggressiveness while defending their nest against a conspecific intruder stimulus. Our results suggest that aggressive subordination and associated food deprivation, poor growth and elevated stress hormone during infancy do not prejudice aggressiveness of adult boobies during at least the first 13 years of life. Development of important traits such as aggressive tendencies may be buffered against the normal and predictable challenges of infancy.

AB  - Stereotypes have a legitimizing function. Results from Germany (N = 71) and New Zealand (N = 103) indicated that the perceived permissibility of acting toward groups with active or passive harm versus facilitation depends upon consensually shared stereotypes of the target group. Our findings were generally consistent with predictions derived from the BIAS Map in both nations, as the permissibility of specific behaviors was reliably associated with target group warmth-competence stereotype combinations. However, evaluations of warmth trumped evaluations of the competence of target groups in the extent to which they legitimized perceptions of active and passive harm directed toward them. Finally, the extent to which warmth-competence stereotypes legitimized perceptions of the acceptability of harm and facilitation was unsystematically related to individual differences in Social Dominance Orientation. People high in Social Dominance Orientation, but not Right-Wing Authoritarianism, viewed harmful behaviors as generally more permissible irrespective of specific target group stereotypes, and this pattern held cross-culturally.

AB  - A number of studies on CLIL, particularly from Spain, which is familiar to this author, will be analysed to show that there are numerous anomalies not only in the research, but in the analysis, and doubts about the conclusions drawn. CLIL instruction is not always necessarily that beneficial, and there is every reason to believe some students may be prejudiced by CLIL, and that not only academic, but also institutional, interests may be taking precedence over some students' interests in the state educational sector. Some research issues are covered in the detailed analysis of one study before a plea is made for ensuring that disinterested research is carried out into the overall effects of CLIL initiatives in state educational institutions and systems, so that the welfare of all state-school students is recognised and respected.

KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Globalization affords greater opportunities to learn about foreign peoples than in the past. What impacts do interpersonal contact, media exposure to and knowledge about China have on the American people's China policy preferences? Two large surveys of U.S. citizens were conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009 to explore whether knowledge about China and prejudice against the Chinese people and the Chinese government would mediate the relationship between contact and media exposure on the one hand, and U.S. China policy preferences on the other. Results show that while knowledge played the expected mediating roles between contact and media exposure on the one hand, and prejudice against the Chinese people on the other, greater knowledge of China was actually associated with greater negativity toward the Chinese government, which in turn contributed to desires for tougher China policies. Both media exposure and interpersonal contact thus had mixed effects on China policy preferences.

AB  - Authoritarianism is a stable construct in terms of individual differences (social attitudes based on personality and values), but its manifestations and behavioral outcomes may depend on contextual factors. In the present experiment, we investigated whether authoritarianism is sensitive to religious influences in predicting rigid morality. Specifically, we investigated whether authoritarians, after supraliminal religious priming, would show, in hypothetical moral dilemmas, preference for impersonal societal norms even at the detriment of interpersonal, care-based prosociality toward proximal persons and acquaintances in need. The results confirmed the expectations, with a small effect size for the religious priming x authoritarianism interaction. In addition, these results were specific to participants' authoritarianism and not to their individual religiosity. The interaction between authoritarian dispositions and religious ideas may constitute a powerful combination leading to behaviors that are detrimental for the well-being and the life of others, even proximal people, in the name of abstract deontology.

TI  - 'What Have We Got to Do with Fun?': Littlewood, Price, and the Policy Makers
T2  - NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - Joan Littlewood blamed anti-socialist prejudice for Theatre Workshop's hostile treatment by the Arts Council. Yet her failure to secure the Council's backing for the Fun Palace an open-ended project for an arts, entertainment, and education centre she developed with architect Cedric Price may be better expressed as a collision between anarchy and bureaucracy. Following Nadine Holdsworth's 1997 article for New Theatre Quarterly, They'd Have Pissed on My Grave": the Arts Council and Theatre Workshop', in this article Juliet Rufford argues that the project fell victim to a form of programme censorship because it broke the rules of culture and professionalism as defined by the major funding body for the arts. The concept of 'fun' is seen as vital to understanding the cynicism of the policy makers towards Price and Littlewood's proposals, but also as driving explorations of intermediality, interactive performance, and performative architecture that have since been taken up successfully by artists working within and beyond the subsidized sector. Juliet Rufford is a post-doctoral research associate at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and is co-convenor of the International Federation of Theatre Research's Theatre Architecture Working Group. She has written on theatre architecture, site-specific performance, scenography, and the politics of space for publications including Contemporary Theatre Review and the Journal of Architectural Education.

TI  - A General Theories of Hate Crime? Strain, Doing Difference and Self Control
T2  - CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - GOTTFREDSON
AB  - This article attempts to put forward a more holistic vision of hate crime causation by exploring the intersections which exist between three separate criminological theories. Within the extant literature both Robert Merton's strain theory and Barbara Perry's structured action theory of 'doing difference' have been widely used to explain why prejudice motivated crimes continue to pervade most communities. Together the theories help to illuminate the sociological factors which act to create immense fear of, and hatred towards, various minority identity groups. However, neither of these theories adequately explain why some individuals commit hate crimes while others, equally affected by socio-economic strains and social constructions of 'difference', do not. This article therefore moves beyond such macro explanations of hate crime by drawing upon Gottfredson and Hirschi's A General Theory of Crime (1990). Using typology research carried out by various academics, the article attempts to illustrate how socio-economic strains and general fears of 'difference' become mutually reinforcing determinants, promulgating a culture of prejudice against certain 'others', which in turn ultimately triggers the hate motivated behaviours of individuals with low self control.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in adult and child populations throughout the world. Childhood obesity has a great impact on adult cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; treatment of this pathological state is important given the significant health consequences. We investigated the effect of short-term lifestyle changes on the alteration of human serum paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activities, leptin, adiponectin, E-selectin, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) as atherogenic and antiatherogenic factors in obese children. PON1 protects lipoproteins against oxidation by hydrolyzing lipid peroxides in oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) and therefore may protect against atherosclerosis.
   Methods: A total of 23 white obese and overweight children (age, 11.43 +/- 1.78 years; 8 girls, 15 boys) participated in a 2-week-long lifestyle camp based on a diet and exercise program. Overweight and obesity were defined according to the national body mass index (BMI) reference tables for age and sex.
   Results: After a 2-week-long supervised diet and aerobic exercise program, obese children had significantly lower leptin (55.02 +/- 33.42 ng/ml vs 25.37 +/- 19.07 ng/ml; p < 0.0001), ADMA (0.68 +/- 0.15 mu mol/l vs 0.55 +/- 0.16 mu mol/l; p < 0.01), and E-selectin levels (67.19 +/- 30.35 ng/ml vs 46.51 +/- 18.40 ng/ml; p < 0.0001), whereas they had significantly higher PON1 paraoxonase activity (110.48 +/- 72.92 U/l vs 121.75 +/- 93.48 U/l; p < 0.05) besides the antiatherogenic alteration of the lipid profile and significant weight change (70.32 +/- 19.51 kg vs 67.01 +/- 18.75 kg, p < 0.0001; BMI, 28.95 +/- 5.05 kg/m(2) vs 27.43 +/- 4.82 kg/m(2), p < 0.0001). Adiponectin and PON1 arylesterase activity did not change significantly.
   Conclusions: Our investigation suggests that modifications in dietary habits and physical activity induce antiatherogenic changes in childhood obesity. These findings emphasize the major role of primary prevention and nonpharmaceutical treatment of childhood obesity through lifestyle changes based on diet and increased physical activity.

TI  - Does the Lack of a Profit Motive Affect Hiring in Academe? Evidence from the Market for Lawyers
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE
KW  - ECONOMICS
KW  - POLITICS
KW  - FACULTY
AB  - The comparative performance of academic and economic markets continues to be debated. One factor potentially distinguishing academic markets is the profit motive. Profit and competition have been shown to curb discrimination in markets, and the absence of profit discipline could result in myriad forms of prejudice in academic hiring. We explore the role of the profit motive in the performance of academic markets by comparing the pedigree of employees of top law schools and top law firms. Top law schools are much more likely to employ graduates of top ranked law schools than elite law firms, and the difference exists at both the junior and senior levels. We find no evidence that the graduates of top 5 law schools outperform grads of less prestigious schools in publications or citations. In the absence of a profit motive, academic hiring appears more likely to indulge a preference for pedigree, and by implication, this may explain other scholarly prejudices in the academy.

KW  - EVOLUTIONARY-THEORIES
KW  - KIN SELECTION
AB  - Understanding why we age is a long-lived open problem in evolutionary biology. Aging is prejudicial to the individual, and evolutionary forces should prevent it, but many species show signs of senescence as individuals age. Here, I will propose a model for aging based on assumptions that are compatible with evolutionary theory: i) competition is between individuals; ii) there is some degree of locality, so quite often competition will be between parents and their progeny; iii) optimal conditions are not stationary, and mutation helps each species to keep competitive. When conditions change, a senescent species can drive immortal competitors to extinction. This counter-intuitive result arises from the pruning caused by the death of elder individuals. When there is change and mutation, each generation is slightly better adapted to the new conditions, but some older individuals survive by chance. Senescence can eliminate those from the genetic pool. Even though individual selection forces can sometimes win over group selection ones, it is not exactly the individual that is selected but its lineage. While senescence damages the individuals and has an evolutionary cost, it has a benefit of its own. It allows each lineage to adapt faster to changing conditions. We age because the world changes.

AB  - This article introduces the notion of genetic essentialist biases: cognitive biases associated with essentialist thinking that are elicited when people encounter arguments that genes are relevant for a behavior, condition, or social group. Learning about genetic attributions for various human conditions leads to a particular set of thoughts regarding those conditions: they are more likely to be perceived as (a) immutable and determined, (b) having a specific etiology, (c) homogeneous and discrete, and (d) natural, which can lead to the naturalistic fallacy. There are rare cases of "strong genetic explanation" when such responses to genetic attributions may be appropriate; however, people tend to overweigh genetic attributions compared with competing attributions even in cases of "weak genetic explanation," which are far more common. The authors reviewed research on people's understanding of race, gender, sexual orientation, criminality, mental illness, and obesity through a genetic essentialism lens, highlighting attitudinal, cognitive, and behavioral changes that stem from consideration of genetic attributions as bases of these categories. Scientific and media portrayals of genetic discoveries are discussed with respect to genetic essentialism, as is the role that genetic essentialism has played (and continues to play) in various public policies, legislation, scientific endeavors, and ideological movements in recent history. Last, moderating factors and interventions to reduce the magnitude of genetic essentialism, which identify promising directions to explore in order to reduce these biases, are discussed.

AB  - People evaluate stigmatized group members negatively when they attribute negative personal outcomes to discrimination, even when discrimination is the likely cause. The present studies examined whether similar interpersonal costs exist for attributing a positive personal outcome to discrimination in the context of positive stereotypes. In Study 1, 129 participants read an excerpt written by an Asian student who attributed an unexpectedly high essay grade to discrimination, writing quality, or easy grading. Participants evaluated the student least favourably when he attributed the positive outcome to discrimination. In Study 2, 140 participants evaluated a successful Asian job applicant less favourably than a successful, white applicant, although both applicants attributed the positive outcome to group membership. The implications for how stigmatized group members perceive and respond to prejudice and discrimination are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Leprosy is a potentially disabling infectious disease that evolves into emotional issues due to the prejudice that persists about the illness. The endemic has declined substantially with multidrug therapy (MDT) in the 80's; however, new demands associated with the reduction of stigma and the improvement of the affected people's quality of life have emerged. In Brazil, leprosy is still a public health problem. Piaui is the second state in the Northeast in prevalence and detection, and Teresina is a hyperendemic city. This study aimed to analyze the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people in treatment for leprosy in Teresina/PI. Methods: An observational study was conducted using the SF-36 (a specific questionnaire for assessing quality of life), which sought the determinants of poor quality of life among people with leprosy, outlining the sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics of the 107 patients interviewed. Results: The correlations between the variables showed five determinants of HRQoL: late diagnosis, multibacillary forms, reactions, disability diagnosis grade II, and prejudice. The profile of the participants showed that leprosy still affects the lower social classes in historically endemic areas, causing high percentages of secondary injuries that compromise the work capacity and quality of life of the affected people, perpetuating the stigma associated with the disease. Conclusions: The study reinforces the need to implement more effective strategies of disease control, due to the development of severe and disabling forms of leprosy is directly related to poor HRQoL in the same cured patient.

AB  - This research examined the effects of the labels "fat" vs. "overweight" in the expression of weight bias, with the prediction that the label "fat" biases individuals to respond more negatively than does the label "overweight." In Study 1, participants' attitudes toward people labeled as fat were less favorable than were their attitudes toward people labeled as overweight. In Studies 2 and 3, although participants chose similar-sized figures to depict fat and overweight targets, weight stereotypes and weight attitudes were more negative toward people labeled as fat than those labeled as overweight. In addition, the endorsement of weight stereotypes mediated the biasing effect of the "fat" label on weight prejudice. Implications of this work for prejudice researchers and for public attitudes are discussed.

AB  - Everyday conversations among non-Indigenous Australians are a significant site in which racism towards Indigenous Australians is reproduced and maintained. This study explores the possibilities of everyday antiracism by asking how people negotiate racist discourses in interpersonal contexts. Twelve first year psychology students (10 female, 2 male, aged 18-50) who had completed a compulsory Indigenous studies course were recruited as participants. Semi-structured interviews were thematically analysed for the constraints and facilitators for responding to racism in everyday contexts. As constraints against speaking up, participants offered 'social expectations to fit in', 'fear of provoking aggression and conflict', assessments of 'the type of relationship', whether they 'could make a difference' and the 'type of racism'. As a facilitator for speaking up, participants reported they were confident in challenging erroneous statements when they felt well informed and authoritative about the facts. The research suggests that everyday antiracism requires a preparedness to deal with possible discomfort and 'bad feeling' which participants reported avoiding. The paper concludes with suggestions for stimulating critical thinking and intergroup dialogue in relation to everyday antiracism. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Punjabi Society is full of various social groups which are further divided into several castes or clans living together for centuries. Although they speak Punjabi language, no matter how much different their dialects are, yet their prejudice, bias and social status have created stereotypes on basis of their social experience. This research is aimed at analysing the caste-stereotypes and their role in the language of Punjabi Society in Punjab (Pakistan). Caste-stereotypes in Punjabi Society are linguistic beliefs and have significant role in creating discrimination among the people belonging to different castes. These caste- stereotypes are affecting the social relations and intercommunication among the people of various castes in the society.

AB  - The social negotiation maintains that the main roles of the environment are to offer alternative views, to develop knowledge, to seek knowledge that is compatible with students' own construction and understanding of the world. It also enhances critical thinking skills such as studying a subject or problem with open-mindedness, determining the facts of a new situation or subject without prejudice, placing these facts and information in a pattern so that students can understand them and accepting or rejecting the source values and conclusions based upon experience, judgment, and beliefs. When students assimilate their current experience with their existing schema, it becomes easier for them to retain learning (Fink, 2003). In this paper, the aim is to show how critical thinking strategies can be used for young learners in reading classes by demonstrating the main steps in the hierarchy of Bloom's taxonomy and applying them to the fairy tales, which lead the learners to show some improvement in their critical thinking strategies.

AB  - Two studies examined the moderating effects of right wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation on the relationship between terrorist images (soldiers versus criminals) and preference for counterterrorist actions (military aggression versus criminal prosecution). Study 1 indicated that the perception of Al-Qaeda terrorists as soldiers was related to preference for military counterterrorism, especially among people high in social dominance orientation. The relationship between the perception of Al-Qaeda terrorists as criminals and preference for the criminal prosecution of terrorists was strengthened among those high in right wing authoritarianism. Study 2 showed that when terrorists were framed as soldiers, social dominance orientation was related to support for military counterterrorism. When terrorists were framed as criminals, only people who endorsed high levels of right wing authoritarianism supported criminal prosecution of terrorists. Social dominance orientation was related to opposition towards military counterterrorism when terrorists were not perceived as soldiers or framed as criminals. It was also related to opposition towards criminal prosecution of terrorists when terrorists were framed as criminals. The findings suggest that different terrorist images are related to preference for counterterrorism that corresponds with the content of the images and individuals' chronic ideological orientations.

AB  - When an anti-gay initiative is on the ballot, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals must contend not only with the tangible consequences if the initiative passes (e. g., a lack of rights) but also with the stress of the campaign itself. The current research examined the consequences of the campaign associated with California's Proposition 8 on LGB individuals' well-being and personal relationships. LGB participants (N = 354) completed a survey in the 5 days before the 2008 election. In both quantitative results and open-ended responses, participants revealed much personal ambivalence. Participants reported experiencing both negative and positive emotions (e. g., anger, pride) and were particularly ambivalent regarding the effect of Proposition 8 on relationships with friends, family, coworkers, and their intimate partner. The campaign created opportunities for support but also opportunities for stigmatization and conflict. These results demonstrate the powerful effects that campaigns themselves, and not just outcomes, have on targeted individuals.

   The implementation of and communication about matters associated with gender in medical education have been predominantly perceived as women's issues. This study aimed to explore attitudes towards and experiences of gender-related issues among key male members of faculties of medicine.
   Methods
   We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 male education leaders from the six medical schools in Sweden. The interviews were analysed qualitatively using a modified grounded theory approach.
   Results
   The core category -'important... but of low status'- reflects ambivalent attitudes towards gender-related issues in medicine among male education leaders. All informants were able to articulate why gender matters. As doctors, they saw gender as a determinant of health and, as bystanders, they had witnessed inequalities and the wasting of women's competence. However, they had doubts about gender-related issues and found them to be overemphasised. Gender education was seen as a threat to medical school curricula as a consequence of the time and space it requires. Gender-related issues were considered to be unscientifically presented, to mostly concern women's issues and to tend to involve 'male bashing' (i.e. gender issues were often labelled as ideological and political). Interviewees asked for facts and knowledge, but questioned specific lessons and gender theory. Experiences of structural constraints, such as prejudice, hierarchies and homosociality, were presented, making gender education difficult and downgrading it.
   Conclusions
   The results indicate that male faculty leaders embrace the importance of gender-related issues, but do not necessarily recognise or defend their impact on an area of significant knowledge and competence in medicine. To change this and to engage more men in gender education, faculty measures are needed to counteract prejudice and to upgrade the time allocation, merits and status of gender implementation work. Based on our findings, we present and discuss possible ways to interest more men and to improve gender education in medicine.

AB  - Diverse advocacy groups have pushed for the recognition of cultural differences in health care as a means to redress inequalities in the U.S., elaborating a form of biocitizenship that draws on evidence of racial and ethnic health disparities to make claims on both the state and health care providers. These efforts led to federal regulations developed by the U.S. Office of Minority Health requiring health care organizations to provide Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services. Based on ethnographic research at workshops and conferences, in-depth interviews with cultural competence trainers, and an analysis of postings to a moderated listserv with 2,000 members, we explore cultural competence trainings as a new type of social technology in which health care providers and institutions are urged to engage in ethical self-fashioning to eliminate prejudice and embody the values of cultural relativism. Health care providers are called on to re-orient their practice (such as habits of gaze, touch, and decision-making) and to act on their own subjectivities to develop an orientation toward Others that is "culturally competent." We explore the diverse methods that cultural competence trainings use to foster a health care provider's ability to be self-reflexive, including face-to-face workshops and classes and self-guided on-line modules. We argue that the hybrid formation of culturally appropriate health care is becoming detached from its social justice origins as it becomes rationalized by and more firmly embedded in the operations of the health care marketplace.

KW  - RESIDENT
AB  - Aim
   To review critically the traditional concept of autonomy, propose an alternative relational interpretation of autonomy, and discuss how this would operate in identifying and addressing ethical issues that arise in the context of nursing home care for older adults.
   Background
   Respect for patient autonomy has been the cornerstone of clinical bioethics for several decades. Important though this principle is, there is debate on how to interpret the core concept of autonomy. We review the appeal of the traditional approach to autonomy in health care and then identify some of the difficulties with this conception.
   Methods
   We use philosophical methods to explain and discuss the traditional and relational conceptions of autonomy and we illuminate our discussion with examples of various contextual applications.
   Conclusion
   We support the relational conception of autonomy as offering a richer, more contextualized understanding of autonomy which attends to the social, political and economic conditions that serve as background to an agent's deliberations. To illuminate these ideas, we discuss the situation of frail older adults who frequently find their autonomy limited not only by their medical conditions but also by cultural prejudices against the aged and by the conditions commonly found within the nursing homes in which many reside. We propose ways of improving the relational autonomy of this population.

TI  - Leprosy and Stigma in the Context of International Migration
T2  - LEPROSY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - If it can be argued that no single attribute or condition (leprosy included) is inherently or universally considered to be 'deeply discrediting,' to quote Goffman, then we must consider how external factors shape stigma associated with that condition in different cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Often, an analysis of what is perceived to be stigma towards people affected by leprosy uncovers other prejudices or stigmatising attitudes associated with class, gender, and/or ethnic inequalities in that society. The movement of people across international borders adds new dimensions to the experience of leprosy, as affected individuals confront different sets of understandings of the disease among healthcare professionals, friends, family, and employers in host and sending countries. Preconceptions of the immigrant 'other' in host countries may be bound up with notions of disease and danger, further complicating the experience of leprosy treatment for immigrants. Drawing on the work of others and on early stage qualitative research on leprosy among Brazilian immigrants to the United States, this paper will consider the ways in which immigration and transnational processes could affect the experience of stigma among immigrants affected by leprosy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - From 1900 to 1902, the General Federation of Women's Clubs' official commitment to "unity in diversity" was tested to the limits when an explosive debate over the admission of African American women's clubs deeply, and in some cases irreparably, divided individual clubs and state federations and nearly resulted in the loss of half of the organization's burgeoning membership. The controversy reveals a captivating, complicated, and at times bizarre struggle between Northern and Southern white members of the General Federation to defend their particular views of race and, in many cases, to obfuscate their own deep-seated racial prejudices. Most members ultimately sacrificed principle for the sake of federation unity, albeit a unity without racial diversity, and thus squandered the opportunity to combine the talents and energies of all organized women in an effort toward social justice and humanitarian reform.

AB  - Background: Rheumatic diseases have a significant adverse impact on the individual from physical, mental and social aspects, resulting in a low health-related quality of life (HRQL). There is a lack of longitudinal studies on HRQL in people with rheumatic diseases that focus on factors promoting HRQL instead of risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between suggested health promoting factors at baseline and outcome in HRQL at a 12 month follow-up in people with rheumatic diseases.
   Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted in 185 individuals with rheumatic diseases with questionnaires one week and 12 months after rehabilitation in a Swedish rheumatology clinic. HRQL was assessed by SF-36 together with suggested health factors. The associations between SF-36 subscales and the health factors were analysed by multivariable logistic regressions.
   Results: Factors predicting better outcome in HRQL in one or several SF-36 subscales were being younger or middle-aged, feeling painless, having good sleep structure, feeling rested after sleep, performing low effort of exercise more than twice per week, having strong sense of coherence (SOC), emotional support and practical assistance, higher educational level and work capacity. The most important factors were having strong SOC, feeling rested after sleep, having work capacity, being younger or middle-aged, and having good sleep structure.
   Conclusions: This study identified several factors that promoted a good outcome in HRQL to people with rheumatic diseases. These health factors could be important to address in clinical work with rheumatic diseases in order to optimise treatment strategies.

AB  - In this essay I seek to show that a philosophy of modesty informs core aspects of both Nietzsche's critique of morality and what he intends to replace morality with, namely, an ethics of self-cultivation. To demonstrate this I focus on Dawn: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality, a largely neglected text in his corpus where Nietzsche carries out a quite wide-ranging critique of morality, including Mitleid. It is one of Nietzsche's most experimental works and is best read, I claim, as an Epicurean-inspired critique of the present and an exercise in moral therapy. In the opening sections I draw attention to the wider social dimension of the text and its concern with a morality of compassion, which is rarely done in the literature. I then turn to highlighting Nietzsche's "Epicurean moment," followed by two sections on Nietzsche on the self in which I aim to bring to light his ethics of self-cultivation and show in what ways his revaluation makes central to ethics a modest egoism and care of self. In the conclusion to the essay I provide a contrast between Nietzsche and Kant and deal with reservations readers might have about his ethics. Overall, the essay seeks to make a contribution to an appreciation of Dawn as a work of moral therapy.

AB  - Openness to Experience and Need for Closure (NFC) are dispositional variables related to social-cultural right-wing attitudes. The present study investigated their joint effects. Factor analysis revealed an 'experiential' dimension with high loading openness items, and a 'cognition' dimension with high loadings for most NFC items and about a quarter of the openness item set. The experiential openness items were weakly related to right-wing attitudes, demonstrating little predictive value. Conversely, the cognitive openness and NFC items were powerful predictors of right-wing attitudes, and also played an important role in integrative models, both as a predictor of authoritarianism-based racism and as a mediator of age related increments in right-wing attitudes. It is concluded that right-wing attitudes should be primarily understood in terms of (motivated) cognition, and to a smaller extent in terms of experiential openness. The distinction between 'experiential' and 'cognitive' openness is critically assessed, and it is asserted that because cognition is a multifaceted construct openness contains more than one cognitive dimension.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the EEG pattern of seizures in patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS). Methods: The clinical and EEG data of 701 BCECTS patients with at least a 3 years follow-up were reviewed from 10 epilepsy centers. Results: Thirty-four seizures were recorded in 30 patients. Four different ictal EEG patterns (A-D) were identified. The most frequent (pattern A) was characterized by low voltage activity of fast rhythmic spikes, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency, and occurred in 14 children. Pattern B (six patients) was constituted by a discharge of spikes intermixed with sharp waves increasing in frequency and amplitude. Pattern C (seven children) consisted of monomorphic theta which progressively formed a discharge increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency. Pattern D (5 children) was characterized by a initial focal depression of the electrical activity, followed by one of the three above described patterns. In 21 out of 28 children, the initial ictal pattern, altered from one pattern to another one. No clinical or EEG feature was predictive of a specific ictal pattern. Discussion: We failed to identify a unique ictal EEG pattern in our patients with BCECTS. The occurrence of per-ictal features, e.g., initial EEG depression or postictal slowing, is common and should not be interpreted with prejudice. Alteration of ictal EEG pattern from one to another is not in conflict with the diagnosis of BCECTS. (C) 2010 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes Stories: Crime and Mystery from the Text to the Illustrations
T2  - CAHIERS VICTORIENS & EDOUARDIENS
LA  - English
AB  - This essay argues that the illustrations provided for the serial publication of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle-mainly by Sidney Paget-constitute a significant supplement that both illustrates common ideological prejudices of the nineteenth century and undermines any complete containment of evil and crime by the investigator. This ambivalence between social conformism and a disquieting urge in Paget's drawings appears for instance in the similitude between images of Holmes and images of Moriarty, his arch enemy, or through the stylized settings which suggest a lasting threat in the outside, non-domestic world. The specific style of the illustrations, often unrealistic and bent on euphemizing violence, also contributes to this ambivalent celebration of crime fighting that only partly hides some distrust as to its success. Eventually, by relating the topic at hand to the global debate on photographic and mechanical reproduction in the nineteenth century, it appears that the various disguises Holmes uses in the plots are rendered graphically by Paget as entirely new images of the characters, which again ambivalently points both to his mastery over crime fighting modern artefacts and to some uncertainty (generating cultural anxiety) over the question of stable identities.

TI  - Perceptions of Diabetes, Barriers to Disease Management, and Service Needs: A Focus Group Study of Working Adults With Diabetes in Hawaii
T2  - PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE
LA  - English
KW  - COMMUNITY
AB  - Introduction
   Research about the support needs for and barriers to successful disease management of working adults with diabetes is limited. Our objective was to gain an in-depth understanding of how working adults in Hawaii perceive diabetes, barriers to disease management, and the services needed to keep people healthy and working.
   Methods
   From November 2008 through March 2009, we conducted focus group interviews with 74 employed adults with diabetes enrolled in the Hawaii Demonstration to Maintain Independence and Employment project. Responses to questions were analyzed within and across groups to identify recurring themes. A third layer of analysis examined themes across responses to all questions, specifically, how barriers related to identified service needs.
   Results
   Employed participants with diabetes experienced pervasive effects on their lives as a result of the disease, although they interpreted these effects positively or negatively. Barriers to disease management, such as additional health issues, social prejudice, and lack of social support, indicated a need to educate the general public about the disease. Participants identified needing social support from other people with diabetes, psychological support to address the emotional side of diabetes, and coordinated teams of specialists to address medication side effects and other health-related barriers to disease management. Many participants discussed the challenge of integrating diabetes management with work and family responsibilities and the need for monetary support.
   Conclusion
   This study provides insight into how employed adults perceived their disease and what they perceived as challenges to successfully managing diabetes. The findings provide future directions for community and workplace diabetes initiatives.

AB  - Providers suspect malingering when patients seek compensation for injury or when pain is unconfirmed via objective evidence, judged disproportionate to the cause, or recalcitrant to treatment. Suspicions or claims of malingering may prejudice treatment or reimbursement decisions. The purpose of this archival study was to identify malingering in a predominantly Hispanic workers' compensation population seeking treatment for pain. We used a correlational archival research design to collect data from the medical records of 91 patients treated over a 10-year period in a specialty clinic. Inclusion criteria included individuals with psychologic evaluation for persistent pain that affected function. Using a priori power analysis for a medium effect size, power of .80, and alpha of .05, data from 85 medical records were necessary to meet correlational significance. The study sample reflects the ethnicity, educational level, and socioeconomic status of the larger U.S.-Mexico border community. The majority (93%) had workers' compensation and about one-third had active litigation. No one was diagnosed with malingering or pain disorder with primarily psychologic origins. Depression coexisted with chronic pain, and patients reported serious impairment in physical, occupational, and social function an average of 5 years after the onset of chronic pain. However, the vast majority of patients returned to work. In our experience, there is no place for the labeling and resultant stigma of malingering in chronic pain sufferers.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in romantic relationships experience stigma, prejudice, and discrimination stemming from widespread social devaluation of same-sex relationships. Research on same-sex couples has demonstrated a negative association between experiences of stigma and relationship quality. However, critical questions remain unanswered regarding how experiences of stigma become more or less meaningful within the context of same-sex relationships. This paper presents a study of the stories that a purposive sample of 99 individuals in same-sex relationships wrote about their relational high points, low points, decisions, and goals, as well as their experiences of stigma directly related to their relationships. Narrative analysis of these stories revealed that participants utilized several psychological strategies for making meaning of their experiences of stigma within the context of their relationships. Some participants framed stigma as having a negative impact on their relationships, while others framed stigma as relevant, but external to their lives. Some participants saw stigma as providing an opportunity to (re)define notions of commitment and relational legitimacy. Additionally, many participants framed stigma as bringing them closer to their partners and strengthening the bond within their relationships. The results of this study illuminate the psychological strategies individuals in same-sex couples use to make meaning of, cope with, and overcome societal devaluation thereby furthering understandings of the association between stigma and intimacy within marginalized relationships.

AB  - This article explores how computers and the Internet are represented among young, educated people in Niger and the social expectations that are attached to their use. It argues that pre-existing social and economic conditions play an important role in shaping the meanings associated with these devices. Thus, in a context of poverty and unemployment, the Internet and computers are perceived as technologies that may help young people and their country integrate into a modern world of economic opportunities and well-being via the transnational and transcultural interactions that take place in cyberspace. The Internet is associated with the ideas of modernity and 'leapfrogging' development. However, because of the lack of computer equipment and adequate infrastructure, these expectations are largely exaggerated, and they divert attention from the actual possibilities for change that reside in people and not in technological devices. The research is based on fieldwork conducted among young, educated computer and Internet users during the summers of 2003 and 2004 in Niamey, the capital city of Niger and further complemented by data collected in 2008. Semistructured interviews were used to explore the reception of the Internet and the representations associated with them. Although the term 'educated' may sometimes refer to traditional or Arabic/Islamic education in Niger, we restricted the use of the word to refer to modern western-style education (without prejudice or pejorative label to those who are not in that category).

AB  - The literature has noted that native views about legal as opposed to undocumented immigration in the United States differ. Furthermore, native views about immigration are known to vary by gender. Yet, most surveys do not inquire native men and women about their views with regards to the two distinct immigrant groups, thus impeding an analysis of differences in preferences toward legal and undocumented immigrants from the same sample of natives. Using a recent San Diego County survey, we examine differences in native male and female opinions with regard to legal and undocumented immigration and their determinants. Native preferences toward immigration appear to significantly differ by gender as well as according to immigrants' legal status. In addition, public finance and welfare concerns are among the key factors driving native male and female preferences toward legal and undocumented immigration. However, native women's attitudes are also impacted by concerns regarding the social integration and economic assimilation of undocumented immigrants possibly related to the alleged prejudice factor.

T2  - LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - AFRO
KW  - RACE
AB  - In the national consciousness, Ecuador is a mestizo nation. However, it is also an ethnically diverse nation with sizable minorities of indigenous and Afro-descended peoples. In national surveys, there is also a considerable minority who self-identify as blanco (white). Although there is strong evidence of continuing discrimination and prejudice toward both indigenous and Afro-descended peoples, there is little public discussion or political action addressing such issues. The emergence of a powerful and resilient indigenous movement in the late 1980s gained international, interest and acclaim in the 1990s, in part because of the peaceful mobilization efforts and effective bargaining tactics of the movement. However, indigenous leaders usually have not engaged in a discourse of racismo and/or discriminacion. There has been much less social movement solidarity and activism among Afro-Ecuadorians, but their leaders commonly employ a discourse of racism and discriminacion. In August and September 2004, a survey of more than eight thousand adult Ecuadorians was conducted in regard to racism and related topics. In this research, we use several measures from this survey that focus on awareness of and sensitivity to issues of racism, prejudice, and discrimination. Self-identification of respondents enables us to contrast the responses of whites, mestizos, Indians, and Afro-Ecuadorians to the measures. Other independent variables of interest are level of education, the region in which the respondent resides, and whether the respondent lives in an urban or rural area. Regression results show differences among the ethnic groups in levels of awareness of racism, but more powerful predictors are level of education and rural residence.

AB  - Recent scholarship contends that collective action emerges when human rights are violated. This article investigates why Haitians without status in the Bahamas have yet to mobilize collectively for basic rights and protections, despite discrimination and exploitation. The article examines two analogies to explain their immobilization. The analogy of dry land drowning utilizes Goffman's Stigma (1963) framework to describe how social prejudice hinders the ability of Haitians without status to act, while the analogy of rip current survival explains how institutional drawbacks pull Haitians without status away from movement activity through a political process analysis. The article contends that both interpretations are inadequate when taken alone and provides suggestions for future research into Bahamian-Haitian relations.

KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - In the Journal of Moral Education, 39(2), Brenda Almond and Lawrence Blum debate the importance of tolerance versus acceptance in sex education. Blum defines acceptance as 'positive regard', in contradistinction to mere tolerance, 'a live and let live attitude toward others, an acceptance of coexistence, but with a disapproval of that "other"'. Employing consequentialist and definitional arguments, he defends an acceptant educational policy. I shore up this defence by addressing the issue of autonomy: specifically, I refute the claim that acceptance undermines parental autonomy in a morally unacceptable fashion. Drawing on Philip Pettit and Michael Smith's defence of the idea of 'orthonomy' or right-rule, I argue that orthonomy, rather than autonomy, should guide educational policy-making. I then show that the principle of orthonomy, together with teachers' professional responsibilities to ensure a safe and prejudice-free learning environment, entails that teachers have an inalienable responsibility to promote homophilic (gay-positive) values, regardless of whether they or their students' parents agree.

AB  - Most Brazilians believe that racial and socioeconomic inequalities tend to overlap-in other words, blacks are poorer because they have less education and worse jobs. In the past few years, however, several quantitative studies have presented an interesting puzzle: racial inequalities are strongest among those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy. This article explores the "elitist profile" of racial discrimination through eighty in-depth interviews with black professionals in Rio de Janeiro. The results show that interviewees describe their trajectories of social mobility through mechanisms that involve both socioeconomic and racial exclusion. Their perceptions of injustice, however, are more directly related to experiences of racial discrimination. In narrating incidents of discrimination, interviewees stress the distinction and tensions between what we call generalized prejudice and particularized universalism.

AB  - Given the influence of social conformity and prejudice, defendants pleading not guilty by reason of insanity face the significant challenges of securing fair and impartial juries. Attitudes and knowledge of the insanity defense are factors that may influence levels of impartiality. In the light of this, we set out to develop a scale to examine knowledge levels of the insanity defense and their influence on decision-making. Two studies were conducted to construct a scale designed to assess laypersons' knowledge of the insanity defense. Items measuring knowledge of the insanity defense were based on Perlin's (1995) insanity defense myths. The first study identified particular items in need of revision and subscales that required the development of additional items in order to improve reliability and construct validity in the second study. The second study used the revised scale, demonstrating improved validity and reliability. The scale also had acceptable predictive validity with reference to insanity defense verdicts.

KW  - RACE
AB  - This article argues that African Americans, especially males living in urban areas, are physically and mentally trapped on a Devil's Island. The penal colony on the coast of French Guiana is a metaphor for the boundaries and constraints that close off opportunities and constrain African American historical knowledge. The article argues that although African Americans have struggled to learn their history (e.g. economic, political and social), the goal of critically using that history to decipher their social world eludes them. While social movements of the twentieth century produced some racial progress, none of them generated enough progress to eliminate the racism that keeps Blacks on Devil's Island - racism that includes widely accepted mantras such as 'the United States is a Nation of Immigrants,' a historical 'sin of omission' that markets racism as merely prejudice within the context of pluralism and makes it more difficult for Whites to address the privilege their skin color provides and to acknowledge the structures in society that keep racism in place.

AB  - Adopting a comparative historical approach informed by Marxist theory of imperialism, this study demonstrates the tendencies toward conflict between past and present rising and declining imperial powers. In the present context the study compares and contrasts two types of imperialism: a highly militarised US empire based on wars and territorial occupations and a market-driven Chinese empire driven by an alliance of state, foreign and national capital. Both imperial systems are influenced by ooverseaso diasporas. In the case of the USA, an internal Zionist power configuration loyal to Israel subordinates Washington's Middle East policies to the economically prejudicial interests of a militarist state (Israel), while in the case of China the overseas diaspora facilitates and promotes investments and trade enhancing China's dynamic economic expansion. The emerging contradictions between and within the two conflicting styles of empire building, point to the need for a social transformation, enhancing the power and position of labour against the Zionised state and speculative economy in the USA and the new plutocrats in China.

AB  - This article argues that Tran Van Dinh's Blue Dragon, White Tiger, the first Vietnamese American novel written in English and published in the United States, helps to explain the victory of the Vietnamese communists over the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies. Some structures and theories developed in postcolonial criticism are used to elucidate the characters and the plot of this very important contribution to Vietnamese American literature, which captures the essentially poetic and humanistic soul of the Vietnamese people. Emphasis will be laid upon a discussion of the ironies of the U.S. intervention in Vietnamese politics, the destereotyping of the U.S. prejudicial portrayal of the communists, and a questioning of the "just cause" concept associated with the Vietnam War. The novel suggests reasons why Western political and economic agendas failed to win over the social and cultural hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people through a postcolonial discourse on the interactive socio-political aspects of the war.

AB  - Purpose: Laparoscopy has certainly brought considerable benefits to patients, but laparoscopic surgery requires a set of skills different from open surgery, and learning in the operating room may increase surgical time, and even may be harmful to patients. Several training programs have been developed to decrease these potential prejudices.
   Purposes: to describe the laparoscopic training program for urological residents of the "Hospital das Clinicas" of the Sao Paulo Medical School, to report urological procedures that are feasible in dry and wet labs, and to perform a critical analysis of the cost-benefit relation of advanced laparoscopic skills laboratory.
   Materials and Methods: The laparoscopic skill lab has two virtual simulators, three manual simulators, and four laparoscopic sets for study with a porcine model. The urology residents during their first year attend classes in the virtual and manual simulator and helps the senior urological resident in activities carried out with the laparoscopic sets. During the second year, the urological resident has six periods per week, each period lasting four hours, to perform laparoscopic procedures with a porcine model.
   Results: In a training program of ten weeks, one urological resident performs an average of 120 urological procedures. The most common procedures are total nephrectomy (30%), bladder suture (30%), partial nephrectomy (10%), pyeloplasty (10%), ureteral replacement or transuretero anastomosis (10%), and others like adrenalectomy, prostatectomy, and retroperitoneoscopy. These procedures are much quicker and caused less morbidity.
   Conclusion: Laparoscopic skills laboratory is a good method for achieving technical ability.

AB  - The UK's elite law firms have recently seen a shift from talking about equality of opportunity alone to the adoption of a diversity discourse as well. This article examines this transition for what it can tell us about the value of diversity strategies as a means for widening access to the corporate legal profession on the basis of social class, focusing on five elite law firms based in the City of London. A number of studies have demonstrated how cultural practices within the legal sector maintain exclusionary mechanisms based on class. There has been less attention to how this is sustained within an amended institutional framework which outwardly 'celebrates' difference. This research suggests that though diversity strategies do little to change organisational cultures, those that recognise both the depth of professional prejudice within the sector and the reality of educational inequality across the UK may prove relatively progressive nonetheless.

AB  - Recent research in social psychology suggests that people harbor "implicit race biases," biases which can be unconscious or uncontrollable. Because awareness and control have traditionally been deemed necessary for the ascription of moral responsibility, implicit biases present a unique challenge: do we pardon discrimination based on implicit biases because of its unintentional nature, or do we punish discrimination regardless of how it comes about? The present experiments investigated the impact such theories have upon moral judgments about racial discrimination. The results show that different theories differ in their impact on moral judgments: when implicit biases are defined as unconscious, people hold the biased agent less morally responsible than when these biases are defined as automatic (i.e., difficult to control), or when no theory of implicit bias is provided.

KW  - VERIFICATION
AB  - Most international sports organisations work on the premise that human beings come in one of two genders: male or female. Consequently, all athletes, including intersex and transgender individuals, must be assigned to compete in one or other category. Since the 1930s (not, as is popularly suggested, the 1960s) these organisations have relied on scientific and medical professionals to provide an 'objective' judgement of an athlete's eligibility to compete in women's national and international sporting events. The changing nature of these judgements reflects a great deal about our cultural, social and national prejudices, while the matter of testing itself has become a site of conflict for feminists and human rights activists. Because of the sensitive nature of this subject, histories of sex testing are difficult to write and research; this has lead to the repetition of inaccurate information and false assertions about gender fraud, particularly in relation to the 'classic' cases of Stella Walsh and Heinrich/Hermann/Dora Ratjen. As historians, we need to be extremely careful to differentiate between mythologies and histories.

T2  - RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES
LA  - English
AB  - Damas was long considered one of the three leading Negritude writers, along with Cesaire and Senghor, but in recent years he has been increasingly, unjustifiably overlooked. His lyric masterpiece, the long poem Black-Label, has never been thoroughly analyzed. After contrasting Damas's poetic vision to that of his peers, this article explains and illustrates his striking originality and esthetic complexity in using verbal repetitions-notably anaphora, local framing, and pervasive refrains-to depict the collective emotional trauma of the black diaspora, slavery, and racial prejudice. Damas's subtle modulation of anguish and sarcasm explains why Henry Louis Gates's and Anthony Appiah's authoritative Africana encyclopedia credits him with having elaborated the most telling and universal representation of "the rising international black consciousness after World War II." The personal psychodrama of a ceaseless struggle against abjection alternates with a firm refusal to forget or forgive historical injustices, current persecutions by white racists, and the economic exploitation inherent in capitalist globalization.

AB  - Priming stereotypes can lead to a variety of behavioral outcomes, including assimilation, contrast, and response behaviors. However, the conditions that give rise to each of these outcomes are unspecified. Furthermore, theoretical accounts posit that prime-to-behavior effects are either direct (i.e., unmediated) or mediated by cognitive processes, whereas the role of affective processes has been largely unexplored. The present research directly investigated both of these issues. Three experiments demonstrated that priming a threatening social group ("hoodies") influences both affect and behavior in an interpersonal context. Hoodie priming produced both behavioral avoidance and several affective changes (including social apprehension, threat sensitivity, and self-reported anxiety and hostility). Importantly, avoidance following hoodie priming was mediated by anxiety and occurred only under conditions of other-(but not self-) focus. These results highlight multiple routes through which primes influence affect and behavior, and suggest that attention to self or others determine the nature of priming effects.

KW  - LIEUX-DE-MEMOIRE
AB  - This article asks how we can understand processes of regional integration through the lens of memory. Regional integration, despite its taking place in the here and now, rests on acts of cultural recall. Socially shared versions of history, concepts of identity, values and norms, stereotypes, and prejudices as well as certain modes of behavior are usually formed in long historical processes and become part of a "cultural memory." Cultural memory is one of the "soft factors" which are inevitably at work in the negotiation of economical questions, energy and power politics-the "hard factors" of regional integration, as it were. It can affect the way in which processes of regional integration function, or fail to do so. And it often does so in ways that social groups are not even conscious of. The article will present theories of cultural memory put forward by Maurice Halbwachs, Pierre Nora, and Aleida and Jan Assmann as well as recent trends in research on "transcultural memory" and ask about their implications for the study of regional integration.

KW  - PROPOSAL
AB  - Little attention has been paid to the importance of the relationship between therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ) and the role of criminal defense lawyers in insanity and incompetency-to-stand-trial (IST) cases. That inattention is especially noteworthy in light of the dismal track record of counsel providing services to defendants who are part of this cohort of incompetency-status-raisers and insanity-defense-pleaders. On one hand, this lack of attention is a surprise as TJ scholars have, in recent years, turned their attention to virtually every other aspect of the legal system. On the other hand, it is not a surprise, given the omnipresence of sanism, an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character of other irrational prejudices that cause (and are reflected in) prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry, that infects both our jurisprudence and our lawyering practices. Sanism is largely invisible and largely socially acceptable, and is based predominantly upon stereotype, myth, superstition, and deindividualization. It is sustained and perpetuated by our use of alleged "ordinary common sense" (OCS) and heuristic reasoning in an unconscious response to events both in everyday life and in the legal process.
   This paper examines the literature that seeks to apply TJ principles to the criminal law process in general, drawing mostly on the work of Professor David Wexler. It considers why the lack of attention that I have referred to already is surprising (given TJ's mandate and the fact that many TJ issues are inevitably raised in any insanity or IST case). The paper then considers why this lack of attention is not surprising, given the omnipresence of sanism. It will consider some of the actual counseling issues that might arise in these contexts, and offer some suggestions to lawyers representing clients in cases in which mental status issues may be raised. The paper concludes that we must rigorously apply therapeutic jurisprudence principles to these issues, so as to strip away sanist behavior, pretextual reasoning and teleological decision making from the criminal competency and responsibility processes, so as to enable us to confront the pretextual use of social science data in an open and meaningful way. This gambit would also allow us to address-in a more successful way than has ever yet been done-the problems raised by the omnipresence of ineffective counsel in cases involving defendants with mental disabilities.

AB  - Past research has consistently found that aging lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs) are more apt to suffer from loneliness than their heterosexual counterparts. Data from the 2002 Gay Autumn survey (N = 122) were used to find out whether minority stress relates to higher levels of loneliness among older LGB adults in the Netherlands. We examined five minority stress factors: external objective stressful events, expectations of those events, internalized homonegativity, hiding and concealment of one's LGB identity, and ameliorating processes. The results showed that greater insight into loneliness among older LGB adults was obtained when minority stress factors were considered. Older LGB adults who had experienced negative reactions, as well as aging LGBs who expected those reactions, had the highest levels of loneliness. Having an LGB social network buffered against the impact of minority stress. These minority stress processes added to the variance already explained by general factors that influenced levels of loneliness (partner relationships, general social network, physical health, and self-esteem). Interventions aimed at decreasing feelings of loneliness among older LGBs should be focused on decreasing societal homonegativity (to decrease the amount of negative and prejudiced reactions) and on the enhancement of social activities for LGB elderly.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - In the 193 os, sanatorium directors and medical bureaucrats warned of the threat to Canadian society of 'Indian tuberculosis.' Long-standing government policy aimed to isolate Aboriginal people on reserves and in residential schools, while their access to medical care was limited by government parsimony and community prejudice. Characterized as 'racially careless' concerning their own health, Aboriginal bodies were seen as a menace to their neighbours and a danger to the nation. By the 1940s state-run racially segregated Indian hospitals institutionalized Aboriginal people who were not welcome in provincial sanatoria or in the modernizing community hospitals. The opening of the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital in Edmonton in 1946, one of the first acts of the newly created department of National Health and Welfare, was a very public demonstration of the state's commitment to define and promote 'national health' by isolating and institutionalizing Aboriginal people.

AB  - The authors examine the impact of predictors for ingroup favouritism and a positive attitude towards a university merger by conducting a longitudinal field study investigating students' perceptions of a merger Thus, the focus of this paper lies on the developmental and dynamic aspect of social identity processes and the test of directional hypotheses in an applied setting. Based on a cross-lagged regression approach, it was shown that pre-merger identification increased favouritism, but favouritism also increased pre-merger identification. Moreover ingroup favouritism was uni-directionally related to a negative attitude towards the merger Contact with the merger partner revealed lagged effects on ingroup favouritism. These results confirm that issues of identity change and compatibility are crucial aspects in understanding merger adjustment and support. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

KW  - patient information
AB  - Hypertension in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is an interdisciplinary topic, concerning both cardiology and diabetology, which are both internal medicine branches, is a highly topical concept. There are two aspects that seem to play an essential role in the ethical approach of such a patient: diagnosis communication and therapeutic approach. A "highly paternalistic" approach which is extremely controversial and which would violate the patient's right of making his/her own decisions does not meet the requirements of a long-term compliance. Accepting a chronic condition depends on the best balance between the doctor's and the patient's responsibilities, as these two are in a partnership relation. The partnership approach used on patients has left tradition behind and has made room for the increasingly frequent central concept called patient autonomy. Disputes occur when autonomous patients refuse the treatment. The final goal is a successful disease management and self-management. This is possible only when the patient is willing to accept his/her medical background, to understand why it is important for him/her to change his/her lifestyle and to observe the strictest therapy plan, although this is unable to cure him/her, although, despite our efforts as doctors, we do not have a healing solution. Another issue is the social impact the society's attitude towards these patients, who are also "chronic consumers of partially free and fully free prescriptions". Therefore, these people, who actually have a normal social behavior, often end up stigmatized and marginalized. All these dilemmas and controversies, in addition to social prejudice and myth, and to patient stigmatization, clearly prove that patients suffering from such an association of diagnoses are more than a simply medical management challenge. They are actually a real approach challenge.

AB  - Across 6 studies, factors signaling potential vulnerability to harm produced a bias toward outgroup categorization-a tendency to categorize unfamiliar others as members of an outgroup rather than as members of one's ingroup. Studies I through 4 demonstrated that White participants were more likely to categorize targets as Black (as opposed to White) when those targets displayed cues heuristically associated with threat (masculinity, movement toward the perceiver, and facial expressions of anger). In Study 5, White participants who felt chronically vulnerable to interpersonal threats responded to a fear manipulation by categorizing threatening (angry) faces as Black rather than White. Study 6 extended these findings to a minimal group paradigm, in which participants who felt chronically vulnerable to interpersonal threats categorized threatening (masculine) targets as outgroup members. Together, findings indicate that ecologically relevant threat cues within both the target and the perceiver interact to bias the way people initially parse the social world into ingroup vs. outgroup. Findings support a threat-based framework for intergroup psychology.

AB  - Introduction: People with epilepsy are socially discriminated against on the grounds of widespread negative public attitudes, misunderstandings and defensive behaviour. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the public understanding of and attitudes toward epilepsy among the Chinese population in Malaysia.
   Methods: A validated, self-administered questionnaire comprising 23 questions was utilised to evaluate the understanding of and attitudes toward epilepsy among randomly approached respondents from the Chinese population living in the urban areas of Penang, Klang Valley, Kuala Lumpur and Sibu in Malaysia.
   Results: Out of 1,000 people approached, 697 (69.7 percent) respondents agreed to participate in the study. When asked whether people with epilepsy are slow learners and have intellectual functioning below normal, 448 (64.3 percent) respondents answered 'no'. This positive answer was mainly provided by female (35.6 percent) as compared to male (28.6 percent) respondents. Moreover, more than half responded positively to the following statements: people with epilepsy should not be isolated from the normal population; epileptics can perform daily activities; epileptics can receive academic education; and epileptics can become useful members of society. In addition, significant associations were discovered between the education level of the respondents and several statements, including whether epileptics are as intelligent as everyone else (p-value is 0.009), whether epilepsy can be treated with drugs (p-value is 0.037) and whether epileptics can be as successful as other people in their chosen career (p-value is 0.009). Positive responses were mainly acquired from those with secondary education and above. A large number of the respondents felt that people with epilepsy should not be employed as lorry drivers, firefighters, doctors and army personnel.
   Conclusion: The general Chinese population in the urban areas of Malaysia had, at the time of the investigation, a relatively high level of understanding and positive attitudes toward certain aspects of epilepsy, although a minority of the study population demonstrated prejudice and discriminatory behaviours toward people with epilepsy.

KW  - Till Death Us Do Part
AB  - Historians have struggled to unpick the complex relationship between the British working classes and heightened Commonwealth immigration to postwar Britain and have tended to explain the development of racial politics in this period in terms of the agenda of the Conservative Party and broader forces of the political right. Within this historical analysis, Labour's position has been less clear. This article argues that an analysis of Johnny Speight's BBC comedy series Till Death Us Do Part informs historical discussion about changing racial sensibilities within the Labour Party and its working-class constituencies.
   Till Death Us Do Part was one of the most popular and controversial programmes of its generation. The story focused on the working-class Garnett family and specifically on the anti-hero Alf Garnett, played by Warren Mitchell. Speight claimed that he utilized this character to explode popular prejudices and attack the British class system. Whilst the relationship between Speight and his character was somewhat more complicated, this article argues that Till Death Us Do Part does offer critical insight into the political and social dynamics of the British working classes and ultimately can enhance historical understanding of British race relations in this period.

AB  - An essential part of particularism as a systematic option in philosophical ethics is the structure of perception. In this paper, we defend perception as a central feature against the meta-ethical and meta-epistemological prejudices of rationalism. The insurmountable border between perception and justification, which is central to rationalist ethics, rests on three premises that are rejected by particularism: ethical knowledge is not exclusively inferential or discursive, ethical reflection is not solely deductive reasoning, and the bases of justified actions do not have to be universal laws. Against rationalist ethics, we defend perception as a central and primary source of ethical knowledge, as a way of non-discursive reflection and as a genuine form of ethical justification. Ethical experience is not only reason but the complex responsiveness of persons that develops biographically as a result of situations in social and culturally contingent contexts.

AB  - The article relates Walter Benjamin's insights on history and eternal return to modern spaces in colonial and postcolonial Calcutta/Kolkata. Playing on the renaming of the city, the article argues that contemporary social spaces of urban development associated with "Kolkata" return through 18th and 19th century colonial consumption imperatives to dreams once heralded as Calcutta's fabled "City of Palaces." Today's new developments, which claim to bring a "new world" to postcolonial Kolkata, not surprisingly, return historical commodity logics. Spatial multiplicities of contemporary Kolkata/Calcutta reveal, immanent within the claim to the modern, returned social spaces of consumptive repetition, what Benjamin called "the ever-selfsame." As such, they evidence the dream sleep of modernity-"the newest remaining the same in all its parts"-rather than a continuity of temporal succession, "ages ending and the new stepping out from the old." Attending to the urban modern through the contemporary (post) colonial cityscape requires that we recast how we define the modern and the modern city. But, we must address, co-terminously, both the embedded colonizing assumptions which continue to shape the ordinary prejudices of the modern, as importantly, the constitutive contradictions, layered practices, and material paradoxes fundamental to differentiating global modernities.

KW  - SHAME
AB  - The poignant and timeless Broadway musical West Side Story is viewed from the standpoint of taking musical forms as psychoanalytic data. The musical configuration of notes called the tritone (or diabolus in musica) is taken as a sonic metaphor expressing ambiguity both in musical vocabulary and in mental life. The tritone, which historically and harmonically represents instability, is heard throughout the score and emphasizes the intrapsychic, interpersonal, and social dramas that unfold within and between the two gangs in West Side Story. Particular emphasis is given to the comic but exceedingly sober song Gee, Officer Krupke. Bernstein's sensitivity to the ambiguity and tension inherent in the tritone in West Side Story is conceptualized as an intersection of music theory and theories of mind; this perspective holds implications for clinical practice and transports psychoanalytic concepts from the couch to the Broadway stage and into the community to address the complexities of love, hate, aggression, prejudice, and violence. Ultimately, West Side Story cross-pollinates music and theater, as well as music and psychoanalytic concepts.

AB  - Conditions under which implicit and explicit impressions of an individual may change in response to new information were investigated in two experiments. Participants formed an impression of a target person based on his membership in a social group and, in some conditions, detailed behavioral evidence. Later, half of the participants were given reason to believe that the initial information they had been given was wrong, and that the target actually belonged to a different social group. Implicit and explicit measures of participants' impressions of the target were then collected. Results indicated that, while explicit impressions were effectively corrected in light of new information, implicit impressions continued to reflect initial beliefs (Experiments 1 and 2). However, when given the opportunity to re-examine the original behavioral information, implicit measures also reflected a change in participants' impressions (Experiment 2). The role of elaboration in determining implicit and explicit impression change is discussed.

AB  - Representation assumes that those who govern have knowledge of those for whom they govern. It is easy to presume knowledge of the "other", but as we know this can be based in prejudice, cultural difference, or simply misinformation or simplification. Usually our explorations of this process have focused on populations identified as disadvantaged, disempowered or somehow "non-privileged". However, the research process outlined here has revealed previously unexplored diversity within a population commonly described as privileged suggesting that good governance requires alertness to presuming to know both the unprivileged and the privileged. The research approach outlined in this paper has used a blend of historical reappraisal and qualitative techniques focusing on a population who have been conceptualized as doubly privileged. This population focus is that of older British; post World War II male migrants in South Australia. These people have been conceptualized as privileged because they are male, and they were part of the preferred ethnic group that Australian politicians and policy makers favoured post WW2. However, review of the historical data and qualitative interviews with some of these men show that the accepted narrative of a homogenous pre-WW2 British origin population is over simplistic. The historical research suggests that the presumption that post WW2 British migrant men were coming into an homogenous, privileging environment in migrating to SA is both ahistorical and crude. Furthermore the belief that post WW2 British migrant men were ethnically homogenous is undermined by the qualitative research, that reveals that their presumed homogeneity is much more fluid and nuanced than dominant conceptualisations have allowed. The impact of core ethnicities that continue to exist and compete in Britain, the social class focus and economic commodification of migrants in the machinations of powerful players in the state of South Australia all confound homogenizing, simplistic knowing of British migrant men in this state. Generically these findings caution social researchers with regard to presuming to know so called "privileged" populations as well as presumed non-privileged groups.

AB  - This article provides an alternative interpretation for the roles of film in the ideological struggle that tore apart the Weimar Republic. Emphasizing the overlooked contribution of Jewish film-makers and critics to the development of the German 'national film' after World War I, I examine popular comedies that were associated with the 'Jewish milieu' by contemporaneous reviewers. My analysis suggests that 'Jewish' characteristics were frequently envisioned as a positive symbol for the new urban environment. Such an environment was depicted as an exciting, fascinating sphere, in which middle-class liberalism thrives. Noting the social functions of humour, I argue that these popular comedies transformed the Jew from a threatening outsider to the iconic hero of the urban middle-class. Thus, Jewish comedies went beyond the discussion of both (anti-Semitic) stereotypes and the (Jewish) desire to assimilate into the German nation. Their protagonists struggled for social equality, disdained prejudices and segregation and were indifferent to the nationalist sentiment (of both German and Jewish nationalism). The ideological biases of the popular comedies demonstrate the need to re-consider the roles and influences of film in the political discourse of pre-Nazi Germany. It suggests that Weimar film-industry should be studied as a source for a progressive, liberal propaganda, no less than as a manifestation of nationalistic zeal, right-wing conservatism or careless escapism.

AB  - Drawing on observation, autoethnography, and audio-taped interviews, this article explores the religious backgrounds and experiences of Bible Belt gays. In the Bible Belt, Christianity is not confined to Sunday worship. Christian crosses, messages, paraphernalia, music, news, and attitudes permeate everyday settings. Consequently, Christian fundamentalist dogma about homosexuality-that homosexuals are bad, diseased, perverse, sinful, other, and inferior-is cumulatively bolstered within a variety of other social institutions and environments in the Bible Belt. Of he 46 lesbians and gay men interviewed for this study (age 18-74 years), most describe living through spirit-crushing experiences of isolation, abuse, and self-loathing. This article argues that the geographic region of the Bible Belt intersects with religious-based homophobia. Informants explained that negative social attitudes about homosexuality caused a range of harmful consequences in their lives including the fear of going to hell, depression, low self-esteem, and feelings of worthlessness.

AB  - Research has shown that perceived group status positively predicts competence stereotypes but does not positively predict warmth stereotypes. The present study identified circumstances in which group status positively predicts both warmth and competence judgments. Students (N = 86) rated one of two groups (psychologists vs. engineers) presented as either being low or high in social status on warmth and competence. Results showed that status positively predicted competence stereotypes for both groups, but warmth stereotypes only for psychologists, for whom warmth traits are perceived to be functional in goal achievement. Moreover, for psychologists perceived warmth mediated the relationship between status and perceived competence. Results are discussed in terms of the contextual malleability of the relationship between perceived status, warmth, and competence.

AB  - The current paradigm on the nature of viruses is based on early work of the 'phage group' (the pro-phage concept) and molecular biologists working on tumour viruses (the protooncogene concept). It posits that viruses evolved from either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cellular genes that became infectious via their association with capsid genes. In this view, after their emergence viruses continued to evolve by stealing cellular genes (the escape model). This paradigm has been challenged recently by scientists who propose that viruses pre-dated modern cells. In particular, the discovery of Mimivirus has stimulated a lot of discussions on the nature of viruses. There are two major schools of thought, those who defend the escape model, suggesting that giant viruses are giant pickpockets (chimera), and those who emphasize their uniqueness and ancient origin. Comparative genomics of Mimivirus and related viruses (nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses) have produced a lot of data that have been interpreted according to the prejudices of the authors and thus failed until now to generate a consensus. I briefly review here the history of these debates and how they lead to new proposals, such as the definition of viruses as capsid-encoding organisms or else the recognition of their fundamentally cellular nature, the virocell concept.

AB  - My thesis insists oil the theme of evil implicit in Sand's title to her pastoral novel, La Mare an diable (1846). The question of evil as death (le mal metaphysique) stands Out ill her preface, opens her novel, and defines the challenge faced by the hero in social prejudice (le mal social) and in the heroic journey to overcome internalized obstacles such as fear (le mal psychologique) in order to transform his values. The interplay between good and evil culminating in "the devil's pond" intuits Jung's theory of the convergence of good and evil and the necessity of the latter in the maturation process. The victory of the hero, Germain, is also chat of Sand who rises above the ideological partisanship of her opening chapters to bring to life inspirational values open to all.

AB  - At the University of North Florida School of Nursing, students, faculty, and community partners engage in a long-term relationship with a home-base to address community issues and student learning objectives. Community home-bases can be geographic or programmatic, but they serve as the central place where all of the partners come together and participate in mutually beneficial service-learning activities. The Home-base model addresses the unique integration of this partnership in the undergraduate curriculum, distinguished by the continuity of the student's clinical practice in one place throughout their nursing program. Findings from formative evaluation indicated that students "see the big picture," "shed underlying prejudices," "value upstream approaches," and "make a difference." This article describes the development and structure of the Home-base model, identifies preliminary outcomes, and discusses implications for nursing education.

AB  - This article discusses the development of internet forums in the social and historical context in China with regard to its political impact. Online forums emerged in the mid 1990s in China as a promising social space for liberal-minded discussion led to a transformation in the popular ethos of people going online. However, in contrast to the prevailing optimistic estimation that the internet has brought the hope of democracy into China, the research shows that the power of state remains the strongest force in shaping the public ethos. Since online public discussion space is intersubjective and based upon online connectivity, changes in individuals' minds can affect the public ethos to such an extent that a pattern of development can be identified. Private citizens showed the capacity to form, with resilience, democratic practices and discourses alongside content that is trivial and in a less critical spirit. However, the web has now degenerated into a venue of mass entertainment since the year 2003, as the state successfully sabotaged the development of the electronic public sphere, by repeatedly suspending, dividing and harassing online public venues, so that the folk discourse can no longer sustain deliberative discussions on public matters, instead focusing on unreflective nationalism and popular prejudices. The future for an open public speaking corner is still bleak.

But as studies of implicit prejudice and intuitive fears illustrate, unchecked gut feelings can also lead us astray. Intuition's powers and perils appear in various realms, from sports to business to clinical and interviewer judgments.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant concern for some lesbian households with children. Yet we know of only one study that has examined lesbian mothers' experiences with IPV. In the current study we analyzed the counseling experiences of participants in our prior study. Interviews with 24 lesbian mothers (12 Black, 9 White, and 3 Latina) 23 to 54 years of age (M = 39.5) were coded using thematic analysis. Overall, lesbian mothers experiencing IPV did seek help from counselors (n = 15, 63%), typically after reaching a breaking point. Counselors were most helpful when addressing the abuse and promoting self-empowerment, and least helpful when victim-blaming or ignoring the abuse and/or the same-sex relationship. Lesbian mothers' perceptions that mental health professionals were sometimes ineffective have implications for provider training. In order to work effectively with this population, providers should attempt to eliminate or correct personal biases or prejudices with self-exploration and education. By becoming more aware and knowledgeable of the nuances, struggles, and strengths of the lesbian community, providers can gain competency in providing therapeutic services to such clients. Mental health professionals can also adopt an advocacy stance to assist in spreading cultural awareness to others and support policy or institutional changes to include same-sex IPV. Competencies can be assessed through future studies that identify the knowledge and skills gap among mental health professionals who frequently work with the lesbian population.

AB  - The present research demonstrated that cognitive complexity is related to the perception of contemporary, subtle racism. Results indicated that the perception of subtle racism was related to attributional complexity. Further, greater attributional complexity was also related to greater racial complexity, defined as the ability of individuals to overcome the normative assumption that racism is no longer a major social problem in the United States and the extent that individuals think about racism. The relationship between attributional complexity and racial complexity held even when accounting for need for cognition, perspective taking, empathy, and political ideology. Finally, we found that racial complexity mediated the effect of attributional complexity on the perception of subtle racism. Taken together, the results of these three studies contribute a general cognitive mechanism related to the perception of subtle racism; an extension of cognitive and attributional complexity; and a new construct, racial complexity, related to the perception of contemporary, subtle racism.

AB  - This article highlights the role of sexual orientation in the social transmutation of space, thereby illustrating how certain landscapes, generally characterised by heteronormativity, are queered by cultural phenomena such as the Pink Loerie Mardi Gras (PLMG) in Knysna. It is, however, not the intent of this article to describe the processes of producing queer space in a 'celebratory' tone only, but also to investigate the manner in which hierarchies of race, class, gender and especially sexual orientation are sometimes re-asserted in relation to such spatial practices. The power-laden binaries initially disrupted by the queering of space can, in fact, revert when the PLMG is employed as a mechanism that attempts to control, discipline or even normalise queer bodies. It seems that capitalist role-players (such as corporate sponsors and other stakeholders in the tourism industry) seek to manage the PLMG in terms of 'how much' space it occupies and who is represented (and therefore included or excluded from this space). This leads one to critique the supposed 'Otherness' of the PLMG, because if it is influenced by prejudiced ideologies of consumerism and cosmopolitanism that ultimately operate in favour of heteronormativity and what it considers to be 'different enough', then to what extent can the festival legitimately or freely call itself 'queer'?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many patients with a chronic disease are dissatisfied with the information they are given. A brief questionnaire completed by patients would assist health professionals to identify areas of information needed to be provided, tailored to the patient's mental condition. AIM: The aim of our study was to assess how often thyroid patients report being adequately informed about iodine treatment in connection with their real need thereof, emotional state and acceptance of the disease. METHODS: One hundred outpatients who had presented subclinical hyperthyroidism "[19 men (19%), 81 women (81%); mean (SD+/-) age 53+/-14,range 18-77 yr] treated with radioiodine (RAT) responded to an Experimental Questionnaire, 54 of them answered to AIS, HADS-M and Beck Inventory measuring their acceptance of the illness and depressive symptoms, 37 of them answered the Patient Request Form (PRF). RESULTS: The obtained results indicated that about 50% of patients treated with 131I therapy did not receive suitable information about their treatment. Neither written information prepared by the specialist, nor verbal information given by physicians were adequate for specific problems of study group. The examined patients presented with a comparable intensity of three distinct types of requests: for explanation and reassurance, for emotional support, and for investigation and treatment. The acceptance of their disease was mediocre for most of the study group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the reported lack of satisfaction with medical information in study group was associated with depressive symptoms influencing cognitive efficiency, patients' great need of emotional and cognitive support, influencing the acceptance of their disease, and social prejudice to radioiodine (as a method of treatment), worrying them additionally. All thyroid patients even these with subclinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism should be treated with specific attention by physicians, especially during information process.

AB  - This article employs transformative learning and decolonial theories to investigate the efficacy of simulation pedagogy for undergraduate student learning about refugees and the internally displaced. The simulation of refugee experience was adapted from the Doctors Without Borders' Forced From Home exhibit and facilitated by an experienced affiliate for eighty-nine education and economics undergraduate students. Data include surveys, debriefing discussions, and written reflections. We ask: Does simulation pedagogy support transformative learning toward the decolonial goals of recognizing and deconstructing current power relations? How or how not? Overall, we find that simulation pedagogy successfully supports initial stages of transformative learning through engaging a combination of kinesthetic (body), affective (heart), and cognitive (mind) realms to shift students' perspectives and knowledge. Through a decolonial lens, we chronicle the strengths and limitations of transformative learning processes and find that the simulation pedagogy achieved a combination of colonial and decolonial purposes.

AB  - We apply the dynamic dual pathway model of approach coping to understanding the predictors of future collective action among a sample of advantaged group allies and disadvantaged group members who were attending a protest. We propose that problem-focused approach coping (i.e., group efficacy beliefs) would be a stronger predictor of future collective action among disadvantaged compared to advantaged group members, and emotion-focused approach coping (i.e., group-based anger) would be a stronger predictor of future collective action among advantaged compared to disadvantaged group members. Data was collected from LGBTIQ+ and heterosexual people (N = 189) protesting as part of the 2019 Christopher Street Day Parade in Cologne, Germany. We found that increased group efficacy predicted intentions to engage in future collective action for the rights of sexual minorities among LGBTIQ+ but not heterosexual participants. Increased group-based anger was a predictor of future collective action intentions regardless of which group the participants belonged to. Our findings extend the dynamic dual pathway model by applying it to a sample of advantaged group allies and disadvantaged group members attending a protest using a multiple perspectives approach.

AB  - This experimental study examined the effects of biological attributions on individuals' beliefs and attitudes toward transgender people and the moderating role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). We randomly assigned 183 Chinese university students (men: n = 85, women: n = 98) to read one of three fictitious articles. The first article suggested that transgender identity was causally linked to biology (biological determinist condition), the second one highlighted the interplay between biological and environmental factors (epigenetic condition), whereas the third article did not mention the origins of transgender identity (control condition). Consistent with the biased assimilation hypothesis, the effects of biological attributions depended on individual differences in RWA. Low-RWA participants showed higher levels of naturalness and discreteness/homogeneity beliefs about transgender identity in the biological determinist condition than those in the control condition. By contrast, high-RWA participants displayed higher levels of discreteness/homogeneity beliefs but similar levels of naturalness beliefs when they read the biological determinist message compared with the control group. Low-RWA participants showed higher levels of naturalness but similar levels of discreteness/homogeneity beliefs in the epigenetic condition compared with the control, whereas high-RWA participants exhibited lower levels of naturalness and higher levels of discreteness/homogeneity beliefs when they read the epigenetic message compared with the control group. This study also suggests that, contrary to attribution theory, presenting information regarding the biological basis of transgender identity does not necessarily lead to more positive attitudes because (a) it triggers essentialist thinking and (b) the effects of biological attributions depend on recipients' authoritarian dispositions.

AB  - The past generation has seen a dramatic rise in multiracial populations and a consequent increase in exposure to individuals who challenge monolithic racial categories. We examine and compare two potential outcomes of the multiracial population growth that may impact people's racial categorization experience: (a) exposure to racially ambiguous faces that visually challenge the existing categories, and (b) a category that conceptually challenges existing categories (including "biracial" as an option in addition to the monolithic "Black" and "White" categories). Across four studies (N = 1,810), we found that multiple exposures to faces that are racially ambiguous directly lower essentialist views of race. Moreover, we found that when people consider a category that blurs the line between racial categories (i.e., "biracial"), they become less certain in their racial categorization, which is associated with less race essentialism, as well. Importantly, we found that these two effects happen independently from one another and represent two distinct cognitive processes.

AB  - How should toymakers represent a diverse society? Surprisingly, given the force of recent debates over race and nation and over migration, multiculturalism, and the postcolonial condition of Europe and North America, there is relatively little scholarship on how the toy industry engages with these particular themes. This article seeks to remedy this by taking a single toy company, Playmobil, as a case study for exploring the politics of racial and ethnic difference in its toys and marketing materials. It argues that the company, in an effort to diversify its products without alienating wary customers, has incorporated difference through specific strategies that elide and thereby reinforce an implicitly white, majoritarian norm, following a pattern of "banal multiculturalism" (Thomas 2011). By exploring these strategies in detail and by tying them to longstanding historical patterns, this study will suggest how companies can more critically challenge their own exclusionary practices of representation.

AB  - Statistical discrimination is usually flagged by economists as a potential source of treatment disparities. The literature, however, lacks reduced-form tests that provide information about the relative importance of statistical discrimination in explaining aggregate patterns. This article explores whether combining three different diagnostics of aggregate discrimination - those being, unconditional treatment disparities, benchmark tests, and outcome tests - can provide insights into sources of statistical discrimination. We discuss the difficulties concomitant with this exercise and argue, using an identification result that relies on restrictive (and presumably implausible) assumptions, that the answer is most likely negative.

AB  - Developing work on the nature and consequences of negative intergroup contact, this study explores its potential role in sustaining everyday experiences of dehumanization; that is, experiences in which participants report feeling deprived of full human status. As a case study, we explore domestic service relations in a neighbourhood of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, analysing interviews (n = 22) conducted with Black domestic workers and their families (n = 64 participants in total) about their day-to-day interactions with Indian employers. Drawing on thematic analysis of accounts of paid domestic labour and food-sharing practices, we argue that negative contact experiences may cumulatively engender a sense of dehumanization and associated feelings of humiliation: a response marked by intertwined constructions of shame and injustice. Implications for understanding wider problems of intergroup conflict and political solidarity are discussed and avenues for future research proposed.

AB  - Proceeding globalization and the increase in global mobility entail that a growing proportion of people in economically developed countries have a migration background, so that cultural diversity has become an integral characteristic of many societies. Consequently, national identifications and attitudes towards immigrants are gaining importance in both international and intra-societal contexts. Previous studies revealed that in some countries, including Germany, national identification is associated with negative attitudes towards outgroups. In the present article, the interplay between national identification and intergroup contact is analyzed, with xenophobia as the criterion. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey amongst members of the majority population in Germany. It was predicted and found that the association between national identification and xenophobia is moderated by intergroup contact. There was only an association between national identification and xenophobia in participants with below-average or average levels of contact, whilst for those with above-average levels of contact, there was no significant association. Thus, the results point to the importance of contact experiences as a path to neutralize the effects of national identification on xenophobia, possibly by assisting in a redefinition of national belonging.

AB  - Men can play an important role in supporting gender equality. In the present research, we draw on Intergroup Contact Theory to examine positive intergroup contact with feminist women as one factor that can encourage men to support gender equality. In one cross-sectional study (N = 170) and one half-longitudinal panel study (N = 240), we found that straight men who reported more positive contact with feminist women also reported greater feminist solidarity. Cross-sectional results indicated that straight men's solidarity with feminists, in turn, predicted more support for gender equality in public and domestic spheres and greater awareness of their gender privilege. The longitudinal results also supported the association between solidarity with feminists and gender privilege awareness, but not public and domestic support for gender equality. Decades of research has shown that positive intergroup contact can change attitudes. Our research suggests that, when it comes to gender equality, positive contact with feminist women may also encourage men to identify with feminists and raise their gender consciousness.

AB  - Interest in unintended discrimination that can result from implicit attitudes and stereotypes (implicit biases) has stimulated many research investigations. Much of this research has used the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure association strengths that are presumed to underlie implicit biases. It had been more than a decade since the last published treatment of recommended best practices for research using IAT measures. After an initial draft by the first author, and continuing through three subsequent drafts, the 22 authors and 14 commenters contributed extensively to refining the selection and description of recommendation-worthy research practices. Individual judgments of agreement or disagreement were provided by 29 of the 36 authors and commenters. Of the 21 recommended practices for conducting research with IAT measures presented in this article, all but two were endorsed by 90% or more of those who felt knowledgeable enough to express agreement or disagreement; only 4% of the totality of judgments expressed disagreement. For two practices that were retained despite more than two judgments of disagreement (four for one, five for the other), the bases for those disagreements are described in presenting the recommendations. The article additionally provides recommendations for how to report procedures of IAT measures in empirical articles.

AB  - How do routine police encounters build or undermine community trust, and how might they contribute to racial gaps in citizen perceptions of the police? Procedural justice theory posits that officers' interpersonal communication toward the public plays a formative role, but experimental tests of this hypothesis have been constrained by the difficulties of measuring and manipulating this dimension of officer-citizen interactions. Officer-worn body camera recordings provide a novel means to overcome both of these challenges. Across five studies with laboratory and community samples, we use footage from traffic stops to examine how officers communicate to drivers and whether racial disparities in officers' communication erode institutional trust in the police. Specifically, we consider the cumulative effects of one subtle interpersonal cue: an officer's tone of voice. In Studies 1A, 1B, and 1C, participants rated thin slices of officer speech. Participants were blind to the content of the officer's words and the race of their interlocutor, yet they evaluated officers' tone toward White (vs. Black) men more positively. By manipulating participants' exposure to repeated interactions, we demonstrate that even these paraverbal aspects of police interactions shape how citizens construe the police generally (Study 2), and that racial disparities in prosodic cues undermine trust in institutions such as police departments (Study 3). Participants' trust in the police, and personal experiences of fairness, in turn, correlated with their perceptions of officer prosody across studies. Taken together, these data illustrate a cycle through which interpersonal aspects of police encounters erode institutional trust across race.

AB  - Iexamine why Confederate monuments were built in public spaces in counties throughout the US South with particular attention to connections to race. I use event history analysis to examine the overall likelihood of erecting the first monument in a county while accounting for dimensions of time. The data include a comprehensive accounting of public Confederate monuments, covariates spanning 150 years, and several unique historical variables. This is the first study to assess competing explanations for the construction of Confederate monuments in a generalizable analysis. Results provide support for understanding Confederate monuments as part of a larger "memory movement." Moreover, this movement was strongly related to the relationship between race and power within a county. However, my analyses offer limited support for viewing Confederate monuments as part of a countermovement in response to local racial tensions. Incorporating the nuances of how race relates to Confederate monuments will be valuable to future research as scholars develop an understanding of their links to contemporary society.

AB  - Tracing the boundaries of freedom of expression is a matter of wide societal and academic import-especially, as these boundaries encroach on the politics of inclusion. Yet, the elements that constitute offensive speech and determine its legal status remain poorly defined. In two studies, we examined how lay judges evaluate the offensiveness of apparently descriptive statements. Replicating prior work, we found that non-linguistic features (including speaker intent and outcomes on the audience) modulated the statements' meaning. The speaker's identity-and, in particular, their membership in the target group-independently influenced evaluations of offensive speech among conservatives and progressives alike. When asked to disclose their abstract principles, or jointly evaluate two contrastive cases, participants tended to deny the relevance of identity while primarily endorsing the intent principle. Taken together, our findings confirm that assessments of offensive speech are governed by contextual features, some of which are not introspectively deemed relevant.

AB  - A critical lever in the fight against poverty is to improve attitudes toward those living in poverty. Attempting to understand the factors that impact these attitudes, we ask: Does believing that meritocracy exists (descriptive meritocracy) sustain negative attitudes? Using cross-sectional (N = 301) and experimental (N = 439) methods, we found that belief in the United States as a meritocracy is associated with blaming people living in poverty and predicts negative attitudes toward them. Replicating and extending these findings, we experimentally manipulated beliefs in meritocracy and blame. Weakening American Dream beliefs predicted improved attitudes toward those in poverty. Understanding the nuanced role of belief systems in attitudes toward those in poverty provides strategies for promoting more positive thoughts and feelings.

AB  - Intergroup biases shape most aspects of person construal, including lower-level visual representations of group members' faces. Specifically, ingroup members' faces tend to be represented more positively than outgroup members' faces. Here, we used a reverse-correlation paradigm to test whether engaging in perspective taking (i. e., actively imagining another person's mental states) can reduce these biased visual representations. In an initial image-generation experiment, participants were randomly assigned to a minimal group and then composed a narrative essay about an ingroup or an outgroup target person, either while adopting the person's perspective or while following control instructions. Afterward, they generated an image of the person's face in a reversecorrelation image-classification task. Subsequent image-assessment experiments using an explicit rating task, a sequential priming task, and an economic trust game with separate samples of participants revealed that ingroup faces elicited more likability and trustworthiness than did outgroup faces. Importantly, this pattern of intergroup bias was consistently weaker in faces created by perspective takers. Additional image-assessment experiments identified the mouth (i.e., smiling cues) as a critical facial region wherein the interactive effects of group membership and perspective taking emerged. These findings provide initial evidence that perspective taking may be an effective strategy for attenuating, though not for eliminating, intergroup biases in visual representations of what group members look like.

AB  - Liberal nationalists argue that identification with the nation promotes feelings of mutual obligation, including support for redistribution. Existing attempts to test this hypothesis have focused on whether the higher sense of national identity among the majority increases support redistribution. We argue for a twofold shift in focus. First, beyond the majority's own national identity, we need to explore their perceptions of whether minorities share this identity. Second, we need to shift from one-dimensional ideals of 'identity' to more complex ideas of attachment and commitment. Do members of the majority view minorities as committed to the nation and willing to make sacrifices for it? Drawing on a custom-designed online survey in Canada, we show that three salient out-groups (Aboriginal peoples, French-speaking Canadians and immigrants) are seen by majority respondents as less committed to Canada, and that this is a powerful predictor of support for general and inclusive redistribution.

AB  - A growing number of businesses are focusing on diversity and inclusion efforts. Amidst this recent interest, scholars have sought to understand the ideologies that perpetuate inequality, concentrating primarily on the hierarchy-enhancing ideologies that antiegalitarians leverage to maintain inequality. However, we suggest that the hierarchy-enhancing beliefs typically associated with antiegalitarians (e.g., stereotypes, meritocracy) sometimes appeal to people at the opposite end of the ideological pole: egalitarians. Across four preregistered studies, we demonstrate that when hierarchy-enhancing myths may support practices aimed at promoting organizational diversity, egalitarians increasingly endorse these myths that they typically reject. When essentialism (Study 1), the Protestant work ethic (Study 2), and gender stereotypes (Study 4) supported organizational diversity, egalitarians increasingly endorsed these beliefs. They also exhibited scientific skepticism when findings jeopardized affirmative action efforts (Study 3). These findings illustrate that, ironically, pro-diversity goals can encourage egalitarians to mobilize and endorse beliefs that are typically associated with antiegalitarians and the justification of inequality.

We used an online sample of U.S. adults (Mean age = 38.91 years, SD = 12.58 years; n = 400) to conduct a partially latent variable SEM analysis and tested the direct effects of religious fundamentalism, contact, and gender on transphobia and the indirect effects of religious fundamentalism on transphobia through contact. We additionally tested for gender differences in the structural relations of the variables through a multi-group analysis. Results showed a statistically significant effect of religious fundamentalism, contact, and gender on transphobia. Religious fundamentalism also had a statistically significant indirect effect on transphobia through contact. Gender differences were also found for the effects of religious fundamentalism on contact and on transphobia. We conclude with implications for research and practice.

AB  - Background Racism has been linked with poor health in studies in the United States. Little is known about prospective associations between racial discrimination and health outcomes in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods Data were from 4883 ethnic minority (i.e. non-white) participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Perceived discrimination in the last 12 months on the basis of ethnicity or nationality was reported in 2009/10. Psychological distress, mental functioning, life satisfaction, self-rated health, physical functioning and reports of limiting longstanding illness were assessed in 2009/10 and 2011/12. Linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, income, education and ethnicity. Prospective analyses also adjusted for baseline status on the outcome being evaluated. Results Racial discrimination was reported by 998 (20.4%) of the sample. Cross-sectionally, those who reported racial discrimination had a greater likelihood on average of limiting longstanding illness (odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49; 2.13) and fair/poor self-rated health (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.24; 1.82) than those who did not report racial discrimination. Racial discrimination was associated with greater psychological distress (B = 1.11, 95% CI 0.88; 1.34), poorer mental functioning (B = - 3.61; 95% CI -4.29; - 2.93), poorer physical functioning (B = - 0.86; 95% CI -1.50; - 0.27), and lower life satisfaction (B = - 0.40, 95% CI -0.52; - 0.27). Prospectively, those who reported racial discrimination had a greater likelihood on average of limiting longstanding illness (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.01; 1.69) and fair/poor self-rated health (OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.00; 1.69), than those who did not report racial discrimination. Racial discrimination was associated increased psychological distress (B = 0.52, 95% CI 0.20; 0.85) and poorer mental functioning (B = - 1.77; 95% CI -2.70; - 0.83) over two-year follow-up, adjusting for baseline scores. Conclusions UK adults belonging to ethnic minority groups who perceive racial discrimination experience poorer mental and physical health than those who do not. These results highlight the need for effective interventions to combat racial discrimination in order to reduce inequalities in health.

AB  - In 16 independent samples from five countries involving similar to 7,700 participants, we employ a mixture of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and quasi-experimental methods to examine the effect of intergroup contact on (a) the blatant dehumanization of outgroups, and (b) the perception that outgroup members dehumanize the ingroup (meta-dehumanization). First, we conduct a meta-analysis across 12 survey samples collected from five countries regarding eight different target groups (totalN= 5,388) and find a consistent effect of contact quality on dehumanization and meta-dehumanization. Second, we use a large longitudinal sample of American participants (N= 1,103) to show that quality of contact with Muslims at Time 1 predicts dehumanization of Muslims and meta-dehumanization 6 months later. Finally, we show that sustained semester-long "virtual contact" between American and Muslim college students is associated with reduced American students' (N= 487) dehumanization of, and perceived dehumanization by, Muslims.

AB  - The attitudes, both implicit and explicit, that people hold toward sexual minorities and those who identify as gay or lesbian remain understudied, especially in Asia. In the present study, we examine the implicit and explicit attitudes people in Taiwan have regarding same-sex attraction. Participants (N = 1,696; 1,025 women; M-age: 24.36 years, SD = 5.40 years) completed implicit and explicit measures through the Project Implicit Taiwan website. Analyses revealed that participants, especially those who identified as gay or lesbian, demonstrated positive implicit attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women. Participants' reported attitudes toward heterosexual as well as gay and lesbian individuals were related to their own gender and sexuality. In particular, participants showed the strongest preference for members of their target sexuality category (e.g., heterosexual men toward heterosexual women). Women were more positive than men toward gay and lesbian individuals. Participants were supportive of same-sex marriage, although this support was stronger among women and gay men; participants' explicit and implicit attitudes also impacted the degree to which they supported same-sex marriage. Our findings represent an initial investigation into the current attitudes people hold toward same-sex attraction and related societal issues, in Taiwan and potentially in the broader Asia region.

AB  - Philosophers have long speculated that authoritarianism and belief in determinism are functionally related. To evaluate this hypothesis, we assessed whether authoritarianism and allied personality and political variables predict varieties of belief in determinism in three community samples (N-1 = 566 to 20,010; N-2 = 500; N-3 = 419). Authoritarianism and allied variables manifested moderate to large positive correlations with both fatalistic and genetic determinism beliefs. Controlling for political conservatism did not meaningfully attenuate these relations. Further, openness was negatively related to fatalistic determinism beliefs and agreeableness was negatively related to genetic determinism beliefs. Taken together, our findings clarify the nature of relations between authoritarianism and general personality, on the one hand, and free will/determinism beliefs, on the other, and suggest intriguing intersections between worldviews and personality traits.

AB  - By 2050, the elderly population is expected to represent more than one third of the Portuguese population. Previous research demonstrated a significant increase of the LGB population in this age group, and that the needs of these individuals are not being addressed. Elderly LGB people, as both a sexual minority and an older age cohort, are particularly vulnerable to double stigma. The aim of this study was to evaluate how minority status of gay/bisexual men and its association with other psychosocial variables may affect sexual and relationship satisfaction. The sample was recruited online and composed of 110 gay/bisexual men aged 60 years or older (M = 63.5; SD = 3.41). Regression analyses showed that both the concealment of sexual identity in recent years and self-stigma significantly affected sexual and relationship satisfaction. In contrast, age-related discrimination was not associated with sexual satisfaction or relationship satisfaction. Gay and bisexual elderly men in this study tended to maintain their sexual identity hidden from others, possibly due to a lack of openness of the Portuguese society to accept homoaffective behavior. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Collective action researchers have recently started investigating solidarity-based collective action by advantaged groups. This literature, however, has overlooked intergroup meta-beliefs (MBs, i.e., beliefs about the outgroup's beliefs), which we argue are crucial, since solidarity inherently involves protesting for the outgroup. In the context of racial inequality in the U.S., we focused on three MBs White Americans could hold: responsibility, inactivity, and allyship. In two studies (N-total = 648), we found that inactive and responsible MBs predicted higher collective action tendencies among low White identifiers via guilt and obligation to act. Conversely, we found that both predicted lower collective action tendencies among high White identifiers, via perceived unfairness. Finally, we found that ally MB was positively associated with collective action tendencies, regardless of identification. We highlight the importance of the meta-perspective in understanding solidarity-based collective action, and discuss conceptual and practical implications of these findings.

AB  - Heteronormativity is a culturally embedded system defining acceptable identities and behaviors in romantic relationships. Recent literature has suggested that heteronormativity is strongly associated with political attitudes, personality characteristics such as tolerance of ambiguity, and key demographic variables such as gender and sexual orientation. However, interactions between gender and other factors have not been thoroughly explored as predictors of heteronormative attitude and beliefs. The current study (N = 306) expands the understanding of predictors of heteronormativity, particularly as they interact with gender. In the current study, higher education was associated with lower heteronormativity among women, but not among men, and expressiveness was associated with lower heteronormativity among men, but not among women. Finally, a 3-way interaction showed that the relationship between education and heteronormativity for men (but not women) depended on trait expressiveness. Future studies are recommended, including observation of changes in heteronormativity over time and exploration of mechanisms that reinforce or reduce heteronormativity.

AB  - The present study reflects an exploration of student race and attitudes toward the legal system as predictors of teachers' and administrators' support for police-to-student physical intervention. We experimentally manipulated student race (Black vs. White) in a hypothetical scenario depicting physical police intervention stemming from a student's misbehavior. Teachers and administrators were significantly more punitive (i.e., requested juvenile detention and expulsion) toward the Black student than the White student. Moreover, endorsement of police legitimacy and legal authoritarianism (LA) predicted increased punitive attitudes toward the student, the belief that the student is dangerous, perceived likelihood that the student would recidivate, and perceived appropriateness of police officer behavior. Finally, the relationships between police legitimacy, LA, and perceived police behavior appropriateness were stronger when the student was portrayed as Black than White.

AB  - The paper explores differences in attitudes towards immigration both between and within countries. We draw on new questions, included in the ESS for the first time in 2014, about willingness to accept culturally distinct groups of migrants such as Muslims. These new measures yield additional insights about the nature of symbolic boundaries since they directly tap one of the most salient boundaries in contemporary migration discourse. The paper makes use of Multilevel Latent Class Analysis, a method enabling one to disentangle group-level from individual-level differences. The findings distinguish three classes of individual attitudes, labelled 'restrictive', 'selective' and 'open'. The proportions of individuals belonging to these classes varies across European countries, which fit into three more or less distinct sets (labelled the Czech model, the Norway model and the Ireland model). These three sets display differing levels of internal homogeneity, with the Czech model being the most homogeneous and the Norway model the most heterogeneous. This pattern is also reflected in the degree of socio-economic polarisation. In effect, the nature of the symbolic boundaries are more contested within the Ireland and Norway models, different groups having very different ideas of where the boundaries lie and how rigid they should be.

AB  - This paper examines the content and degree of uniformity of meta-stereotypes among women living homeless in Madrid, Spain, and the differences with their male counterparts. The study was conducted utilizing a structured interview with a representative sample of men living homeless (n = 158) and a convenience sample of a similar size (n = 138) of women living homeless. The results show that the meta-stereotypes of women living homeless in Madrid are characterized by mainly negative (e.g., consumers of alcohol, drug users, lazy, criminals) or indulgent (e.g., physically and psychologically worn out, rejected by society, sick) contents, with very limited positive (e.g., courteous, respectful, polite) contents, and a high degree of uniformity. There are no major differences in the content of meta-stereotypes of the female interviewees in terms of their age, academic background, motherhood, or nationality. Compared to men in the same situation, a larger percentage of women living homeless agree with negative and indulgent meta-stereotypes, and a smaller percentage agree with positive meta-stereotypes.

AB  - There is increasing scientific and public support for the notion that some foods may be addictive, and that poor weight control and obesity may, for some people, stem from having a food addiction. However, it remains unclear how a food addiction model (FAM) explanation for obesity and weight control will affect weight stigma. In two experiments (N = 530 and N = 690), we tested the effect of a food addiction explanation for obesity and weight control on weight stigma. In Experiment 1, participants who received a FAM explanation for weight control and obesity reported lower weight stigma scores (e.g., less dislike of 'fat people', and lower personal willpower blame) than those receiving an explanation emphasizing diet and exercise (F-(4,F-525) = 7.675, p = 0.006; and F-(4,F-525) = 5.393, p = 0.021, respectively). In Experiment 2, there was a significant group difference for the dislike of 'fat people' stigma measure (F-(5,F-684) = 5.157, p = 0.006), but not for personal willpower weight stigma (F-(5,F-684) = 0.217, p = 0.81). Participants receiving the diet and exercise explanation had greater dislike of `fat people' than those in the FAM explanation and control group (p values < 0.05), with no difference between the FAM and control groups (p > 0.05). The FAM explanation for weight control and obesity did not increase weight stigma and resulted in lower stigma than the diet and exercise explanation that attributes obesity to personal control. The results highlight the importance of health messaging about the causes of obesity and the need for communications that do not exacerbate weight stigma.

AB  - Trustworthiness and dominance impressions summarize trait judgments from faces. Judgments on these key traits are negatively correlated to each other in impressions of female faces, implying less differentiated impressions of female faces. Here we test whether this is true across many trait judgments and whether less differentiated impressions of female faces originate in different facial information used for male and female impressions or different evaluation of the same information. Using multidimensional rating datasets and data-driven modeling, we show that (a) impressions of women are less differentiated and more valence-laden than impressions of men and find that (b) these impressions are based on similar visual information across face genders. Female face impressions were more highly intercorrelated and were better explained by valence (Study 1). These intercorrelations were higher when raters more strongly endorsed gender stereotypes. Despite the gender difference, male and female impression models- derived from separate trustworthiness and dominance ratings of male and female faces-were similar to each other (Study 2). Further, both male and female models could manipulate impressions of faces of both genders (Study 3). The results highlight the high-level, evaluative effect of face gender in impression formation-women are judged negatively to the extent their looks do not conform to expectations, not because people use different facial information across genders but because people evaluate the information differently across genders.

Using thematic analysis, it extracts the dominant themes and messages towards Muslim, Arab and Palestinian 'others'. The study follows 123 textbooks recommended by the Israeli Ministry of Education for grades 7 through 12 of the Jewish state and state-religious sectors for the 2000-2019 academic years. The academic subjects or disciplines represented in the study include history, geography, civics, (Jewish) religious studies and Hebrew language and literature studies. Study findings indicate that current Israeli textbooks to not contain any overt racism or incitement against Palestinians. However, ethnocentric perceptions and victim mentality are two themes that still dominate curricular discourse and are counterproductive to peace education goals. Additionally, the paucity of Palestinian narratives is another potential hurdle to achieving peace education goals.

AB  - Information systems (IS) research has primarily focused on explicit perceptions, attitudes, and intentions of which users are largely aware. We argue that this view may be too narrow. We extend it by presenting the concept of implicit attitude, which is as a stable subconscious evaluation of an IS that is developed a priori, stored in memory, and triggered with limited or no awareness and intentional effort when users are exposed to system-related stimuli. We further discuss the theoretical aspects of implicit attitude toward IS and document a set of guidelines regarding a technique for implicit attitude measurement: the implicit association test (IAT). We further present an overview of the FreeIAT software package and offer a practical example and configuration of the IAT, which includes its administration and scoring. Overall, this tutorial builds methodological foundations for future inquiries into the role of implicit processes in IS research.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine cross-sectional and prospective associations between perceived sex discrimination and health and well-being in a sample from the United Kingdom. Method: Data were from 2,956 women aged >= 16 years who participated in the U.K. Household Longitudinal Study. Perceived discrimination was reported in 2009-2010. Psychological distress, mental functioning, life satisfaction, and self-rated health were assessed in 2009-2010 and 2013-2014. Depression was assessed in 2009 and 2010. Linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, income, education, and ethnicity. Prospective analyses adjusted for baseline well-being. Results: Perceived sex discrimination was reported by 576 (19.5%) participants. Younger, wealthier, better educated, White women reported more discrimination (p < .001). Cross-sectionally, perceived discrimination was associated with increased depression (odds ratio [OR] = 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI; 2.10, 4.79]) psychological distress (B = 1.26, 95% CI [0.95, 1.56]), poorer mental functioning (B = -5.39, 95% CI [-6.33, -4.46]), lower life satisfaction (B =-0.52, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.36]), and greater odds of poor self-rated health (OR = 1.89, 95% CI [1.47, 2.41]). Prospectively, perceived sex discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress (B = 0.66, 95% CI [0.07, 1.24]), poorer mental functioning (B = -1.37, 95% CI [-2.71, -0.03]), and lower life satisfaction (B = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.58, -0.05]) over 4-year follow-up. Conclusions: Women who perceive that they have been discriminated against based on their sex report poorer mental health and well-being than those who do not perceive discrimination. These results provide cross-sectional and prospective evidence of associations between perceived sex discrimination and mental well-being outcomes in U.K. women.

AB  - This article adds to our understanding of the gendered impact of informal rules and norms for party leaders. Specifically, it examines the gendered nature of party leader tenures and exits. Using original data collected on party leader experiences in Canada, we test for the existence of gender differences in leader tenures and exits, and examine two potential explanations for any differences. We find that leader tenures and exits are indeed gendered but only within parties with the potential to form government, ones where the political stakes are highest. Within these major parties, women's tenures as party leaders are significantly shorter than men's and they are significantly more likely to be forced to resign from the position. We find clear evidence of the existence of the glass cliff phenomenon in major parties but unclear evidence of its role in women's shorter tenures. Instead, women's shorter tenures are explained by the harsher set of standards being applied to women party leaders.

AB  - Generally, White (vs. Black) and high-status (vs. low-status) individuals are rated positively. However, implicit evaluations of simultaneously perceived race and socioeconomic status (SES) remain to be considered. Across four experiments, participants completed an evaluative priming task with face primes orthogonally varying in race (Black vs. White) and SES (low vs. high). Following initial evidence of a positive implicit bias for high-SES (vs. low-SES) primes, subsequent experiments revealed that this bias is sensitive to target race, particularly when race and SES antecedents are presented in an integrated fashion. Specifically, high-SES positive bias was more reliable for White than for Black targets. Additional analyses examining how implicit biases may be sensitive to perceiver characteristics such as race, SES, and beliefs about socioeconomic mobility are also discussed. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of examining evaluations based on race and SES when antecedents of both categories are simultaneously available.

AB  - Research on linguistic biases shows that stereotypic expectancies are implicitly reflected in language and thereby subtly communicated to message recipients. Research on the Negation Bias shows that the use of negations (e.g., not stupid vs. smart) is more pronounced in descriptions of stereotype-inconsistent compared with stereotype-consistent behaviors. This article reports a replication study of the original research conducted in Dutch, using newly developed materials, and in five different languages: English, Dutch, Hungarian, Finnish, and Serbian. The results validate the existence of the Negation Bias in all five languages. This suggests that negation use serves a similar stereotype-maintaining function across language families.

AB  - The inclusion of transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals in feminist theory, discourse, and activism is fraught with controversy. Given this historical tension within various feminism movements, the current study sought to understand the nature of the relationship between endorsement of feminist beliefs and transphobia, and whether the specific individual-level factors such as openness to experience and mindful acceptance, moderate such a relationship. Analyzing data from a sample of n = 211 participants recruited from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform, the regression analyses indicate both endorsement of feminist beliefs and openness to experience are independent inverse predictors of transphobia, net of other variables in the regression models. However, openness to experience does not moderate the relationship between endorsement of feminist beliefs and transphobia. Further, mindful acceptance was not a significant predictor or moderating variable regarding transphobia. For the feminist community, this is an important contribution as it supports the idea that feminist attitudes may be inclusive of TGNC identities, along with the individual personality facet of openness to experience. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Based on two theoretical approaches contact-theory and threat perception theory-(i)n combination with meaningful encounter and media perspective and using the example of two neighbourhoods in Zagreb, this paper aims to explore several issues related to asylum seekers: (1) the deftnition and perceptions of asylum seekers expressed by locals; (2) attitudes towards asylum seekers in relation to vicinity to an asylum seeker centre and contact with asylum seekers on the neighbourhood level; and (3) the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. The survey was conducted in the period of November 2015 to January 2016, using a systematic random sample (N = 299) in two selected neighbourhoods of the City of Zagreb: Dugave and Trnje. Each neighbourhood represents a specific surrounding in relation to the proximity of asylum seekers. In terms of location and contact with the asylum seekers, significant differences were found in all obtained latent dimensions of attitudes towards asylum seekers and attitudes based on locational attributes regarding asylum seeker reception: Dugave residents (located closer to the reception and accommodation centre) expressed, in general, more negative attitudes towards asylum seekers and their reception in Croatia than their counterparts in Trnje. The specific timeframe (the 2015-2016 sequence usually referred to as "European Migration Crisis") and the spatial context chosen for conducting the survey allows for spatialised and comparative findings. The discussion further develops the perceptive role played by media in a context of highly-mediatised migration, and the nature of contact in shaping more positive or negative attitudes towards refugees and migrants.

AB  - Background: Lived experience practitioners can contribute to improved outcomes for people with mental illness, supplementing traditional mental health services and reducing health care costs. However, lived experience practitioners frequently face stigma and discrimination within their work roles. Aim: To understand the impact of stigma and discrimination on the effectiveness of lived experience roles from the perspective of lived experience practitioners. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 lived experience practitioners within a grounded theory study. Results: Issues of stigma and discrimination were identified as a core category of this study. Participants described stigma and discrimination so prevalent as to be considered a "normal" part of their working life. Professional isolation and attitudinal barriers from colleagues were seen to inhibit the effectiveness of lived experience roles. Conclusions: Lived experience practitioners can provide a vital contribution to stigma reduction broadly, however, the stigma and discrimination they face within work roles must be addressed to allow this contribution to be effective.

AB  - In the current study we extend previous findings on the shooter bias toward targets with Arab ethnicity. In an adapted shooter task, we presented stereotypically oriental-looking targets without explicit symbols of Islam (e.g., a turban) and additionally tested if presenting a "harmless" companion dog, together with Arab versus White targets, would affect the shooter bias. Participants responded faster and made fewer errors for armed Arab than for armed White targets. Moreover, compared to the "neutral" no dog condition, the presence of a dog triggered fewer false alarms for White than for Arab targets and slowed down (correct) responses in general. Implications and potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a new serious game focused on reducing stigma toward mental health illness with other traditional procedures utilized in different stigma awareness programs, namely face-to-face contact with mental health patients and talks given by professionals. The Stigma-Stop serious game introduces four characters with various psychological disorders (schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and agoraphobia) providing users with information about these disorders and pertinent questions. Furthermore, it offers players different ways of reacting when in contact with such individuals. A sample of university psychology students was selected and divided into four groups: (a) students who used Stigma-Stop, (b) direct contact with people suffering from mental health problems, (c) a talk by a professional, and (d) the control group. The results show that the serious game had an effect similar to those of direct contact with mental health patients and the talk by a professional with regard to dangerousness, avoidance, segregation, and anger. The game's results were better in terms of help when compared with the talk, and also diminished the stigma related to coercion when compared with direct contact and the talk.

AB  - Theories of risk aversion, epistemic defense, and ingroup enhancement converge in predicting greater impact of negative (vs. positive) experiences with outgroup members on generalized evaluations of stigmatized outgroups. However, they diverge in predictions for admired outgroups. Past tests have focused on negative outgroups using correlational designs without a control group. Consequently, they have not distinguished between alternative explanations or ascertained the direction of causality/generalization, and they have suffered from self-selection biases. These limitations were redressed by a meta-analysis of experimental research on individual-to-group generalization with positive and negative outgroups (59 tests; 3,012 participants). Controlling for modest confounds, the meta-analysis found a generalization advantage of negative experiences for stigmatized outgroups and a generalization advantage of positive experiences for admired outgroups. These results highlight the centrality of valenced expectations about outgroups, consistent with epistemic defense and ingroup enhancement and inconsistent with risk aversion. Implications for positive changes in intergroup dynamics are discussed.

AB  - We sought to examine perceived gender identity, perceived co-worker discomfort, and salary recommendations for youth counselors with transgender-related work experience. In two experiments conducted in 2016 and 2017, we randomized participants to view 1 of 2 resumes with varying work experience at a camp for transgender youth or a generic youth camp. Study 1 participants were 274 adult festivalgoers at a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride festival. Study 2 participants were 296 employed, heterosexual adults aged 35-60 from an online survey panel. In Study 1, viewing the resume with transgender experience resulted in a statistically significantly higher likelihood of reporting the applicant was gender minority than cisgender (adjusted odds ratio = 3.76, 95% confidence interval [1.32, 10.72], p = .01), higher but not a statistically significant level of co-worker discomfort (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI [0.83, 2.32], p = .22), and, although not statistically significant, a $2,605 higher salary (95% CI [$604, - $5,814], p = .11). In Study 2, we found a statistically significantly greater likelihood of reporting the applicant was gender minority than cisgender (OR = 2.56, 95% CI [1.36, 4.82], p < .01), statistically significantly higher odds of reported co-worker discomfort (OR = 3.57, 95% CI [2.15, 5.92], p < .01), and, although not statistically significant, a $1,374 higher salary (95% CI [-$1,931, $4,679], p = .41). Our results indicate the potential for stigma by association for professionals working with marginalized groups and suggest potential pathways through which employment discrimination may exacerbate existing inequities for gender minority people.

AB  - Consumers with stigmatized identities may be especially attentive to organizational cues that signal to them whether or not they are welcomed and valued consumers. These stigmatized-identity cues can become a part of a company's brand, influencing the attractiveness of the company and consumer loyalty, and allowing consumers to draw inferences about an organization's ideologies and attitudes toward multiple stigmatized groups. Consumers with stigmatized identities attend to stigmatized-identity cues that signal inclusion (or exclusion) toward other stigmatized groups, resulting in stigmatized-identity cue transfers, especially when similarity mindsets are activated, and among consumers who are high in stigma solidarity. Because identity is central in consumer behavior, stigmatized-identity threat cues can at times result in anti-consumption, including boycotts, allowing consumers and companies to engage in collective action. This article reviews this growing body of research, demonstrating the important influence of stigmatized-identity cues on consumer behavior and discussing ways in which companies can better signal their inclusive attitudes and ideologies to attract consumers.

AB  - Threat has been linked to certain facets of moral cognition, but the specific implications of disease threat for moral judgment remain poorly understood. Across three studies, we investigated the role of perceived disease threat in shaping moral judgment and hypothesized that perceived disease threat would cause people to be more sensitive to moral violations (or more "morally vigilant"). All three studies found a positive relationship between dispositional worry about disease transmission and moral vigilance. Additional analyses suggested that this worry was more strongly related to vigilance toward binding moral foundations. Study 3 demonstrated that moral vigilance was higher in individuals for whom the threat of disease was experimentally made salient, relative to individuals in both a neutral and a nondisease threat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that perceived disease threat may influence people's moral vigilance across moral domains.

AB  - The present research unites two emergent trends in the area of language attitudes: (a) research on perceptions of nonnative speakers by nonnative listeners and (b) the search for general, basic mechanisms underlying the evaluation of nonnative accented speakers. In three experiments featuring an employment situation, German participants listened to a presentation given in English by a German speaker with a strong versus native-like accent (in Studies 1-3) versus a native speaker of English (in Study 1). They evaluated candidates with a strong accent worse than candidates with a native(-like) pronunciation-even to the degree that the quality of arguments was of no relevance (Study 1). Study 2 introduces an effective intervention to reduce these discriminatory tendencies. Across studies, affect and competence emerged as major mediators of hirability evaluations. Study 3 further revealed sequential indirect influences, which advance our understanding of previous inconsistent findings regarding disfluency and warmth perceptions.

AB  - The present research aims to verify the presence of Linguistic biases in crime news reports (Study 1) and their role (Study 2) in activating a crime stereotype toward racial/ethnic minorities. In a first content analysis study, the natural occurrence of a set of linguistic biases was analyzed in Italian news articles that described comparable crimes committed by an in- or an outgroup aggressor. Results indicated that when the crime was committed by an outgroup (vs. ingroup) member, more aggravating and less attenuating adjectives were used. Moreover, the nationality of the perpetrator was not only mentioned more frequently, it also appeared in most cases as a noun. In Study 2, participants read a fictitious news article that either described an in- or outgroup criminal act with neutral or biased language. Their implicit associations between in- and outgroup members and weapons (vs. tools) were measured immediately afterward in the weapon paradigm. Results confirmed that a biased (vs. neutral) language use increased participants' crime-related associations with the outgroup in general only when an outgroup criminal was staged. The role of media portrayals in determining the cognitive representations of racial/ethnic minorities is discussed.

AB  - Israeli Jews and Palestinians are involved in a high-intensity, overt, violent conflict, in which Israeli Palestinians can be considered a mediating group, which shares a citizenship with Israeli Jews and an ethnicity with non-Israeli Palestinians. The current research examines (1) the primary effects of online contact between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians on attitudes towards the Israeli Palestinians; (2) the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of online contact between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians on attitudes of the former toward non-Israeli Palestinians.
   The study was conducted through an online survey of 450 Israeli Jews aged 18-35. It revealed direct positive effect of online contact with Israeli Palestinians on attitudes towards them, if this contact was defined by respondents as positive, and negative effect if the contact was defined as negative. We found evidence of STE of online contact with Israeli Palestinians (primary outgroup) on attitudes toward non-Israeli Palestinians (secondary out-group) for positive contact, but no evidence of STE was found when the contact was negative. The relationship between the frequency of online positive contact with the primary out-group and attitudes toward the secondary outgroup was fully mediated by attitudes toward the primary, encountered out-group, namely, via a process of attitude generalization.
   This paper adds to a growing body of research on STEs of intergroup contact considering a previously unexplored STE of positive and negative online contact. The study revealed that the potential of Internet and online contacts might be used to increase solidarity and understanding within and between nations.

AB  - This research reports a novel investigation into the comparative effects of positive and negative direct and extended intergroup contact on intergroup orientations. It tested the generality of the positive-negative asymmetry effect among majority (N=357) and minority (N=101) group members in Iceland. Little evidence of asymmetry was observed: the beneficial effects of positive contact were mostly as strong as the detrimental effects of negative contact, for both direct and extended contact. However, evidence was found for alternative interaction models in which positive contact buffers the negative effects of negative contact, and negative contact enhances the benefits of positive contact. These interaction effects were found only for direct contact and principally in the majority group, but were also found for the minority group, though more weakly. No interaction was observed for extended contact. It appeared that differential group salience elicited by positive and negative contact could partly contribute to the explanation of the observed effects, at least in the majority sample.

AB  - Intergroup contact (i.e. personal encounters with and presence of immigrants) has frequently been related to improved immigration attitudes among the national majority. The impact of ideological climates, in turn, has received scant attention. Drawing on the notion of deprovincialization, we argue that, in proximal geographical contexts, contact with immigrants as well as progressive (vs conservative) ideological climates engender a reappraisal of national ingroup boundaries by attenuating ethnic views of nationhood. As expected, multilevel regression analyses with the Swiss ISSP 2013 data (N = 1019 Swiss respondents living in 136 districts) revealed that personal encounters with immigrants related to reduced ethnic boundary making. Importantly, on the district level, immigrant presence buffered the impact of conservative ideological climates.

AB  - Article 531 of the Turkish Commercial Code grants the right to request corporate dissolution for just causes to shareholders representing at least 10% of the capital in joint stock companies, and 5% in publicly traded companies. In addition to dissolution, the court can order purchase of the claimant's shares at real value (buy-out remedy) or adopt a different solution. This article conducts an economic analysis of the buy-out remedy against minority oppression and compares Turkish law with Swiss and English legislation. The buy-out remedy is supposed to provide an ex post control on the controller's conduct, and it is expected to function as a put option conditional upon oppression. However, the current provision does not provide the expected incentives. Addressing this issue, I suggest that: (1) the relief sought by the claimant should be taken into account; (2) the purchaser of the claimant's shares should be the oppressive controller, rather than the company in question; (3) the standard of 'just cause' to be proven should not be equal for each remedy, and thus, the courts should be able to give a buy-out order even if the facts do not justify corporate dissolution; (4) dissolution orders should not be given in cases where there is a going-concern value to protect; and finally, (5) the valuation of the claimant's shares should, in principle, be made on a going concern and pro rata basis, and any depreciation of the claimant's shares due to the controller's abusive conducts should be taken into account.

AB  - In five studies, we explored how expectations and memory for a target's facial appearance vary as a function of whether that face is said to belong to a transgender or cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) individual. Participants in each study were randomly assigned to either a transgender or a cisgender target. In Study 1, participants indicated how feminine and masculine they expected the target to look. In Study 2, participants were shown an image of the target's face (which was androgynous in all conditions) and asked to rate how feminine and masculine the face appeared. In Studies 3, 4, and 5, participants were shown the same image of the target's face and later instructed to identify it from an array of faces. Results from these studies revealed that supposedly cisgender targets' faces are expected to look, evaluated, and remembered as more gender congruent than supposedly transgender targets' faces. Potential implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Ethnic and national identities, as ingroup and superordinate identities, are key predictors for reconciliation, yet less research considers religious identity a superordinate identity.
   Focusing on the reconciliation of the Kurdish conflict in Turkey, this study aims to test a mediation model in which the relations between ethnic (i.e., Kurdish) and religious identifications (i.e., Muslim) and reconciliation outcomes were mediated by positive intergroup emotions. Moreover, to understand the diffusion of the conflict in a transnational context, this model is tested both in Turkey and Belgium among Muslim Kurdish minorities (N = 141). Kurdish minorities' levels of support for reconciliation and the ways they construe reconciliation were analyzed as two outcomes. For the latter, descriptions of reconciliation were first content-coded into seven themes. A latent class analysis of these themes led to two main construals: those endorsing a rights-based versus dialogue-based understanding of reconciliation; which was then used as a binary outcome. Results supported a similar mediation model in Turkey and Belgium. Accordingly, stronger religious identification as Muslim was associated with positive intergroup emotions and in turn more support for reconciliation, whereas stronger ethnic identification as Kurdish had the opposite effect. However, having Muslim identity as a superordinate identity was double-edged for the Kurdish minorities: while high Muslim identifiers were more supportive of reconciliation in general; they were also less likely to endorse a rights-based understanding of reconciliation (versus a dialogue-based reconciliation).

AB  - A series of three studies were conducted to generate, develop, and validate the Attitudes toward Transgender Men and Women (ATTMW) scale. In Study 1, 120 American adults responded to an open-ended questionnaire probing various dimensions of their perceptions of transgender individuals and identity. Qualitative thematic analysis generated 200 items based on their responses. In Study 2, 238 American adults completed a questionnaire consisting of the generated items. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed two non-identical 12-item subscales (ATTM and ATTW) of the full 24-item scale. In Study 3, 150 undergraduate students completed a survey containing the ATTMW and a number of validity-testing variables. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) verified the single-factor structures of the ATTM and ATTW subscales, and the convergent, discriminant, predictive, and concurrent validities of the ATTMW were also established. Together, our results demonstrate that the ATTMW is a reliable and valid measure of attitudes toward transgender individuals.

AB  - We study media representations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In particular, we train models of semantic memory on a large number of news media outlets that published online articles during the course of the election. Based on the structure of word co-occurrence in these media outlets, our models learn semantic representations for the two presidential candidates as well as for widely studied personality traits. We find that models trained on media outlets most read by Clinton voters and media outlets most read by Trump voters differ in the strength of association between the two candidates' names and trait words pertaining to morality. We observe some differences for trait words pertaining to warmth, but none for trait words pertaining to competence.

AB  - Background: In the setting of end-of-life care, biases can interfere with patient articulation of goals and hinder provision of patient-centered care. No studies have addressed clinician bias or bias management specific to goals of care discussions at the end of life.
   Objectives: To identify and determine the prevalence of palliative care clinician biases and bias management strategies in end-of-life goals of care discussions.
   Design: A semistructured interview guide with relevant domains was developed to facilitate data collection. Participants were asked directly to identify biases and bias management strategies applicable to this setting. Two researchers developed a codebook to identify themes using a 25% transcript sample through an iterative process based on grounded theory. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using Cohen . It was 0.83, indicating near perfect agreement between coders. The data approach saturation.
   Setting/Participants: A purposive sampling of 20 palliative care clinicians in Middle Tennessee participated in interviews.
   Results: The 20 clinicians interviewed identified 16 biases and 11 bias management strategies. The most frequently mentioned bias was a bias against aggressive treatment (n = 9), described as a clinician's assumption that most interventions at the end of life are not beneficial. The most frequently mentioned bias management strategy was self-recognition of bias (n = 17), described as acknowledging that bias is present.
   Conclusion: This is the first study identifying palliative care clinicians' biases and bias management strategies in end-of-life goals of care discussions.

AB  - The affect misattribution procedure (AMP) is widely used to measure sensitive attitudes towards classes of stimuli, by estimating the effect that affectively charged prime images have on subsequent judgements of neutral target images. We test its resistance to efforts to conceal one's attitudes, by replicating the standard AMP design while offering small incentives to conceal attitudes towards the prime images. We find that although the average AMP effect remains positive, it decreases significantly in magnitude. Moreover, this reduction in the mean AMP effect under incentives masks large heterogeneity: one subset of individuals continues to experience the full' AMP effect, while another reduces their effect to approximately zero. The AMP thus appears to be resistant to efforts to conceal one's attitudes for some individuals but is highly controllable for others. We further find that those individuals with high self-reported effort to avoid the influence of the prime are more often able to eliminate their AMP effect. We conclude by discussing possible mechanisms.

AB  - Whereas confrontations of racial bias prompt negative self-directed affect (e.g., guilt) and reduce bias, confrontations of gender bias are typically disregarded. We examined the effectiveness of an evidence-based confrontation in which participants received concrete evidence of their discriminatory gender-biased evaluations. Participants were confronted with evidence that they evaluated a female applicant for a lab manager position negatively, which would have resulted in her not being hired, and that their evaluations were more negative than an otherwise identical applicant who was male. Experiment 1 found that this confrontation activated greater guilt and, in turn, concern about expressing and regulating gender bias in the future (hereafter "future concern"), relative to participants who were confronted about gender bias but without concrete evidence of bias. Experiment 2 showed that confrontation with concrete evidence of gender bias activated guilt and future concern whether the bias was framed as viewing women as not belonging in science or as unintelligent. Experiment 3 showed that the positive effects of confronting gender bias with evidence were just as strong as a parallel confrontation of racial bias. Experiment 4 showed that the positive effects also held in a non-STEM domain, and that these effects were not dependent on the situational salience of norms opposing gender bias. Thus, a robust strategy for effective confrontation of gender bias was established. However, we discuss difficulties with implementing this strategy in many real world situations,, along with implications for how best to curb gender bias through confrontation.

AB  - In recent years, the Netherlands has been frequently confronted with public incidents of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. After defining the complex concepts of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, presenting the theoretical approach to these phenomena, and sketching the societal context in which they are embedded, this article describes the development of the numbers of reported expressions of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the Netherlands since the turn of the century. It notes that the general level of annual numbers of recorded incidents of the phenomena has increased since 2000 and, at the same time, there are significant fluctuations in the numbers of notified incidents per year. These fluctuations correlate to outbursts of violence in the Middle East and to acts of violence committed in the name of Islam in the West, while the general higher level of incidents of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia relates to numerous and various threats experienced in the context of the Dutch multi-ethnic society, changes in national identity, and trends in globalisation.

AB  - A pressing issue concerns how to reduce stereotypic responses and discriminatory outcomes resulting from the operation of implicit biases. One possibility is that cognitive retraining, such as by repeatedly practicing counterstereotypes, can reduce implicit bias so that stereotype application will be reduced in turn. Another possibility involves motivated self-regulation, where people's awareness of their proneness to biased responses heightens negative self-directed affect, which in turn facilitates monitoring for biases and reduces stereotype application. These possibilities were tested across three experiments. In all experiments, participants who completed counterstereotype training subsequently scored lower on a measure of implicit bias, relative to untrained participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, counterstereotyping did not reduce subsequent stereotype application; in Experiment 3, counterstereotyping did reduce stereotype application, but this effect was not mediated by implicit bias scores. Participants in the motivated self-regulation condition (Experiments 2 & 3) were primed with their proneness to respond in biased ways, which increased negative self-directed affect among participants more internally motivated to respond without bias. Participants degree of negative self-directed affect was not consistently associated with implicit bias scores. However, greater negative self-directed affect was associated with reduced stereotype application (Experiment 2) and greater rejection of racist jokes (Experiment 3). These results suggest that reductions of implicit bias through counterstereotype training do not, in turn, lead to reduced stereotype application. In contrast, the results support the viability of motivated self-regulation interventions that facilitate awareness of bias and heighten negative self-directed affect, thus creating the motivation to self regulate stereotype application.

AB  - In the current work, we experimentally examined the effect of exposure to a narrative of nonviolent resistance on third-party attitudes toward and support for a disempowered group involved in asymmetric conflict. Across three experiments, we found that Americans exposed to a brief video about Palestinian nonviolent resistance consistently registered more favorable attitudes toward Palestinians than people who watched a film trailer either unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or a trailer to a Palestinian-made film about sympathetic Palestinians violently opposing Israelis. Americans' attitudes toward Palestinians and behavior supporting Palestinian collective action persisted weeks after exposure to nonviolent resistance and were mediated by decreased perceptions that Palestinians are inherently violent. Importantly, positive attitudes toward Palestinians did not result in increased negativity toward Israelis. These data show that exposure to nonviolent resistance can have lasting effects on third-party attitudes and behavior toward an underdog/disempowered group, without driving partisanship.

AB  - Opposition to immigrant inclusion is often grounded in a Latino threat narrative that portrays Latino immigrants and their descendants as incapable of assimilation and undeserving of the benefits of citizenship. Are nativist reactions to this narrative strongest where immigrants are lagging behind in cultural assimilation, or where they are actually making the greatest gains? Two competing logics of status threat are tested through an analysis of county-level voting returns on California's Proposition 227. Status politics theories predict higher antibilingual support where immigrants are failing to learn English. In contrast, the status devaluation argument leads to the counterintuitive prediction that support should be highest where language assimilation rates are high. Although we might expect that the claims of the Latino threat narrative would be least appealing where objective circumstances refute them, findings suggest that the resonance of such claims can be amplified in settings where they are furthest from the truth. The theoretical argument advanced helps explain why nativist policies continue to generate broad appeal at a time when immigrants are rapidly assimilating.

AB  - Three studies examined the role of need for affect (NFA) and need for cognition (NFC) in intergroup perception. We hypothesized that NFA predicts a preference for stereotypically warm groups over stereotypically cold groups, whereas NFC predicts a preference for stereotypically competent groups over stereotypically incompetent groups. Study 1 supported these hypotheses for attitudes toward stereotypically ambivalent groups, which are stereotyped as high on one of the trait dimensions (e.g., high warmth) and low on the other (e.g., low competence), but not for stereotypically univalent groups, which are seen as high or low on both dimensions. Studies 2 and 3 replicated this pattern for stereotypically ambivalent groups, and yielded provocative evidence regarding several putative mechanisms underlying these associations. Together, these findings help integrate and extend past evidence on attitude-relevant individual differences with research on intergroup perception.

AB  - A field experiment on the discrimination of Roma migrants from Eastern Europe was conducted in two stations of the Paris metro to explore the behaviors that may communicate misrecognition in everyday encounters. An actress asked for help to randomly chosen passengers on a metro platform, wearing a glaringly Romani skirt in the treatment condition but an unconspicuous middle-class style in the control condition. In interaction with the actress wearing the Romani skirt, passengers were found to enact the so-called visual dominance pattern, and male passengers in particular were found to keep greater distances. Reverse discrimination also occurred as women kept shorter distances from the actress bearing the ethnic stigma. Last, passengers helped less the stigmatized actress, but only in one of the two metro stations where trials were conducted.

AB  - Survey data on people's reported attitudes towards ethnic minorities are sometimes used as a proxy for ethnic discrimination. However, there is weak empirical evidence of a link between reported attitudes and discrimination. In this article, we use survey data on people's attitudes towards ethnic minorities combined with a direct measure of ethnic discrimination from a field experiment in the Swedish housing market to re-examine this policy-relevant issue. We find clear evidence of a link between reported attitudes towards ethnic minorities and the extent of ethnic discrimination: in regions where attitudes are more negative, there is more discrimination, and vice versa. Thus, in contrast to most prior studies, our results suggest that reported attitudes may be a useful predictor of ethnic discrimination.

AB  - Ingroup favoritism is pervasive. It emerges even in the minimal group paradigm, where participants are assigned to novel groups based on seemingly insignificant characteristics. Yet many of the grouping schemes used in minimal group research may imply something significant: namely, that ingroup members will share in-the-moment subjective experience, or I-share. Two studies examine the role of inferred I-sharing in the minimal group paradigm. We found that (1) people inferred that they would I-share with ingroup members more than outgroup members; (2) inferred I-sharing increased ingroup favoritism; and (3) inferred I-sharing accounted for this ingroup favoritism. Moreover, expecting to I-share with the outgroup improved participants' attitudes toward the outgroup. These results converge with other research suggesting that people favor ingroup members, in part, because they expect to I-share with them.

AB  - Psychological research has provided essential insights into how stigma operates to disadvantage those who are targeted by it. At the same time, stigma research has been criticized for being too focused on the perceptions of stigmatized individuals and on microlevel interactions, rather than attending to structural forms of stigma. This article describes the relatively new field of research on structural stigma, which is defined as societal-level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the opportunities, resources, and well-being of the stigmatized. I review emerging evidence that structural stigma related to mental illness and sexual orientation (a) exerts direct and synergistic effects on stigma processes that have long been the focus of psychological inquiry (e.g., concealment, rejection sensitivity), (b) serves as a contextual moderator of the efficacy of psychological interventions, and (c) contributes to numerous adverse health outcomes for members of stigmatized groups-ranging from dysregulated physiological stress responses to premature mortality-indicating that structural stigma represents an underrecognized mechanism producing health inequalities. Each of these pieces of evidence suggests that structural stigma is relevant to psychology and therefore deserves the attention of psychological scientists interested in understanding and ultimately reducing the negative effects of stigma.

AB  - The meanings attached to the nation can be consequential for group members' attitudes and beliefs. We examined how national identity definition can influence the extent of individuals' homophobia with 159 Lithuanian and 176 Scottish university students who completed a questionnaire which measured their national identification, homophobia, and the extent to which they felt traditional family values were central to their nation's identity. Consistent with nation-wide differences in the significance given to the family, Lithuanian participants perceived family values to be more important for their national identity and expressed higher levels of homophobia than did Scottish participants. Moreover, the relationship between level of national identification and homophobia was stronger in Lithuania than in Scotland. Analyses revealed that the perceived importance of family values helped explain the difference between homophobia levels in Lithuania and Scotland. In both sites we found an indirect effect of national identification on homophobia via the perceived importance of family values, but this effect was significantly stronger for Lithuanian participants. These findings illustrate the ways in which identification with the nation is relevant to attitudes concerning sexuality, and how this varies according to national context. Our work indicates that LGBT rights campaigns should be informed by the knowledge that homophobia may be perpetuated by national valorisation of the family.

AB  - A brief mindfulness intervention diminished bias in favor of one's in-group and against one's out-group. In the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB), individuals expect in-group members to behave positively and out-group members to behave negatively. Consequently, individuals choose abstract language beset with character inferences to describe these expected behaviors, and in contrast, choose concrete, objective language to describe unexpected behaviors. Eighty-four participants received either mindful attention instructions (observe their thoughts as fleeting mental states) or immersion instructions (become absorbed in the vivid details of thoughts). After instruction, participants viewed visual depictions of an imagined in-group or out-group member's positive or negative behavior, selecting the best linguistic description from a set of four descriptions that varied in abstractness. Immersion groups demonstrated a robust LIB. Mindful attention groups, however, exhibited a markedly tempered LIB, suggesting that even a brief mindfulness related instruction can implicitly reduce the propensity to perpetuate stereotypical thinking through language. These results contribute to understanding the mechanisms that facilitate unprejudiced thinking.

AB  - This study investigates whether human service administrators' attitudes toward immigration are associated with local demographic context. Hypotheses informed by threat, contact, and institutional theories are tested with a probability sample of human service administrators from Alabama, a state with pockets of dramatic growth in Latino immigrants. Results show that administrators from counties with larger percentage growth in the Latino population from 1990 to 2010 perceived a greater threat from immigration. Administrators perceived less threat from immigration when immigrant services were expected and legitimate in the organizational task environment. Results have implications for immigrant services in contexts of demographic change.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that sexualized female bodies are objectified at a cognitive level. Research using the body-inversion recognition task, a robust indicator of configural (vs. analytic processing) within cognitive psychology, shows that for sexualized female bodies, people recognize upright and inverted bodies similarly rather than recognizing upright bodies better than inverted bodies (i.e., an inversion effect). This finding suggests that sexualized female bodies, like objects, are recognized analytically (rather than configurally). Nonetheless, it remains unclear when and why sexualized female bodies are objectified at a basic cognitive level. Grounded in objectification theory, the present experiments examine moderating factors that may prompt more configural processing (i.e., produce an inversion effect) and less objectification of sexualized female bodies. Replicating previous research, sexualized male bodies elicited more configural processing and less objectification compared to sexualized female bodies. We then examined whether reducing the salience of sexual body parts (Experiments 2a and 2b) and adding humanizing information about the targets (Experiment 3) causes perceivers to recognize female bodies more configurally, reducing the cognitive objectification of women. Implications for sexual objectification theory and research, as well as the role of humanizing often-dehumanized sexy women, are discussed.

AB  - The current paper connects anxiety about disease contamination to that about cultural contamination and the exclusionary behavior toward ethnic outgroups that it incites. We suggest that when individuals are exposed to disease fears, an epistemic groundwork is laid for construing outgroups as sources of contamination. We begin with a pilot experiment showing that contagious disease anxiety primes opposition to legalization of illegal aliens. We then analyze historical data about the diffusion of rumor-based ethnic violence, showing that Indian regiments of the East India Company were more likely to mutiny against their British officers if they had been exposed some months earlier to a cholera discourse. (These mutinies were proximally caused by acceptance of a rumor that the Company administration had violated a cultural taboo.) We discuss implications for studying the cognitive antecedents of the diffusion of beliefs and practices in organizations and in cultures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The focus of this special issue is relative deprivation (RD): the judgment that one or one's group is worse off compared to some standard accompanied by feelings of anger and resentment. This collection of seven papers demonstrates the range of the new thinking and research about RD, and they include data from an impressive variety of participants-including Canadians (both French- and English-speakers), Dutch, the Maoris of New Zealand, Mongols, Singaporeans, and South Africans (both Blacks and Whites). These seven papers show that if RD, and its counterpart, relative gratification, are defined carefully, at the right level of analysis and employed within larger theoretical models, the concept offers invaluable insight to how people respond to often dramatic changes in their objective circumstances.

AB  - Feminine forms of job titles raise great interest in many countries. However, it is still unknown how they shape stereotypical impressions on warmth and competence dimensions among female and male listeners. In an experiment with fictitious job titles men perceived women described with feminine job titles as significantly less warm and marginally less competent than women with masculine job titles, which led to lower willingness to employ them. No such effects were observed among women.

AB  - The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was designed to measure automatically activated attitudinal associations, free of the influence of processes that affect their expression. Subsequent research has shown that IAT performance also is influenced by non-associative processes, but the extent to which these non-associative processes are content-specific or if they operate similarly regardless of the attitude being measured has largely gone unexamined. In the current research, participants completed pairs of IATs that varied in conceptual overlap: Tests shared a high, moderate, or low degree of overlap in the measured attitudes. The Quad model was applied to estimate the contributions of four processes to IAT performance. Evidence was found for two relatively general, non-attitudinal processes and two relatively attitude-specific processes. Implications are discussed for interpretation of IAT scores, individual differences in IAT scores, and IAT score malleability.

AB  - Theoretically, modem racism and sexism are characterized by ambivalence. We directly examined the consequence of being higher in subjective ambivalence toward gays (i.e. attitudes that feel "torn") with regard to gay rights support. In Study 1, greater subjective ambivalence was associated with more negative attitudes (and not more positive attitudes), more ideological opposition to gays, more negative intergroup emotions, and less gay rights support. In Study 2, less opposition to gay bullying was predicted by: (a) greater subjective ambivalence (through lower intergroup empathy); and (b) experimentally-salient bullying justification norms (through lower collective guilt). These effects held controlling for Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (i.e., traditional negative attitudes). Although not overtly negative, individual differences in subjective ambivalence tap a unique, subtle, and less objectionable form of bias, consistent with aversive racism and justification-suppression frameworks of explaining modem biases.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: There are few controlled experimental studies that examine reactions to people with speech disabilities. We conducted 2 studies designed to examine participants' reactions to persuasive appeals delivered by people with physical disabilities and mild to moderate dysarthria. Research Method/Design: Research participants watched video clips delivered by actors with bona fide disabilities and subsequently rated the argument, message, and the speaker. The first study (n = 165) employed a between-groups design that examined reactions to natural dysarthric speech, synthetic speech as entered into a keyboard by hand, and synthetic speech as entered into a keyboard with a headwand. The second study (n = 27) employed a within-groups design that examined how participants reacted to natural dysarthric speech versus synthetic speech as entered into a keyboard by hand. Results: Both of these studies provide evidence that people rated the argument, message, and speaker more favorably when people with disabilities used synthetic speech than when they spoke in their natural voice. Conclusions/Implications: The implications are that although people react negatively to computer-synthesized speech, they prefer it to and find it more persuasive than the speech of people with disabilities. This appears to be the case even if the speech is only moderately impaired and is as intelligible as the synthetic speech. Hence, the decision to use synthetic speech versus natural speech can be further complicated by an understanding that even the intelligible speech of people with disabilities leads to more negative reactions than synthetic speech.

AB  - When the economy declines, racial minorities are hit the hardest. Although existing explanations for this effect focus on institutional causes, recent psychological findings suggest that scarcity may also alter perceptions of race in ways that exacerbate discrimination. We tested the hypothesis that economic resource scarcity causes decision makers to perceive African Americans as "Blacker" and that this visual distortion elicits disparities in the allocation of resources. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that scarcity altered perceptions of race, lowering subjects' psychophysical threshold for seeing a mixed-race face as "Black" as opposed to "White." In studies 3 and 4, scarcity led subjects to visualize African American faces as darker and more "stereotypically Black," compared with a control condition. When presented to naive subjects, face representations produced under scarcity elicited smaller allocations than control-condition representations. Together, these findings introduce a novel perceptual account for the proliferation of racial disparities under economic scarcity.

AB  - This study describes a creative and psychometrically sound method that allows researchers to measure homonegativity at a lower threshold than existing measures and to differentiate between homonegativity toward gay men and lesbians. Four hundred and thirty-one undergraduate students at a Western comprehensive university were asked to respond to a series of vignettes describing situations in which heterosexuals sometimes experience discomfort in the presence of homosexuals, indicating the degree to which they would feel comfortable or uncomfortable. The 12-item Homonegativity as Discomfort Scale (HADS) has adequate alpha reliability (.92) as well as good criterion and construct validity. Suggestions are made as to how the measure could be employed in research. Testing on this sample shows greater discomfort with gay men than with lesbians and greater discomfort among men than among women.

AB  - In a set of two studies, we tested whether gender-stereotypical associations are automatically activated by Spanish women in a categorization task, and how this process is conditioned by the context in which the target is presented (kitchen vs. office). We hypothesized that gender stereotypes would be activated implicitly when the target (men vs. women) appeared in an office context (associated with male dominant roles), but not when they appeared in a kitchen context (traditionally associated with female roles). The studies were conducted with two samples (N = 44; N = 47) of female undergraduate students from the University of Granada (Spain). In both studies, a priming effect was found, indicating that a traditional, role-congruent stereotype pattern (men-competence, women-warmth) emerged when primes appeared in an office context, but not in a kitchen context. Further, negative competence traits were evaluated faster when a male prime was presented in the context of a kitchen (role-incongruent). The purpose of Study 2 was to clarify the implicit nature of this contextual contingency effect by manipulating the controllability of the priming effect (i.e., Stimulus Onset Asynchrony duration-SOA, and restricted response time). The results of Study 1 were replicated in only the short SOA condition, which implies faster and presumably less controlled processing of the stimuli. Theoretical implications for stereotyping and gender role research are discussed.

AB  - This paper reflects on the concept of insecurity defined as 'the capacity to hurt'. It begins by considering asylum seekers and refugees as hyper-precarious groups that have experienced bodily, material and psychological 'hurt' in the UK. At the same time, the paper considers how these hyper-precarious groups are perceived to have the capacity to hurt (bodily, materially, psychologically and spatially) the majority population. Having drawn out two understandings of the capacity to hurt-both the ability to be or feel hurt and the act of hurting others, we argue that a shared recognition of what it means to feel hurt (co-suffering or suffering together)-albeit to very different extremes and with very different consequences-and an understanding of the processes which drive this might be mobilised politically to challenge the act of hurting others. In doing so, we argue for a group politics of compassion to respond to increasingly insecure times.

AB  - This paper examines relationships between religiosity and intolerance towards Muslims and immigrants among Europeans living in non-Muslim majority countries by applying multilevel modeling to European Values Study data (wave four, 2010). Thus relationships across 44 national contexts are analyzed. The analysis found large between-country differences in the overall levels of intolerance towards immigrants and Muslims. Eastern Europeans tend to be more intolerant than Western Europeans. In most countries Muslims are less accepted than immigrants,-a finding which reflects that in post-9/11 Europe Islamophobia is prevalent and many still see Muslims with suspicion. A key result is that believing matters for the citizen's attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants. Across Europe, traditional and modern fuzzy beliefs in a Higher Being are strongly negatively related to intolerance towards immigrants and Muslims, while fundamentalism is positively related to both targets of intolerance. Religious practice and denominational belonging on the other hand matter far less for the citizen's propensity to dislike the two out-groups. With the only exception of non-devout Protestants who do not practice their religion, members of religious denominations are not more intolerant than non-members. The findings are valid for the vast majority of countries although countries differ in the magnitude of the effects.

AB  - Classic views on right-wing attitudes suggest that right-wing adherents are characterized by psychological problems, such as deeply rooted anxieties and fundamental unhappiness. This perspective has gained much attention and has influenced the way researchers and even laypeople think about right-wing individuals. We reviewed recent accumulated evidence that suggests that right-wing attitudes are not bad for the self and that right-wing adherents have relatively normal mental lives. Specifically, we found that although right-wing adherents feel threatened by societal problems (external threat), they do not experience strong personal anxieties (internal threat). Moreover, our evidence showed that right-wing attitudes are weakly related to psychological ill-being. These findings are discussed in terms of the self-defensive function of right-wing attitudes, and a novel perspective that distinguishes between different levels of the self is proposed.

AB  - We examined how people with HIV are both part of and apart from the communities in which they live. We compared perceptions of behavioral norms of 203 people with HIV living in 33 different communities with community-level normative perceptions assessed by surveys of 2444 randomly selected residents of these communities. Participants with HIV perceived behavior that risks the transmission of HIV as injunctively and descriptively more normative than did other community residents. Participants with HIV living in communities in which community residents perceived relatively widespread approval of condom use also perceived these behaviors as injunctively normative, and they perceived relatively low levels of HIV stigmatization. Discussion focuses on how perceptions about "deviant" behaviors may affect the experiences of people whose stigmatized status is assumed to be the result of such behavior.

AB  - We examined reactions to the Race Implicit Association Test (IAT), which has been widely used but rarely examined as an educational tool to raise awareness about racial bias. College students were assigned to read that the IAT reflected either personal beliefs or both personal and extrapersonal factors (single vs. multiple explanation conditions). They then completed the IAT and quantitative measures of affect, attitudes, and belief in bias. A subset of participants also wrote reaction papers, which were used to develop qualitative themes to more fully describe reactions to the IAT. Quantitative results revealed that participants with a stronger implicit preference for European Americans more strongly believed in implicit bias in the multiple (vs. single) explanation condition. Mixed methods analyses using data transformation and typology development indicated that participants whose qualitative IAT responses were more negative were subsequently more likely to help an African American.

AB  - How does living in a society in which one is frequently exposed to reminders of its Christian foundations shape one's basic cognitions and behaviors? Following contextual priming logic, being exposed to Christian religious content should render associated norms accessible. One prototypical Christian norm is the reliance on dichotomous moral categories such as right vs. wrong (virtuous vs. sinful). If Christian primes indeed activate this normative structure, it should manifest itself in an increased ambiguity intolerance. We tested this reasoning in five studies: Specifically, we demonstrated that semantically activating Christian concepts increases self-reported ambiguity intolerance (Study 1), preference for a non-ambiguous (vs. ambiguous) visual stimulus (Study 2), as well as judgment certainty as means to reduce experienced ambiguity (Studies 3a & 3b). Finally, we extended our laboratory findings to real-life environments by showing that individuals exposed to a cathedral (vs. a place with civic buildings) reported increased ambiguity intolerance (Study 4).

AB  - Two experiments examined aspects of the communicator, message, and audience in producing evaluative backlash toward minorities who make claims of ongoing racial bias. In Experiment 1, participants evaluated a White or Black confederate who gave a speech expressing no claim, a mild claim, or an extreme claim of racial bias. Results indicated a race-specific evaluative backlash: Participants more negatively rated Black compared with White communicators, but only when the claim was extreme. Experiment 2 found that participants more negatively rated Black (vs. White) communicators when they used low-quality arguments, but this backlash was eliminated when Black communicators used high-quality arguments. Furthermore, participants who held stronger meritocracy beliefs and who heard low-quality arguments were more likely to evaluate Black communicators harshly. These findings clarify the conditions under which people from advantaged groups are more likely to recognize claims of racial bias as legitimate and respond favorably to the communicator.

AB  - Six experiments examined how people strategically use thoughts of foregone misdeeds to regulate their moral behavior. We tested 2 hypotheses: 1st, that people will feel licensed to act in morally dubious ways when they can point to immoral alternatives to their prior behavior, and 2nd, that people made to feel insecure about their morality will exaggerate the extent to which such alternatives existed. Supporting the 1st hypothesis, when White participants could point to racist alternatives to their past actions, they felt they had obtained more evidence of their own virtue (Study I), they expressed less racial sensitivity (Study 2), and they were more likely to express preferences about employment and allocating money that favored Whites at the expense of Blacks (Study 3). Supporting the 2nd hypothesis, White participants whose security in their identity as nonracists had been threatened remembered a prior task as having afforded more racist alternatives to their behavior than did those who were not threatened. This distortion of the past involved overestimating the number of Black individuals they had encountered on the prior task (Study 4) and exaggerating how stereotypically Black specific individuals had looked (Studies 5 and 6). We discuss implications for moral behavior, the motivated rewriting of one's moral history, and how the life unlived can liberate people to lead the life they want.

AB  - The present research introduces the concept of experience-taking the imaginative process of spontaneously assuming the identity of a character in a narrative and simulating that character's thoughts, emotions, behaviors, goals, and traits as if they were one's own. Six studies investigated the degree to which particular psychological states and features of narratives cause individuals, without instruction, to engage in experience-taking and investigated how the merger between self and other that occurs during experience-taking produces changes in self-judgments, attitudes, and behavior that align with the character's. Results from Studies 1-3 showed that being in a reduced state of self-concept accessibility while reading a brief fictional work increased and being in a heightened state of self-concept accessibility decreased participants' levels of experience-taking and subsequent incorporation of a character's personality trait into their self-concepts. Study 4 revealed that a first-person narrative depicting an ingroup character elicited the highest levels of experience-taking and produced the greatest change in participants' behavior, compared with versions of the narrative written in 3rd-person voice and/or depicting an outgroup protagonist. The final 2 studies demonstrated that whereas revealing a character's outgroup membership as a homosexual or African American early in a narrative inhibited experience-taking, delaying the revelation of the character's outgroup identity until later in the story produced higher levels of experience-taking, lower levels of stereotype application in participants' evaluation of the character, and more favorable attitudes toward the character's group. The implications of these findings in relation to perspective-taking, self other overlap, and prime-to-behavior effects are discussed.

AB  - In two experiments, the present research identifies basic mechanisms for reducing endorsement of benevolent and modern sexist beliefs. Responses to attitudinal measures and a collective action measure on policy beliefs in Study 1 (N = 164) as well as to dating profiles in Study 1 and Study 2 (N = 159) support the hypothesis that endorsement of benevolent sexist beliefs can be reduced by providing information about its harmful consequences. Moreover, women and men become more aware of the full scope of gender discrimination and reduce their endorsement of modern sexist beliefs when they are provided with information about the harmful nature and pervasiveness of benevolent sexism. Theoretical implications regarding the linkage between benevolent and modern sexist beliefs and practical implications for reducing sexism are discussed.

AB  - The present study examined whether expressed acceptance of a person with AIDS reflects genuine acceptance or a desire to appear to be accepting. Theory and research on the effects of mortality salience on acceptance of stigmatized people provided the framework for investigating this question. After writing about death or another aversive topic, participants indicated their acceptance of a target with AIDS while connected to physiological equipment that they believed could detect lies (bogus pipeline) or was simply measuring physiological responses to participation in the study. As predicted, participants in the mortality salience/bogus pipeline condition indicated significantly less acceptance of the target with AIDS than participants in the other three conditions, suggesting that acceptance of a person with AIDS is at least partially a result of wanting to appear to be accepting, without necessarily genuinely accepting someone with AIDS.

AB  - While many sociological studies analyze the causes, conditions, and mechanisms perpetuating American racial inequality, the literature on how African Americans understand and explain these inequalities is less developed. Drawing on 150 interviews with middle-class and working-class African American men and women, this paper analyzes inductively how respondents define and conceptualize the most pressing obstacles facing their group when probed on this question. We find that middle- and working-class respondents alike identify the problem of racism as the most salient obstacle facing African Americans. Class differences appear with respect to what other obstacles are singled out as salient: while middle-class respondents focus on lack of racial solidarity among Blacks and economic problems (in this order), working-class respondents are more concerned with the fragility of the Black family followed by the lack of racial solidarity. This analysis discusses the relevance of considering how groups make sense of obstacles, and of racism and discrimination in particular, for the study of destigmatization and antiracist strategies of stigmatized minorities.

AB  - The current studies investigate the effects of homophobic labels on the self-perception of heterosexual males, hypothesizing that when exposed to homophobic epithets, they are motivated to underline their masculinity and claim a distinctly heterosexual identity by taking distance from homosexuals and, to a lesser degree, from women. Heterosexual male participants were subliminally (Study 1) and supraliminally (Study 2) primed either by a homophobic epithet or by a category label, and completed the Traditional Beliefs About Gender and Gender Identity scale. Participants stressed their heterosexual identity, but not their gender distinctiveness, when exposed to homophobic epithets, compared to category labels. Study 2 demonstrated that the relation between the homophobic label and the participants' heterosexual identity was mediated by how negatively they reacted to the antigay label. Heterosexual identity was enhanced in reaction to homophobic labels but not to an equally derogatory label referring to regional identity. Results are discussed within an intergroup framework.

AB  - Extensive work over the past decade has shown that race can bias perceptions and responses to threat. However, the previous work focused almost exclusively on responses to men and overlooked how gender and the interaction of race and gender influence decisions regarding use of force. In the current article, two studies examine the implications of gender (Study 1) and both race and gender (Study 2) for decisions to shoot criminal suspects on a computerized simulation. In Study 1, participants were biased away from shooting White female suspects compared to White male suspects. In Study 2, White participants showed a pronounced bias toward shooting Black men but a bias away from shooting Black women and White ingroup members, providing evidence of a behavioral threat-related response specific to outgroup men stereotypically associated with aggression. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Five experiments investigated the hypothesis that perspective taking-actively contemplating others' psychological experiences-attenuates automatic expressions of racial bias. Across the first 3 experiments, participants who adopted the perspective of a Black target in an initial context subsequently exhibited more positive automatic interracial evaluations, with changes in automatic evaluations mediating the effect of perspective taking on more deliberate interracial evaluations. Furthermore, unlike other bias-reduction strategies, the interracial positivity resulting from perspective taking was accompanied by increased salience of racial inequalities (Experiment 3). Perspective taking also produced stronger approach-oriented action tendencies toward Blacks (but not Whites; Experiment 4). A final experiment revealed that face-to-face interactions with perspective takers were rated more positively by Black interaction partners than were interactions with nonperspective takers-a relationship that was mediated by perspective takers' increased approach-oriented nonverbal behaviors (as rated by objective, third-party observers). These findings indicate that perspective taking can combat automatic expressions of racial biases without simultaneously decreasing sensitivity to ongoing racial disparities.

AB  - Unlike gender, race, or ethnicity, sexual orientation is not necessarily readily identifiable. The current work tests whether the timing of disclosure of sexual orientation influences reactions to intergroup interactions. Participants in two studies anticipated interacting with a partner for a study of first-time interactions. Prior to the interaction, they received information about the partner in the form of a prerecorded interview. During the interview the partner revealed his sexual orientation either early or late. Male participants whose partner disclosed as gay early in the interview responded with negative and avoidant responses to the upcoming interaction, formed more stereotypic impressions of the interaction partner, and reacted more aggressively toward the partner. Timing of disclosure by a straight partner did not influence responses. In addition, the negative responses toward the gay target who disclosed early were mediated by the stereotypicality of the impression the male participants formed of their interaction partner. These results suggest a primacy effect for group categorization such that greater levels of bias occur when group categorization occurs prior to the receipt of individuating information.

AB  - In this paper we explore the extent to which 'discursive deracialization', the removal of 'race' from potentially racially motivated arguments, is taking place in talk about asylum seeking. A discourse analysis is conducted on the part of a corpus of data collected from focus groups with undergraduate students talking about asylum seeking, in which they were asked if they considered it to be racist to oppose asylum. We show that speakers use three arguments for opposing asylum that are explicitly framed as non-racist: opposition is based on (1) economic reasons (2) religious grounds and the associated threat of terrorism and (3) the lack of asylum seekers' ability to integrate into British society. These findings are discussed with regard to the implications they have for our understanding of discursive deracialization in which it is shown that there is a common knowledge understanding, albeit one that needs qualifying, that opposition to asylum is not racist.

AB  - Previous research has shown that people use warmth and competence as basic dimensions to evaluate others and to interpret their behavior, but little research has examined the conditions under which low-warmth targets are liked. A series of 3 experiments involving 4 vignettes showed, in general, that low-warmth targets were better liked when they exhibited higher competence and that high-status persons displayed greater tolerance toward the low-warmth person of low status. Exceptions to these patterns were predicted and found as a function of the type of organizational context in which evaluations were made: groups that place priority on individual goals over common goals and groups that are performance oriented rather than relationship oriented. Target gender interacted with competence and relative status.

AB  - This article briefly describes how psychology, psychiatry, and the mental health professions (here collectively referred to as Psychology) treated sexual orientation differences as deficits for much of the 20th century, as well as some of the negative consequences that practice had for sexual minorities. The 1970s witnessed a remarkable turnaround when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the American Psychological Association called for psychologists to work to remove the stigma historically associated with homosexuality. This history illustrates not only how cultural institutions play a central role in legitimating stigma, but also how they can recognize their own complicity in this process and work effectively to undo its harmful effects. It is argued that Psychology still has an important role to play in challenging the differences-as-deficits model in contemporary policy debates.

AB  - In four studies, the authors explored factors contributing to negative attitudes and behavior toward Arab immigrants in the United States. In Study 1, Americans reported greater threat from Arabs, compared to other groups (e. g., Latino, Asian). In Study 2, they tested the effects of ingroup identification and group-level narcissism on attitudes toward Arab, Latino, Asian, and European immigrants. Identification interacted with group narcissism in predicting attitudes toward Arab (but not other) immigrants, such that identification predicted negative attitudes toward Arab immigrants only at mean and high levels of group narcissism. Study 3 explored the convergent and discriminant validity of the group narcissism construct. In Study 4, the authors added a behavioral dependent measure. Again, ingroup identification predicted negative behavior and attitudes toward an Arab immigrant group (but not comparison groups) only at mean and high levels of group narcissism. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - An Opposing Process Model outlining the pathways through which individual differences in Benevolent Sexism (BS) simultaneously enhance and attenuate support for gender equality of income and employment opportunity is presented. Results from a New Zealand electoral sample (N = 336) indicated that BS predicted Hostile Sexism (HS), and thus indirectly opposition toward gender-related policies (a hierarchy-enhancing effect). For women, BS also directly predicted attitudes toward gender equality in the opposing, supportive direction (a hierarchy-attenuating effect). Analyses of a 9-month longitudinal sample of undergraduate women substantiated these results (Study II; N = 170). In stable societies, the dual opposing effects of BS seem to form a system where hierarchy-enhancing and hierarchy-attenuating processes tend toward homeostasis or equilibrium within the population.

AB  - To understand how homophobia manifests itself through a Latino cultural lens of identity, a program was designed to address the issues connecting homosexual identity, culture, and Christianity. The program included screening of one of two documentary films about lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity and family relations. This was followed by group sharing and biblical reflections. Participants (N = 122) were asked to complete measures of homophobic attitudes and qualitative appraisal of the program. Pearson product moment correlations analyses revealed that age and political ideology were related negatively to homophobia. Eighty-five percent found the program to be very useful or useful and 95% indicated that they would recommend it to others. The complexities of the intersections of Christianity, culture, and attitudes toward homosexuality in an individual's identity were examined. The data illustrates a positive trend in changing attitudes towards homosexuality in the Latino Christian community.

AB  - This study explored the relations of gender and adult attachment styles to college students' scores on several measures of authoritarian attitudes (e. g., right-wing authoritarianism, ethnocentrism, homophobia, and religious fundamentalism). A multivariate analysis of authoritarian attitudes yielded significant main and interaction effects involving students' gender and their (categorical) attachment style scores. Relative to women, men reported higher levels of homophobia, ethnocentrism, and right-wing authoritarianism. Gender differences in homophobia were additionally conditioned by participants' adult attachment styles: Men with dismissing styles evidenced the highest levels of homophobia, whereas women with dismissing styles demonstrated the lowest levels; that is, a fear of intimacy seemed to contribute to homophobic attitudes found among heterosexual men. This was the first U. S. study of the relationship between adult attachment styles and right-wing authoritarianism, and further investigation is warranted.

AB  - Implicit preferences for Whites compared to Blacks can be reduced via exposure to admired Black and disliked White individuals (Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001). In four studies (total N = 4,628), while attempting to clarify the mechanism, we found that implicit preferences for Whites were weaker in the "positive Blacks" exposure condition compared to a control condition (weighted average d =.08). This effect was substantially smaller than the original demonstration (Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001; d =.82). Factors beyond exposure to admired Blacks may be necessary for the effect, such as making race accessible during exemplar exposure and including negative White exemplars. Our evidence suggests that exposure to known-group members shifts implicit race bias reliably, but weakly.

AB  - This research investigated whether people are biased against migrants partly because they find migrants more difficult to cognitively process than nonmigrants. In Study 1, 181 undergraduate students evaluated migrant and nonmigrant members of two minimal groups and reported the difficulty that they experienced in thinking about each type of target. Participants rated migrants less positively than nonmigrants, and difficulty ratings partially mediated this effect. Study 2 (N = 191) replicated these findings and demonstrated similar findings for individuals who had been excluded from minimal groups. This evidence implies that migrant bias can be explained partly in terms of the difficulty that people have in processing information about migrants, and that it is related to migrants' exclusion from their original group.

AB  - Indigenous communities and students have been marginalized by colonial practices, disproportionally referred to special education programs, and encounter systematic prejudice and discrimination in education systems that lack respect for their ways of knowing and being. To disrupt hierarchical practices and structures that enact a hidden curriculum of privilege and racism, reconciliation and educational and system transformation need to work in tandem. Drawing on critical case study guided by Indigenous Storywork principles, we are researching how Professional Learning Networks (PLNs) can support educators and Indigenous community partners' collaboration to decentre colonizing education practices. Analysis of preliminary data offers a window into the potential and complexity of engaging in decolonizing work that asks educators to unpack their role in reconciliation efforts and unlearn much of what they believed to be ethical practice. Findings include: participants awakening to structural inequities and racism; white/settler participants engaging with difficult knowledge; educators emphasizing their need for external resources to decolonize their practice; and a delicate balance between educators feeling challenged, feeling hopeful, and recognizing the distance yet to be travelled. This study demonstrates that collaboration with Indigenous community partners within education change networks (ECNs) holds potential to support pedagogical transformation and ultimately redefine student success.

AB  - Despite growing scientific attention for hate, little is known about how perceived threats may influence hate and aggression. In four preregistered online studies (N-total = 1422), we test a threat - hate - aggression model, examining the differential effects of symbolic and realistic threats on the emergence of hate, and the associations between hate and specific aggressive behaviors, across interpersonal and intergroup hate targets. In Study 1 we specify models testing the threat - hate - aggression paths. In Studies 2 (interpersonal hate) and 3 and 4 (intergroup hate) we manipulate realistic and symbolic threat perceptions, measuring hate and aggression. Across studies, hate is better predicted by symbolic than realistic threats. Also, hate consistently predicts aggressive tendencies and hurting behaviors, and interpersonal hate mediates the relationship between symbolic threats and the two aggressive behaviors while intergroup hate mediates the relationships between symbolic (and partially realistic) threats and the two aggressive behaviors. We discuss the implications of our findings for hate, threat, and prejudice research.

AB  - Racial discrimination typically expands under resource scarcity, but the psychological mechanisms driving this effect remain poorly understood. We examined the role of stereotypes in this effect, given their theorized function in asserting and maintaining existing group hierarchies, and hypothesized that stereotype expression would be heightened in response to scarcity, a signal of social instability. In Study 1, the manipulated perception of scarcity strengthened reported knowledge of stereotypes of Black Americans as low in socioeconomic status and as threatening, relative to control participants. In Study 2, perceived scarcity increased the stereotypicality of participants' visualizations of a Black male face, as assessed using a reverse correlation procedure and judged by independent raters. Study 3 replicated the effect of scarcity on stereotypic face visualizations and further demonstrated that scarcity increased anti-Black stereotypes even among individuals with relatively weak implicit stereotype associations. Together, these studies reveal that the mere perception of scarcity can increase stereotyping of Black Americans, as expressed in self-reports and implicit visualizations of Black faces. We discuss the potential role of stereotyping under scarcity as a means to justify racial discrimination and maintain power structures in response to systemic threat.

AB  - Speciesism, like other forms of prejudice, is thought to be underpinned by biased patterns of language use. Thus far, however, psychological science has primarily focused on how speciesism is reflected in individuals' thoughts as opposed to wider collective systems of meaning such as language. We present a large-scale quantitative test of speciesism by applying machine-learning methods (word embeddings) to billions of English words derived from conversation, film, books, and the Internet. We found evidence of anthropocentric speciesism: words denoting concern (vs. indifference) and value (vs. valueless) were more closely associated with words denoting humans compared to many other animals. We also found evidence of companion animal speciesism: the same words were more closely associated with words denoting companion animals compared to most other animals. The work describes speciesism as a pervasive collective phenomenon that is evident in a naturally occurring expression of human psychology - everyday language.

AB  - This research note addresses the current and potential future role of psychologists in the study of international migration. We review ways in which psychologists have contributed to the study of migration, as well as ways in which psychological scholarship could be integrated with work from other social science fields. Broadly, we discuss four major contributions that psychology brings to the study of international migration-studying migrants' internal psychological experiences, incorporating a developmental perspective, conducting experimental studies, and integrating across levels of analysis. Given the position of psychology as a 'hub science' connecting more traditional social sciences with health and medical sciences, we argue for a more prominent role for psychologists within the study of international migration. Such a role is intended to complement the roles of other social scientists and to create a more interdisciplinary way forward for the field of migration studies. The research note concludes with an agenda for further scholarship on migration.

AB  - We investigated the effect of health and environmental information messages on purchases of meat and plant-based alternatives in a non-hypothetical online supermarket experiment. When controlling for observables, we find the health information nudge to be effective at motivating meat eaters to purchase plant-based meat alternatives. This effect is absent when providing environmental information or its combination with health information. We also find that meat eaters implicitly perceive meat to be healthier but environmentally unsustainable compared to plant-based alternatives. Our findings provide insights as to how to steer consumers towards meat alternative purchases under different information types in an online supermarket.

AB  - Public Significance Statement These studies collectively reveal that deliberative thinking increases tolerance of contested practices in society, and this occurs regardless of whether people reflect on pragmatic or principled reasons for accepting such contested practices. Such an understanding provides us with a useful strategy for how to promote acceptance of differences in societies comprising cultural, religious, and ideological diversity.
   Tolerance of minority beliefs and practices is typically considered a critical ingredient for an equal and diverse society. Psychologically, people can use both intuitive and deliberative cognitive sources to make tolerance judgments. Following dual-process theories, this research uses survey experiments to manipulate intuitive versus deliberative thinking to examine whether deliberative thinking increases tolerance of minority practices. Across three studies using nationally representative samples of Dutch majority members (N = 1,811), we find that deliberative thinking increases tolerance, regardless of whether people deliberate over pragmatic or principled reasons for accepting contested minority practices and social changes. These findings are similar across a range of minority practices and robust across gender, age, educational level, and political orientation.

AB  - Women's empowerment is one of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 5, gender equality. However, little research has highlighted the contributions of sustainable female leadership in academic governance. In order to fill this gap, this study identifies and analyses the satisfactions, opportunities, and contributions of women academics to university governance and their perceptions of the potential impact of gender in this process. Forty-eight women leaders participated in the study. A purposive sampling technique was used because the research involved leaders who had held a management position in the university. The research methodology was qualitative, the instrument used for the collection of information was a semi-structured interview, and the analysis of the narratives was carried out with Aquad v. 7 software (Gunter Huber, Tubingen, Alemania). The study revealed that the leadership style of the female academics is framed within the sustainable leadership approach. Beyond personal satisfactions, the main reward derived from the performance of the position lies in becoming transformative and catalysing agents of the institution, who try to find a balance between the economic and social interests of the organisation. The functions these female academics perform, within the framework of sustainable development, have a technical and, at the same time, humanised vision, as they focus on people and on personal and social values. Gender issues have not been a determinant in the satisfactions, opportunities, and contributions that the leaders make to the institution; however, participants emphasise that this was a strength for leadership.

AB  - Bias is an inclination or preconceived outlook that favors toward or against an idea, person, or group. It manifests in implicit and explicit ways throughout all aspects and institutions of society. These cognitive shortcuts are often based on stereotypes and can lead to prejudice and discrimination in medicine as they mediate interactions with patients, between providers, and at the institutional level. It is important to understand the drivers and consequences of bias in order to overcome barriers to representation, equity, and inclusion. This paper provides definitions of bias; discusses its manifestations across academic medicine at the institutional and individual levels; and concludes by examining techniques to reduce bias and measure progress. Equity for patients, families, and members of the broader surgical community cannot be achieved without reducing bias and discrimination. We call for action to increase intentional efforts that reduce the influences of bias in healthcare, research, and education, particularly in the field of pediatric surgery. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Is art appreciation universal? Previous evidence suggests a general preference for representational art over abstract art, and a tendency to like art originating from one's own culture more than another culture (an ingroup bias), modulated by art expertise. However, claims about universality are difficult given that most research has focused on Western populations. Across two pre-registered and statistically powered experiments, we explore the role of culture and art expertise in the aesthetic evaluation of Indian and Western paintings and dance depicting both abstract and representational content, by inviting expert and art-naive Indian and Western participants to rate stimuli on beauty and liking. Results suggest an ingroup bias (for dance) and a preference for representational art (for paintings) exists, both modulated by art expertise. As predicted, the ingroup bias was present only in art-naive participants, and the preference for representational art was lower in art experts, but this modulation was present only in Western participants. The current findings have two main implications: (1) they inform and constrain understanding of universality of aesthetic appreciation, cautioning against generalising models of empirical aesthetics to non-western populations and across art forms, (2) they highlight the importance of art experience as a medium to counter prejudices.

AB  - Objectives Mindful attention deployment has been found to have practical benefits for a range of interpersonal outcomes including prosocial action and emotion. Recently, theory has posited that contemplative training that incorporates mindful attention may enhance intergroup compassion.
   Methods Here, we conduct a selective narrative review, drawing on the Buddhist concept skillful means to ask if mindful attention deployment presents an optimal starting point for intergroup compassion and action.
   Results An interdisciplinary theoretical framework is presented, which suggests that mindful attention dismantles common intrapsychic challenges to intergroup prosociality. Empirical research is described concerning cause and effect relationships between mindfulness and several outgrowths of intergroup prosociality. Specifically, mindfulness promotes basic social cognitive processes that allow intergroup prosociality to flourish.
   Conclusions While this research is promising, to date, the science on this topic has been limited to individual-level outgrowths of mindfulness practice. Discussion focuses on the future of mindfulness research in intergroup prosociality and calls for an integrative approach situating mindful attention deployment within social (and other) psychological interventions to enhance intergroup compassion.

AB  - Introduction Studies emphasize that the time elapsed between self-awareness of one's sexual orientation and its disclosure to others (disclosure gap) can be an indicator of psychosocial adjustment of sexual minorities. Methods This study examined the coming out experiences and disclosure gap of three generations of sexual minority men: adults, 25-39 years; middle-aged, 40-59 years; and seniors, 60 or more years. A sample of 274 cisgender men was recruited, with ages ranging from 25 to 79 years. Data was collected between 2018 and 2019. Results Although most men had disclosed their sexual orientation to significant others, there was a wide variation on the coming out timing and experiences across the three age cohorts. Senior sexual minority men realized and disclosed their sexual orientation later than middle-aged men, while the latter realized and disclosed later than their younger counterparts. The disclosure gap followed a similar trend increasing with age. Regression analyses revealed that high levels of self-stigma explained a larger disclosure gap among the middle-aged, whereas low community connectedness explained a larger disclosure gap among seniors. No significant predictors emerged among adults. Conclusions Overall coming out experiences worsened with age, with the older cohort reporting realizing and disclosing their sexual orientation later in life, taking longer to come out after identifying as sexual minorities, and feeling less accepted by others after coming out. Policy Implications This study highlighted some of the social factors that may improve sexual minority's psychosocial well-being and possibly counterbalance the negative effects of stigma, namely, connection to the LGBT community.

AB  - This article reveals the characteristics and demographics of non-Muslim Australians who express levels of anger towards Muslims and Islam. Using data from a 2018 national social survey of a random, stratified sample of Australians, we identify key demographic characteristics amongst those expressing above-average degrees of anger towards Muslims and the religion of Islam, separately. We identify the proportion of different typologies of people who hold anger towards Islam and Muslims. We aim to establish which combinations of demographic and personal characteristics are most strongly associated with the expression of anger so that policy and interventions targeted at reducing this emotion might be effectively directed. We draw on the literature about Muslimophobia and Islamophobia, along with key studies that have examined attitudes towards Islam and Muslims in Australia and elsewhere. Our findings are relevant to organisations and government bodies in Australia, with implications for policy and social cohesion programs.

AB  - Racism is hardly discussed in Spanish public debates: however, when approached through policy, it is generally understood either as violent acts committed by extremists, or as a matter of stereotypes/prejudices/lack of information about cultural Others. This article focuses on the latter understanding, as performed by Spanish "anti-rumour" strategies, a varied ensemble of initiatives aimed at dismantling stereotypes of migrants and racial minorities, mainly by encouraging better knowledge and empathy. By approaching these initiatives as a representative case of mainstream, psychology-based perspectives on anti-racism and drawing on fieldwork conducted in relevant Spanish locations, I focus on their main assumptions and theoretical/political implications. Despite the heterogeneity of such initiatives, the fieldwork analysis points to common flaws; particularly in the ways their "positive" narratives and allegedly inclusive approaches might foster narrow definitions of racism, silencing its institutional/structural/governmental dimensions and potentially normalizing racist power relations.

AB  - Understanding the social dynamics of public opposition to religious symbols is a pressing issue. This research finds that stereotypes of how committed group members are to the national community shape support for the right to wear religious symbols in various settings. These social perceptions are particularly influential in determining support for the rights of Muslims to wear religious symbols. Drawing on data from a national survey experiment (N = 974) conducted in Canada, the results show Christians benefit from a particularly strong perceived commitment to the nation, while religious minorities are stereotyped as less committed and identified to the country than the average Canadian. As the perceived national commitment of religious minorities increases, however, the gap in support shown for the rights of Christians over religious minorities disappears and may lead to particularly strong support for the rights of Muslims to wear religious symbols in public when perceptions of national commitment are high.

AB  - Sociological researchers have made immense strides in understanding systemic racism, privilege, and bias against Black people. Relational frame theory provides a contemporary account of human language and cognition that intersects within complex external contingency systems that may provide a provisionally adequate model of racial bias and racism. We propose a reticulated model that includes nested relational frames and external contingency systems that operate at the level of the individual (implicit), communities (white privilege), and system policies (systemic racism). This approach is organized from within the framework of critical race theory as an area of sociological scholarship that captures racial disadvantages at multiple levels of organization. We extend this model by describing avenues for future research to inform anti-racism strategies to dismantle this complex and pervasive sociobehavioral phenomenon. At all levels, police violence against the Black community is provided as a case example of negative social impact of racism in our society.

AB  - Accumulated findings from studies in which implicit-bias measures correlate with discriminatory judgment and behavior have led many social scientists to conclude that implicit biases play a causal role in racial and other discrimination. In turn, that belief has promoted and sustained two lines of work to develop remedies: (a) individual treatment interventions expected to weaken or eradicate implicit biases and (b) group-administered training programs to overcome biases generally, including implicit biases. Our review of research on these two types of sought remedies finds that they lack established methods that durably diminish implicit biases and have not reproducibly reduced discriminatory consequences of implicit (or other) biases. That disappointing conclusion prompted our turn to strategies based on methods that have been successful in the domain of public health. Preventive measures are designed to disable the path from implicit biases to discriminatory outcomes. Disparity-finding methods aim to discover disparities that sometimes have obvious fixes, or that at least suggest where responsibility should reside for developing a fix. Disparity-finding methods have the advantage of being useful in remediation not only for implicit biases but also systemic biases. For both of these categories of bias, causes of discriminatory outcomes are understood as residing in large part outside the conscious awareness of individual actors. We conclude with recommendations to guide organizations that wish to deal with biases for which they have not yet found solutions.

AB  - This paper investigates volatility spillovers between the global crude oil market and the stock markets of the global oil stock markets (Russian, Canada, China, Kuwait, and the USA) pre and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We use wavelet Granger causality methods to study the volatility spillovers between global oil stock markets, mainly from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. Our Results (1) shows that WTI and Brent oil prices had a negative mean return before COVID-19 but a positive mean return during the pandemic spread. Other Results (2) find the positive, significantly lowest, and highest frequency during the COVID-19 outbreak for all selected countries. The results also show that the link between oil WTI & Brent prices and stock markets return in the lowest (33-66 days) and highest frequency range (4-16) before the Covid-19 epidemic, especially in the first quarter of 2020. Before the COVID-19 period, the Russian oil stock market is seriously prejudiced with oil prices on a modest scale, but not after the pandemic's start. This study also perceives direction opposite between the COVID-19 period. The Canadian and United States America oil and stock markets influence the lowest scale in the previous COVID-19 sample for the U.S. market. Moreover, this paper exposed that oil marketing highest oil futures in their portfolios than stock shares for all times. We found that oil price shocks had a more significant impact on the stock markets of the United States and Canada than on the stock markets of other countries.

AB  - The current study uses data from The British Broadcasting Corporation Loneliness Experiment to explore the social stigma of loneliness and how it varies by gender, age and cultural individualism. We examined stigmatizing judgements of people who are lonely (impressions of those who feel lonely and attributions for loneliness), perceived stigma in the community and self-stigma (shame for being lonely and inclination to conceal loneliness), while controlling for participants' own feelings of loneliness. The scores on most measures fell near the mid-point of the scales, but stigmatizing perceptions depended on the measure of stigmatization that was used and on age, gender and country-level individualism. Multilevel analyses revealed that men had more stigmatizing perceptions, more perceived community stigma, but less self-stigma than women; young people had higher scores than older people on all indicators except for internal versus external attributions and people living in collectivist countries perceived loneliness as more controllable and perceived more stigma in the community than people living in individualistic countries. Finally, young men living in individualistic countries made the most internal (vs. external) attributions for loneliness. We discuss the implications of these findings for understandings of loneliness stigma and interventions to address loneliness.

AB  - Drawing from recent work on "otherness" and social boundaries in America, we investigate anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish opinion among white Americans. After outlining the logic of the comparison, we use nationally representative data to analyze these forms of othering. Although anti-Muslim opinion is more extensive, the two track together empirically and share a cultural logic as connected forms of ethno-religious boundary-making. Latent class analysis shows that anti-Semitism is nested within anti-Muslim attitudes, with political and religious identifications as consistent predictors of opinion. We conclude with a reflection on politicized boundary-making and the relationship between extreme and mainstream views of the "other."

AB  - Although personal intergroup contact is known to predict positive intergroup outcomes, little is known about the kind of positive personal contact that reduces prejudice in real-world post-conflict societies. Using a behavioural experiment, the present study examined the effect of face-to-face personal contact between three groups of ex-combatants (national army, former national army and armed group) and civilians with disabilities in Rwanda. A total of 444 participants were randomly assigned to intergroup or intragroup pairs under high and low personalisation conditions, and their person preference, evaluative bias and impressions of contact partners were compared to those who had contact without personalisation. Between ex-combatants of the national army and civilians, low personalisation generally resulted in better intergroup outcomes than high personalisation or no personalisation. The trend is reversed for personalisation between the three groups of ex-combatants, who are former adversaries. Implications for personal contact in real-world post-conflict societies are discussed.

AB  - Objective Using theories of group threat and research on the political dynamics of gun ownership, this article examines two research questions: To what extent does the political affiliation of the president of the United States shape gun ownership? Moreover, how does the president of the United States' political affiliation intersect with individuals' political alignments to impact gun ownership patterns? Methods This study utilizes repeated cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (1980-2018). Specifically, it uses logistic regression to examine the intersection of the political affiliation of the U.S. president in a given survey year and respondents' individual political identities. Results Although there is no independent effect of the president's political affiliation on gun ownership, the results indicate there is an increase in reported gun ownership among Republicans when a Democrat was in office. A similar increase is observed for Democrats when a Republican is in office. Conclusion These results demonstrate the linked macro-micro dynamics of gun ownership, specifically for political contexts.

AB  - In recent years, Europe witnessed several terrorist attacks by Islamist terrorists. To date, crucial questions are whether and how such events influence the European public's resistance towards Muslims, and if such influence depends on the level of intergroup competition, both at the contextual and individual level. Using the European Social Survey (ESS7), we were able to compare respondents interviewed shortly before and after the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015. While we found no support for a moderating role of intergroup competition, our study shows that the levels of resistance towards Muslim immigrants were higher shortly after the attacks in Ireland and Czech Republic, however, lower in France. For Austria, Finland and Germany we found no influence. Our findings indicate that one cannot be too careful with generalizing conclusions from single countries.

AB  - Background: Sexism results in a number of attitudes and behaviors that contribute to gender inequalities in social structure and interpersonal relationships. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Lights4Violence, an intervention program based on promoting health assets to reduce sexist attitudes in young European people.
   Methods: We carried out a quasi-experimental study in a non-probabilistic population of 1146 students, aged 12-17 years. The dependent variables were the difference in the wave 1 and wave 2 values in the subscales of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: benevolent sexism (BS) and hostile sexism (HS). The effect of the intervention was evaluated through linear regression analyses stratified by sex. The models were adjusted by baseline subscales scores, socio-demographic and psychological variables.
   Results: In girls, we observed a decrease in BS in the intervention group compared to the control group (beta= - 0.101; p = 0.006). In the wave2 BS decreased more in the intervention group compared to the control group in girls with mothers with a low level of education (beta=-0.338; p= 0.001), with a high level of social support (beta= - 0.251; p < 0.001), with greater capacity for conflict resolution (beta= - 0.201; p < 0.001) and lower levels of aggressiveness (beta= - 0.232, p < 0.001). In boys, the mean levels of HS and BH decreased in wave 2 in both the control and intervention groups. The changes observed after the wave 2 were the same in the control group and in the intervention group. No significant differences were identified between both groups.
   Conclusions: The implementation of the Lights4Violence was associated with a significant reduction in BS in girls, which highlights the potential of interventions aimed at supporting the personal competencies and social support. It is necessary to reinforce the inclusion of educational contents that promote reflection among boys about the role of gender and the meaning of the attributes of masculinity.

AB  - Objectives Bridging the power-relation framework with prejudice and bias studies, this study examines how individuals perceive and construct racial hate crimes. Methods This study employs a factorial survey experiment with randomized vignette assignments to obtain insights into respondents' judgment principles. Participants (N = 2635) were recruited through Mechanical Turk and were asked to read a fictional scenario that could be considered a racial hate crime. Logistic regression models are estimated, followed by moderation analyses and margins tests. Results The results support an integrated model that both the power dynamics between the victims and the offenders and the prejudice and beliefs of the respondents play significant roles in perceiving a racial hate crime. Conclusions This study finds empirical evidence to establish a link between the status of incidents, respondents' prejudice, and the perception of racial hate crimes. Future research will benefit from expanding the examination to other minority groups as well as to other bias motives.

AB  - Mistrust is a common cause of conflict between individuals belonging to different identity groups. When can such mistrust be overcome? We present a theoretical model of trust-building across social identity groups to address this question. Trust between groups increases when individuals in one group are willing to take a chance on engaging with members of the other group, their engagement is positively reciprocated, and they are able to credibly communicate the experience to their fellow group members, thereby increasing their belief that members of the other group are trustworthy. This process is made easier if the individuals are not too hostile to the out-group, are flexible enough to change their beliefs in response to new information, and are sufficiently attached to their own group to be honest about their experiences with out-group members.

AB  - Confrontation is an important mechanism to reduce racial prejudice. Yet, little research has examined White adults' intended confrontation within the context of discriminatory policies that pose barriers to Black Americans seeking employment. Moreover, less research has investigated reactions to zero-sum and negative-sum anti-Black institutional discrimination. The present study investigated the effects of an antiracism educational exercise on White adults' intended confrontation of zero-sum and negative-sum institutional discrimination. Participants aged 20-85 years (n = 195; M-age = 54.16) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) antiracism education with writing reflection, (2) antiracism education alone, or (3) a control condition. Participants then reported how they would respond in situations that described zero-sum (i.e., new hire recruitment exclusively from predominantly White institutions) and negative-sum anti-Black institutional discrimination (i.e., hairstyle discrimination). Participants in the antiracism education alone condition intended to confront more assertively in both scenarios compared to participants in the control condition. Across conditions, participants were more likely to intend to confront, and intended to confront more assertively, in the zero-sum discrimination scenario than the negative-sum discrimination scenario. We conclude that a brief antiracism education exercise may hold promise for increasing White adults' assertive confrontation of institutional discrimination, but the effects may be contingent on whether a reflective writing task is included and the characteristics of the discriminatory policy.

AB  - The demographic data and projections show that the world is ageing at a high pace and that this has transversal consequences to society. The available data on ageism show that it constitutes the most prevalent form of discrimination in Europe. Whilst this seems logical because ageism, potentially, affects everybody (unlike sexism or racism), public debates on the phenomenon are rare. The awareness of people of its importance is minimal, the resources and investigation devoted to understanding it are relatively small and the initiatives towards combating ageism are not enough. There is a mismatch between the dimension of the phenomenon and the attention that we have given it. Ageism has various negative consequences for the older adults themselves; for the institutions at large (but especially for the working world institutions) and for countries. In a fast-ageing world that will witness structural changes in age groups, ageism is a complex phenomenon that needs to be counteracted. So far, in Europe, combating ageism through law and public policy seems to have produced poor results. However, the literature shows that adult education and learning can provide very effective means to improve the mutual knowledge between generations, combat myths and prejudice and deconstruct age-based stereotypes.

AB  - This article describes lived experiences of successful women leaders in government administration organizations in India. The analysis of women's experiences revealed the enablers and deterrents faced by these women in their leadership trajectories. These factors are categorized as an individual: family background and childhood experiences, self-aspiration and leadership development and work-life balance and familial support or organizational viz. workplace and sociocultural challenges and success mantras. A combination of them has influenced the progression of these women. The results present the need for a massive social change initiated by human service organizations to shift the so-called patriarchal social system. The paper has identified various dimensions like prioritizing promoting diversity, mentoring, and redesign of human resource policies which need to be focused. Also, the organizations and government can use these findings to design development programs for realistically promoting more women to higher positions.

AB  - Purpose This article examines ways COVID-19 health surveillance and algorithmic decision-making ("ADM") are creating and exacerbating workplace inequalities that impact post-treatment cancer survivors. Cancer survivors' ability to exercise their right to work often is limited by prejudice and health concerns. While cancer survivors can ostensibly elect not to disclose to their employers when they are receiving treatments or if they have a history of treatment, the use of ADM increases the chances that employers will learn of their situation regardless of their preferences. Moreover, absent significant change, inequalities may persist or even expand. Methods We analyze how COVID-19 health surveillance is creating an unprecedented amount of health data on all people. These data are increasingly collected and used by employers as part of COVID-19 regulatory interventions. Results The increase in data, combined with the health and economic crisis, means algorithm-driven health inequalities will be experienced by a larger percentage of the population. Post-treatment cancer survivors, as for people with disabilities generally, are at greater risk of experiencing negative outcomes from algorithmic health discrimination. Conclusions Updated and revised workplace policy and practice requirements, as well as collaboration across impacted groups, are critical in helping to control the inequalities that flow from the interaction between COVID-19, ADM, and the experience of cancer survivorship in the workplace. Implications for Cancer Survivors The interaction among COVID-19, health surveillance, and ADM increases exposure to algorithmic health discrimination in the workplace.

AB  - Gender stereotypes play a potent role in how the work of men and women is perceived and valued. Stereotypes also influence the way people look upon themselves. In the present research, two studies are reported where men and women at work rated the degree of warmth and competence of a person with their own occupation, and how they think people in general would perceive a person in the same occupation. A wider gap between own perceptions and that of people in general was expected for women than for men, as it was assumed that the view of other people's perceptions would serve as a proxy for stereotype threat for women. Study 1 comprised 449 participants (74 % women) working within the public sector, mainly in social, caring, and education professions, and Study 2 comprised a convenience sample of 189 participants (70 % women) from a variety of sectors and professions. Both studies yielded consistent results; contradictory to what was expected, men and women did not differ in terms of how they thought people in general would perceive the competence of their occupation, instead women rated the competence of their own occupation higher than men did, even after controlling for type of occupation and educational level. Warmth displayed only minor gender differences. The results are discussed in relation to research on counter-reactions against stereotype threat, how the concept of competence could be understood, as well as other possible explanations of the unexpected results.

AB  - This article analyzes the relationship between the relative position of an ethnic group, as measured by its majority/minority status at a subnational level, and attitudes of its members toward immigrants of different origins. Based on the Russian case, it addresses the question whether the effects of in-group majority status within a region on attitudes toward the general category of immigrants hold regardless of out-group origin and, if not, what may drive this variation. Using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the Higher School of Economics and Bayesian hierarchical structural equation modeling, the study demonstrates that the relative position of an ethnic in-group is of varying importance as a predictor of attitudes toward migrant groups of European versus non-European origin in Russia. A group's majority status within a region proved to play a role in predicting attitudes toward migrants originating from the "south" (encompassing North and South Caucasus; Central Asia; and China, Vietnam, and Korea) but not toward migrants coming from the "west" (Ukraine and Moldova). We draw on arguments related to the source and the level of threat induced by the out-groups, ethnic hierarchies, and group cues to explain this pattern of results.

AB  - Eliminating racism, specifically anti-Black racism, requires systematic organizational change at every level (e.g., structural, policy, interpersonal, and personal) with attunement to the intersections within and between each of these levels. In this article we will present advances from the fields of counseling and social psychology regarding approaches to disrupting racism and will suggest ways that these strategies might be applied to the child welfare field. Literature in both fields explicates general and specific strategies aimed at the interpersonal and personal levels that those working in child welfare agencies can integrate into organizational policy and practices in order to create a more just, anti-racist system.

Besides some criticisms and reasonable doubts, he points out that the previous articles present a somewhat lopsided view with prejudice when the scholars interpret the existing literature. He further explores the underlying implications of the archaeological materials based on studying large numbers of references. In this way, reliable conclusions are obtained with rigorous academic attitude.

AB  - The article studies over-time changes in public attitudes towards asylum seekers, from a cross-national comparative perspective. The article applies the 'hierarchical age-period-cohort' model to data from the European Social Survey collected in 17 European countries. The findings demonstrate that cross-cohort variations play a negligible role in the over-time changes in attitudes towards asylum seekers in Europe; and that most of these over-time changes can be attributed to period-related effect. The main findings reveal that not only exposure to an actual high inflow of asylum seekers (i.e. living in a country with an especially high inflow of asylum seekers) is associated with exclusionary attitudes towards asylum seekers, but also exposure to the potential of such an inflow (i.e. living in a country bordering countries with a high inflow of asylum seekers).

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual (LGB+) individuals have disproportionate rates of mental illness. Minority stress and sexual identity stigma are posited as the primary social determinants of LGB+ mental health disparities. Discussions in the literature have questioned the impact of sexual identity stigma in a world increasingly accepting of sexual minorities. Additionally, the LGB+ population in the United States South is often overlooked in American research. This article details a qualitative study exploring experiences related to sexual identity stigma among adults who identify as LGB+ in the United States South. Semi-structured interviews with 16 individuals were analyzed using content analysis. Six thematic categories of stigma emerged from participants' experiences: (a) navigating an LGB+ identity, (b) social acceptability of an LGB+ identity, (c) expectation of LGB+ stigma, (d) interpersonal discrimination and harassment, (e) structural stigma, and (f) relationship with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community. Findings suggest that sexual identity stigma remains a common experience among these Southern United States participants. Further, thematic categories and subcategories primarily aligned with extant theory with one exception: Intracommunity stigma, a form of stigma emanating from the LGBTQ community, emerged as a stigma type not currently accounted for in theoretical foundations underpinning mental health disparities in this population.

AB  - Introduction
   European societies are rapidly becoming multicultural. Cultural diversity presents new challenges and opportunities to communities that receive immigrants and migrants, and highlights the need for culturally safe healthcare. Universities share a responsibility to build a fair and equitable society by integrating cultural content in the nursing curricula. This paper aims to analyze European student nurses experience of learning cultural competence and of working with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds.
   Materials and methods
   A phenomenological approach was selected through a qualitative research method. 7 semi-structured focus groups with 5-7 students took place at the participants' respective universities in Spain, Belgium, Turkey and Portugal.
   Results
   5 themes and 16 subthemes emerged from thematic analysis. Theme 1, concept of culture/cultural diversity, describes the participants' concept of culture; ethnocentricity emerged as a frequent element in the students' discourse. Theme 2, personal awareness, integrates the students' self-perception of cultural competence and their learning needs. Theme 3, impact of culture, delves on the participants' perceived impact of cultural on both nursing care and patient outcomes. Theme 4, learning cultural competence, integrates the participants' learning experiences as part of their nursing curricula, as part of other academic learning opportunities and as part of extra-academic activities. Theme 5, learning cultural competence during practice placements, addresses some important issues including witnessing unequal care, racism, prejudice and conflict, communication and language barriers, tools and resources and positive attitudes and behaviors witnesses or displayed during clinical practice.
   Conclusion
   The participants' perceived level of cultural competence was variable. All the participants agreed that transcultural nursing content should be integrated in the nursing curricula, and suggested different strategies to improve their knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is important to listen to the students and take their opinion into account when designing cultural teaching and learning activities.

AB  - Education affects individual values and beliefs, mitigates prejudices and enhances open-mindedness. Additionally, education has been shown to affect cultural traits like trust and respect in societies. Building on this literature and employing an extensive individual-level cross country data from World Value Survey (WVS), we explore the role of educational attainment and cultural traits in shaping attitudes towards abortion. Our results show that higher educational attainment is associated with stronger justification of abortion as a choice. We also show that cultural traits like trust and respect enhance the association between educational attainment and attitudes towards abortion. Obedience, however, erodes the impact of educational attainment on the individual justification for abortion. Our results are robust to a wide array of controls as well as estimates taking into bias arising out of simultaneous sample selection.

AB  - Internalized homonegativity results from the acceptance of negative attitudes about one's same-sex orientation, which has negative consequences for the health of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). We translated the 7-item Reactions to Homosexuality Scale (RHS) to Brazilian Portuguese and assessed its factor structure, validity and reliability. The first step included the translation, back-translation, evaluation, peer review, and pre-testing of the scale. Then, we piloted the scale in two convenience samples of adult Brazilians recruited online during October 2019 and February to March 2020 through advertisements on Grindr and Hornet, respectively. The largest sample was randomly split into two groups for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Criterion and construct validity were assessed via correlations between scale scores and study variables. A total of 5573 GBM (sample 1: 218; sample 2: 5355) completed the RHS. EFA (N = 2652) yielded two eigenvalues greater than one (Factor 1: 3.5 and Factor 2: 1.1). A one-factor solution provided the most interpretable model based on examination of scree plot and item factor loadings (chi 2(14) = 1373.1, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.89; TLI = 0.84; RMSEA = 0.19; SRMS = 0.09). Though one-factor CFA showed moderate fit, freeing errors terms to covary, based on item content and interpretation, significantly improved model fit (chi 2(12) = 309.1, p < .001; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.09; SRMR = 0.02). As hypothesized, men who did not self-identify as gay (mean score 17.9 compared to those self-identifying as gay: 11.8) and men who reported no sex with men in the past 6 months (mean score 12.6 compared to those who reported sex with men: 10.6) scored higher reflecting higher internalized homonegativity. The RHS was effectively translated and validated in Brazilian Portuguese and can be used to evaluate the role of internalized homonegativity on GBM's health, as well as its impact on the uptake of HIV prevention technologies.

AB  - European citizenship consisting of equal economic, social and political rights for all EU citizens has come under pressure in recent years due to the different crises the EU had to face. Based on a survey conducted in 13 EU member states we examined to what extent EU citizens support the notion that citizens from other European countries should enjoy the same rights as nationals. Overall, 56% of EU citizens support the idea that citizens from other EU member states (EU migrants) and national citizens shall be treated equally. In addition, we find remarkable variation between the countries. Multivariate analyses indicate that cultural factors on the individual and the country level have a strong impact on attitudes towards Europeanized equality, whereas structural factors that are related to individuals' and a countries' socioeconomic position are only of minor importance.

AB  - Traditional gender beliefs and gender prejudice (sexism) are thought to play a key role in the reproduction of gender inequality. It is known that such traditional gender beliefs are more common among strongly religious people. Europe is facing a growing population of religious, often immigrant youth from Islamic countries such as Turkey and Morocco. Against that background, we investigate how ambivalent sexism is related to adolescents' religious affiliation (being Christian or Muslim), religiosity (how important religion is in one's life), perceived pressure for religious conformity and ethnic background (native, Turkish, Moroccan) by performing multivariate multilevel regression analyses. We rely on data from two independent samples gathered in 2013 and 2018 by the Youth Research Platform among Dutch-speaking boys (N = 1637) and girls (N = 2058) between 14 and 18 years old. The results show the gendered ways in which religion and ambivalent sexism towards women are related. For girls, ambivalent sexism was related to perceived pressure for religious conformity and ethnic background (more group-level aspects). Boys' ambivalent sexism was related to more individual-level aspects such as higher religiosity. No differences were found between Muslim or Christian youth.

AB  - Racially and ethnically minoritised healthcare staff groups disproportionately experience and witness workplace discrimination from patients, colleagues and managers. This is visible in their under-representation at senior levels and over-representation in disciplinary proceedings and is associated with adversities such as greater depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, low job satisfaction and sickness absence. In the UK, little progress has been made despite the implementation of measures to tackle racialised inequities in the health services. So, what is it about the health service organisational context which shapes and maintains such inequities, and what role does discrimination, bullying and harassment play? Drawing on qualitative interviews with 48 healthcare staff in London (UK), we identify how micro-level bullying, prejudice, discrimination and harassment behaviours, independently and in combination, exploit and maintain meso-level racialised hierarchies. Within teams, the high diversity-low inclusion dynamic shaped and was perpetuated by in- and outgroup inclusion and exclusion processes (including "insidious dismissal") often employing bullying or microaggressions. These were linked to intersecting factors, such as race, ethnicity, migration, language and religion, and could increase segregation. For racially and ethnically minoritised groups, ingroup maintenance, moving teams or leaving were also ways of coping with organisational inequities. We discuss implications for tackling racialised workplace inequities.

AB  - Sex trafficking is an abhorrent crime in our contemporary times. Malaysia is currently both a transit and destination country, where women from different countries are trafficked in and out of Malaysia for sex purposes. This article focuses specifically on the trafficking of Vietnamese women into Malaysia. We, the researchers of this paper, interviewed a group of 10 Vietnamese women who were caught in a single police raid at an illegal 'gambling center' and placed in a women's shelter in Kuala Lumpur. While this article explores the tragedy of sex trafficking and the plight of trafficked victims, it also focuses on the politics of the body of the trafficked woman, discussing how the female body has been abused and condemned through manipulation and oppression. This article also reveals how systems of oppression, namely patriarchal cultural practices and gendered discrimination, have helped form a prejudice and suppression of Vietnamese women. Ketu Katrak and Elleke Boehmer's discussions on the politics of the female body construct the basis of this article's theoretical framework. At the same time, the literary approach of 'lived narratives' offers a unique blend of multiple disciplines of study, including literature, sociology, gender, and politics, to discuss sex trafficking in Malaysia. Overall, this article provides a glimpse into the complex dynamics of sex trafficking in Malaysia.

AB  - The attitudes of medical students toward transgender people have important implications for the future quality of healthcare for Caribbean transgender patients. This paper examined the attitudes and beliefs of Caribbean medical students toward transgender people, provides psychometric evaluation of a promising instrument, and considers implications for the development of transgender curricula in Caribbean medical education. Medical students (N = 205; 155 women, 43 men, 7 unstated) enrolled at a publicly supported Caribbean university completed the Transgender Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (TABS; Kanamori et al., 2017). Internal consistency was strong for the total TABS (alpha = .93) and more variable for the three subscales: interpersonal comfort (IC: alpha = .91), sex/gender beliefs (SGB: alpha = .89), and human value (HV: alpha = .74). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated acceptable overall fit for the three-factor model. There were no significant gender differences in overall attitudes toward transgender people as measured by the total TABS score; women reported higher IC scores. Scores were not correlated with age or with year in medical school. Students reported significantly more tolerant attitudes on the HV scale than on IC or SGB scales. Psychometric findings establish measurement invariance and provide support for further use of the TABS in the Caribbean. We discuss implications for medical curriculum development, including use of the TABS as a tool for medical students to reflect on their individual attitudes and beliefs regarding transgender people.

AB  - Introduction Lesbian women experience situations of discrimination and prejudice that require them to constantly negotiate the disclosure of their sexual orientation. The quality of this negotiation can post either a positive or negative effect on their mental health. Methods The present study aimed to characterize outness profiles in lesbian women. Profile differences were verified according to sociodemographic as well as health care access data. An anonymous self-applicable instrument was used to perform an online study in the year of 2019 with 1146 women who self-identified as lesbian and that lived in Brazil in the year before data collection. Participants responded instruments concerning sociodemographic and health care access data, internalized homophobia, general outness, and distress levels. Results Through cluster analytic method, four outness profiles were identified: Functional Outness (n = 328; 28,62%), Functional Concealment (n = 273; 23,83%), Dysfunctional Outness (n = 385; 33,60%), and Dysfunctional Concealment (n = 160, 13,96%). Functionality was determined by low levels of distress. Differences were observed among cluster groups with regard to their socio-demographic and health care access data. Conclusion It is argued that the differences (sociodemographic as well as health care access data) observed among the four cluster groups interfere in the way lesbian women negotiate disclosure which, in turn, alters the effect of outness and internalized homophobia in their mental health. Policy Implications Brazilian studies involving outness especially in lesbian women are incipient. Health professionals need to be aware of the influence of outness in the health care of lesbian women. This awareness should be introduced in academic formation and endorsed through professional updating.

AB  - How does an increased presence of immigrants in the workplace affect anti-immigration voting behavior? While cooperative interactions between natives and immigrants can reduce intergroup prejudice, immigrant coworkers might be regarded as a threat to native-born workers' labor market position. We combine detailed Swedish workplace data with precinct-level election outcomes for a large anti-immigration party (the Sweden Democrats) to study how the share of non-Europeans in the workplace affects opposition to immigration. We show that the share of non-Europeans in the workplace has a negative effect on support for the Sweden Democrats and that this effect is solely driven by same-skill contact in small workplaces. We interpret these results as supporting the so-called contact hypothesis: that increased interactions with minorities can reduce opposition to immigration among native-born voters, which, in turn, leads to lower support for anti-immigration parties.

AB  - Social status is highly consequential in organizations but remains elusive for many professional women. Status characteristics theory argues that women are particularly status disadvantaged in masculine organizational cultures. These types of cultures valorize traits and abilities stereotypically associated with men, making it difficult for women in these settings to be seen as skilled and gain status. In the present study, we build and test novel theory explaining when and why masculine organizational cultures create the conditions for some women-those willing and able to skillfully navigate the espoused norms-to disproportionately gain status. We introduce and define the construct of a sexist culture of joviality, a type of masculine organizational culture representing the intersection of sexism and joviality that emerged inductively from our initial qualitative data. A sexist culture of joviality is characterized by norms promoting frequent sexist joking and teasing, along with underlying values and assumptions that support these sexist jovial behaviors. In a longitudinal mixed-methods field study, we demonstrate that participation in a sexist culture of joviality via engagement in sexist jovial norms is positively related to status for women but negatively related to status for men. In a follow-up experiment, we replicate this effect and demonstrate that differential perceptions of social skill mediate this interaction. Our findings illuminate the subtle ways sexism is perpetuated in organizations despite changing societal norms, underscoring the importance of disrupting these dynamics and revealing insights into how to do so.

AB  - How does interethnic marriage influence the occurrence of ethnic violence in sub-Saharan Africa? Previous studies on the relationship between intergroup contact and conflict onset have produced mixed findings. Some scholars have argued that this might be due to the way interethnic contact is measured. Building on insights of social psychology, this study examines the influence of interethnic marriage as the ultimate form of positive intergroup contact. In doing so, we combine information of the Demographic and Health Surveys with event data on ethnic conflict. Our analysis shows that areas with higher levels of exogamy significantly experience less ethnic conflict.

AB  - Forgiveness helps repair ruptured relationships and maintain cooperation. It may most usefully serve these functions when it is preferentially directed toward better cooperators. We examined this proposal in two studies with young children. Study 1 asked whether children forgive in-group members (whom people generally expect to be more cooperative) more than out-group members. When a novel in-group member and out-group member both transgressed against the child and both showed remorse, 5-year-old children (N = 20) were more forgiving of the in-group member. In Study 2, when only the out-group transgressor was remorseful whereas the in-group transgressor was unremorseful (and did not demonstrate cooperative intent), 5-year-olds (N = 20) were more forgiving of the remorseful out-group transgressor. Children also judged the unremorseful in-group transgressor negatively and wanted her to leave their group. Together, these results reveal that from early in life, forgiveness is preferentially directed so as to maximize successful cooperation while reducing the risk of exploitation.

AB  - Increased attention to gendered violence has led to a burgeoning of different community-based programmes designed to support men and boys to adopt more inclusive and respectful masculinities. Accompanying this attention has been a proliferation of guidance materials to support facilitators to critically reflect on their identities and practice to enact their work in gender just ways. In this paper, we explore issues of reflexivity, ethics and accountability in how facilitators work with men and boys. Through three facilitator stories, we consider processes of reflexivity in relation to facilitators: 1) recognizing their intersectional selves, 2) acknowledging and learning from prejudice, and 3) bringing an ethics of openness and vulnerability to their work. We argue that these areas of reflexivity are central to gender transformative facilitation.

AB  - An individual possesses multiple social identities, and different identities are temporarily salient at different points in time. A particular social identity, such as national identity (NI), may have little or no impact on consumer response unless that identity is activated. This study explores how NI activated through different contexts of international sporting events and associated group-based emotions (happiness vs. anger) would exert differential influence on consumers' responses to patriotic ads. Further, this study proposes that this effect would vary depending on the corporate origin of the brand, which refers to whether the advertised brand is domestic or foreign. Findings show that (1) while both happiness and anger improve consumer responses to patriotic ads, such an effect is significantly stronger in the happiness-eliciting context, and (2) while NI activation in the happiness-eliciting context has an effect on increasing consumers' responses to patriotic ads regardless of the corporate origin of the brands, the effect of activating NI is greater for a domestic (vs. foreign) brand in the anger-eliciting context. This study contributes to extending previous findings by applying two important variables-contexts of activating NI that elicit specific group-based emotions and a corporate origin of the brand-that influence consumer response to a patriotic ad.

AB  - When analyzing the relationship between individual religiosity and attitudes toward immigration, empirical research often leads to contrasting findings. By focusing on contemporary Italy, our contribution aims to provide evidence of two opposite effects that religiosity can exert on attitudes toward immigration. On the one hand, belonging to a religious community is expected to reinforce a social identity, leading to negative attitudes toward outgroups. On the other hand, religious commitment implies adhering to religious teachings which promote altruistic values, such as the acceptance of others. Since the two hypotheses pertain to different dimensions of religiosity, we propose to use a typology combining affiliation and church attendance, so that the two hypotheses can be tested as complementary. The first evidence we provide to support the hypotheses analyzes parallel survey data coming from the European Social Survey (ESS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). In particular, we point out that non-religious and highly religious people show more positive attitudes toward immigration than affiliated individuals with low religious commitment. Moreover, data from the 2018 ISSP module "Religion IV", which includes more specific measures of religious identity and commitment, lend further support to our expectations.

AB  - Hostile sexism encompasses beliefs about the risks of depending on women, so men's endorsement of hostile sexism should interrupt access to social support. Across two studies, U.S. and Canadian men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism expressed lower satisfaction with support from female romantic partners (Study 1; N = 293) and lower desire for support from close others in stressful scenarios (Study 2; N = 396). Moderation and mediation analyses identified more (vs. less) interdependent relationships as a key context of discomfort with support and two potential mechanisms: Men who endorsed hostile sexism perceived support as potentially threatening and felt more vulnerable when seeking support, partially explaining their discomfort with support. Surprisingly, results for women's hostile sexism showed similar patterns of discomfort with support. Our findings illustrate that endorsing hostile sexism has costs for men themselves, but also suggest the effects of hostile sexism are less gender specific than previously theorized.

AB  - Although acceptance of gay men has grown in recent years, gay men still regularly experience bias in their social relationships. The bias gay men experience has been theorized to stem from societal expectations regarding adherence to gender roles. Additionally, threats to masculinity have been suggested to promote antigay attitudes and discrimination among men. However, it remains unclear whether the bias gay men experience as a result of threatened masculinity is due to gay men's sexuality, gender role adherence, or the combination. Thus, across two studies (N = 564) we examine how threats to masculinity and target adherence to traditional gender roles impact heterosexual men's evaluations and anticipated emotional response toward gay or straight men. In Study 1, 405 heterosexual men completed a "personality test" and received either masculinity-threatening feedback or no feedback before assessing the target. We found that when threatened, heterosexual men evaluated feminine gay men less favorably and expressed greater anticipated negative emotions when thinking about interacting with them. Masculinity threat did not influence evaluations of masculine gay men or either heterosexual target. In Study 2 (n = 159), we replicated our findings and demonstrated that self-affirmation of one's personal values can eliminate the negative reactions expressed toward gay feminine men. Anticipated negative emotions were found to mediate the impact of threat on negative evaluation of the feminine gay target in both studies. The current research provides insight into how heterosexual men's experiences with threats to their masculinity, interacts with target sexuality, and expressions of gender influence interpersonal evaluations.

AB  - Nonhuman animals are often abandoned and killed during non-epidemic and epidemic emergencies. However, the study of public attitudes toward animals during an epidemic outbreak and their antecedents and consequences is rare. The present study aimed to determine the individual and psychological variables associated with attitudes toward animals during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Two groups of 990 adults completed an online survey: one group from the epicenter of the epidemic (Hubei Province); the other from other provinces in China. Attitudes toward animals were assessed by four scales: general attitudes toward animal protection, belief in animal mind, human-animal continuity, and psychological closeness between animals and self-concept. Results demonstrated that after the effects of demographics were controlled for, contact with companion animals positively predicted all aspects of the attitudes toward animals in both groups. The above associations tended to be weaker in the epicenter than the non-epicenter group, suggesting the potential modulating role of the localized severity of the epidemic. In addition, perceived continuity between humans and animals negatively predicted the prejudicial attribution to animals of causing the outbreak. The findings provide evidence for the importance of positive interactions with companion animals and people's attitudes toward animals to prevent mistreatment of other species when emergencies occur. The findings also expand the limited empirical research on human-animal relations in non-Western countries.

AB  - Recent findings highlight two facets of the two fundamental stereotype content dimensions of agency (i.e., 'dominance' and 'competence') and communality (i.e., 'morality' and 'sociability'; e.g., Abele et al., 2016) with implications for understanding gender inequality in the workplace (e.g., Prati et al., 2019). Extending this research and contributing to the facial first impressions literature, we examined how these facets of agency and communality when inferred from White men's and women's faces, along with attractiveness, influence their leadership suitability. In three studies in the United Kingdom (total N = 424), using student and working samples and two managerial descriptions, we found an unexpected pattern of results, supported by an internal meta-analysis: attractiveness and competence were the most important predictors of hirability for all candidates. For women, dominance was the next most important predictor; for men, morality and sociability were more important than dominance. Moreover, morality and sociability were more important in evaluating men than women, while dominance was more important in evaluating women than men. Findings are discussed in terms of a 'deficit bias', whereby the qualities women and men are considered to lack - dominance for women, morality, and sociability for men - may be given more weight when evaluating their leadership suitability.

AB  - Discrimination continues to plague society, creating stark inequities between groups. While existing work has considered the role of prejudice in perpetuating discrimination, we draw on emerging research on privilege and inequity frames to offer an overlooked, complementary explanation: Objectively discriminatory decisions that are described as favoring, compared with disfavoring, are less likely to be recognized as discrimination. We further theorize this is because favoring decisions are perceived to be motivated by positive intentions. We find support for our hypotheses across eight studies. First, using both qualitative (Studies 1a-b) and experimental approaches (Studies 2-7), across a range of discrimination contexts including race, sex, nationality, and age, we find that inequity frames affect perceptions of discrimination. Further, we find that even human resource employees are less likely to recognize discrimination when described as favoring (Study 3), in turn affecting their reporting behaviors: They are less likely to report potentially discriminatory decisions for review. Next, sampling language from U.S. Supreme Court cases, we find that people support litigation less when discrimination uses a favoring frame, versus disfavoring frame (Study 4). Then, we find that this pattern is driven by inequity frames shaping perceived intentions, rather than perceived harm (Studies 5-6). Finally, we find some evidence that inequity frames regarding a discriminatory decision committed by an organization may affect candidates' job pursuit behaviors (Study 7). This work contributes to a nascent perspective that advantaging mechanisms are critical for creating group inequity: given individuals are less likely to recognize favoritism as discriminatory, favoritism may especially contribute to the persistence of inequity.

AB  - Research shows that news media around the world carry negative representations of ethnic minorities which incite violence, hatred or lead to more marginalisation and social exclusion [Bhatia, M., Poynting, S., & Tufail, W. (2018). Media, crime and racism. Springer; Elias, A., Mansouri, F., & Paradies, Y. (2021). Media, public discourse and racism. In A. Elias, F. Mansouri, & Y. Paradies (Eds.), Racism in Australia today (pp. 211-240). Palgrave Macmillan]. It is also the case that overt racism has become less tolerated in society and, therefore, racist discourses now tend to take more subtle forms, often disguised as reasonable concerns about threats to national culture, economic burdens or disruptions of social order [Bonilla-Silva, E. (2006). Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States. Rowman & Littlefield]. This is very much the case regarding the Roma. Yet, less research has been carried out on the way that the affordances of television - juxtaposition of images, captions, sound and voice-overs, editing, and resequencing - may have very specific ways to conceal racism. In this paper, using Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, we examine the representation of the Roma in a Romanian television news report, in the case of a highly mundane story - a failure to pay electricity bills. We show how television news with its affordances can camouflage racism, and distract from the extreme poverty and social exclusion that Romani people experience in contemporary Europe.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the extent to which Twitter users engaged in uncivil and morally questionable expressions in their comments about specific Asian countries and citizens. The integrated threat theory (ITT) was used to formulate questions surrounding incivility and moral foundations within Twitter discourses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected tweets and retweets posted by English-speaking Twitter users in the United States (US) across the following three phases: (1) initial discovery of COVID-19 in China, (2) high US mortality rate from COVID-19 and (3) the announcement that a vaccine would soon be available in the US. Findings The authors found a significant difference in uncivil tweets posted in cities with higher levels of reported hate crimes against Asians than cities with low levels. Lastly, English-speaking Twitter users tended to employ moral virtue words and moral vice words when discussing China and Chinese culture/populations. Research limitations/implications The bags-of-words employed are limited in capturing nuanced and metaphorical terms. In addition, the analysis focused solely on Tweets composed in English and thus did not capture the thoughts and opinions of non-English speakers. Lastly, this study did not address all Asian countries. In this sense, the findings of this study might not be applicable to Tweets about other nations. Practical implications Given that many Twitter users tend to use terms of moral virtue in support of Asians and Asian communities, the authors suggest that non-governmental organization administrators provide morally supportive social media campaigns that encourage users to engage in civil discourse. Social implications These findings have theoretical implications as the frameworks of integrated threats and moral foundations were used to offer group-level explanations for online behavior. Additional research is needed to explore whether these frameworks can be used to explain negativity in other communication environments. Originality/value This study expands the findings of prior studies that identified the extent to which Twitter users express hate speech, focusing on general Twitter discourse across three specific periods of the pandemic: degrees of incivility and moral foundations, and comparison of incivility based on the prevalence of reported hate crimes.

AB  - Spontaneous (i.e., heuristic, fast, effortless, and associative) processing has clear advantages for human cognition, but it can also elicit undesirable outcomes such as stereotyping and other biases. In the current article, we argue that biased judgements and behaviour that result from spontaneous processing can be reduced by activating various flexibility mindsets. These mindsets are characterised by the consideration of alternatives beyond one's spontaneous thoughts and behaviours and could, thus, contribute to bias reduction. Research has demonstrated that eliciting flexibility mindsets via goal and cognitive conflicts, counterfactual thinking,, recalling own past flexible thoughts or behaviour, and adopting a promotion focus reduces biases in judgements and behaviour. We summarise evidence for the effectiveness of flexibility mindsets across a wide variety of important phenomena - including creative performance, stereotyping and prejudice, interpersonal behaviour, and decision-making. Finally, we discuss the underlying processes and potential boundary conditions.

AB  - Research on public attitudes toward the death penalty has yet to systematically examine the role of race in the context of offense-related attributes. This study uses a conjoint experiment randomly exposing a sample of 500 U.S. adults to different pairings of capital offenders to test the role of both offender and offense-related attributes on beliefs about death penalty deservingness. The results show offense-related factors play a significant role in who the public deems deserving of the death penalty, while the offender's race matters only for citizens holding prejudicial opinions towards Blacks or Latinos. Instrumental considerations typically outweigh racial considerations in death penalty judgments, although perceptions of those factors might be racialized as well. The results point to a potential disjuncture between the desires of citizens and the implementation of the death penalty.

AB  - This 12-year study examined racism and sexism in the 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 US presidential elections. Data were collected in the weeks surrounding each election, and participants completed measures of racism, sexism, and support for candidates. The hypotheses were that liberal participants would endorse less racism and sexism than conservative participants, and that racism and sexism would predict support for the presidential candidates differently in different election cycles. There was mixed support for the hypotheses; overall liberal participants did endorse racism and sexism less than conservative participants. Racism was a significant predictor during both the 2008 and 2016 elections. Although benevolent sexism was a significant predictor in 2008 and 2012, hostile sexism was a significant predictor in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Taken together these results suggest that political affiliation predicts levels of racism and sexism, and that these voter prejudices do predict support for political candidates.

AB  - Sexual minority men are at greater risk of depression and suicidality than heterosexuals. Stigma, the most frequently hypothesized risk factor for this disparity, operates across socioecological levels-structural (e.g., laws), interpersonal (e.g., discrimination), and individual (e.g., self-stigma). Although the literature on stigma and mental health has focused on interpersonal and individual forms of stigma, emerging research has shown that structural stigma is also associated with adverse mental health outcomes. However, there is limited data on whether changes in structural stigma, such as when a stigmatized person moves to a lower stigma context, affect mental health, and on the mechanisms underlying this association. To address these questions, we use data from the 2017/18 European Men-who-havesex-with-men Internet Survey (n = 123,428), which assessed mental health (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire) and psychosocial mediators (i.e., sexual orientation concealment, internalized homonegativity, and social isolation). We linked these data to an objective indicator of structural stigma related to sexual orientation-including 15 laws and policies as well as aggregated social attitudes-in respondents' countries of origin (N = 178) and receiving countries (N = 48). Among respondents who still live in their country of birth (N = 106,883), structural stigma was related to depression and suicidality via internalized homonegativity and social isolation. Among respondents who moved from higher-to-lower structural stigma countries (n = 11,831), longer exposure to the lower structural stigma environments of their receiving countries was associated with a significantly: 1) lower risk of depression and suicidality; 2) lower odds of concealment, internalized homonegativity, and social isolation; and 3) smaller indirect effect of structural stigma on mental health through these mediators. This study provides additional evidence that stigma is a sociocultural determinant of mental health.

AB  - Discrimination resulting from the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks has been associated with poor mental health outcomes among Arab and/or Muslim Americans. However, there has been an absence of research assessing whether 9/11-related discrimination has been associated with psychiatric disorders among other populations of color. This study investigated whether perceived discrimination resulting from the 9/11 attacks was associated with psychiatric disorders and psychiatric comorbidity within Latinx populations in the United States. We used multivariable logistic and negative binomial regression to analyze nationally representative data from 2,507 Latinx respondents collected during the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). Psychiatric outcomes included mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Perceived discrimination was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of reporting all of the psychiatric disorders included in this study, with odds ratios ranging from 1.22 (any psychiatric disorder) to 1.56 (PTSD) for the entire Latinx sample. In addition, perceived discrimination was significantly associated with psychiatric comorbidity (p < .001) for the entire sample. The associations between perceived discrimination post-9/11 and psychiatric disorders as well as psychiatric comorbidity were heterogeneous across Latinx ethnicities. Perceived discrimination post-9/11 was significantly associated with psychiatric disorders independent of more routine and unrelated forms of discrimination. Discrimination resulting from major sociopolitical events has the potential to affect the mental health of a variety of social groups, including racial and ethnic groups not linked to the occurrence of such events.

AB  - The extent of political efficacy within a community reflects the general state of affairs within that community, with higher levels of political efficacy presumably related to other kinds of socially preferable attitudes. High levels of political efficacy could further be regarded as a glue that keeps a political community together and should be even more important within minority communities. As political efficacy differs across minority communities, it indicates that individual levels of political efficacy is not only an individual trait but something also affected by the local contextual features. To explore the relationship between varying local contexts and political efficacy within a minority population, we use data from Barometern 2019 (N = 3,913), which is a survey measuring the opinions and attitudes of the Swedish-speaking population in Finland, i.e., the Swedish-speaking Finns. This study, thus, analyses the role of contextual- and individual-level determinants (e.g., age, education and gender) as well as linguistic identity (Swedish and bilingual) and political interest on both internal (subjective sense of political understanding) and external (political responsiveness) political efficacy. We find that context matters for political efficacy within a minority context but that the effects differ between the internal and external types of political efficacy. The findings presented will contribute to increasing our knowledge about political efficacy within a minority context.

AB  - We investigated whether stronger religious fundamentalism predicted negative attitudes toward church-state separation as a consequence of perceiving low in-group prototypicality (IGP). Across two studies (N = 635), Christians from the United States reported their religious orientations (intrinsic, extrinsic-personal, extrinsic-social, fundamentalism) before we measured (or manipulated) their perceptions of IGP. The dependent variables were attitudes toward church-state separation (S1, S2) and attitudes toward religious-national integration (S2). Results showed that stronger religious fundamentalism predicted negative attitudes toward church-state separation. Results also showed that fundamentalists' negativity toward church-state separation was stronger when Christianity was not perceived as prototypical of America's identity. Religious fundamentalism did not predict attitudes toward church-state separation when perceiving high IGP. Religious fundamentalism predicted support of religious-national integration irrespective of IGP. The results suggest that fundamentalists will oppose the separation of church and state when they perceive their religion is not prototypical of their national identity.

AB  - Research on automatic stereotyping is dominated by the idea that automatic stereotyping reflects the activation of (group-trait) associations. In two preregistered experiments (total N = 391), we tested predictions derived from an alternative perspective that suggests that automatic stereotyping is the result of the activation of propositional representations that, unlike associations, can encode relational information and have truth values. Experiment 1 found that automatic stereotyping is sensitive to the validity of information about pairs of traits and groups. Experiment 2 showed that automatic stereotyping is sensitive to the specific relations (e.g., whether a particular group is more or less friendly than a reference person) between pairs of traits and groups. Interestingly, both experiments found a weaker influence of validity/relational information on automatic stereotyping than on non-automatic stereotyping. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on automatic stereotyping.

AB  - Homonegativity refers to a series of prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes towards individuals perceived as homosexuals. Previous studies indicated that some personality traits (i.e., neuroticism, low openness to experience), as well as specific ideological attitudes (i.e., conservatism, authoritarianism) and higher levels of psychopathology make individuals more prone to show homonegative attitudes. However, no studies have compared these three dimensions in order to identify their different role in homonegativity. For this reason, the aim of this study was to simultaneously evaluate the association of ideological, personality, and psychopathological factors with homonegativity in adults living in Italy. Participants were 307 heterosexual adults (males = 46%) ranging in age between 19 and 66 years (M = 28.74, SD = 10.65), who completed four self-report questionnaires: Modern Homophobia Scale, Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale, NEO Five-Factor Inventory 3, and Symptom Check List-90-R. A structural equation model was computed to examine the relation between ideological, personality, and psychopathological factors and homonegativity. Results showed that ideological factors, particularly authoritarian attitudes and religiosity, were mostly related with homonegativity, while lower agreeableness and lower psychopathology were significantly albeit more weakly associated with homonegativity in adults living in Italy. Methodological limitations and implications for interventions are discussed.

AB  - Why do native Europeans discriminate against Muslim immigrants? Can shared ideas between natives and immigrants reduce discrimination? We hypothesize that natives' bias against Muslim immigrants is shaped by the belief that Muslims hold conservative attitudes about women's rights and this ideational basis for discrimination is more pronounced among native women. We test this hypothesis in a large-scale field experiment conducted in 25 cities across Germany, during which 3,797 unknowing bystanders were exposed to brief social encounters with confederates who revealed their ideas regarding gender roles. We find significant discrimination against Muslim women, but this discrimination is eliminated when Muslim women signal that they hold progressive gender attitudes. Through an implicit association test and a follow-up survey among German adults, we further confirm the centrality of ideational stereotypes in structuring opposition to Muslims. Our findings have important implications for reducing conflict between native-immigrant communities in an era of increased cross-border migration.

AB  - This article explores racial exclusion, bias, and prejudice in the context of same-sex mobile dating, focusing on the experiences of a group of Australian-based Chinese queer women. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants' racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women's interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women's racialized experiences. Correspondingly, the participants developed diverse interpretations of and responses to their racialized experiences. This study reveals how the anti-Asian racism in the global West permeates the realm of queer women in the context of mobile dating. It contributes to understanding the digital dating practices and racialized experiences of queer women and the broader Chinese diaspora.

AB  - While a long history of scholarship has explored fear as an affective reaction to the prospect of crime, a much smaller number of studies have suggested that anger may be both more common and more predictive of punitive policy views (e.g. Ditton et al. International Review of Victimology 6:83-99, 1999a; Johnson Punishment & Society 11:51-66, 2009; Hartnagel & Templeton Punishment & Society 14:452-74, 2012). This difference matters in that fear and anger imply different stories: fear can be personal while anger necessarily draws our attention to social meanings and connects to broader issues like race relations and racism. We use a nationally representative survey conducted by the ANES to verify what we already know and then ask new questions about the potential sources and other potential consequences of anger about crime. While personal victimizations are associated with fear, victimizations of acquaintances are associated with anger. Anger appears rooted in both racial resentment and the racial context. In turn, while the fearful are supportive of a wide range of approaches to addressing social problems, the angry are only more supportive of crime spending and in fact oppose social assistance spending. Implications for research on affective reactions to crime and for crime-relevant policies are discussed.

AB  - Background: Past survey studies document that people strongly prefer Covid-19 vaccines developed domestically over those developed abroad. Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. Methods: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. Results: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prejudice against foreign countries may be less of a concern for vaccine hesitancy and that its effect may be highly context specific.

AB  - This research investigated whether and to what extent Dutch society is polarized in its attitudes towards refugees and migrants. We further investigated what factors were linked to polarization by testing an integrated three-dimensional model. A latent profile analysis of a representative Dutch sample (N = 1897) suggested that society is indeed polarized, with two substantial groups-anti (16.5%) and pro (18.7%)-at opposite ends. The middle was also divided into people with critical (31.8%) and lenient (33%) attitudes. The three dimensions of our model, (1) the individual and social self (education, political orientation, relative deprivation), (2) perceptions and experience regarding refugees and migrants (perceived cultural distance and contact), and (3) the societal context (societal discontent), were all significantly associated with polarized attitudes. Interestingly, perceived cultural distance from Islam was most strongly linked to polarized attitudes. Organizing different factors into an integrated model offers new insights into the complexity of polarization in society.

AB  - Purpose
   Metronidazol and vancomycin were long the two best options against Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infections (CDI). Now, the cost of new drugs such as fidaxomicin directs us towards alternative treatment options, such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Its effectiveness is similar to fidaxomicin. There are questions regarding its safety, but the biggest challenges are prejudice and inconvenience. Most protocols refer to FMT applied in the form of a solution. We investigated different modalities of FMT.
   Methods
   Instead of using nasoenteric tubes or colonoscopy, we place frozen or lyophilised stool in non-coated, size "00", hard gelatine capsules or enterosolvent, size "0" capsules.
   Results
   We found that non-coated, size "00", hard gelatine capsules are appropriate for conducting FMT. Capsules containing lyophilised supernatant with a low number of bacteria have been proven to be non-inferior to other FMT modalities. The primary cure rate in the supernatant group was 93.75%, and 66.67% in the sediment group. The overall cure rate was 82.14%. Depending on the protocol, 4-7 capsules are sufficient per patient. Capsules can be stored for up to one year at -20 degrees C.
   Conclusions
   FMT is a feasible alternative to antibiotic treatments in CDI. Our method makes the process flexible and less inconvenient to patients. Long storage time allows a consistent supply of capsules, while small volume and formulation make the procedure tolerable.

AB  - People endorsing stronger beliefs in human supremacy over animals typically show less moral concern for animals. Yet, how people think about different types of animals also depends on the role of the animals in society. For instance, people are less concerned about food animals than about companion animals. It is unclear, however, how human supremacy beliefs relate to this perceived moral divide between different types of animals. In two surveys of British adults (n = 196 and n = 256), we tested whether human supremacy beliefs are associated with a greater perceived moral divide between high-status animals such as companion animals and low-status animals such as food animals. In both studies, participants rated the extent to which they felt obligated to show moral concern to a range of animals and completed the human supremacy beliefs scale. As expected, the results showed that participants felt more moral concern for companion animals (e.g., dogs and cats) and appealing wild animals (e.g., dolphins and chimps) than for food animals (e.g., pigs and turkeys) and unappealing wild animals (e.g., frogs and bats). Critically, confirming our hypotheses, this moral divide between high- and low-status animals was significantly larger for those holding stronger human supremacy beliefs. Furthermore, the effect of human supremacy beliefs remained after controlling for gender, age, diet, and social dominance orientation. These findings suggest that beliefs in human supremacy over animals may serve as a legitimizing strategy to preserve not only the existing human-animal hierarchy but also greater hierarchical divides between animals.

AB  - Black and poor students are suspended from U.S. schools at higher rates than White and nonpoor students. While the existence of these disparities has been clear, the causes of the disparities have not. We use a novel data set to examine how and where discipline disparities arise. By comparing the punishments given to Black and White (or poor and nonpoor) students who fight one another, we address a selection challenge that has kept prior studies from identifying discrimination in student discipline. We find that Black and poor students are, in fact, punished more harshly than the students with whom they fight.

AB  - Does contact across social groups influence sociopolitical behavior? This question is among the most studied in the social sciences with deep implications for the harmony of diverse societies. Yet, despite a voluminous body of scholarship, evidence around this question is limited to cross-sectional surveys that only measure short-term consequences of contact or to panel surveys with small samples covering short time periods. Using advances in machine learning that enable large-scale linkages across datasets, we examine the long-term determinants of sociopolitical behavior through an unprecedented individual-level analysis linking contemporary political records to the 1940 U.S. Census. These linked data allow us to measure the exact residential context of nearly every person in the United States in 1940 and, for men, connect this with the political behavior of those still alive over 70 years later. We find that, among white Americans, early-life exposure to black neighbors predicts Democratic partisanship over 70 years later.

AB  - People diagnosed with schizophrenia (PDS) will find seamlessly coordinated services and care in their communities if they are delivered with a high level of continuity of care (COC). Most studies of COC were conducted in Western countries that initiated deinstitutionalisation several decades ago. Limited studies highlight experiences of COC among PDS who live in societies still heavily relying on institutionalised care, such as prolonged hospitalisation, like South Korea where PDS stay in psychiatric hospitals over 100 days on average. This qualitative study explored COC that PDS experienced in South Korea. We focused on cross-boundary COC, which refers to service coordination at a given moment, and longitudinal COC, which refers to care over a period of time. Twenty-one PDS completed in-depth interviews from June to August 2017. Fifteen participants were male (71.4%), and ages ranged from 26 to 71. We used grounded theory techniques for data analysis, including initial open coding, in vivo coding, constant comparison and axial coding. Findings include that PDS experienced poor longitudinal COC when discharge planning during hospitalisation was absent, which undermined their ability to live independently. Poor employment support effectively undermined recovery even if PDS worked hard to attain economic self-sufficiency. As for cross-boundary COC, poor communication between psychiatrists and providers offering psychiatric rehabilitation services was a barrier. PDS in general had difficulties locating needed psychiatric rehabilitation services in the community. The lack of COC appeared to arise from particular sociocultural contexts, including poor self-determination in consumer-provider relationships, families' lack of knowledge and support, and discrimination and prejudice. Despite experiences with discrimination, no participants appeared to have internalised messages that they are 'less than' those without mental illnesses. Findings highlight the significance of multi-pronged approaches to increase COC, which can effectively link PDS, families, psychiatrists and psychiatric rehabilitation service providers.

AB  - An increasing number of people tend to eat alone due to social changes and an altered attitude towards cooking and eating practices. Anecdotal reports indicate that solo diners tend to use information and communication technology devices, for example, the smartphone, as part of the eating experience. While lab studies suggest that the devices contribute to an increased high-calorie food intake and decreased feeling of satiety, these studies disregard the everyday experience and motivation of solo diners. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate how solo diners use digital devices as part of their daily eating experience. Semi-structured interviews with solo diners (N = 12) were analyzed using thematic analysis in an inductive approach leading to six themes. The themes focus on (1) the perception of a meal; (2) the experience of a solo diner; (3) the purpose of using an information and communication technology device; (4) the perceived influence of the devices; (5) factors decreasing and increasing the use; (6) and the potential to promote healthier food consumption. Our results indicate that the use of digital devices while eating alone can lead to distraction, being unaware of the food texture and the amount that is eaten. The devices can also induce a positive influence by providing entertainment and mitigating negative emotions like loneliness and boredom. The devices have the potential to contribute to healthy eating practices by providing education and by influencing the speed of eating through elements of sound. Although the use of devices might negatively affect eating behavior, their ubiquitous presence also offers the opportunity to reach specific, vulnerable populations.

AB  - Drawing on theories of intergroup conflict and research on political legitimization of prejudice and crime motivated by bias, this study examines the temporal clustering of hate crimes in the aftermath of triggering events in the UK. In addition to domestic and nondomestic terrorist attacks, we consider the effects of the EU referendum widely known as Brexit. Consistent with previous work, the results reveal sharp increases of hate crimes in the aftermath of the antecedent events. However, we found that the effects of the EU referendum were more prolonged and more intense than the effects of the other triggering events. Moreover, the effects of domestic events are generally significant and stronger in magnitude than nondomestic events. Finally, the results show that the duration and decay of the effects of terrorist attacks on hate crimes generally mirror the severity of the galvanizing event. Taken together, our findings underscore the role of the EU referendum in explaining dramatic increases in crime motivated by bias. Accordingly, they are of particular importance to politicians and policy makers and have implications that go beyond the case of Brexit.

AB  - Negative attitudes and stigmatization can originate from the perception of a disease-related threat. Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is often suggested that incidents of discriminatory behavior are the result of defense mechanisms aimed at avoiding pathogens. According to the behavioral immune system theory, people are motivated to distance themselves from individuals who show signs of infection, or who are only heuristically associated with a disease, primarily because of the disgust they evoke. In this paper we focus on negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians who are among social groups that have been persistently framed as "unclean." In our correlational study (N = 500 heterosexual participants; Polish sample data collected during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Poland, in March/April 2020) we tested moderation models derived from the behavioral immune system theory. Specifically, we investigated whether perceived vulnerability to disease and perceived threat of contracting COVID-19 moderate the relation between disgust and homonegativity. We found that sexual disgust (but not pathogen nor moral disgust) predicted homonegative attitudes. This effect was stronger for participants expressing higher levels of perceived vulnerability to disease but was not dependent on the perception of the COVID-19 threat. The results reaffirm previous evidence indicating a pivotal role of disgust in disease-avoidance mechanisms. They also point to functional flexibility of the behavioral immune system by demonstrating the moderating role of perceived vulnerability to disease in shaping homonegative attitudes. Finally, they show that the threat of COVID-19 does not strengthen the relationship between disgust and homonegativity.

AB  - Purpose
   Brands are increasingly reflecting social values, and many brands have begun to embrace equality and inclusivity as a marketing strategy. Accordingly, consumers are increasingly being exposed to brands associated with different social groups. This paper aims to examine how consumers who have experienced pride respond to brands associated with dissociative out-groups.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Four studies were conducted. Study 1 tested the basic effect of how the experience of different facets of pride affects consumers' brand attitudes toward a brand associated with a dissociative out-group. Studies 2 and 3 examined the underlying mechanism of consumers' psychological endorsement of egalitarianism using both mediation and moderation approaches. Study 4 derived implications of our findings for marketers.
   Findings
   The results show that consumers respond differently to a brand associated with a dissociative out-group based on the facets of pride they experience. When consumers experience authentic (vs hubristic) pride, they exhibit a more favorable attitude toward the brand associated with the dissociative out-group. This is because authentic (vs hubristic) pride increases consumers' psychological endorsement of egalitarianism, which enhances consumers' brand attitudes toward the brand associated with the dissociative out-group.
   Practical implications
   The findings suggest that brand managers should think about ways to elicit consumers' authentic pride to minimize the potential backlash from consumers when promoting equality and inclusivity in their brand communications, particularly when such communications contain cues of dissociative out-groups.
   Originality/value
   This paper contributes to the branding literature by identifying pride as an important determinant that can help brands overcome the negative impact of dissociative out-groups on consumers' brand reactions, enriches the literature on pride by documenting a novel effect of the two facets of pride on consumer behavior and extends the literature of egalitarianism by demonstrating pride as a driver of consumers' psychological endorsement of egalitarianism.

AB  - According to some evolutionary theorists human prosocial dispositions emerged in a context of inter-group competition and violence that made our psychology parochially prosocial, ie. cooperative towards in-groups and competitive towards strangers. This evolutionary hypothesis is sometimes employed in bioethical debates to argue that human nature and contemporary environments, and especially large-scale societies, are mismatched. In this article we caution against the use of mismatch theories in moral philosophy in general and discuss empirical evidence that puts into question mismatch theories based on parochial prosociality. Evolutionary mismatch theories play at best a rhetorical role in these moral debates and may misrepresent the status of relevant evolutionary research. We finally recommend that moral philosophers interested in the evolutionary literature also engage with dispositions such as xenophilia and social tolerance to counterbalance the focus on psychological mismatches adopted so far.

AB  - Writing the architecture survey remains one of the biggest challenges in the field. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western scholars usually followed a synchronic approach (literally "with-time") and described Chinese architecture without reference to its development and evolution over time. Although synchrony (attention to a particular moment in time) is not incorrect in principle, it is all too often attached with a negative connotation. A possible reason is that Liang Sicheng, and the generations after him, have understood all facets of synchrony as expression of the old dichotic worldview that once glorified Europe and deprived Asia of its history (non-historical timelessness) as formulated by the German philosophers Hegel and Herder and codified in Fletcher's and Fergusson's authoritative textbooks. Challenging the previous misconception of the generalization of synchronic textbooks, the paper attempts to examine the multiple facets of synchrony and identify the writing style of Borschmann's Chinesische Architektur, the prime example of the German-language survey on Chinese Architecture. In doing so, the paper hopefully can provide basis and arguments in defense of the work, presenting a reconciliation to the biased, subjective presentation of Chinese architecture once afflicted with prejudices and misapprehensions. The paper values Borschmann's Chinesische Architektur as a distinguished work different from other synchronic writings through its pioneering, value-neutral and formal approach.

AB  - The present study examined the prevalence of cross-race interactions occurring in daily life using wear-able camera technology that captures photographs of a participants' immediate environment and social interactions. Coders used appearance-based cues to identify the number of interaction partners captured in the photos who appeared to be White or a racial minority. We found that 29.6% of Whites' social inter-actions were with racial minorities and 23.9% of racial minorities' social interactions were with Whites. Furthermore, we examined whether personality and other individual differences correlated with being captured in more cross-race interactions. We found that Whites who used more emotion-focused coping and less emotional suppression were more likely to be captured engaging in cross-race interactions.

AB  - The present research proposed a theoretical distinction among various stereotypes that we predicted would moderate their malleability in implicit person perception: the extent to which the stereotypes can be learned and validated with minimal or no indirect inference (i.e., their observability). We hypothesized that observable stereotypes would be less malleable than unobservable stereotypes in implicit person perception in the presence of counterstereotypic individuating information. This main hypothesis was tested in four studies, as were two alternative hypotheses that all implicit stereotype-relevant evaluations would show evidence of fast-learning, and that all such evaluations would provide support for slow-learning. Studies 1 and 2 tested these predictions in the domain of an observable (Study 1) and an unobservable (Study 2) racial stereotype, and Studies 3 and 4 in the domain of an observable (Study 3) and an unobservable (Study 4) gender stereotype. Considered as an aggregate, Studies 1 and 2 provided strong support for the hypothesis that the observability of an implicit stereotype would moderate its malleability. Studies 3 and 4 showed only limited support for this hypothesis. However, when all four studies were considered together, the hypothesis was supported. The finding that observable stereotypes in implicit person perception are less malleable than unobservable stereotypes is discussed in the context of current debates regarding the processes underlying implicit and explicit social cognition.

KW  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
AB  - Different from the regular migration some migrants want the opportunity to move further to a new country rather than settle down. However, this peculiar "transit migration" is only studied based on small-scale surveys, which is regional and always controversial. To reconcile the contradiction of the fact that systematic issues such as immigration analysis need global large-scale data, this paper constructs a multilateral migration network and studies its statistical characteristics to get the probability of being transit countries and routes. It is quantified by irregular triangle relationships in the global migration network, and shows some popular springboards mentioned in prior research studies, such as Canada and Australia acting as the global hubs, and some typical transit countries directing to Europe, as Russia, Turkey, France and Germany. Besides, it also reveals and quantifies several hidden possible transit stations that were seldom noticed before, like South Africa, Israel and some hubs of local refugee flows in Africa. Exploring these possible routes and key notes might shed light on policy development, and from the viewpoint of physics, these results provide an objective view to transit migrants and countries that is free of prejudice and political attitudes.

AB  - For international and domestic actors, post-conflict peacebuilding is one of the most difficult policy are-nas to understand and in which to operate. Environmental and natural resource governance have the potential to facilitate peacebuilding in such contexts, but existing research has not yet produced a cohe-sive theoretical understanding of the pathways by which natural resource management strategies can facilitate positive peace. This paper explores the wider benefits of natural resource management and dis-cusses their potential for reducing political fragility in affected states and helping to build positive peace. The paper outlines three mechanisms through which improved natural resource governance in post-conflict contexts is theorized to have positive effects on peace: (a) the contact hypothesis, whereby the facilitation of intergroup cooperation reduces bias and prejudice; (b) the diffusion of transnational norms, where the introduction of environmental and other good governance norms supports human empower-ment and strengthens civil society; and (c) state service provision, where the provision of access to public services addresses the instrumental needs of communities, thereby strengthening their belief in the state. Guided by an interest in the opportunities presented by natural resource management to support peace -building processes in post-conflict states, the paper seeks to revise and advance the current environmen-tal peacebuilding research agenda.

AB  - Despite the fact that gay men and lesbian women face significant economic disparities compared to their heterosexual counterparts, people appear to believe that the opposite is true, a phenomenon which has been dubbed the "myth of gay affluence." In the current research (N-tot = 2,162), we address the consequences of this belief. Specifically, we hypothesize and find that believing that gay men and lesbian women are financially well off-either chronically (Study 1) or because of an experimental manipulation (Studies 2-3)-leads participants to deny discrimination against gay men and lesbian women, above and beyond anti-gay attitudes, and this is mediated by the belief that there is a "gay agenda" that is backed by powerful lobbyists. Thus, perpetuating this myth-either intentionally or inadvertently-could have deleterious effects on efforts for social change and the promotion of rights for sexual minorities.

AB  - Although human existence is enveloped by ideologies, remarkably little is understood about the relationships between ideological attitudes and psychological traits. Even less is known about how cognitive dispositions-individual differences in how information is perceived and processed- sculpt individuals' ideological worldviews, proclivities for extremist beliefs and resistance (or receptivity) to evidence. Using an unprecedented number of cognitive tasks (n = 37) and personality surveys (n = 22), along with data-driven analyses including drift-diffusion and Bayesian modelling, we uncovered the specific psychological signatures of political, nationalistic, religious and dogmatic beliefs. Cognitive and personality assessments consistently outperformed demographic predictors in accounting for individual differences in ideological preferences by 4 to 15-fold. Furthermore, data-driven analyses revealed that individuals' ideological attitudes mirrored their cognitive decision-making strategies. Conservatism and nationalism were related to greater caution in perceptual decision-making tasks and to reduced strategic information processing, while dogmatism was associated with slower evidence accumulation and impulsive tendencies. Religiosity was implicated in heightened agreeableness and risk perception. Extreme pro-group attitudes, including violence endorsement against outgroups, were linked to poorer working memory, slower perceptual strategies, and tendencies towards impulsivity and sensation-seeking-reflecting overlaps with the psychological profiles of conservatism and dogmatism. Cognitive and personality signatures were also generated for ideologies such as authoritarianism, system justification, social dominance orientation, patriotism and receptivity to evidence or alternative viewpoints; elucidating their underpinnings and highlighting avenues for future research. Together these findings suggest that ideological worldviews may be reflective of low-level perceptual and cognitive functions. This article is part of the theme issue 'The political brain: neurocognitive and computational mechanisms'.

AB  - This research examined how recipients reacted to group-directed praise formulated by ingroup or outgroup members and varying in linguistic abstraction. Study 1 (N = 81) showed that ingroup praise was perceived as more sincere when formulated in abstract (vs. concrete) terms, whereas outgroup praise formulated in abstract terms was seen as less sincere than concrete praise. In Study 2 (N = 89), recipients of outgroup praise formulated in abstract versus concrete terms attributed more hidden agenda and prejudice to the speaker, and perceived lower congruency between the speaker's words and beliefs; the opposite pattern occurred for ingroup praise. Perceptions of congruency and hidden agenda mediated the effects of speaker group membership and linguistic abstraction on recipients' perception of the praising message. This research points out that linguistic abstraction influences the appraisal of group-directed praise as it works as a cue of speakers' motives. It also suggests important implications for developing successful communications between groups.

AB  - Disability stigma in many low- and middle-income countries represents one of the most pervasive barriers preventing people with disabilities from accessing equal rights and opportunities, including the uptake of available assistive technology (AT). Previous studies have rarely examined how disability stigma may be shaped through factors endemic to social interactions, including how the use of assistive technology itself may precipitate or alleviate disability stigma. Through two strands of work, we address this gap. Via a series of focus groups with Kenyans without disabilities (Study 1) and secondary data analysis of consultations with Kenyans with disabilities and their allies (Study 2), we identify shared and divergent understandings of what shapes disability stigma and discrimination. Specifically, Kenyans with and without disabilities were cognizant of how religious/spiritual interpretations of disability, conceptions of impairments as "different" from the norm, and social stereotypes about (dis)ability shaped the experience of stigma and discrimination. Moreover, both groups highlighted assistive technology as an influential factor that served to identify or "mark" someone as having a disability. However, whereas participants without disabilities saw assistive technology purely as an enabler to overcome stigma, participants with disabilities also noted that, in some cases, use of assistive technologies would attract stigma from others.

AB  - Many studies of women's electability in the developing world focus on single traits such as gender, ethnicity, or religion. Employing an original survey experiment in Jordan, we examine the impacts of multiple, intersecting candidate identities on voter preferences. We show empirically that existing theories of electoral behavior alone cannot account for women's electability. An intersectional lens that considers how power structures shape electability and produce complex effects that must be empirically verified in different contexts is needed. Although less electable overall, female candidates fare as well as males from similar social identity groups. Our findings underscore the need to apply intersectionality to theories of electoral behavior in the developing world and lay the groundwork for a larger research agenda explaining women's electability in Arab elections.

KW  - implicit bias
KW  - Roma ethnic minority
KW  - healthcare professionals
AB  - The Roma or Gipsy population is the largest ethnic minority both in Europe and Hungary with a 10-15years lower life expectancy and significantly worse health indicators than majority populations. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate a sensitive and controversial topic: the perspectives of healthcare staff about the presence and impacts of implicit bias in the Hungarian healthcare system towards Roma patients. Therefore, between June 2017 and May 2018 semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 13 healthcare professionals. Interview transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The presence and occasional manifestation of prejudices against the Romas were noted by the interviewees, most commonly in the form of longer waiting time, comments or other meta-communicative tools. Study participants appeared to exclude a direct relationship between health providers' implicit bias and the lower quality of health services or the worse health status of Roma patients. However, as reported, indirect negative effects may occur in cases where a patient refrains from seeking care due to previous perceived or experienced discrimination. As barriers to effective patient-provider communication and cooperation, differences in culture, health-seeking behaviour and gaps between health literacy levels were emphasized. In terms of prevention, enhancing anti-discriminatory attitudes from early childhood within the families, the role of media in conveying unbiased information, increasing health awareness of the Roma people as well as educating healthcare providers on culture-related issues may be beneficial. Stress and burnout of healthcare professionals also need to be addressed as these may impact on the enactment of unconscious biases.

AB  - Meta-dehumanization contributes to a vicious cycle of hostility. This study extends the literature by investigating antecedents and outcomes of meta-dehumanization in the context of Muslim-non-Muslim relations. Specifically, control over terrorism (COT) and threat were tested as predictors of meta-dehumanization among non-Muslim British nationals (N = 313). The results revealed that lower perceptions of COT predicted increased threat, which in turn predicted meta-dehumanization. Meta-dehumanization, consequently, predicted Islamophobia via increased dehumanization of Muslim people. The results were significant while controlling for political orientation and intergroup contact. This research highlights the unsettling cycle of meta-dehumanization and intergroup hostility. Theoretical and practical implications of this research are discussed. Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article's Community and Social Impact Statement.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY

AB  - Ancient rhetorical theorists described figured speech (oratio figurata) as a strategy for expressing criticism safely, through a screen of ambiguity. I argue that Cicero's Pro Balbo can be read as figured, communicating criticism of Pompey. Cicero's panegyric to Pompey in this speech would have appeared to be factually accurate and commendable to pro-Pompeian members of the audience, but factually wrong or even insincere to anti-Pompeians. Multiple readings of Cicero's intentions are latent as possible interpretations of the speech because of political divisions and divergent prejudices at the time of its delivery.

AB  - Since the increase in numbers of refugees worldwide, the acceptance of refugees in host countries is a highly contested topic. Negative attitudes towards refugees pose a challenge to both integration efforts and social cohesion. So-called paradoxical interventions help mitigating such extreme attitudes, but little is known about the cognitive processes elicited by these interventions. This research investigated whether a paradoxical leading-questions intervention targeting anti-refugee attitudes increases cognitive flexibility, especially among those with anti-refugee attitudes. Results of two preregistered experiments with general-population samples (N= 306) provide evidence that participants with anti-refugee attitudes showed higher cognitive flexibility in the paradoxical condition compared to control conditions. Thereby, this research proposes a cognitive foundation for the benefits of paradoxical interventions in intergroup contexts and suggests novel indications as to why these interventions are effective. We discuss the potential of paradoxical interventions for other important socially contested contexts, such as vaccination and climate change.

AB  - Jane Austen's Gothic parody Northanger Abbey was first published in 1818 and translated into Chinese in 1958 under the title Nuosangjue Si (sic). However, the novel has remained unpopular in China to this day and has received considerably less critical attention than Austen's other works, especially Pride and Prejudice (1813). This article examines the reception of Northanger Abbey in China since the early twentieth century, considering in particular the reasons for contemporary readers' lukewarm response to the novel. It argues that a knowledge of Gothic conventions and elements is crucial to an understanding of the literary satire in Northanger Abbey-and yet Ann Radcliffe's Gothic novels were not available to Chinese readers in translation until very recent decades. It also addresses the difficulties that arose when translating the Gothic-sounding title of Northanger Abbey from English into Chinese and explores the influence of Marxist literary criticism on the first translation of the novel.

AB  - Background: Implicit bias is prejudice shown towards an individual or group without consciously meaning to do so. This bias may occur due to age, race, and gender among other factors. Implicit bias has been examined and identified in a variety of health care professionals, primarily using Implicit Association Tests. To date, literature has not examined implicit bias using covert simulated patients in a naturalistic setting, or in practicing community pharmacists.
   Objective: To develop and pilot a novel method for exploring and reporting on implicit racial bias by community pharmacists in their practice setting.
   Methods: Four female actors of different racial and ethnic backgrounds (Caucasian Australian, East Asian, Middle Eastern, South Asian) completed simulated patient visits at eight community pharmacies in Sydney, Australia between February-March 2019. Actors provided scripted requests for assistance with symptoms or products relating to women's health ailments (cystitis, dysmenorrhea, emergency contraception, vaginal thrush) at a rate of one visit per pharmacy per week. Visits were audio-recorded. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with actors immediately post-visit. Transcriptions of visits and interviews were analyzed through discourse analysis.
   Results: Thirty-two vists were completed. Discourse analysis identified 3 discursive frames of 'caring', 'neutral, and 'abrupt' and enabled identification of potential differences between pharmacists when responding to actors of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Consultation length, number of products sold, and number of questions asked did not significantly differ between visits.
   Conclusions: This novel method proved feasible and future work could adapt this method to different practitioners and simulated patient demographics to explore different types of implicit bias in a number of naturalistic settings.

AB  - As government welfare programming contracts and NGOs increasingly assume core aid functions, they must address a long-standing challenge-that people in need often belong to stigmatized groups. To study other-regarding behavior, we fielded an experiment through a text-to-give campaign in Greece. Donations did not increase with an appeal to the in-group (Greek child) relative to a control (child), but they were halved with reference to a stigmatized out-group (Roma child). An appeal to fundamental rights, a common advocacy strategy, did not reduce the generosity gap. Donations to all groups were lower near Roma communities and declined disproportionately for the Roma appeal. Qualitative research in 12 communities complements our experiment. We conclude that NGO fundraising strategies that narrowly emphasize either in-groups or out-groups, or fundamental rights language, may not be as effective as broader appeals, and we discuss implications for public goods provision in an era of growing nationalism.

AB  - The retention of key human resources is a challenge and a necessity for any organisation. This paper analyses the impact of the existence and accessibility of work-family policies on the well-being of workers and their intention to leave the organisation. To test the proposed hypotheses, we applied a structural equation model based on the partial least squares path modelling (PLS-SEM) approach to a sample of 558 service sector workers. The results show that the existence and accessibility of work-family policies directly reduce the intention to leave the organisation. Moreover, this relationship also occurs indirectly, by mediating the well-being that is generated by these work-family policies. We also analysed the moderating role that gender and hierarchy could have in the above relationships. In addition to the above theoretical implications, this study has practical implications. The findings show that employees with family and work balance problems experience lower emotional well-being, more health problems and eventually higher turnover rates. To avoid these problems, management must focus not only on the implementation of work-family policies but also on their accessibility, without subsequent retaliation or prejudice to employees. Additionally, management should pay special attention to female managers, given their greater difficulty in balancing work and family life.

AB  - Stigmatization is a socially and culturally constructed process, occurring in social interactions, whereby a person is labeled as different and then devalued, resulting in status loss and discrimination. In this article, we present four key arguments as to why qualitative research is imperative to understanding and changing stigma: (a) Stigmatization is complex and qualitative research is well-suited for exploring complex phenomenon; (b) Qualitative research is participatory and offers substantial opportunities for meaningful community engagement, which promotes agency and empowerment, and redresses power imbalances; (c) Qualitative research is imperative to effective stigma reduction; and (d) Qualitative research informs further scientific inquiry and plays an important role in ensuring that we focus on important and relevant aspects of stigma in our research. For each argument, we outline relevant literature and discuss our own experiences with conducting qualitative research on stigmatization. We lean on both theory and practice, paying attention to not only the outcomes of, but also the processes involved, in conducting qualitative research on stigmatization. We then address two criticisms of qualitative research that undermine its legitimacy. We conclude that to better understand stigma, to redress power imbalances, and to inform interventions and further scientific inquiry, we must continue to conduct qualitative research across stigmatized identities and conditions.

AB  - This article examines the changing nature of Austen's reception in China since the 1950s, in particular the growth of feminist critical approaches to her work among contemporary Chinese scholars. Among Austen's works, Pride and Prejudice has remained at the centre of scholarly and popular attention and has had a major impact on Chinese readers' view of Austen as a feminist writer. Anglo-American scholarship commonly considers Austen's feminism in relation with her contemporary Mary Wollstonecraft's feminist thought. Unfamiliar with Wollstonecraft, Chinese scholars and general readers tend to read Austen rather differently, and their exploration of her engagement with 'the woman question' is instead closely connected with the development of Marxism and gender studies in contemporary China.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge in Nigeria with a minimum yield of various TB control efforts due to sociocultural determinants of health including TB-associated stigma. Therefore, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal targets for TB control, an understanding and reduction in TB-associated stigma is necessary. The study aims to explore the perspective of community members and investigate the possible ways of mitigating TB-associated stigma in rural and urban areas in Lagos State, Nigeria. Eight focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted among eight homogenous groups of participants living in the community in rural and urban areas of Lagos state who were stratified by gender, between July and November 2017. Analysis of data was done using the modified grounded theory. A total of 86 participants took part in the FGDs. There were various stigmatising behaviours towards people infected with TB in rural and urban communities studied. This includes: Not willing to eat with people suffering from TB, withdrawal from TB patients in social gatherings, verbal abuse of TB patients and refusing to visit their houses because of their illness. There were also misconceptions about the cause of TB in our study which includes spiritual attack, ingestion of cat hair and inhalation of dust. However, participants in the study believed that mitigating the effect of TB-associated stigma will require adequate community education on TB, provision of financial and emotional support to the patients, as well as the involvement of community leaders in TB control activities and stigma reduction interventions. TB-associated stigma exists in rural and urban communities, with a lack of appropriate knowledge of TB and fear of infection as a major determinant in rural and urban areas respectively. Health education and sensitisation about TB, with community leaders as champions could help to mitigate the effect of TB-associated stigma.

AB  - Objective. Evidence suggests that voters' prejudices may lead them to take information shortcuts in choosing political leaders. This study analyzes whether the skin tone of 12,798 candidates influenced the outcome of their electoral campaigns. Methods. To determine the probability of winning an election, we estimate a linear regression where skin tone is used as an explanatory variable, with controls such as sex and political party. Based on the number of votes obtained by each candidate, we estimate an ordered logit model. Results. Candidates with dark brown skin tones face a probability of winning that is 20-38 percent less than those with intermediate skin color. A one standard deviation increase in skin tone is associated with an 8 percent decrease in the probability of finishing in first place. Conclusion. Skin color influences electoral outcomes. Public policies should therefore ensure equal access and true representativeness.

AB  - Although the relationship between stereotypes and acculturation preferences has been previously studied from the majority perspective among adults, the perspective of adolescents and minority groups is understudied. This research analyzed the contribution of four stereotype dimensions (i.e., morality, immorality, sociability, and competence) to the acculturation preferences of Spanish adolescents and adolescents of Moroccan-origin, the moderating role of stereotypes in intergroup acculturation discrepancies, and the interaction of stereotypes with acculturation perceptions on acculturation preferences. A sample of 488 Spanish adolescents and 360 adolescents of Moroccan-origin living in Spain, from 12 to 19 years old, reported how moral, immoral, social, and competent they perceive each other to be. Spanish adolescents reported their perception about how Moroccan youth were acculturating in terms of maintaining their original culture and adopting the host culture, and their acculturation preferences in the same dimensions. Adolescents of Moroccan-origin reported to what extent they were maintaining their original culture and adopting the host culture, their acculturation preferences, and their ethnic and national (Spanish) identity. Results showed that adolescents of Moroccan-origin reported more positive perceptions of Spanish youth than conversely. The perceived immorality of the outgroup was important for understanding the preferences for adopting the host culture of both groups, but in the opposite direction. The four stereotype dimensions modulated the majority-minority discrepancies in preferences for cultural adoption. An analysis of the interaction between stereotypes and perceived adoption on acculturation preferences showed that when Spanish adolescents perceived that Moroccan youth were not adopting the Spanish culture, perceived morality and sociability played a role in their preferences for adoption. The less moral and sociable Moroccans were perceived, the more preference for cultural adoption. These findings support the importance of considering stereotypes in acculturation studies of majority and minority groups, as well as the relevance of including these perceptions in interventions aimed at improving intercultural relations.

TI  - Re-examining public opinion preferences for migrant categorizations: "Refugees" are evaluated more negatively than "migrants" and "foreigners" related to participants' direct, extended, and mass-mediated intergroup contact experiences

AB  - Although migrant categorizations (e.g. "migrants", "refugees") are often conflated in political and academic discourse, they may be ascribed to different people and inspire different preferences in public opinion. Previous research in Western Europe has identified more positive attitudes toward "refugees" than toward "migrants" due to the legitimate need for international protection of "real refugees" compared to the perceived illegitimate claims by "economic migrants". However, little evidence suggests that the same preference also exists in Eastern European countries that have historically received smaller numbers of refugees and had fewer frequent experiences with migrants and foreigners compared to West European countries. Moreover, the term "refugee" was intensively recategorized as "bogus" and de-legitimized in East European political discourse. To provide new evidence, we conducted a pre-registered comparative survey-based study with a sample of young Slovak adults (N = 873) to compare evaluations of three commonly used migrant categorizations in Slovakia - "refugees", "migrants", and "foreigners" - on multiple attitudinal and behavioural measures. In addition, we also tested the intergroup contact hypothesis about the relationship between participants' evaluations and their experiences of direct, extended, and mass-mediated contact with these target groups. We found that "refugees" invoked less favourable feelings, attitudes, trust, and greater social distance compared to "migrants" and "foreigners". These evaluations related to the valence (and less to the quantity) of participants' experience of intergroup contact. These results challenge previous findings about public opinion preferences for "refugees" over "migrants", support the intergroup contact hypothesis, and make a case for a more contextualized research.

AB  - While workplace leadership is widely discussed in the management literature, less is known about the outcomes and influence process of leaders, under which xenophobic behaviours are generating. In other words, even if xenophobia is likely to be generated from economic losses and social factors according to literature, leadership can deliberately produce a "hostile environment" for mi- grant employees. This paper scrutinizes the effect of paternalistic leadership and its dimensions on xenophobia in the context of business organizations. Besides, the life satisfaction factor has been functionalized as a moderator in this process. Cross-sectional survey data (n=395) were obtained from employees and analysed with a variance-based structural equation modelling (VB-SEM) and multivariate regression technique. Research findings prevail that paternalis- tic leadership significantly decreases personal or individual fears, on the other hand; it increases political and cultural fears against "others" in organizations. To avoid xenophobia, a special effort should be made to ensure that the relevant styles and broader organizational context are accurately assessed when reducing fear against others.

AB  - Research on the metrological characteristics of linguistic quantitative characteristics (LQCs) based on corpus and metrological linguistic methods has gained wide attention in artificial and online machine translations. Although a support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms in the field of text analysis, its application in the study of translation style is rare. This study compares the translation styles of Pride and Prejudice with ML using different linguistic measurement features. Firstly, the language measurement features of three translations are obtained with the information gain algorithm. Specifically, the corpus can be achieved through human-machine interaction (HCI), i.e., computers can look, hear, touch, smell, taste, and speak using sensors such as cameras and mathematical algorithms. Then a text classifier, i.e., an SVM, is constructed on the basis of these features to automatically classify the translated texts of the three translations. Finally, the validity of the classifier is verified by the tenfold cross-validation method. It is proved that the SVM algorithm has high classification accuracy and a strong predictive function, which is helpful for judging or predicting the translation or translator's style. Compared with the traditional method, this classification method based on an SVM saves time and effort, the process can be repeated, and the result is accurate and reliable.

AB  - In two studies, we investigated how intersecting social categories shape views of immigrants in the United States. In Study 1, we analyzed 310 attributes generated by 92 participants for the category of immigrant and 30 additional immigrant groups with intersecting social categories (e.g. "undocumented immigrant") reflecting various levels of social status. Using the Meaning Extraction Method (MEM) and factor analysis to examine shared meanings, we identified five factors; further comparative analyses of immigrant groups focused on the first two factors (Vulnerable vs. Hardworking, Drain vs. Asset). The importance of legal status for judgments on these two factors was evident in comparisons of the generic immigrant with four specific legal intersections. An examination of all 31 groups of immigrants showed that higher status groups were perceived as Hardworking (less Vulnerable) and high national Assets (low Drain), while lower status groups varied in Vulnerability perceptions but were generally thought to be Drains on the nation rather than Assets. In Study 2, 270 participants evaluated intersectional immigrant social categories that differed in combinations of higher status (privileged) and lower status (marginalized) social group memberships, using scales based on the terms identified by the factors in Study 1. Participants rated immigrant groups with two privileged statuses as less vulnerable and more likely to be an asset to the nation than immigrant groups with two marginalized or mixed statuses. The utility of a bottom-up intersectional approach to assess stereotype content of immigrant groups is discussed.

AB  - Islam is becoming an increasingly prevalent religion in Europe due to large inflows of Muslims over the last few decades. Previous social survey research suggests that the European public is critical of immigration from Muslim countries with concerns relating to integration and security. Using the 7th round of the European Social Survey and linking it to other data sources, this paper examines whether threat hypotheses can explain anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe. The study finds that opposition to Muslims is significantly higher than opposition to migrants in general, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe. The threat hypothesis is not supported on a country level as counties with higher "stock" of Muslim population and higher number of Islamic terrorist attacks are more welcoming towards further Muslim immigration. Furthermore, the study finds that women are more opposed to Muslim immigration than men. The wider implications of these findings and alternative explanations are discussed.

AB  - This study examines a set of unique isolated lived-experiences to offer some general observations concerning Afghan-Hazara migration, relocation, and individuation in Australia. Culture may have the appearance of immutability. However, like any social formation, it is produced, reproduced, and contested through time. Everyone is an individual, and while we speak of the impact and culture, lived-experience is very different. People always have choices they can make about what lessons they might derive from experiences. If one faces discrimination within the realm of the state, which is historically well documented where Hazaras are concerned, one begins looking for alternative pathways to advancement. These include personalised networks in religious communities, education, and business entrepreneurship. The study analyses the fluid nature of belief systems, and the multiplicity of ways lived-experience shapes individuation and reshapes identity through pathways to advancement in a globalising Australia.

AB  - Introduction. - Teachers tend to develop negative expectations and behaviours towards students coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
   Objective. - The objective of this study was to test the influence of teacher political orientation, as well as their attachment to power and universalism values, on their predictions of academic success towards students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
   Method. - Eighty-eight high school teachers (M-age = 38.04 years; 44.3% men) responded to a questionnaire of political ideology and values, as well as to a questionnaire evaluating their prediction of success towards male high school students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
   Results. - Teachers predicted a better academic success for students coming from a high socioeconomic background. Despite relatively small effect size, political ideology, as well as attachment to power and universalism values, predicted the bias of judgment.
   Conclusion. - Taking into consideration teachers' ideology and values would deepen understanding of processes underlying expectations development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - A robust stream of research has shown the detrimental influence of slurs and derogatory epithets on attitudes toward minority groups. Extending prior work, we explored the influence of positive labels ascribed to the majority group on the evaluation of the minority group. Specifically, three studies tested the possibility that the label "straight," generally linked with the concept of morality, would promote a negative evaluation of gay men. Study 1 exposed English speakers to an individual person described as straight (vs. heterosexual) while Study 2 exposed English speakers to a target person described as straight (vs. heterosexual vs. no label). Study 3 considered a non-English sample (i.e., Italian adults) and experimentally induced the association between the straight label and the concept of heterosexuality. In each study, participants were asked to express their attitudes toward a gay target after the manipulation. Results showed that heterosexual participants exposed to the label "straight" reported more negative attitudes toward gay men than heterosexual participants exposed to the label "heterosexual" (or when they were not exposed to any label). Critically, such an effect emerged only among highly religious participants. Implications for policies and prejudice reduction are discussed.

AB  - This paper highlights the potential roles of implicit bias and implicit association testing (IAT) in the practice of reflexivity. In the paper, eight leisure scholars reflected on their explicit and implicit prejudice and privilege and its influence on their efforts to conduct critical leisure research. Data were collected from these scholars in three stages. First, participant-researchers engaged in a 'conscious,' written, personal reflexive exercise considering their biases and how these biases influenced their research. Second, participants completed four IATs - a parallel 'unconscious' reflexive exercise. Third, participants individually and collectively reflected on results of the IATs in relation to their conscious responses. The authors report results from thematic analyses of these reflections; consider practical opportunities, challenges, and cautions associated with using implicit measures to denote one's positionality; and initiate a theory driven discussion of broader uses of implicit measures in critical leisure research.

In three studies using data from samples drawn from nationally representative panels in the Netherlands (additionally analyzed in an internal meta-analysis ofN = 1,791), it was found that deprovincialization is a unique and robust predictor of support for immigrant rights, above and beyond prejudicial feelings, political orientation, level of education, gender, age, and religious affiliation. Furthermore, deprovincialization was found to be independent of national identification, which in previous research has been used as a proxy for deprovincialization. Additionally and in trying to conceptually replicate the pattern of findings (Studies 2 and 3), two different measures of perceived concern about the continuity of the in-group culture and identity were found to weaken the deprovincialization-support association. The findings go beyond existing research by focusing on the cultural openness understanding of deprovincialization and demonstrating the robust importance of how majority members understand their in-group for their support of immigrants' practices and rights.

AB  - Most research documenting bias against older adults has been conducted in individualistic and industrialized cultures. In the current study, we examined cultural variation in attitudes toward older adults and subjective age in a large sample of 911,982 participants (M-age= 27.42,SD= 12.23; 67.6% women) from 68 different countries (M-size= 12,077;Mdn(size)= 425.5). We hypothesized that age bias would be lower among those living in highly collectivistic countries. We found that living in collectivistic countries was associated with less implicit and explicit age bias, and greater feelings of warmth toward older adults compared with highly individualistic countries. Given the impact of age bias and prejudice on both the targets and perpetrators of bias, further research is needed to examine the causes of and interventions for bias against older adults.

AB  - We examine the extent to which relevant social identity traits shared between two individuals-what we term "attribute affinity"-can moderate out-group hostility. We argue that in-group affinity is a powerful force in shaping preferences over potential immigrants. We focus on two closely related, yet distinct, dimensions of identity: religion and religiosity. Using evidence from three surveys that included two embedded experiments, we show that sharing strength in religious practice can diminish strong aversion to immigrants of different religious affiliations. We find that, among highly religious U.S. natives, anti-Muslim bias is lower toward very religious Muslims, compared to non-religious Muslims. This attenuating effect of attribute affinity with respect to religiosity on anti-Muslim bias presents the strongest evidence supporting our argument.

AB  - This study investigated the moderation effect of contact with gay men and lesbian women on the relationship between religiosity levels with the endorsement of same-sex unions' and families' rights. Analyses were carried out on a national representative cross-sectional sample of 5,544 Italian adult residents (% females = 54). Multiple linear regressions coupled with an examination of the interaction between contact and religiosity showed that contact mitigated the negative relationship between religiosity and endorsement of same-sex unions' and families' rights, especially at lower rather than higher levels of religiosity. These results are important in terms of understandings of the relationship between religiosity and policy preference regarding same-sex unions' and families' rights. Contact can promote equality for gay men and lesbian women but different susceptibility levels persist between highly and less religious individuals in this respect.

AB  - In the past few years, millions have been forced to leave their homes seeking refuge in other countries, most displaced from Muslim majority countries. The inflow of refugees and recent terrorist attacks in Europe may have reinforced prejudice against Muslim immigrants in Europe. Research on these issues is almost non-existent in Iceland. Using a random sample of 3.360 individuals in late 2019 and a survey-based experimental design, we address several questions related to attitudes towards Muslim immigrants and refugees in Iceland. Our results indicate that just over half of the population is willing to accept more refugees than is currently done and does not want to limit the proportion of Muslims among them. Notwithstanding, about 44% of the public believe that the risk of terrorism will increase if Iceland accepts more immigrants from Muslim majority countries. Political orientation and education are associated with attitudes toward refugees, an association that is partly mediated through stereotypes of Muslims as a security threat. The findings also show that people who are informed that research finds no link between the number of Muslim immigrants and the risk of terrorism are less likely to stereotype Muslim immigrants as a security threat than people who get no such information. This type of information has similar effects on people irrespective of their political orientation. Consequently, the current study does not support the proposition that right-leaning individuals in Iceland are more distrustful of scientific in-yformation than those on the left. The effects are, however, significantly contingent on education.

A study was conducted with 655 cis women (471 heterosexuals, 179 bisexuals and lesbians) and 174 cis men (120 heterosexuals, 54 bisexuals and gays). Descriptive, multivariate analysis of variance, bivariate correlations and multiple regression were used. In general, the groups of men and heterosexuals obtained higher negativity scores and lower acceptance scores, with significant correlations being more frequent in the heterosexual group. Predictive models confirmed the literature on social and ideological conservatism.

AB  - The presence of adolescents with immigrant backgrounds in Spain is a structural phenomenon with major implications and challenges for intergroup coexistence. The purpose of this study is to analyse the possible existence of psychosocial profiles in these adolescents. Using latent class cluster models (LCCM), profiles were identified where these adolescents can be situated according to their responses to variables related to acculturation (preferences, perceptions, identity) and adaptation (life satisfaction and school adjustment), using sex, ethnocultural group, place of birth and perceived discrimination as covariates. Participants were 683 adolescents with immigrant backgrounds between the ages of 12 and 19 (56% girls) enrolled in public secondary schools in five provinces in Spain. The results show the existence of three psychosocial profiles (bicultural, ethnic and national), with national being the least common. Even though the bicultural profile (orientation towards both cultures) is the most adaptive, positive results were found with all three profiles, which indicates a moderate adaptive acculturation process.

AB  - Increasingly severe environmental issues, especially those in developing countries such as China, drive the evolution of the environmental protection institution (EPI) to its strictest levels. However, the implementation of the strictest EPI still confronts various challenges and barriers, and the multi-stakeholder features of EPI determine these barriers are not independent of one another but rather present complex interactive relationships. This paper identifies the barriers to implementing China's EPI from four aspects of environmental legal, economic, regulatory, and public participation institutions. A variable precision rough DEMATEL approach is proposed to visualize the causal relationships and intensities among barriers from the similarities and differences in perspectives of stakeholders from the government, company, and public levels. The obtained causal interactive mechanism among barriers highlights the need to prioritize the improvement of environmental policy assessment, and the concrete measures in policies or plans should be integrated into legislation to ensure they are mutually supportive early. The non-substantive contributions achieved by China's public participation in environmental protection reveal prejudices that the public is often regarded as a supporter or spectator by both government and company groups, which makes the transparent environmental information disclosure, transfer and feedback into an effective mediation among stakeholders. Comprehensive coordination and feedback mechanisms including source prevention, process control, and severe punishment for consequences while enhancing linkages among stakeholders are put forward to overcome barriers and help implement the strictest EPI.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this article is to examine whether refugee flows are associated with an increase in electoral support for populist-right parties. The empirical evidence on this so far remains mixed. This article argues that refugee inflows alone are an inaccurate predictor of the success of populist-right parties. Rather, refugee inflows can lead to a rise in electoral support for populist-right parties where traditional welfare states are expansive-the so-called welfare chauvinism argument, wherein natives already dependent on high levels of social welfare are likely to see refugees as interlopers who free-ride on welfare and thereby threaten the welfare of locals. Methods This article deploys Tobit and OLS fixed effect estimators in panel data covering 27 OECD countries during the period 1990-2014 (25 years). Results There is no evidence to suggest that refugee inflows per se increase electoral support for populist-right parties. However, a positive effect of refugee inflows on electoral support for populist-right parties is conditional upon a higher degree of social welfare spending, which supports the propositions of "welfare chauvinism." Moreover, support for populist-right parties increases when the degree of labor market regulation and welfare spending is high. These results are robust to alternative data, sample, and estimation techniques. Conclusion The results suggest that societies with higher levels of social protection through high taxes might fuel "welfare chauvinism," in which the segments of native population fear significant welfare losses from inflow of refugees.

AB  - Anti-immigration preferences among educated and racially egalitarian voters is hard to explain using existing frameworks of self-interest or prejudice. I address this puzzle by developing a theory ofparochial altruism, which stipulates that voters are motivated to help others at a cost, but they prioritize helping compatriots. I hypothesize that parochial altruists or voters high in both "nationalism"and"altruism" are more supportive of immigration restrictions perceived to be in the national interest. However, parochial altruists are also expected to be more supportive ofincreasingimmigration when it benefits their compatriots. I test my theory by conducting a population-based UK survey. Using a novel measure of elicited preferences, I first find most altruists who donate to domestic rather than global charities are as anti-immigration as egoists who do not donate at all. Using a conjoint experiment, I then show voters support increasing immigration when these alternative policies benefit their compatriots.

AB  - The student population in American public schools has become increasingly diverse; however, the teacher workforce remains primarily White (80%). The purpose of the current paper was to examine the relationship between student-teacher racial composition and perceptions of school climate and the impact of Whiteness on the educational outcomes of minoritized students and their counterparts. Findings from the study indicate that more than 90 percent of the minoritized students in the sample are being educated by a majority White teaching staff. White students' perceptions of cultural acceptance and connectedness increased as the number of White teachers increased. However, there was no effect for minoritized students. For minoritized students, perceptions of school climate did increase as the number of minoritized students increased. Recommendations for addressing ways to create more equitable learning environments for minoritized students and address and reduce teacher bias are discussed.

AB  - The transition to college is a stressful experience. For members of underrepresented minority groups, the usual stresses are frequently accompanied by ethnicity-based stressors, including discrimination. This longitudinal study extends prior work on discrimination by examining the prospective associations between anticipated and experienced ethnic/racial discrimination and sleep, a ubiquitous and basic biological need critical for optimal functioning. In a sample of 274 low-income/first-generation Latinx students, results from a cross-lagged panel model revealed that both the anticipation and experience of discrimination at the beginning of college uniquely predicted worsening sleep quality over the second half of freshmen year, controlling for relevant covariates. There was also some evidence for bidirectionality, with poor sleepers experiencing more discrimination. These findings add to the literature linking discrimination and sleep, both of which play large roles in mental, physical, social, and academic outcomes.

AB  - How does local economic inequality affect the native-immigrant gap in immigration attitudes? Existing studies do not distinguish between native and immigrant citizens, which is problematic because immigrants represent an increasing share of the population and voting public. Immigrant citizens, as legal residents, receive the same legal and social protections as native citizens. However, as an out-group, they are less likely to be attached to the national and cultural identity of a host country. This paper uses the Australian Election Study to show that immigrant citizens prioritise cultural or psychological considerations in forming immigration attitudes. As local economic inequality rises, immigrant citizens' support for immigration strengthens regardless of their country of origin, reason for migration and length of stay in Australia.

AB  - Voters use heuristics to help them make decisions when they lack information about political choices. Candidate appearance operates as a powerful low-information cue. However, widely held stereotypes mean that reliance on such a heuristic can reduce support for candidates of color. We argue that racial prejudices are more likely to dominate decision making when electoral environments require voters to expend more cognitive resources-such as when they must choose multiple candidates at once. Using two experiments we find that black candidates receive less support from cognitively taxed voters than from voters who have the cognitive space to intentionally limit their prejudices when voting. We also reveal that this pattern is particularly evident among ideologically liberal voters. Respondents who profess politically liberal views support black candidates more often than white candidates when the cognitive task is simple but are less likely to do so when they are cognitively taxed.

AB  - Training has shown little effectiveness in altering harassing or discriminatory behavior. Limitations of prior intervention efforts may reflect poor conceptualization of the problems involved, poor training intervention design, approaches that engender cynicism, or misunderstanding psychological principles of attitude and behavior change. Interventions should capitalize on behavioral science models and tools at multiple levels from a broad array of disciplines to explain harassment and bias, and then to defeat these behaviors. Measures to ensure fair treatment should focus on leadership socialization, organizational culture and climate, increased professional competence, and integration with organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility and performance.

AB  - Locker rooms operate as pivotal access points to physical activity across sports, physical education, and fitness facilities. However, locker rooms are predicated on cis-heterosexual assumptions that can be isolating to LGBTQ+ individuals. Using an online cross-sectional survey, LGBTQ+ adults (N = 1,067) were asked open-response questions about their past and present locker-room experiences. The resulting texts were independently coded by two researchers using thematic analysis and compared. All discrepancies were discussed with and rectified by a third researcher who acted as a critical peer. The results present distinct experiences across three intersecting aspects of embodiment: self-conscious-"I hate(d) being seen," sexual transgression, and gender transgression. The findings provide insight into how harmful LGBTQ+ stereotypes influence lockerroom experiences and support the redesign of locker rooms to challenge the binary organization of these spaces.

AB  - The Chinese are one of the largest migrant groups in Central-Eastern Europe. While governments have welcomed these newcomers, we do not know whether locals share this sentiment. This is because we have not had the requisite data. In this article, I address this shortcoming. I draw on two oft-cited explanations in the migration literature to examine public attitudes toward the Chinese. The first is about competition over scarce economic resources; the second is about conflicts between two distinct cultures. Using two different survey samples, I find strong evidence to corroborate the second hypothesis. Attitudes toward the Chinese are generally negative when the aggregate Chinese population is large. Public discourse (i.e., passive contact) reinforces cultural stereotypes. There is, however, a caveat: An increasing Chinese presence in a person's neighbourhood (i.e., active contact) can offset these negative effects. As the spatial gap between the two cultures closes, the social ones correspondingly narrow.

AB  - For years, experts have blamed Strickland v. Washington's lax standard for assessing trial attorney effectiveness for many of the criminal justice system's problems. But the conventional understanding of Strickland as a problem for ineffectiveness claims gives the decision too much prominence because it treats Strickland as the test for all such claims. That is a mistake. Properly understood, the Supreme Court has recognized four different constitutional forms of trial attorney ineffectiveness, and Strickland's two-pronged test applies to only one of the four. If litigants and courts would notice this complexity and relegate Strickland to its proper place, it would pave the way for meritorious ineffectiveness claims of the other. three kinds. This Article disaggregates strands of Sixth Amendment doctrine that others have jumbled together to enable courts and litigants to confine Strickland to its proper domain and use more appropriate analyses elsewhere.
   The Article also explains why additional disaggregation is necessary within the category of cases where Strickland rightly applies. Implicitly, the Supreme Court has created not one but three tests for assessing deficient performance within that domain, and it has indicated a willingness to soften the outcome-determinative prejudice prong as well. Failure to recognize these different forms of Strickland ineffectiveness has made the test seem much harder for defendants to satisfy than needs to be true. Recognizing these complexities, and applying the right test in the right case, is necessary if individual defendants are to be treated fairly and systemic constitutional problems in the provision of indigent defense services are to be addressed.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine whether Israeli gay men reported higher interpersonal vulnerability in comparison with matched Israeli heterosexual men and to further assess the association between interpersonal vulnerability and depressive symptoms as a function of sexual orientation. Israeli gay men (N = 474) were individually matched with Israeli heterosexual men (N = 474) who completed measures of hostile-world scenario (HWS) in the interpersonal domain and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that gay men reported higher interpersonal vulnerability and higher depressive symptoms in comparison with heterosexual men. Also, a stronger positive association was found between interpersonal vulnerability and depressive symptoms among gay, in comparison with heterosexual, men. The findings may be explained in terms of minority stress, stigma, family and peer rejection, as well as discriminatory local policies regarding sexual minority rights, which serve as potential contributors to more interpersonal concerns and more depressive symptoms among gay, in comparison with heterosexual, men.

AB  - Studies have provided empirical evidence, that teachers' judgments of students' academic performance are biased by social stereotypes. Thus, in the present study it was tested whether the impact of stereotypes about immigrant students, students with a low socioeconomic status and male students on preservice teachers' evaluations can be reduced by a counterstereotypic training. For this purpose, one hundred and forty-seven preservice teachers first read a short text in which a fifth grader male student was described who could respectively be allocated to one of these three stereotypical categories. Half of the participants then completed the training. After that, all subjects were asked to evaluate an essay of the fictive target and to give a prognosis about his level of graduation. The results showed that the training led to a reduction of the stereotype-based judgment bias only with regard to the gender stereotype. Accordingly, in the training condition the male target's essay was marked better and the prognosis of his level of graduation was higher than in the no-training condition. No training effects were found for the other two stereotypes. The implications of the study are discussed with regard to teacher education and vocational trainings.

AB  - The large inflow of asylum-seekers in recent years has heralded a diversification in adopted asylum policies across European societies. Although a growing body of research has addressed these versatile approaches and their implications for the European integration project, insight into the social basis of these restrictive or open asylum policies remains underdeveloped. Hence, the current study provides detailed insight into public preferences for asylum policies and offers a new understanding of how these attitudes are affected by diverging socio-economic realities across Europe. In addition, this paper considers the role of individual factors that coincide with publicly adopted frames in contemporary asylum debates. In particular, to explain how contextual differences reflect on opinion climates, the impacts of the policy, economic, and migratory context are studied. On the individual-level, we focus on threat perception and human values, which represent humanitarian, economic, and cultural frames. To explore these relations, data on 20 countries from the European Social Survey Round 8 (2016) are analyzed through a multilevel structural equation modeling approach. Results indicate that, on the contextual-level, only unemployment rates have a significant impact and, rather surprisingly, lower unemployment rates provoke a more negative opinion climate. Yet, this relationship seems to be largely driven by some specific countries that are characterized by large unemployment rates and relatively positive opinion climates simultaneously. The migratory and policy context, on the other hand, do not influence attitudes toward asylum policy. This indicates that it is not necessarily the countries facing the largest inflow of asylum-seekers or issuing the most positive decisions on asylum applications that have the most restrictive opinion climates. As shown by the important roles of human values and threat perceptions, which represent widely adopted frames, public discourses seem much more important in explaining attitudes toward asylum policy across Europe.

AB  - Bisexual individuals experience unique forms of discrimination related to their sexual orientation (e.g., anti-bisexual prejudice), which occurs from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals. Bisexual individuals may experience stigma differently depending on the gender of their relationship or sexual partners, because they may be perceived as heterosexual if they have a partner of a different gender and as gay/lesbian if they have a partner of the same gender. The present longitudinal study investigated within-persons differences in anti-bisexual experiences, internalized binegativity, and bisexual identity affirmation based on the gender of participants' serious relationship partners and gender of sex partners in a sample of 180 young bisexual men. Results indicated that young bisexual men experienced more interpersonal hostility from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals when their serious relationship partner was female. No significant differences were found in other types of anti-bisexual prejudice, internalized binegativity, or bisexual identity affirmation by serious partner gender. For sexual partner gender, men who had only male sex partners experienced more sexual orientation instability attitudes from heterosexual and lesbian/gay individuals; men with only female sex partners experienced more sexual irresponsibility attitudes from heterosexuals, but not from lesbian/gay individuals; and, like those with female serious relationship partners, men with only female sex partners had more frequent experiences of interpersonal hostility from heterosexual and lesbian/gay individuals. Results indicate that bisexual men experience unique forms of prejudice based on the gender of their relationship and sexual partners. Implications for the mental health of bisexual men are discussed.

AB  - Despite considerable efforts, the determinants of firm growth and financial market volatility have not been definitively identified, yet sets of stylized facts - most notably power-law distributions - relating to firm size and market returns suggest both evolve as part of a complex system. This scenario implies that a positive feedback loop between firms and investors exists and may be responsible for prejudicing the way management allocates their resources, with firm, and economic, growth adversely affected. Further, there are growing real-world concerns that the management of publicly listed firms is becoming too concerned with the movement of their firm's share price, which is adversely influencing resource allocation decisions. A related concern is that agents, in general, within financial markets are placing a disproportionate focus on short-term factors. To investigate the ramifications of the proposed feedback loop on firm growth and market volatility, this paper implements a novel agent-based artificial stock market where management can consider the movements of their firm's endogenously determined share price when allocating resources between sales and margin growth. The results highlight an inferior outcome regarding firm growth, and various other financial metrics, if management is overly concerned with share price movements. The growth of the firms (and market) is also affected by the mixture of the investor classes initiated due to the divergent levels of volatility they create. Additionally, the model presents insights into how and why the extent to which agents consider past outcomes in their decision-making process becomes influential. Notably, the model's results emulate an extensive set of global micro-level firm data. By providing significant insights on the effects of the stock market on management decision-making and its ramifications for firm growth, this paper provides crucial insights into the mechanisms responsible for inefficient behavior by market participants.

AB  - Using a lab experiment that simulates a labor market, we investigate racial discrimination for employee selection. We find discrimination against Blacks persists even when information about candidates' past performance/abilities is known. The experiment design allows us to observe within-subject variation in discrimination based on different available information about candidates, which helps distinguish between statistical and taste-based discrimination. We find evidence of discrimination by Non-Blacks against Blacks whenever race is salient. Some hiring discrimination against Blacks is statistical, since it is based on distrust of applicants' self-reported abilities, and is also present in the discrimination of Blacks against their own group. But discrimination by Non-Blacks against Blacks is likely taste-based as it endures when more accurate information about abilities is known and even when such discrimination is costly. We suggest that the institutional and social climate may shape the prevalence of this type of discrimination.

AB  - Fair treatment and social acceptance are paramount to human well-being, yet, society often withholds these crucial needs and discriminates against certain groups, including ex-prisoners. Discrimination and lack of social support by the public reduces ex-prisoners' well-being and threatens successful reintegration into society after release from prison, perpetuating conflict and impeding social justice. Identifying strategies to reduce discrimination against ex-prisoners and to foster prosocial behaviors towards them is therefore of high relevance. Building on past evidence, we assess the viability of a values affirmation intervention given to members of the general public to reduce their discrimination against ex-prisoners and to foster prosocial motivation towards them. Across two studies in two cultural contexts, Nigeria and the United States, we provide evidence that engaging in values affirmation can significantly reduce discriminatory behavioral tendencies, for instance in the employment sector, and motivate prosociality towards ex-prisoners, such as supporting educational rehabilitation programs. These results point towards a potential avenue for shifting the public's discriminatory views and behavioral tendencies towards ex-prisoners, in an effort to support reintegration and to further social justice.

AB  - Simple Summary It has been shown that people within the horse industry have preconceived ideas about horse behaviour, temperament and rideability, based solely on the sex of the horse. Such ideas can have welfare implications, if personnel allow bias to affect their interactions with particular horses. Such welfare implications include employment of harsher training methods, and increased horse wastage. The current study explored data on riders' and trainers' reports of ridden horse behaviour. Reported sex-related behavioural differences were evaluated based on 1233 responses from the pilot study of the Equine Behaviour and Research Questionnaire (E-BARQ) survey. Results from the study suggest there are some sex-related differences in behaviour between male and female horses; geldings are more likely to chew on rugs and lead ropes when tied, and mares are more likely to move away when being caught in paddock. However, there was no evidence of sex-related differences associated with behaviour when ridden which may warrant further investigation. Findings from this study may be used to educate riders and trainers about the need to regard behaviour and motivation in ridden horses as sex-neutral.
   Abstract Horse trainers and riders may have preconceived ideas of horse temperament based solely on the sex of the horse. A study (n = 1233) of horse enthusiasts (75% of whom had more than 8 years of riding experience) revealed that riders prefer geldings over mares and stallions. While these data may reflect different sex preferences in horses used for sport, they may also reduce the chances of some horses reaching their performance potential. Further, an unfounded sex prejudice is likely to contribute to unconscious bias when perceiving unwanted behaviours, simplistically attributing them to demographic characteristics rather than more complex legacies of training and prior learning. The current study analysed reported sex-related behavioural differences in ridden and non-ridden horses using data from responses to the pilot study of the Equine Behaviour Assessment and Research Questionnaire (E-BARQ) survey. Respondents (n = 1233) reported on the behaviour of their horse using a 151-item questionnaire. Data were searched for responses relating to mares and geldings, and 110 traits with the greatest percentage difference scores between mares and geldings were selected were tested for univariate significance at p < 0.2. Multivariable modelling of the effect of sex (mare or gelding) on remaining traits was assessed by ordinal logistic regression, using a cumulative proportional log odds model. Results revealed mares were significantly more likely to move away when being caught compared to geldings (p = 0.003). Geldings were significantly more likely to chew on lead ropes when tied (p = 0.003) and to chew on rugs (p = 0.024). However, despite sex-related differences in these non-ridden behaviours, there was no evidence of any significant sex-related differences in the behaviours of the horses when ridden. This finding suggests that ridden horse behaviour is not sexually dimorphic or that particular horse sports variously favour one sex over another.

AB  - Prior research has found that indirectly measured preference for White people over Black people is positively related to categorizing angry racially ambiguous faces as Black. This past work found no evidence that directly measured racial preferences predict this racial categorization bias (RCB), suggesting that the RCB could be a unique and easily administered tool for investigating automatic evaluation and validating automatic evaluation measures. In two studies (total N > 7,000), using structural equation models that account for error variance, multiple indirect evaluation measures were uniquely related to the RCB, thus bolstering their predictive validity. However, the RCB also correlated with self-reported evaluation, leaving psychologists without a robust, replicable outcome uniquely related to automatic evaluation. The lack of such an outcome hinders theoretical and practical progress in research on implicit social cognition.

AB  - Research on inter-group attribution and ultimate attribution error has mostly focused on religious and ethnic groups. However, in view of the distinct nature of Indian social structure, this study examined inter-group attributions in caste context. The study was conducted with university students belonging to two caste groups. A total of 95 students participated in the study: 51 from General Caste category and 44 from Scheduled Caste category. Hypothetical situations were used to record attributions made for the success and failure of both in-group and out-group along the dimensions of locus of causality, stability, and controllability. Results indicated that General Caste category participants showed no inter-group attribution bias. Moreover, Scheduled Caste category participants showed a pattern of in-group derogation. These results are explained in terms of role of education and ideology in influencing the inter-group attribution process, suggesting that ultimate attribution error is not universal.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of intergroup contact on processing of own- and other-race faces using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Previous studies have shown a neural ownrace effect with greater BOLD response to own race compared to other race faces. In our study, white participants completed a social-categorization task and an individuation task while viewing the faces of both black and white strangers after having answered questions about their previous experiences with black people. We found that positive contact modulated BOLD activity in the right fusiform gyrus (rFG) and left inferior occipital gyrus (lIOC), regions associated with face processing. Within these regions, higher positive contact was associated with higher activity when processing black, compared to white faces during the social categorisation task. We also found that in both regions a greater amount of individuating experience with black people was associated with greater activation for black vs. white faces in the individuation task. Quantity of contact, implicit racial bias and negatively valenced contact showed no effects. Our findings suggest that positive contact and individuating experience directly modulate processing of out-group faces in the visual cortex, and illustrate that contact quality rather than mere familiarity is an important factor in reducing the own race face effect.

AB  - Aims To understand the working experiences and career trajectories of male nurses in China.
   Background Compared with developed countries, men were far more under-represented in the nursing profession in China. Little is known about the working experiences of Chinese male nurses and the contextual factors that contribute to their low participation rate in the nursing profession.
   Methods In-depth interviews with twenty-five male nurses and two hospital administrators were conducted. All interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results Chinese male nurses had better career prospects and promotion chances compared with female nurses. The extremely low participation rate of men in nursing was related to the prejudice among the general public as well as the low professional status and salary. Two unique contextual factors influenced the career trajectories of male nurses in China: (1) the major assignment mechanism in the college entrance examination and (2) the implementation of the two-child policy.
   Conclusion Although Chinese male nurses enjoyed many advantages compared with female nurses, they also encountered many difficulties related to working in a female-dominated profession.
   Implications for Nursing Management Appropriate measures should be taken to shift public attitudes towards male nurses, improve the professionalization of nursing and promote gender diversity and equity.

AB  - This research seeks to bridge two findings-on the one hand, top-down controlled processes inhibit display of intergroup bias; on the other one hand, sleep deprivation impairs cognitive control processes. Connecting these two proven statements, begs the question: would sleep deprivation also influence intergroup bias? This intriguing link has hardly been explored in extant literature. To fill this gap, we theorize through the lens of social identity. Previous research has shown that individuals who share a common identity with an outgroup are more motivated to inhibit biases toward the outgroup than do their counterparts who do not endorse such common identity. We predicted that this motivated inhibition would be compromised by sleep deprivation. Across two studies, as predicted, we found that only when an individual has adequate sleep did common ingroup identity attenuate the display of intergroup bias, whereas individuals with short habitual sleep (study 1) or after one-night sleep deprivation (study 2) displayed equally high levels of intergroup bias regardless of their high or low levels of common ingroup identity. In the global context of incessant intergroup bias and diminishing sleep time, our findings offer new insights for understanding and handling intergroup bias.

AB  - This article critically engages with the voices of South Asian, Muslim women living in Rotherham to provide an emic gaze (Pike, 1967) of the intersectional lived experience of the 'cultural others'. Everyday voices of South Asian, Muslim women activists living in the UK are marginalised based on prejudicial cultural assumptions. We demonstrate our challenge of negative discourses of the 'passive and culturally oppressed female'. Our activism confronts racism predicated on cultural stereotypes embedded in state structures in contemporary Britain. This article explores the actions and tensions of confronting racism by South Asian, Muslim women living in Rotherham.

AB  - Weight bias is a neglected issue in the health professions, including mental health training programs. Even though mental health professionals exhibit many of the same weight biases that are seen at the societal level and among other health professionals, mental health programs rarely provide training on weight bias, weight diversity, or critical weight science. No study to date has tested the effectiveness of a weight bias reduction intervention in a mental health setting. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a weight bias seminar informed by the attribution-value model of prejudice. Using a pretest-posttest design, 45 clinical psychology trainees completed measures of weight controllability beliefs, anti-fat attitudes, and attitudes toward fat clients 1 week before and 1 week after the weight bias seminar. After the weight bias seminar, participants reported weaker weight controllability beliefs, anti-fat attitudes, and negative client attitudes. Furthermore, weight controllability beliefs mediated the effect of the weight bias seminar on participants' general anti-fat attitudes and client-specific attitudes. Thus, this study identifies weight controllability beliefs as a potential mechanism underlying the efficacy of educational weight bias interventions in mental health training programs. Future weight bias educational interventions may benefit from application of the attribution-value model of prejudice.

AB  - Background: Although earlier studies have indicated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals are at greater risk of psychiatric symptoms than heterosexual individuals, limited attention has been paid to the mental health disparities within LGB populations, especially in non-Western societies. This study examined the disparities in depression, anxiety, and mental well-being between gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals and investigated how the disparities are explained by the greater sexual identity stress experienced by bisexual individuals compared to their gay and lesbian counterparts.
   Methods: The study sample included 931 cisgender LGB individuals in Hong Kong, with 70.1% identifying as gay/lesbian and 29.9% identifying as bisexual. They completed a self-report questionnaire on sexual identity stress and mental health.
   Results: Bisexual individuals showed higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than lesbians and gay men. Structural equation modeling showed that, compared with lesbians and gay men, bisexual individuals were more likely to report identity uncertainty, conceal their sexual orientation, and have a weaker sense of connection to the LGBT community, which were in turn associated with greater affective symptoms and poorer mental well-being.
   Limitations: The use of cross-sectional data does not allow conclusions on causal relationships among variables.
   Conclusions: Given the greater vulnerability of bisexual individuals to common mental health problems, evidence-based psychological interventions that strategically target their identity stress at multiple levels should be developed and made available to those in need. Social and psychoeducational interventions are also necessary to transform the monosexist culture and eradicate binegativity in the LGBT and wider communities.

T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The current work argues that expressing out-group ambivalence based on cognitive information is a strategy to justify one's one's prejudice, which may ultimately "cover" the discriminatory nature of out-group-directed negative action tendencies, depending on individuals' in-group 'attachment' and 'glorification' levels. As expected, after expressing prejudice in a normative context inducing prejudice suppression (a) high-glorification participants were more prone to out-group-directed aggression, and (b) high-attachment participants were more prone to out-group-directed avoidance, when such action tendencies were self-reported after the expression of ambivalent beliefs but not emotions concerning the out-group.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that the general personality structure predisposes the political or ideological orientation. Here, we first replicated findings of associations between Big Five factors openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and self-reported political orientation in a large German sample. However, the new aspect of our study is the addition of Wahl-O-Mat (WoM; a prominent voting advice application) as a measure of concrete policy-positions. Here, a score of accordance between a participant's and the several German parties' stances on current and relevant policy-issues is computed. Given that political science identifies trends towards a dealignment of voters with political parties and a decreasing significance of socio-structural factors, an issue-based approach to vote choice may become critical in the future. Therefore, we investigated whether personality's influence on political orientation also extends to stances about specific issues and, thus, is not restricted to self-placements. As expected, WoM-scores also showed meaningful correlations with personality traits: accordance with right-of-center-parties is negatively related to openness and agreeableness and positively related to conscientiousness. Finally, we recruited smaller samples in the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Turkey, Spain, Australia, and Bulgaria and showed that the associations mentioned above are cross-nationally replicable. We conclude that personality influences not only self-perceived political identity but also attitudes towards current issues of political controversy. In both cases, the effects of personality were mediated by Right-Wing-Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation.

AB  - Health policies routinely emphasize weight loss as a target for health promotion. These policies rest upon the assumptions: (1) that higher body weight equals poorer health, (2) that long-term weight loss is widely achievable, and (3) that weight loss results in consistent improvements in physical health. Our review of the literature suggests that these three assumptions underlying the current weight-focused approach are not supported empirically. Complicating this further are the misguided assumptions (4) that weight stigma (i.e., pervasive social devaluation and denigration of higher weight individuals) promotes weight loss and (5) recognizing that one is "overweight" is necessary to spur health-promoting behaviors. We highlight throughout how these assumptions have manifested in current policies and offer suggestions for alternative approaches to health promotion. We conclude by advocating for the broad adoption of a weight-inclusive approach to health policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family involvement during the transition process is crucial. However, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) families report barriers to effective transition planning related to cultural misunderstandings with educators. Professionals need to be culturally competent when interacting with CLD families and youth. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to revise a CLD Transition Knowledge and Skills (CLDTKS) Evaluation Instrument and have special educators use the instrument to evaluate the levels of CLD transition knowledge and skills of their colleagues.
   METHODS: The CLDTKS Evaluation Instrument was revised following expert review. Participants included 206 special educators. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the factor structure of the instrument. Structural equation modeling was used to test construct validity, and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. Means were computed for all factors.
   RESULTS: The CLDTKS Evaluation Instrument consisted of four scales: Cultural Characteristics Related to Active Family Involvement, Family Norms and Communication Styles, Individualized Education Program (IEP) Meetings and Transition Policies, and Family Legal Status and Associated Prejudice. For all factors, there was a lower mean on skills than on knowledge.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CLDTKS Evaluation Instrument is a valid and reliable measure for evaluating transition knowledge and skills related to working with CLD youth and families, and it can be used for research and professional development needs.

AB  - Leadership, as a habit of thinking, assumes the alpha and omega position for pursuance of sustainable development in Uganda. However, what if we considered followership first? Using literature review, a conceptual framework, and critical reflexivity as data source and analysis, this paper provides a new approach to understand challenges in Uganda. The argument is to transcend leadership models and switch to followership model for possibilities of achieving especially sustainable development. This will not only strengthen democratic practices, but also offers more efficient and effective leadership methods. Followership remains the critical yet silent element that has caused the shift in focus from traits, behavior, and lastly, contingent leadership theories. It is why some leadership theorists are considering feminine styles as more effective because they are prejudiced as natural followers. I suggest possibilities of exploring a followership model where followership is the main factor upon which Empowerment for Sustainable Development (ESD) directly depends.

AB  - Objectives This research aims to investigate the relationship between coming out to family and coming out in sports for lesbian and gay athletes and to examine the internalization of sexual prejudice as a potential mediator of this relationship.
   Methods For this purpose, disclosure of sexual orientation to family, coming out in sports and internalized sexual prejudice in sports-related contexts, age, gender, socioeconomic status, education level, political orientation, type of sport (individual vs. team sport), years of sports participation were assessed on an Italian sample of 113 lesbian athletes and 63 gay athletes between 18 and 35 years of age.
   Results Findings indicated that coming out to family was significantly associated with coming out in sports. In addition, the internalization of negative attitudes toward the visibility of lesbian and gay athletes in sport settings partially mediated the relationship between coming out to family and coming out in sports.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that prior experiences of coming out in family contexts may provide additional resources to prevent the internalization of sexual prejudice, and this may promote the coming out in other life contexts. Moreover, we recommend that more efforts should be made to support sexual minority athletes who are not able to disclose their identity in sports environments. Research implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Transgender rights and discrimination against transgender people are growing public policy issues. Theorizing from social, cognitive, and evolutionary psychology suggests that beyond attitudes, discrimination against transgender people may derive from folk theories about what gender is and where it comes from. Transgender identity is met with hostility, in part, because it poses a challenge to the lay view that gender is determined at birth, and based on observable physical and behavioral characteristics. Here, in two pre-registered studies (N = 1323), we asked American adults to indicate the gender of a transgender target who either altered their biology through surgical interventions or altered their outward appearance: to what extent is it their birth-assigned gender or their self-identified gender? Responses correlate strongly with affect toward transgender people, measured by feeling thermometers, yet predict views on transgender people's right to use their preferred bathrooms above and beyond feelings. Compared to male participants, female participants judge the person's gender more in line with the self-identified gender than the birth-assigned gender. This is consistent with social and psychological theories that posit high status (e.g., men) and low status (e.g., women) members of social classification systems view group hierarchies in more and less essentialist ways respectively. Gender differences in gender category beliefs decrease with religiosity and conservatism, and are smaller in higher age groups. These results suggest that folk theories of gender, or beliefs about what gender is and how it is determined have a unique role in how transgender people are viewed and treated. Moreover, as evident by the demographic variability of gender category beliefs, folk theories are shaped by social and cultural forces and are amenable to interventions. They offer an alternative pathway to measure policy support and possibly change attitude toward transgender people.

AB  - Although urban disorder has played a central role in neighborhood research, its impact may have been overstated in studies relying on the subjective perception of survey respondents only. Research on the "perception bias"-defined as the divergence between respondents' subjective assessments and systematic observations of disorder-has revealed the ambiguous nature of disorder and opened a door to the analysis of the social construction of this environmental cognition. Using survey and observational data from 140 small neighborhoods in two German cities, we advance this research by focusing on the moderating role of residents' interethnic contacts and attitudes. The results show that the effects of neighborhood minority concentration on the perception bias are conditional on the residents' interethnic contacts and xenophobic attitudes. These findings highlight the subjectivity of disorder perceptions and caution against a naive understanding of Broken Windows theory.

AB  - The Narrative Categorical Content Analysis toolkit (abbreviated as NarrCat) decomposes narratives into distinct, quantifiable psychological processes. In this study, NarrCat was applied to analyze New Zealand's historical "Speeches from the Throne" from 1854 to 1913 (68 speeches). Specifically, NarrCat's cognition, emotion, and intention modules were applied to analyze patterns of psychological perspective, or psychological states, attributed to various groups in the speeches (Maori, British settlers, and British governing elites). This allowed us to examine infrahumanization bias, as denoted by patterns of language, in New Zealand's governing discourses during colonization. Results showed that Maori were infrahumanized compared with the British settlers overall. However, only British Governing elites were attributed significantly greater agency (i.e., cognition and intention) in inferences of their psychological perspective compared with other groups. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed through the lens of infrahumanization theory, as well as colonizing discourses like the British Enlightenment and Good Maori-Bad Maori discourse.

AB  - The history of travel writing positions the genre as a form that invents and circulates problematic image(s) of Africa. Emerging from this biased background, postcolonial African travel writing offer reimaginations regarding how to think about the continent differently. This article explores how Sihle Khumalo's Dark Continent My Black Arse, performs this reimagination through counter-travel. I interrogate Khumalo's appropriation of parody on three sites-naming, landscape, and the body-to counter the prevalent (mis) representation of the continent and propagate alternative ways of imagining Africa in travel writing. This article argues that although parody as counter-travel strategy is a poignant tool for critiquing the negative representation, authorial prejudices allow for slippages that propagate the same set of biases the form intends to critique.

AB  - Diversity within health care organizations has many proven benefits, yet women and other groups remain underrepresented in cardiothoracic surgery. We sought to explore responses from a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) survey to identify myths and barriers for informing organizational strategies in the STS and cardiothoracic surgery. We performed a qualitative review of narrative survey responses within three domains surrounding diversity in cardiothoracic surgery: myths, barriers, and strategies for improvement. Common diversity myths included diversity as a pipeline problem (24%), diversity equated to exclusivity (21%), and diversity not supporting meritocracy (18%). The most frequent barrier code was perceived prejudice (22%). Suggested strategies toward improvement were culture change prioritizing diversity (22%) and training the leaders (14%). Notably, 15% of response codes reflected the belief that disparities do not exist; thus, the issue should not be prioritized by the organization. The results do not necessarily reflect the beliefs of most of the STS membership; nonetheless, they provide important insight critical to guide any efforts toward eliminating disparities within cardiothoracic surgery and improving the care of our patients.

AB  - Flag-displays can be used within national groups to communicate majority supremacy over ethnic minorities. In two studies set in an Australian context (N= 88 andN= 102), we explain how mode of national identification (glorifying identifiers versus attached identifiers) differently predicts support for multicultural values and national flag-displays. In line with the hypotheses, we found that attached identifiers were more supportive of multicultural values and national flag-displays by ethnic minorities than glorifying identifiers. In contrast, glorifying identifiers supported flag-displays by the majority more than did the attached identifiers. Study 2 demonstrates that glorifying identifiers' use of the national flag is explicitly meant to exclude other groups. As expected, support for multicultural values and endorsement of the flag as an exclusion tool helped to explain the relationship between identification and flag-displays. As such, results revealed the attitudes behind a novel form of prejudice that is currently on the rise.

AB  - Two experiments carried out in Spain and the Netherlands tested the joint effects of imagined contact and similarity with a narrative protagonist on attitudes and behavioral intentions related to stigmatized immigrants. We advance a concept of optimal reception condition: imagining a positive interaction with an immigrant before reading a testimonial of an immigrant who is similar to the native audience. The optimal reception condition induced greater identification and transportation than the reference condition, leading to more positive attitudes and a higher intention of intergroup contact. The findings are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and prejudice reduction.

AB  - The current study experimentally examined the potential for a contemporary extension of the contact hypothesis, known as electronic contact, or E-contact, to reduce sexual prejudice, intergroup anxiety, and avoidant behavioral intentions among heterosexuals. It also extended the sexual minority contact literature by examining the role of participant and interaction partner sex as a possible boundary condition of this contact?prejudice relationship. To test our hypotheses, 140 heterosexual female and male university students were randomly allocated to interact with a homosexual or heterosexual, female or male E-contact partner, in a collaborative and text-only online interaction before completing the outcome measures. Overall, the results demonstrated that interacting online with a female, as opposed to a male, homosexual E-contact partner reduced heterosexual men?s feelings of intergroup anxiety, which in turn was associated with lower sexual prejudice and outgroup avoidance. For heterosexual women, however, E-contact did not influence the outcome variables. In the context of sexual prejudice, these results suggest that E-contact may be particularly useful as a prejudice-reduction strategy among individuals who typically require it most: heterosexual men.

AB  - Despite international concern about the resurgence of right-wing authoritarianism and xenophobic prejudice throughout Central and Eastern Europe, researchers have argued recently that rightists may be less cognitively rigid and system-justifying than liberals and leftists in the context of Hungary (Kelemen, Szabo, Meszaros, Laszlo, & Forgas, 2014; Lonnqvist, Szabo, & Kelemen, 2019). We identify shortcomings of the research on which these claims are based and provide evidence that "rigidity-of-the-right" does indeed characterise contemporary Hungarian politics. Specifically, we hired professional survey firms to administer measures of personal needs for order and structure, system justification and political orientation to two large, nationally representative samples in Hungary. Results revealed that self-identified rightists scored higher than leftists on needs for order and structure and system justification (Study 1, N = 1005) and that supporters of right-wing parties (Fidesz and Jobbik) scored higher on both general and economic system justification than supporters of liberal and leftist parties (Study 2, N = 886). In exploratory analyses, we also observed that rightists expressed more intolerance than leftists toward groups that are commonly mistreated in Eastern Europe, including the Roma, religious minorities and sexual minorities.

AB  - Two studies investigated outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, addressing whether members of negatively perceived minority outgroups are perceived as prototypical of larger partially-inclusive outgroups and whether this tendency is enhanced under intergroup threat. Both experimental studies were conducted with Italian undergraduate participants. Experiment 1 (N = 186) tested whether Roma are generalized onto (i.e., perceived as prototypical of) Romanians to a higher extent under intergroup realistic and symbolic threat than under no-threat. It also explored the direction of the phenomenon and its underlying mechanism. Experiment 2 (N = 90) provided additional evidence on the effect of threat on such generalization phenomenon considering a different pair of groups (Islamic terrorists, Arabs) and employing a less blatant measure of generalization. Overall, these studies provided consistent evidence of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, clarifying the conditions of its occurrence. These results contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization and of its impact on outgroup perception and prejudice.

AB  - The primary purpose of these studies was to investigate associations between religiosity, political ideology, and attitudes toward immigrants using a mediation path-analytic approach. Respondents in two nationally representative samples of Americans (Studies 1 and 2) completed single items assessing general religiosity, political ideology, and immigrant prejudice. University students (Studies 3 and 4) completed measures of religious fundamentalism (RF), political ideology, and perceived realistic and symbolic threats posed by immigrants. Across the four studies, there were small to medium positive relationships between measures of religiosity and prejudice toward immigrants and consistent evidence that religiosity influences immigrant prejudice through political ideology (i.e., significant indirect relationships). None of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included zero for total or indirect effects of religiosity on immigrant prejudice. However, when liberal political ideology was included as the mediator, the relationship between religiosity and immigrant prejudice weakened to statistical and practical nonsignificance. These four studies reveal the role political ideology plays in associations between measures of religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - This study is grounded in Allport's intergroup contact theory and Herek's sexual prejudice theory. We aimed at (a) investigating the mediational role of sexism and homonegativity on the relation between gender, age, and contact with gay and lesbian people with gender stereotypes about gay men and lesbians; and (b) replicating and corroborating the direct associations found in previous research among these variables. The present research used secondary data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics and comprehending a representative sample of 5,863 Italian adults. The results from path analysis indicated that both homonegativity and sexism partially mediated the effect of gender and age on gender stereotypes, whereas they totally mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons. Findings suggest that reducing sexist and homonegative attitudes and increasing contact with gay and lesbian people may reduce stereotypical beliefs about homosexual people.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how gay employees, as labeled deviants, cope with heterosexist harassment at work in an Asian culture of hegemonic heterosexual masculinity, using the modified labeling theory. Design/methodology/approach Using qualitative research approach, in-depth interviews were carried out with 16 self-identified gay employees. Findings Results revealed how the coping strategies of gay employees, in the face of harassment, are entwined with the labeling and stigma leading to diverse and complex coping strategies. Several broader coping strategies were thus identified based on whether the participants accepted the label of deviance and stigma and whether they were open about their sexuality. These broader coping strategies are support seeking, confrontation, inaction, quitting and, stigma and labeling avoidance strategies. Under these broader strategies, there were also sub strategies such as seeking social support, organizational support, legal support the support of the wise, as well as secrecy and social withdrawal. Originality/value These findings will advance the knowledge in coping strategies of heterosexist harassments at work as well as knowledge in harassment of gay employees, in hegemonic heterosexual cultures.

AB  - This study examined the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Spanish version of the Homophobic Content Agent Target (HCAT) scale in a sample of 1848 high school students. Participants completed an online survey including measures of homophobic bullying, depression, and anxiety. The factor structure showed adequate fit indices in Spanish adolescents similar to the original scale. An exploratory factor analysis showed a simple factor solution of two related factors strongly correlated describing the extent to which students use homophobic language (agent) and the extent to which students are called homophobic epithets (target) due to sexual orientation. The Spanish HCAT scale showed high Cronbach's alpha coefficient at the subscale score levels, as well as good convergent validity. This study contributes a Spanish-language validated measure of homophobic victimization to be used among adolescents. Implications for understanding homophobic bullying in adolescents are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines spatial differences in the attitudes of the public towards asylum seekers using data from the British Social Attitudes Survey. Initial analysis reveals some statistically significant variations across geographical areas, with people living in London, the South East of England and Scotland displaying the most tolerant views. The spatial variations are then further investigated by considering differences between rural and different types of urban areas. The estimation of regression models enables a range of socio-demographic influences on attitudes to be examined including whether an individual is a foreign national, belongs to ethnic minority group and possesses a higher education qualification. Members of each of these groups are more concentrated in urban areas, especially London, thus accounting for part of the observed differentials. However, even after controlling for these and other factors, some significant differences remain between rural and some urban areas, especially large cities. We discuss potential explanations and conclude that having opportunities for meaningful social contact with asylum seekers and other immigrants is a key factor underlying some of the unexplained rural-urban differences in attitudes. Given increasing diversity in rural areas, it is recommended that policy makers and civil society organisations concerned about the impacts of negative attitudes on social and community cohesion should invest resources in creating opportunities for meaningful social contact between different groups.

TI  - Evolving Public Views On The Likelihood Of Violence From People With Mental Illness: Stigma And Its Consequences
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS

KW  - ATTITUDES
KW  - CARE
AB  - Highly publicized acts of violence routinely spark reactions that place blame on the perpetrator's presumed mental illness. Despite solid evidence that people with mental illness are unlikely to be dangerous, such prejudice can lead to support for inappropriately using legal means to force people into treatment. We examined trends in public perceptions of violence and support for coerced treatment across a twenty-two-year period using data from three National Stigma Studies. The studies gave respondents one of three vignettes describing people who met clinical criteria for mental disorders or one describing a person with nonclinical "daily troubles." Perceptions regarding potential violence and support for coercion generally rose over time-significantly so for schizophrenia. By 2018 over 60 percent of respondents saw people who met criteria for schizophrenia as dangerous to others, and 44-59 percent supported coercive treatment. Sixty-eight percent saw people with alcohol dependence as dangerous to others, and 26-38 percent supported coercion. Lower but substantial percentages were reported for people with depression and, remarkably, for those with nonclinical "daily troubles," who were viewed as dangerous. These findings reflect political discourse, not scientific data, and could lead to policies that would be ineffective and misdirect the search for the underlying roots of violence while unnecessarily increasing stigma toward people with mental illness.

AB  - Rationale: Physician bias against sexual minorities can hinder the delivery of high-quality health care and thus contribute to the disproportionate prevalence of negative health outcomes within this population. Medical students' interpersonal experiences within the context of medical school may contribute to this bias.
   Objective: The goal of the current research was to examine the relationship between these interpersonal experiences, reported by heterosexual, cisgender medical students, and explicit and implicit bias against lesbians and gay individuals, reported two years later during second year of medical residency.
   Method: Data were collected by surveying students (n = 2940) from a stratified sample of U.S. medical schools in fall 2010 (first semester of medical school), spring 2014 (final semester of medical school), and spring 2016 (second year of medical residency).
   Results: Amount and favorability of contact with LGBT individuals, reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted lower levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Additionally, exposure to negative role modeling, also reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted higher levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Amount of contact with LGBT individuals - and in particular, with LGBT medical students - predicted lower levels of implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Neither favorability of contact with LGBT individuals nor exposure to negative role modeling predicted implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that interpersonal experiences during medical school can systematically shape heterosexual, cisgender physicians' subsequent explicit and implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men disclosing their sexual preferences in eight Latin American countries. The sample consisted of 1,539 participants belonging to three age groups (18-29 years, 60-69 years, and 70 years and over). Their answers to two open-ended questions were content-analyzed, and binary logistic regressions were run on the extreme attitudinal categories. Results showed that although most attitudes were positive, a solid percentage of participants still expressed different kinds of derogatory attitudes. Men (as compared to women) and participants who were more religious and less educated tended to hold more negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Both older samples were more prejudiced than the younger one, and attitudes also varied according to country. There was a general trend showing more positive attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men in those countries where sexual minorities' rights are better assured, which suggests that measures to protect sexual minorities and to make sexual diversity in older age visible could be advisable.

AB  - Across three experiments, participants were provided with a list of racist behaviors that purportedly were enacted from a fellow student but in fact were based on the participants' own behaviors. People consistently evaluated themselves as less racist than this comparison other, even though this other's racist behaviors were identical to their own. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrate this effect is quite robust and even occurs under social pressure and social consensus conditions in which participants were free to express their racial biases. Thus, it appears that people are less likely to base their racist trait ratings on behavioral evidence when evaluating themselves compared to when they are evaluating another. Taken together, this work provides evidence for the consistency and robustness of self-enhanced social comparisons as applied to the trait domain of racism. Further, this work sheds insight into why people deny they are racist when they act racist.

AB  - Since publication of Unequal Treatment by the Institute of Medicine in 2003, there has been a growing recognition of the role of provider implicit racial bias in patient care. Provider implicit racial bias has been consistently negatively associated with both care satisfaction and provider trust among racial/ethnic minority patients. This suggests provider implicit racial bias likely manifests through their communication behaviors, which in turn may offer a means of addressing racial disparities in healthcare and ultimately in health. However, identifying provider communication behaviors that mediate the links between provider implicit racial bias and patient outcomes is challenging. In this paper, we argue that identifying these provider communication behaviors requires (1) taking into account findings from social psychology research of implicit racial bias and (2) incorporating the perspectives of racial/ethnic minority patients into patient-provider communication research. We discuss the utility of mixed methods research designs as a framework for resolving this complex scientific question. Research that draws on social psychology research of implicit racial bias and incorporates the racial/ethnic minority patient perspectives can inform the development of communication skills training programs for students and residents in various healthcare fields. Such programs are one element of a broader effort to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In Tajikistan, governmental policies leave the decision whether or not to sell syringes to people who inject drugs (PWID) to pharmacists' discretion. This exploratory study tests a theory-driven model explaining Tajikistani pharmacists' actual syringe sale practices to inform future HIV advocacy activities.
   Methods: Data were collected via attempts to purchase syringes without prescription and a subsequent survey among a sample of 232 pharmacists in two cities (Dushanbe and Kulob) in Tajikistan in 2015. The survey collected data on attitudes and beliefs related to selling syringes to PWID, stigma against PWID and background contextual factors such as social conservatism, HIV and drug use knowledge. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the relationships between syringe sale practice and pharmacists' attitudinal and background factors.
   Results: The majority (87.9%, n = 204) of sampled pharmacists agreed to sell syringes to the study research assistants without a prescription. According to the final model, agreeing to sell syringes was moderately associated with the reported intent to provide syringes without prescription (beta = 0.36, p < 0.001), lower stigma against PWID (beta = -0.43, p = 0.01), and stronger social conservatism (beta = 0.35, p = 0.02). Intent to provide syringes correlated with positive attitudes towards provision of syringes (beta = 0.35, p = 0.008), which in turn were negatively associated with stigma (beta = -0.54, p < 0.001) and positively with age (beta = 0.20, p = 0.03). Stigma against PWID was directly associated with social conservatism (beta = 0.47, p < 0.001) and inversely with university-level education (beta = -0.28, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: We demonstrated the accessibility of over-the-counter syringes in urban pharmacies of Tajikistan and emphasized the role of stigma in shaping pharmacists' syringe sale practices. Advocacy interventions should target pharmacists to reduce stigmatization of PWID and ensure access to clean syringes.

AB  - Literature on intergroup conflict and identity is well established; this literature includes work on competitive victimhood-the process by which groups attempt to establish that they have suffered more than opposing groups (Noor et al., Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2012, 16(4), 351-374) to restore feelings of moral identity, or cache often for use in a political context (Sullivan et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2012, 102(4), 778). Within prior work on competitive victimhood, models of reconciliation based on the particular needs and identities established within the competitive victimhood dynamic have also been posited (SimanTov-Nachlieli et al., European Journal of Social Psychology, 2015, 45(2), 139-145; Shnabel et al., Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2013, 49(5), 867-877). While competitive victimhood theory has been applied in prior work to several cross-national settings, there exist other important areas of intergroup tension that have not been explored. We propose that the concept of competitive victimhood can be fruitfully used to understand movement-countermovement dynamics, including those related to conflictual race relations in the United States. Specifically, this article will examine the dynamic between the movements "Black Lives Matter" and "Blue Lives Matter" as a salient paired research case of a movement and countermovement for investigating identity and victimhood. In our present article, we map the discourse of the Black and Blue Lives Matter movements as illustrations of collective victimhood (Schori-Eyal et al., Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 2014, 44(12), 778-794) and competitive victimhood (Noor et al., Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2012, 16(4), 351-374). We find that while both movements demonstrate competitive victimhood, they are also qualitatively different. Due to differences in threat, power, and history of those the movements advocate for, each movement demonstrates different needs (Burton, Conflict: Human needs theory, Springer, 1990). We posit that the identity dynamics of competitive victimhood within social movements specifically lead to important and different identity needs for agency and morality (Shnabel & Noor, in Restoring civil societies: The psychology of intervention and engagement following crisis (pp. 192-207), Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, England, 2012). We examine what these differences would mean in these particular movements, as well as for potential avenues of community building based on addressing these needs. In all cases, we aim to show that what has largely been considered a criminal justice phenomenon in the United States is fundamentally political, with roots and possible solutions in intergroup identity dynamics that can be fruitfully explored within political psychology.

AB  - Individuals with obesity often report experiencing prejudice and discrimination due to their weight. Past research on obesity bias reduction strategies have yielded mixed results. The present study investigated the effectiveness of manipulating information about weight controllability in reducing obesity bias. Participants (N = 350) were randomly assigned into one of three conditions: counterstereotypic, stereotypic, or control. Each condition consisted of four short vignettes. The counterstereotypic condition provided an uncontrollable explanation of obesity (e.g., genetics) in each vignette describing a person with obesity, while the stereotypic condition emphasized lifestyle choices as the main cause of obesity. The control condition included a vignette in which weight was not addressed. Participants completed questionnaires about weight controllability and obesity bias pre- and post-exposure. There was a significant interaction between time and condition on beliefs about weight controllability and obesity bias. Participants in the counterstereotypic condition increased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and decreased in obesity bias, while participants in the stereotypic condition decreased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and increased in obesity bias. Obesity bias reduction strategies that utilize information about weight controllability can be effective. However, perpetuating stereotypic causes of obesity can worsen the problem.

AB  - In this study, we report on changes to reported attitudes, knowledge, and empathy immediately after and 3 months following a round-robin conversation between "askers" and "answerers" in intergroup sessions created by a local public radio station. Listeners were invited to have short one-on-one in-person conversations with people who were members of an identifiable out-group. These were "Ask A" sessions with Muslims, transgender people, Trump supporters, police officers, formerly homeless, newcomers, immigrants, gun owners, foster parents, journalists, and Special Olympians. We found correlations among our assessed variables for askers (N = 113) going into the interactions and increases in the variables as reported after the event. Two of the expectancy variables remained high three months after the sessions.

AB  - Hate crime charges offer enhanced sentences for prejudice-motivated acts in recognition of the injury that extends beyond the victim to other members of the targeted group. The present study builds upon and extends previous work illuminating how anti-Black prejudice influences application of free speech protections to justify criminal acts against Black (vs. White) targets, which subsequently reduces support for hate crime charges for the act by investigating the potential effects of environmental cues that increase the salience of free speech rights. The present work tested the main and interactive effects of act target (Black vs. White), anti-Black prejudice, and the salience of freedom of speech on perceived free speech protections for a prejudice-motivated criminal act and the consequent influence on support for hate crime charges. Replicating previous findings, greater anti-Black prejudice predicted more perceived free speech protections for Black-targeted acts, which predicted less support for hate crime charges. Low-bias participants viewed Black- versus White-targeted acts as less protected by free speech rights and more deserving of hate crime charges; high-bias participants viewed the two acts similarly. Making the right to free speech (compared to protections from search and seizure) salient amplified differential perceptions of free speech protections based on prejudice and target group, which predicted support for hate crime charges. This work holds implications for justification processes and highlights the importance of studying culture-specific values.

AB  - Interracial couples are an understudied but increasingly common social group in the United States. We used direct and indirect measures to examine explicit and implicit biases (respectively) against interracial couples among samples of (a) predominantly White (non-Black; N = 1,217), (b) Black (N = 293), and (c) multiracial (N = 284) respondents recruited from the United States. Results provide evidence of implicit and explicit bias against Black-White interracial couples among respondents in the predominantly White sample and the Black sample. There was no evidence of such biases among self-identified multiracial respondents; in fact, they self-reported favoritism for interracial couples. Consistent with psychological theory and our preregistered hypotheses, we found that personal experience with interracial romance and self-reported contact with interracial couples tended to predict lower levels of bias against interracial couples. This research exposes a robust bias against a growing social group (interracial couples) among predominantly White respondents and Black respondents relative to respondents who identify as multiracial.

AB  - Prior work suggests that when social targets with ambiguous group membership present an overt threat, people are more likely to categorize the target as belonging to the outgroup. Yet, the impact of threat cues incidental to the target on social categorization remains unexplored. Prior work has found overt threat cues integral to the stimulus bias outgroup social categorization irrespective of the group in question. In contrast, we predicted that incidental threat cues would only bias judgments when the potential outgroup was one linked with threat. Drawing upon research finding the color red serves as an incidental threat cue, six experiments find that a red background behind a face (vs. a control color) increases outgroup categorizations, but only when the outgroup is linked with threat. Incidental threat cues bias outgroup categorization in a different manner than do overt threats integral to the stimulus, suggesting refinements to current thinking on the role of motivated processes in social categorization.

AB  - Recent waves of immigration have changed the demographic face of European societies and fueled considerable debate over the consequences of ethnic diversity for social cohesion. One prominent argument in this debate holds that individuals are less willing to extend trust and solidarity across ethnic lines, leading to lower social capital in multiethnic communities. We present a direct test of this proposition in a field experiment involving native-immigrant interactions in Zurich's Central Train Station. Our intervention consists of approaching commuters with a small request for assistance (borrowing a mobile phone), which we take as a measure of prosociality. We further differentiate between reactions towards natives as well as both high- and low-status immigrant groups. Compared to native-native interactions, we find lower solidarity in native-immigrant encounters, especially in cases involving stereotypically low-status immigrants. In exploratory analyses, we further show that discrimination only obtains in 'low cost' situations where commuters could easily justify not helping (e.g. by claiming not to carry a phone). Overall our results shed light on key theoretical mechanisms underlying patterns of solidarity in contemporary multiethnic societies.

AB  - Objectives Does the presence of a particular high-profile female politician influence how citizens think about women in politics generally? Methods We randomly assigned respondents in four statewide polls either to receive a cue about Hillary Clinton followed by a battery of questions about women in politics generally, or to hear only the women in politics battery. Results Drawing on scholarship from social psychology about the role of exemplars in auto evaluation, our results indicate that most individuals still hold gendered perceptions toward women in public office, but also that pushing the Clinton button first neither diminishes nor aggravates gendered expectations broadly. This is true even among males and Republicans, whom past scholarship suggests would be most susceptible to exemplar effects, and regardless of whether respondents were primed to think about Clinton as a diplomat or a candidate. Conclusions Our findings challenge the view that specific high-profile female politicians will influence public perception of women's leadership qualifications generally.

Consistent with previous research, we found that compared to vegetarians and semi-vegetarians, omnivores favored conservative policies more strongly and liberal polices less strongly, identified more closely with the Republican party and less closely with the Democratic party, were less liberal, approved of Donald Trump's performance more, and were more likely to have voted for Trump.

AB  - In the late twentieth century, interreligious education emerged as a way to transform one's attitude toward other religions and reduce religious prejudice. This article addresses the philosophical aspects of this practice, in particular the problems that arise when an essentialist approach is accommodated. The problems include the why (philosophical rationale), the who (subject and participant), the what (content), and the future (purpose). In response, the author explores how a relational approach grounded in a Whiteheadian philosophy of multiplicity would allow us to understand interreligious education differently. The article finds that a relational approach can help us imagine and embody interreligious education in a more humanizing, inclusive, and transformative way.

   Objectives This study aimed to identify the prevalence of age-based discrimination, and its relationship to health, among patients seeking cosmetic procedures.
   Methods Patients from a university-based, single-surgeon, aesthetic plastic surgery clinic completed the Everyday Discrimination Scale, which assesses the frequency with which individuals have experienced microaggressions and the main reason(s) for discrimination (including age). Participants also completed: measures of perceived age discrimination across interpersonal, romantic, work, and healthcare contexts and anticipation of age-based discrimination in the future; a single-item measure of self-rated health (rated 1-5); and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.
   Results Fifty patients consented to participate in the study (94% women, 78% white, mean age 49.4 13.5 years). More than 30% of participants reported age as the main reason for everyday discrimination. Participants who reported experiencing age-based discrimination, compared with those who did not, had worse self-rated health, lower self-esteem, and greater anticipated age-based discrimination. Participants most frequently endorsed experiencing age-based discrimination in an interpersonal context (36.0%) followed by work settings (20.0%).
   Conclusions A significant portion of patients seeking cosmetic procedures may experience age-based discrimination, which could negatively affect their health and well-being. Patients might benefit from expectation management about how their procedure may or may not address their concerns about age-based discrimination. More research is needed to determine whether cosmetic procedures help to mitigate discrimination in aging patients.

AB  - Sociological theories of symbolic boundaries (understandings of who belongs to in-groups and out-groups) and social boundaries (material stratification) argue both are related, but empirical analyses often focus on one or the other. Using survey data from 2014, we replicate and validate earlier research describing patterns in how Americans draw symbolic boundaries against a range of minority groups. We then go beyond this work by demonstrating a new link between boundary-drawing and attitudes about inequality and civil liberties with material implications. Drawing symbolic boundaries is not a benign practice; rather, it is associated with willingness to draw social boundaries that support material and political inequality.

AB  - Comparing levels of discrimination across countries can provide a window into large-scale social and political factors often described as the root of discrimination. Because of difficulties in measurement, however, Little is established about variation in hiring discrimination across countries. We address this gap through a formal meta-analysis of 97 field experiments of discrimination incorporating more than 200,000 job applications in nine countries in Europe and North America. We find significant discrimination against nonwhite natives in all countries in our analysis; discrimination against white immigrants is present but tow. However, discrimination rates vary strongly by country: In high-discrimination countries, white natives receive nearly twice the callbacks of nonwhites; in low-discrimination countries, white natives receive about 25 percent more. France has the highest discrimination rates, followed by Sweden. We find smaller differences among Great Britain, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, the United States, and Germany. These findings challenge several conventional macro-level theories of discrimination.

AB  - Objectives This study used thematic content analysis to examine submissions to a youth mental health website, www.itsoktotalk.in, in India.
   Setting We considered submissions made to the It's OK to Talk web platform during the first year of its operation (April 2017 March 2018), focusing specifically on website users based in India.
   Participants We analysed 37 submissions by 33 authors aged 19-31 years (mean age 22 years) from seven Indian cities (New Delhi, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Haryana). Eligible submissions were English-language first-person accounts of self-identified mental health problems, submitted in any media format for online publication by authors aged 18 years or older and who were based in India. Eight study participants were additionally involved in a focus group who contributed to the coding process and preparation of the final manuscript.
   Results Four themes were identified: (1) living through difficulties; (2) mental health in context; (3) managing one's mental health and (4) breaking stigma and sharing hope. Overall, the participants expressed significant feelings of distress and hopelessness as a result of their mental health problems; many described the context of their difficulties as resulting from personal histories or wider societal factors; a general lack of understanding about mental health; and widespread stigma and other negative attitudes. Most participants expressed a desire to overcome mental health prejudice and discrimination.
   Conclusions Personal narratives offer a window into young people's self-identified priorities and challenges related to mental health problems and recovery. Such insights can inform antistigma initiatives and other public awareness activities around youth mental health.

AB  - Drawing on literatures on social movements and collective action, mentalization, and morality, four studies investigated whether a social movement's use of nonviolence can increase people's willingness to support and join the movement. In a correlational study with a nested design, across 23 movements perceived use of nonviolence predicted participants' willingness to support and join the movement (Study 1, n = 203). This effect was also found experimentally, with Americans supporting nonviolent movements more than violent ones, in hypothetical and real foreign countries (Study 2 and 3, ns = 606 and 373). Study 4 (n = 247) replicated the effects in participants' own country. The effects were transmitted by attribution of mental states to nonviolent movements and subsequent greater perceived morality (Study 2-4). This research demonstrates that nonviolence can benefit social movements in terms of support and mobilization potential, and that these benefits are rooted in perceptions of mental capacity, humanness, and morality.

AB  - In this article, Forchtner investigates the construction of an 'ideal', extreme-right, ecologically sensitive subject. A concern for the natural environment is in no way new to the extreme right, and has long been part of its ideological make-up. In particular, claims that the laws of nature are applicable to the social world and that a community is embedded in an ecosystem have long been features of a right-wing ecological imaginary. Through an analysis of all the articles on a paradigmatic ecological issue, biodiversity, published in Germany's exemplary extreme-right magazine preoccupied with ecology, Umwelt & Aktiv (Environment & Active), this cultural imaginary is reconstructed. Included in it as key themes are human responsibility for environmental degradation, the ecological value of flora and fauna, and criticism of modernity's levelling tendencies (both biologically and culturally). Taking responsibility for the community's Heimat (homeland) is, consequently, a crucial element for this subject: a subject who aims for purity, order and the stability of ecosystems.

AB  - Background: Stigma associated with mental illness (MI) results in underutilization of mental health care. We must understand factors contributing to stigma to shape anti-stigma campaigns. Aims: To investigate the factors influencing stigma in university students. Method: Undergraduate psychology students completed measures on causal attribution, stigma, social distance, implicit person theory (IPT), and familiarity. Results: The hypothesis was partially supported; people who felt personality traits were unchangeable (i.e. entity IPT) were more likely to stigmatize individuals with mental disorders and desired more social distance from them. Familiarity with people with a MI individually predicted less desire for social distance, yet the redundancy of the predictors made the effect of familiarity on stigma fall just short of statistical significance. Judgments of biogenetic causal attribution were related to higher stigma levels, but not so when familiarity and IPT were taken into account. Conclusions: Educational campaigns may be effective by focusing on aspects of MI highlighting similarity with non-diagnosed people, and that people with MI can recover.

AB  - Women leaders in the workforce are adversely affected by two sets of stereotypes: women are warm and communal but leaders are assertive and competent. This mismatch of stereotypes can lead to negative attitudes toward women leaders, however, not all individuals will be equally sensitive to these stereotypes. Men and women characterized by a need for cognitive closure (the desire for stable and certain knowledge) should be particularly sensitive to these stereotypes because they can be stable knowledge sources. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward women leaders in the workforce would vary with individuals' need for closure, independent of their gender, and that (b) binding moral foundations (a concern for the larger group and its norms and standards) would mediate this association. In two studies, MTurk workers completed measures of negative attitudes toward women managers (Study 1, n=149), stereotyped beliefs of women as not wanting or deserving high status positions in the workforce (Study 2, n=207), as well as need for cognitive closure, moral foundations, social desirability, gender, and political orientation. Our results were consistent with our hypotheses and suggest that attitudes toward woman managers can reflect acceptance of pre-existent norms. If these norms can be changed, then changes in attitudes could follow.

AB  - Does ingroup favoritism reflect experience or some preset motivation? The latter possibility is well examined in social psychology, but models from cognitive psychology suggest that unrepresentative samples of experience can generate biases even in the absence of motivational concerns. It remains unclear, however, how motivation and initially sampled experiences interact when both influences are possible, and people encounter new groups. Extending classic arguments about motivated information gathering, we propose that people can be described as "group-motivated samplers"-marked by a tendency to primarily seek out information about one's own group, and to attend more to information that portrays the ingroup in a positive light. Four experiments showed that information seeking almost always starts with the ingroup, and that people chose to gather more information from the ingroup compared to an outgroup. In subsequent group evaluations, people were excessively positive about ingroups giving a good initial impression. Participants were also fairly accurate, on average, about the direction and magnitude of group differences when the ingroup was de facto better, but downplayed those differences in the opposite situation. Further analyses indicated that first experiences led to biased evaluations because people failed to discount for nonrepresentative (positive) ingroup experiences, whereas interpretive biases seem responsible for evaluations based on belonging to a better/worse performing group. Taken together, while social psychologists know that people tend to portray ingroups in a flattering light, we show how people selectively incorporate early experiences to build those impressions.

AB  - Objectives: Evidence suggests that agist biases may operate implicitly (i.e., automatically and unconsciously) to affect discriminatory attitudes and behaviors toward older adults. However, few studies have tested the malleability of implicit age bias. The present study tests the effect of a framing intervention on implicit age bias in a nationally representative sample of American adults.
   Method: Participants (N = 767) were randomly assigned to read 1 of 3 framed messages, to an unframed message about aging, or to a control message unrelated to aging. Framed messages emphasized (a) the contributions of older adults to society; (b) aging as a process of accumulating wisdom and energy; and (c) mechanisms through which prejudice against older adults operates. Participants subsequently completed an aging implicit association test (IAT) to assess implicit bias.
   Results: Relative to the control condition, participants in the 3 framed message conditions displayed lower implicit age bias. No differences were observed between participants in the control condition and those who read the unframed message.
   Discussion: Findings indicate that reframing messages about aging can decrease implicit bias against older adults. This study highlights ways for communicators to promote a positive understanding of the aging process, thereby mitigating sources of implicit prejudice.

AB  - When tested immediately, evaluative statements (ES; verbal information about upcoming categories and their positive/negative attributes) surprisingly shift implicit (IAT) attitudes more effectively than repeated evaluative pairings (REP; actual pairing of category members with positive/negative attributes). The present project (total N = 5,317) explored the shared and unique features of these two attitude change modalities by probing (a) commonalities visible in the extent to which propositional inferences created by ES infiltrate REP learning and (b) differences visible in performance of ES and REP learning over time. In REP, the number of stimulus pairings (varied parametrically from 4 to 24) produced no effect (Study 1), but verbally describing stimulus pairings as diagnostic versus nondiagnostic did modulate learning (Study 2), suggesting that even REP give rise to some form of propositional representation. On the other hand, learning from ES decayed quickly, whereas learning from REP remained stable over time both within an immediate session of testing (Study 3) and following a 15-min delay (Study 4), revealing a difference between these two forms of learning. Beyond their theoretical import, these findings may inform interventions designed to produce short-and long-term change in implicit attitudes.

AB  - Past research has shown that humans possess implicit associations that, when activated, affect subsequent behavior. In three studies, we demonstrated a novel implicit association held by some men: an association between women and birds. Additionally, we demonstrated three consequences of possessing and activating a Women-Birds association. For those who strongly associated women and birds, activating the association caused an increase in dehumanization of women, perceptions of female incompetence, and sexist hiring decisions. Perceptions of female incompetence mediated the effect of Women-Birds implicit association activation on sexist hiring decisions. These findings provide insight into a potential cause of bias toward women that should be accounted for when attempting to reduce discrimination toward women and speak to the need for careful consideration when making analogies linking social groups to animals or objects.

AB  - Four experiments, conducted in South Korea and Scotland, drew on uncertainty-identity theory to investigate how recategorization and ingroup projection interplay to maintain a clear, certain sense of identity in people's hierarchy of self-categorizations. Experiment 1 (N = 74) found that people who were made to feel uncertain about a subgroup identity that was central to their self-concept, identified more strongly with and felt more certain about their superordinate identity (H1). In Experiment 2 (N = 70), people were made to feel uncertain about their superordinate identity. Where ingroup projection was low, people also felt uncertain about their subgroup identity (H2). However, when ingroup projection was high, they did not feel uncertain about their subgroup identity (H3). These two experiments support our proposition that uncertainty at the subgroup and the superordinate level can be restored by recategorization and ingroup projection. Experiments 3 and 4 (Ns = 91 and 67) converge to show that when people were uncertain about both superordinate and subgroup identity, they resolved this dual uncertainty by enhancing perceived entitativity of the most central group. If the subgroup was more central, they increased support for subgroup separation so that the subgroup had a clear boundary whereas if the superordiate group was more central, they increased support for integration so that the superordinate group could be a cohesive entity without internal fragmentation (H4). The findings are discussed in terms of group resilience in the face of social change and uncertainty.

AB  - Background: There is substantial research about the occupational health of nurses worldwide. However, empirical evidence about the psychosocial health of migrant and minority nurses in outpatient settings in Germany in comparison to that of autochthonous nurses is lacking.
   Objectives: This study aims to identify work-related stressors, resources and the corresponding coping strategies of migrant and minority nurses in comparison to autochthonous nurses, Design." 24 migrant and 24 autochthonous nurses employed in the German homecare sector were interviewed in qualitative explorative manner while a distinction was made between non-commercial and private-commercial services.
   Settings: The interviews took place in the nursing services' premises or in the nurses' private homes.
   Participants: Services were randomly chosen among all homecare providers in the second largest German federal city-state Hamburg. Nurses were invited for an interview, once their management agreed to participate in the study. Registered nurses and nursing assistants as well as those with a foreign certificate but validated or in process were eligible to participate.
   Methods: Relevant literature findings formed the base for the semi-structured interview guide. Key areas in the interview guide were barriers, resources and coping strategies in the collaboration with colleagues, superiors and clients as well as in the collaboration within a linguistically and culturally diverse team and clients. The conventional approach to qualitative content analysis by Hsieh and Shannon guided the analysis.
   Results: Regardless of their origin or culture, nurses perceive time pressure, lifting patients, lack of appreciation or the client's personal fate as burdening. In the intercultural context, the divergent understanding of behavioral patterns as well as of nursing care and a non-functioning communication impede the collaboration within a diverse nursing workforce. Migrant and minority nurses suffer prejudices, verbal and sexual harassment proceeding from their clients. However they keep it to themselves and don't broach it to their supervisors or colleagues. The interaction with humans, the verbal exchange with colleagues and supervisors at eye level as well as the sensemaking of being a nurse helps nurses to cope with occupational stressors.
   Conclusions: Differences in language is a main stressor which impedes a functioning team collaboration as well as a positive nurse-client relationship. Migrant and autochthonous nurses share similar coping strategies to master occupational burdens. A good collaboration within the team and having an appreciative supervisor are resources that support migrant and minority nurses as well as autochthonous nurses to face the stressors and to cope with those. Migrant nurses of different origin perceive their status as migrants as a sense of community by sharing commonalities.

AB  - The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion increased coverage especially for the "undeserving poor"-nondisabled, nonelderly adults, who disproportionately are African American. However, African Americans benefited comparably less than other groups from Medicaid expansion because they disproportionately reside in states that rejected Medicaid expansion. Psychological and other social science research establishes that disapproval of providing "welfare" to "undeserving poor" is closely aligned with racial bias, and that these sentiments partly motivate public disapproval of policies such as Medicaid for nondisabled, nonelderly adults. It is important to clarify and acknowledge this barrier for a realistic perspective on obstacles to keeping and expanding Medicaid coverage.

AB  - Macklin and Fowlie explore the political life of Count Potocki de Montalk, a poet, pagan and pretender to the Polish throne. Count Potocki is perhaps most famous as a minor cause celebre among London's literary intelligentsia after his imprisonment for obscene libel in 1932. Historians, when they consider him at all, often discount him, viewing him as little more than a colourful eccentric, a view reinforced by Stephanie de Montalk's fascinating biography of the man, which appeared in 2001. Eccentric he most certainly was. However, as this article demonstrates, Potocki also played a key role as an enabler of fascist and extreme right-wing activism through the services he provided myriad groups as a printer of their literature, a career that spanned the interwar and post-war periods. The article examines how his preposterous pursuit of the Polish Crown, coupled with the innate elitism this engendered, led him to reject egalitarianism and democracy and embrace fascism. While the Spanish Civil War saw an outpouring of literature from his literary contemporaries in support of the Spanish Republic, Potocki responded by establishing The Right Review as a mouthpiece for his own personal melange of monarchism and fascism. Utilizing newly released security service files combined with archival research in the newly deposited Searchlight archive at Northampton University, this article pays closer attention to the political side of Potocki's activities than has hitherto been the case, particularly his wartime publishing activities. This includes his anti-Soviet pamphlet on the Katyn massacre, which caused great vexation in government circles for fear of the harm Potocki's (correct) accusations might do to relations with Britain's crucial wartime ally. The authors conclude with a detailed examination of the role Potocki played in post-war National Socialist networks, for both personal and political ends, not least of which was his continued efforts to further his claim to the Polish throne, which he never ceased to believe was his by divine right.

AB  - Researchers have shown that prejudice encourages explanations for inequality that attribute stigmatized groups' negative outcomes to internal-controllable causes. We extended this research by investigating how ambivalent sexism affects attributions for gender income inequality. Hostile sexism should facilitate acceptance of gender income inequality through attributions that emphasize individual choice. We tested this hypothesis in two web-based samples of predominately White American men and women, ranging in age from 18 to 82 years (M-age = 33.8). In Study 1 (N = 650), hostile sexism, but not benevolent sexism, positively predicted acceptance of gender income inequality. Attributions of choice and societal unfairness mediated this effect. In Study 2 (N = 242), following exposure to hostile sexism, participants increased acceptance of gender income inequality; choice explanations mediated this relation, although these effects occurred for political conservatives only. Consistent with prior work on attributions, hostile sexism was linked to victim-blaming attributions for gender income inequality. Overall, hostile sexism creates an attitudinal barrier-especially for conservatives-to supporting equal pay for women. To overcome this barrier, organizations could implement strategies aimed at ensuring more objective performance evaluations and pay decisions. Further, policy makers and communicators should be careful in choosing how they frame the gender pay gap.

AB  - Research on the relationship between the Big Five and prejudice suggests that low agreeableness and low openness to experience are the most consistent personality correlates of prejudice. However, research on this topic has not examined racial resentment (RR) among White Americans, an affectively charged hostility to Blacks rooted in the perception that they lack self-reliance. Based on work suggesting that prejudices like this may have a value-laden component, we argue that the strongest predictors of RR will be those associated with conservatism: conscientiousness and openness. Using three national surveys, we find that conscientiousness and openness are the strongest predictors of RR among White Americans-matching the predictors of ideology but not a stereotyping measure. Extending this, we demonstrate that conscientiousness and openness predict changes in RR over time.

AB  - This thought experiment uses agent-based modeling (computational simulation) to demonstrate how colorism might operate within a local policing context. Colorism is the allocation of privilege and disadvantage based on skin color, with a prejudice for lighter skin. Colorism might help to explain some of the racial disparities in the US' criminal justice system. I use simulated scenarios to explore the plausibility of this notion in the form of two questions: (1) How might colorism function within an organization, and (2) What might occur when managers apply the typical dilemmatic responses to detected colorism? The simulated world consists of three citizen-groups (lights, mediums, and darks), five policy responses to detected colorism, and two policing behaviors (fair and biased). Using NetLogo, one hundred simulations were conducted for each policy response and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison of means. When the tenets of colorism were applied to a simulated organizational setting, only some of the tenets held true. For instance, those in the middle of the skin color spectrum experienced higher rates of incarceration when aggressive steps were taken to counter colorism, which ran counter to the expectations of the thought experiment. The study identified an opportunity to expand the description of colorism to help describe the plight of those in the middle of the skin color spectrum. The major contributions from this work include a conceptual model that describes the relationship between the distinct levels of colorism, and it progresses the notion of interactive colorism. The study also explored conditional statements that can be converted into hypotheses for future experiments.

AB  - Across three studies, we examine the correlates of subjective well-being and mental and physical health among members of a historically disadvantaged group, namely, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. Results show those who minimize (vs. acknowledge) the extent to which their group is the target of discrimination report better well-being across myriad indicators (Studies 1-3). We also demonstrate that this effect is mediated by perceived system fairness (Study 1); holds above and beyond internalized homonegativity (Studies 1 and 3) and ingroup identification (Studies 2-3); and is true regardless of whether individuals reside in hostile or accepting environments (Study 2), and regardless of whether individuals had personally experienced discrimination (Study 3). For some indicators (namely, body mass index [BMI], social well-being, self-esteem, depression, and mental illness diagnosis), the relationship between minimization of discrimination and well-being was stronger among those who had frequent (vs. rare) discriminatory experiences.

AB  - We developed a method that can identify polarized public opinions by finding modules in a network of statistically related free word associations. Associations to the cue "migrant" were collected from two independent and comprehensive samples in Hungary (N (1) = 505, N (2) = 505). The co-occurrence-based relations of the free word associations reflected emotional similarity, and the modules of the association network were validated with well-established measures. The positive pole of the associations was gathered around the concept of "Refugees" who need help, whereas the negative pole associated asylum seekers with "Violence." The results were relatively consistent in the two independent samples. We demonstrated that analyzing the modular organization of association networks can be a tool for identifying the most important dimensions of public opinion about a relevant social issue without using predefined constructs.

AB  - Those persons with church membership or professing a faith or relationship with God represent a microcosm of society. Therefore, the demons of racism, bigotry, and prejudice found in society at large are found in the church. Despite the very nature of Christianity that calls on Christians to be a countervoice in the world against evil, many have capitulated to various strains of racism in the world and in the Church. Some Christian denominations have begun to explore racism in the church and have developed responses to addressing the issues in the church and in the world. This article examines the historical context of race and religion in the Christian church in the United States, and addresses the current efforts of some Christian denominations to become proactive in the struggle against racism.

AB  - Prejudice against gay and lesbian persons remains largely an unaddressed issue in India. This experimental study involved designing, implementing, and assessing the effectiveness of an intervention to foster positive attitudes toward the homosexual community among Indian college students. The experimental group (n = 60) received a three-component module including perspective taking, education, and direct contact with gay and lesbian persons. Attitudes toward homosexuals, empathy, and self-esteem were measured using standardized questionnaires 15 days before the intervention and immediately following the intervention. No intervention was carried out with the control group (n = 55). Their attitudes were measured 15 days apart, parallel to the experimental group. Results showed that attitudes toward homosexuality improved significantly in the experimental group. The control group also showed a significant, but small, improvement in attitudes. Further, levels of empathy were found to increase only in the experimental group. Limitations, future directions, and implications of the study are discussed.

AB  - Migration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals in a relationship is understudied. As motivation can influence the way migration is experienced, the commitment to a partner adds a further component to the equation. Three females were recruited via purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Three themes were identified: "Identity redefinition and sense of agency"; "Emotional response and social support"; and "Coping, meaning-making, and self-realization." Results are discussed within the aforementioned themes. Limitations are considered for methodology and sample characteristics. Future research warrants to expand its focus on LGBTQ migration across Europe to tailor migration policies to individuals' needs.

AB  - Objectives: Diversity courses aim to help students navigate a pluralistic society, and meritocracy beliefs are thought to be central to this effort. The purpose of this study was thus to explore the impact of diversity course enrollment on both meritocracy beliefs and interracial dialogue attitudes.
   Methods: Both at the beginning and end of the semester, quantitative survey data were collected from 435 student respondents: 274 were enrolled in one of two non-diversity courses, 147 participated in one section of an Intercultural Communication course, and 14 were cross-enrolled. The survey included measures of prescriptive and descriptive meritocracy, as well as two measures of dialogue assessed in relation to testimonies of social suffering provided by two African-American students: speaker trust and imagined dialogue receptivity.
   Results: Data confirmed that, among racial outgroup participants, descriptive and prescriptive meritocracy are connected to racial dialogue measures in antagonistic ways. In addition, the diversity class succeeded in decreasing student beliefs in descriptive meritocracy, increasing meritocracy discrepancy, expanding speaker trust, and engendering greater dialogue receptivity relative to the control classes. Lastly, changes in both meritocracy discrepancy and diversity course enrollment independently predicted changes in the racial dialogue measures.
   Conclusion: Meritocracy is a multidimensional, ideological belief that appears linked to racial dialogue engagement in its prescriptive form and avoidance in its descriptive form. Findings underscore the need to distinguish between these forms of meritocracy, encourage the use of meritocracy discrepancy scores, and confirm the promise of diversity course enrollment.

AB  - This article quantitatively investigates racial "othering" in Thailand by using available World Values Survey proxies. We review racial "othering" in Thailand through inter-group threat theory. We investigate the proportion of Thais who are racially and/or ethnically prejudiced, the number of Thais who are racially and/or ethnically prejudiced compared with other countries' citizens, whether Thais have become more racially and/or ethnically prejudiced from 2007 to 2013, the extent to which Thais are religiously discriminatory compared with other countries' citizens, and whether Thais became more religiously discriminatory from 2007 to 2013. We find relatively high levels of racial prejudice by Thais.

AB  - Affective polarization describes the phenomenon whereby people identifying as Republican or Democrat tend to view opposing partisans negatively and co-partisans positively. Though extensively studied, there remain important gaps in scholarly understanding of affective polarization. In particular, (a) how it relates to the distinct behavioural phenomena of in-party "love" vs. out-party hostility; and (b) to what extent it reflects a generalized evaluative disparity between partisans vs. a domain-specific disparity in evaluation. We report the results of an investigation that bears on both of these questions. Specifically, drawing on recent trends in political science and psychology, we hypothesize that moral polarization-the tendency to view opposing partisans' moral character negatively, and co-partisans' moral character positively-will be associated with behavioural hostility towards the out-party. We test this hypothesis in two preregistered studies comprising behavioural measures and large convenience samples of US partisans (combined N = 1354). Our results strike an optimistic chord: Taken together, they suggest that this association is probably small and somewhat tenuous. Though moral polarization itself was large-perhaps exceeding prior estimates of trait affective polarization-even the most morally polarized partisans appeared reluctant to engage in a mild form of out-party hostility. These findings converge with recent evidence that polarization-moral or otherwise-has yet to translate into the average US partisan wanting to express hostile and directly discriminatory behaviour toward their out-party counterparts.

AB  - This contribution uses an expanded conceptualisation of intervention based on the understanding of it as an attempt to influence, negatively or positively, the political context/direction of a country/situation. It does this through the concept of 'aid intervention' in the conflict-context of the occupied Palestinian territory (OPT). Based on over 12years of research experience of aid donors in this context, this contribution compares the stated principles, as well as the methods and practices, of the main Western (USA and EU) and non-Western (Gulf Arab) states involved in providing aid. It is argued that while there are some interesting differences, there are some striking similarities, thus offering a critique and corrective to the prejudices that underpin the distinctions of 'Western' and 'non-Western', 'iberal' and 'illiberal'.

AB  - Traditional accounts of intergroup bias often fail to consider the complexity of intergroup phenomena by insufficiently distinguishing between (a) attitudes, emotions and action tendencies, (b) classes of threat that promote intergroup bias and (c) subtle category distinctions amongst social groups. We develop a nuanced account of antimigrant bias by distinguishing between (a) manifestations of bias in emotions and action tendencies, (b) kinds of threat that drive antimigrant bias, and (c) kinds of migrant groups (economic migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers). By employing within-subjects designs in two prominent migrant-receiving countries (N-Australia = 239, N-US = 200), we find that two distinct classes of threat emerge: in-group morality threat and conflict-related threat. These threats predict specific emotion and action tendency profiles. Our findings carry important implications for the conceptualization of antimigrant bias. We also discuss implications of our findings for facilitating positive relations between receiving communities and migrants via in-group morality threat.

AB  - Research on colorism in the United States frequently focuses on people of color who were born in the country such as African Americans. Globalization, however, requires social scientists to consider new dimensions of intraracial discrimination as research studies must attend to realities and standpoints about race, as well as other forms of categorization, that are not traditionally represented in conversations about in-group stratification. In this article, we consider how colorism acts as a force that propels many immigrants toward identification with whiteness. Based on historical and contemporary snapshots of immigrant trends in the United States, we discuss how and why some groups opt to self-identify as racially White and/or align themselves with the ideological status quo regardless of their racial, phenotypic, and/or cultural self-ascriptions.

AB  - In this introduction to the special issue on psychology and human mobility, we begin by outlining the particularities of the European sociopolitical context to which the studies included in this special issue refer. We discuss internal European mobility, overseas migration to the European Union, the refugee `crisis', and its sociopolitical implications for the European Union. Subsequently, we discuss the ways that the different studies relate to and extend existing literature to new directions, focusing on three different facets of immigration addressed by the studies: (a) the ideological resources used in discourse to achieve certain political ends in relation to immigration, (b) the ways that a dialogical engagement with the social other is established or blocked, and (c) the perspectives of mobile people themselves in experiencing different forms of immigration. As a conclusion, we argue that the studies contribute to the field of human mobility by offering a methodologically plural, processual, and critical analysis of immigration and by showing four different directions as ways to advance the field further. These are: (a) the importance of understanding processes rather than states in the study of immigration, (b) the value of studying discursive practices but also moving beyond discourse to achieve methodological pluralism, (c) the need to engage with multiple perspectives involved in immigration and to understand how they relate to each other, and (d) the need to problematize the taken-for-granted categories that researchers use in studying immigration (e.g., locals/migrants, us/them).

AB  - We introduce the Minimal Turing Test, an experimental paradigm for studying perceptions and meta-perceptions of different social groups or kinds of agents, in which participants must use a single word to convince a judge of their identity. We illustrate the paradigm by having participants act as contestants or judges in a Minimal Turing Test in which contestants must convince a judge they are a human, rather than an artificial intelligence. We embed the production data from such a large-scale Minimal Turing Test in a semantic vector space, and construct an ordering over pairwise evaluations from judges. This allows us to identify the semantic structure in the words that people give, and to obtain quantitative measures of the importance that people place on different attributes. Ratings from independent coders of the production data provide additional evidence for the agency and experience dimensions discovered in previous work on mind perception. We use the theory of Rational Speech Acts as a framework for interpreting the behavior of contestants and judges in the Minimal Turing Test.

AB  - This study expands on game character perspective-taking effects on political opinions while controlling for players' social dominance orientation or inclination for inequality among social groups. Random assignment to play a game as an immigration inspector decreased intention, subjective norms, and self-efficacy to help immigrants relative to baseline scores. The scores of participants randomly assigned to play a game similar in style but instead featuring the role of a newspaper editor remained unchanged. Within-subjects effects implied that baseline reductions in intention, subjective norms, and self-efficacy to help immigrants were solely attributed to playing games as game immigration inspectors. The study provides initial evidence that taking on the perspective of game characters can influence players' opinions about political issues, such as immigration.

AB  - Do liberals and conservatives differ in their empathy toward others? This question has been difficult to resolve due to methodological constraints and common use of ideologically biased targets. To more adequately address this question, we examined how much empathy liberals and conservatives want to feel, how much empathy they actually feel, and how willing they are to help others. We used targets that are equivalent in the degree to which liberals and conservatives identify with, by setting either liberals, conservatives, or ideologically neutral members as social targets. To support the generalizability of our findings, we conducted the study in the United States, Israel, and Germany. We found that, on average and across samples, liberals wanted to feel more empathy and experienced more empathy than conservatives did. Liberals were also more willing to help others than conservatives were, in the United States and Germany, but not in Israel. In addition, across samples, both liberals and conservatives wanted to feel less empathy toward outgroup members than toward ingroup members or members of a nonpolitical group.

AB  - This article analyzes the ego-defensive role played by legitimation, by examining the hypothesis that threat-based justifications attenuate the negative effect on an individual's self-esteem caused by his or her becoming aware of his or her own discriminatory behavior. Across three studies (including a pilot experiment), participants who were led to believe that they had acted in a discriminatory way experienced a decrease in their self-esteem. In Study 1 (N = 116), this effect was nullified when discrimination was justified by either symbolic or realistic threat perceptions. Study 2 (N = 250) replicated this pattern of results and went further by showing that discrimination affects self-esteem only in more egalitarian individuals, whereas for those less egalitarian, it affects their social image. According to the ego-defensive role of legitimation, a meta-analytical integration of the results confirmed that the influence of discrimination in depressing self-esteem is moderated by threat-based justifications.

AB  - Social scientists have shown how easily individuals are moved to exclude outgroup members. Can we foster inclusion instead? This study leverages one of the most significant humanitarian crises of our time to test whether, and under what conditions, American citizens adopt more inclusionary behavior toward Syrian refugees. We conduct a nationally representative survey of over 5,000 American citizens in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election and experimentally test whether a perspective-taking exercise increases inclusionary behavior in the form of an anonymous letter supportive of refugees to be sent to the 45th President of the United States. Our results indicate that the perspective-taking message increases the likelihood of writing such a positive letter by two to five percentage points. By contrast, an informational message had no significant effect on letter writing. The effect of the perspective-taking exercise occurs in the short run only, manifests as a behavioral rather than an attitudinal response, and is strongest among Democrats. However, this effect also appears in the subset of Republican respondents, suggesting that efforts to promote perspective taking may move to action a wide cross-section of individuals.

AB  - How do elected representatives respond to the needs of immigrant constituents? We report the results of a field experiment on U.S. state legislators in which the nativity, likelihood of voting, and race/ethnicity of a hypothetical constituent are independently manipulated. The experimental design allows us to contribute new insights by isolating the various elements that may impede the connection between immigrants and elected representatives. Moreover, we explore racial/ethnic identities beyond black and white by including Latino and Asian aliases. Contrary to expectations, nativity and voting status do not affect response rates. Instead, legislator behavior appears to be driven by racial/ethnic bias. Whites benefit from the highest response rate, while blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all receive lower rates, respectively. This bias follows a partisan logic. The low response rate for Hispanic constituents comes primarily from Republican legislators, whereas Asians experience bias from representatives of both parties. We argue that this difference may result from Hispanic identity sending a stronger signal about partisan affiliation, or from a prejudicial view of Asians as outsiders. In this last interpretation, rather than the model minority, Asians become the excluded minority.

AB  - Civil unrest and riots in the U.S. engender considerable attention. Much of the civil unrest from the 1960s, and recent incidents, likely result from many factors, including poverty, police practices, and negative motivations of some unrest participants. However, not all observers view these events from the same perspective. We contend that individuals often interpret events through social identities, such as race and partisanship, and thus causal attributions for unrest differ widely. We employ data from three recent national surveys and examine individual interpretations of the causal forces leading to these events. Our analyses suggest that racial and political identities provide a powerful lens through which individuals come to attribute causes for civil unrest. Conflicting narratives over causes likely hinders attempts to provide solutions and reduces the likelihood of future unrest that can lead to violence.

AB  - Ambivalent sexism theory states that prejudice toward women comprises two interrelated ideologies. Endorsement of hostile sexismaggressive and competitive attitudes toward women-is linked with endorsement of benevolent sexism-paternalistic and patronizing attitudes toward women. We conduct the first systematic tests of how endorsement of sexism differs across age and across time, using six waves of a nationally representative panel sample of New Zealand adults (N = 10,398). Results indicated U-shaped trajectories for men's endorsement of hostile sexism, women's hostile sexism, and women's benevolent sexism across the life span. However, over time, endorsement of these sexist attitudes tended to decrease for most ages. In contrast, men's benevolent sexism followed a positive linear trajectory across age and tended not to change over time. These results provide novel evidence of how ambivalent sexism differs across age and highlight that benevolent sexism is particularly tenacious.

AB  - In implicit personality theory, people with entity views or a fixed mindset perceive characteristics (e.g., intelligence) as uncontrollable, whereas people with incremental views or a growth mindset perceive characteristics as controllable. In addition to other benefits, the literature sometimes suggests that having a growth mindset will protect against prejudice, which the current two studies examine in terms of negative attitudes toward obese people. Participants (total N=501) were randomly assigned to complete a questionnaire assessing attitudes toward an obese or nonobese person and a self-theory questionnaire also assessed ideas about body weight. People with a growth mindset, and not fixed mindset, were more likely to have negative attitudes toward obese individuals, pointing to a potential downside of growth mindset in the obesity domain.

AB  - In many contexts, such as business, science and law, it is essential to determine whether a company, a product or a person in fact has the reputation attributed to it, regardless of whether that reputation has been rightly earned. In this paper I offer two necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for the attribution of a reputation to a subject within a social group. The first one concerns the way in which reputational information is spread among the members of the relevant social group; the second is the existence, in most members of the group, of a disposition to interpret and evaluate a reputational object in a manner molded by reputational information. Reputational claims generate expectations that are tested every time a member of the group comes in contact with the reputational object. In many cases, the preferential search for behavioral evidence consistent with those expectations will result in a distorted evaluation of the reputational object.

AB  - In the last quarter century, a steadily increasing number of North Americans, when asked their religious affiliation, have self-identified as spiritual but not religious (SBNR). Charles Taylor argues that the popularity of spirituality is the result of the massive subjective turn of modern culture; while Paul Heelas has deemed this new religious form, self-spirituality. Many scholars have taken a critical stance toward this recent cultural development, positing that self-spirituality is a byproduct of the self-obsessed and individualistic culture which saturates the West, or that spirituality, at its worst, is simply a rebranding of religion in order to support consumer culture and the ideology of late capitalism. In this article, I seek to problematize these accounts. Drawing from qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews with Canadian millennials who self-identify as SBNR, I will argue that self-spirituality is less individualistic and narcissistic than these scholars assert, its relationship to late capitalism is better understood as ambivalent, rather than congenial, and due to their methodological prejudices these critiques of self-spirituality are inadequate to analyse and understand the politics of self-spirituality.

AB  - In the last years, more and more literary accounts of recent and current wars in the Middle East have been published. In most cases, they are authored from a Western viewpoint and provide a narrow account of the Muslim world. This article focuses on Sinan Antoon's The Corpse Washer because it opens the scope. That is, it constitutes an alternative to the imagery of the American film industry. Moreover, as Antoon is a Christian, his account of contemporary Iraq is particularly peripheral and hybrid. To analyse the novel, this article makes use of Transmodernity, a concept coined by Rosa Maria Rodriguez Magda in 1989. Yet, instead of Magda's Transmodernity as a neatly Euro-centric phenomenon of worldwide connectivity, Ziauddin Sardar's version of the concept is preferred. Sardar's Transmodernity adds to connectivity a message of reconciliation between progress and tradition, particularly in the context of non-Western cultures. This paper defends that Antoon's novel opens the debate on Islam to challenge the prejudiced Western discourses that have legitimized' war. To do so, Sardar's borders' and Judith Butler's grievability are particularly useful. In a Transmodern context, novels like Antoon's show that humans should never be bare lives.

AB  - Objectives: The main purpose of the study was to examine a bidirectional temporal relationship between perceived age discrimination and depressive symptoms. A secondary goal was to examine whether the negative effects of perceived age discrimination on one's depressive symptoms are stronger among respondents older than 70 years old, compared with respondents between the ages of 51 and 70.
   Methods: The Health and Retirement Study is a U. S. nationally representative sample of individuals over the age of 50 and their spouse of any age. A cross-lagged model was estimated to examine the reciprocal associations of depressive symptoms and perceived age discrimination, controlling for age, gender, education, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, satisfaction with financial status, number of medical conditions, mobility, strength and fine motor skills, and memory functioning.
   Results: The baseline model for the overall sample resulted in adequate fit indices: CFI =.945, TLI =.940, RMSEA =.024 (90% CI =.023,.025). The cross-lagged effect of perceived age discrimination on depressive symptoms was nonsignificant (B [SE] = -. 01 [. 04], p =.82), whereas the cross-lagged effect of depressive symptoms on perceived age discrimination was small, but significant (B [SE] =.04 [. 02], p =.03). This implies that higher levels of depressive symptoms precede a greater likelihood of perceived age discrimination, net of sociodemographic and clinical variables. The cross-lagged effects did not vary according to age group (51-70 vs > 70 years old).
   Discussion: The subjective nature of perceived age discrimination is discussed.

AB  - I study the relationship between intelligence and the rationality of political preferences. Intelligence is operationalized as achievement in standard mental ability tests, rationality as consistency between political attitudes and political preferences and consistency as the effect of the interaction between intelligence and political attitudes on political preferences. Political preferences are measured by party affiliation - support for the Democratic versus the Republican Party in the US - and political attitudes are measured on a conservative-liberal dimension. I analyze three large representative American databases and find that for global political attitudes and for specific social attitudes, but not for specific economic attitudes, intelligence is associated with a considerable more attitude-preference consistency (Delta R-2 of 2.7% 0.9%, and 0.9%, in Study 1, 2 and 3, respectively, corresponding to f(2) of 0.014, 0.011 and 0.035, respectively). I conclude with a discussion of possible causal processes underlying the observed relationship between intelligence and consistency of political attitudes.

AB  - The effect of contextual information about the national ingroup on explicit and implicit attitudes towards a novel brand was studied on a sample of university students from the Lima Metropolitan area (n = 59). The results show that the negative information about the ingroup exerts more influence on explicit attitudes towards a novel brand than the positive information. This effect is understood as a habituation of Peruvians towards the positive contextual information about their group, and an ingroup bias that acts when their national identity is threatened by the negative input. This bias guides them towards explicitly favoring a product they consider related to their social identity. On the other hand, the lack of visible results on the implicit attitudes is explained by the order effect of the Implicit Attitudes Test (IAT). These findings are relevant for advertising and marketing industries in Peru, which constantly develop campaigns that extol Peru and the Peruvian identity.

AB  - This paper describes a classroom demonstration that showcases how pre-existing beliefs (e.g., stereotypes) influence problem-solving. Across four studies, participants solved riddles with gender stereotype-consistent (e.g. doctor is male) or gender stereotype-inconsistent (e.g., doctor is female; barber is female) solutions. Solve time, perceived difficulty, and perceptions of the demonstration and how it influenced learning were measured. Studies 3 and 4 extended Studies 1 and 2 by measuring objective learning through a quiz on gender stereotypes and bias. Results indicate that students solved the stereotype-inconsistent riddles slower than stereotype-consistent riddles. Stereotype-inconsistent riddles were rated as more difficult to solve than stereotype-consistent riddles. Subjectively, participants perceived the demonstration to be an effective tool, enhancing their knowledge about gender stereotypes. Objectively, participants performed better on the quiz when they solved stereotype-inconsistent riddles than stereotype-consistent riddles. These findings suggest that using stereotype-inconsistent riddles in class can help understanding about gender stereotypes and bias.

AB  - Aversion to loanwords may express itself in various ways: deliberate and motivated by ideology of linguistic purism or more implicit and motivated by the strength of one's national identification and ethnolinguistic vitality. A study of Polish philology students assessed their tendency to choose loanwords versus synonymous native words. The results supported a two-path model of linguistic purism. Social identity (strength of identification) directly predicted avoidance of loanwords, whereas ideological concerns (conservative political views) predicted it indirectly, through purist ideology.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to review the perceptions of faculty members, preschool teachers, and pre-school teacher candidates with regard to the Anti-Bias Education Programs (ABEP) by using a phenomenological pattern. The participants' metaphors on ABEP were established and categorized and the differences in participants' perceptions were analyzed in terms of their demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and service time. The working group of this research consisted of 129 participants: from 17 universities, 22 faculty members from the Education Faculty Pre-school Education Departments and 71 pre-school teacher candidates, studying in the fourth year of the Pre-School Education Departments; and 36 pre-school teachers from 9 different cities. The findings of this study show that faculty members produced 17, teachers produced 28 and teacher candidates produced 30 different metaphors about ABEP. The faculty members' metaphors vary in terms of age and service time, whereas the teachers' vary in terms of service time, type of institution, education level and age. Teacher candidates' metaphors vary in terms of age and gender.

AB  - Gender wage gaps are a prevailing feature of the labour market. Statistical discrimination has been highlighted as a potential source. However, the evidence is scarce. The employer learning literature provides a testable framework. This paper develops an employer learning model which incorporates screening discrimination, stereotyping and prejudiced beliefs. Implications of screening discrimination are found not to be consistent with wage dynamics in the Danish labour market. Stereotyping with prejudiced beliefs is argued to be a more plausible candidate. Workplace characteristics, such as the fraction of women in high-ranking positions, do not affect the level of screening discrimination by gender.

AB  - Participants (N = 602; having 0, 1, 2 or 3 stigmatized identities based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and social class) completed a survey on their feelings of invisibility and expectations of receiving unfair treatment (i.e., experiencing discrimination) and being stereotyped due to their group memberships. The results were consistent with the model of intersectional invisibility, with multiply-stigmatized individuals reporting feeling more invisible than individuals who had one or zero stigmatized identities. In addition, multiply-stigmatized individuals reported more unfair treatment and greater stereotype concerns than individuals with one stigmatized identity, with both reporting more unfair treatment/stereotype concerns than individuals without stigmatized identities. Thus, the present data suggest that multiply-stigmatized individuals are keenly aware of their invisibility and that invisibility represents a source of perceived discrimination and stereotyping for multiply-stigmatized individuals.

AB  - Previous research has consistently found widespread attitudinal impacts of terrorist attacks. Using data from the European Social Survey, which was conducting interviews in 11 countries when the Charlie Hebdo attacks happened in January 2015, I compare respondents from before and after the shootings to test whether the event shifted public opinion on several topics. There is no evidence of average impacts across a range of issues, from xenophobia to ideological self-placement and immigration policy preferences. Data collected when the Paris November 2015 shootings happened also present no evidence of public opinion change on immigration and refugee policy matters in France, but there appears to be an effect in other countrieswhich varies according to contextual vulnerability. Results suggest that views on immigration and immigrants have, to a certain extent, stabilized in Europe and are less susceptible to shifts from dramatic events.

AB  - Racial inequality remains an objective reality in the United States and around the world, yet members of advantaged racial groups often deny or minimize its existence. Although we have well-developed theories to explain why advantaged racial groups would be motivated to deny or minimize inequality, at present we know relatively little about why Whites and other advantaged racial groups might be willing to acknowledge or care about racial inequality. In this article, we propose that contact between racial groups offers one of the most promising pathways to advance these outcomes. We review established and emerging research literature suggesting that contact contributes to these outcomes by encouraging members of advantaged racial groups to become psychologically invested in the perspectives, experiences, and welfare of members of disadvantaged racial groups. We propose that psychological processes such as building empathy, enhancing personal relevance, and humanizing other people can facilitate the extent to which contact leads to greater psychological investment in other racial groups. We conclude by discussing several factors that may serve as obstacles to psychological investment across racial lines and the relevance of contact and establishing connections between racial groups in light of current social divisions and racial tensions.

AB  - This research analyzes data from a survey experiment testing whether asking about male perpetration of domestic violence ("a man hitting a woman") before asking about corporal punishment affects opinions on the latter; and whether framing the corporal punishment question in a gender - consistent way ("a father spanking his daughter") or not ("parents spank child") further alters opinion. Results show that context and framing both reduce support for corporal punishment. The strongest context effects occur among liberals, with small but significant framing effects occurring among conservatives. The results suggest that political discourse about domestic violence, especially heightening gender norms, can draw attention to the violent nature of corporal punishment and lower the intensity of support for spanking.

AB  - Three studies assessed the impact of White individuals' mere membership in racially diverse or homogeneous groups on conformity. In Study 1, White participants were randomly assigned to four-person groups that were racially diverse or homogeneous in which three confederates routinely endorsed clearly inferior college applicants for admission. Participants in diverse groups were significantly less likely to conform than those in homogeneous groups. Study 2 replicated these results using an online conformity paradigm, thereby isolating the effects of racial group composition from concomitant social cues in face-to-face settings. Study 3 presented a third condition-a diverse group that included one other White member. Individuals conformed less in both types of diverse groups as compared with the homogeneous group. Evidence suggests this was because Whites in homogeneous (vs. diverse) settings were more likely to reconsider their original decision after learning how other group members responded.

AB  - The authors investigate the relationship between Muslim minority size and inequality using a new cross-sectional dataset of 599 Indian districts. The authors review existing studies, propose a new population growth inequality theory, and develop three hypotheses. A newly constructed multidimensional index of social well-being is used as a proxy for intergroup inequality. A multi-level mixed effects regression analysis with controls for urbanization and state-level effects is applied. The authors find a U-shaped relationship between the size of the Muslim minority and its absolute and relative well-being. Well-being reaches the lowest point when minority reaches approximately 50% of the population in a district. The average gap in well-being tends to be larger in the districts with lower socio-economic development.

AB  - Explicit attitudes towards inclusion are increasingly investigated in (preservice) teachers. However, few studies examine implicit attitudes towards inclusion, despite the advantage of being less sensitive to social desirability. Since inclusion is a sensitive topic, we aimed to investigate implicit and explicit attitudes towards inclusion as well as interactions between these attitudes. Using the Single-Target Implicit Association Test, early semester preservice teachers exhibited ambivalent implicit attitudes and positive explicit attitudes. Implicit attitudes were negatively correlated with explicit attitudes. Methodological and contentual explanations for these findings are discussed and theory-based implications for university education are suggested. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ObjectiveAttitudes toward asylum seekers that have been reported in Australia are negative and pervasive. To date, this body of literature has explored only measured explicit responses. This article is the first to explore their implicit counterpart.
   MethodTwo cross-sectional studies measured explicit and implicit attitudes towards asylum seekers. The first study used a community sample (N=183, M-age=24.98years, 115 females), and the second used a sample of students (N=106, M-age=22.75years, 87 female). The sample in Study 2 also responded to scales measuring levels of ideological orientations toward social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and principle of social justice.
   ResultsIn Study 1, an exploration of demographic variables revealed that gender predicted explicit attitudes, but gender and religious affiliation predicted implicit attitudes. In Study 2, an exploration of ideological variables revealed that higher levels of SDO and RWA predict negative explicit attitudes, and macrojustice principles predict positive explicit attitudes, but only SDO predicts (negative) implicit attitudes.
   ConclusionsThe evidence presented reveals some discrepancies between factors that predict explicit and implicit attitudes toward this socially vulnerable group, and the findings are interpreted as evidence for a dual-construct model of attitudes toward asylum seekers.

AB  - Video recording technology allows for the discovery of psychological phenomena that might otherwise go unnoticed. We focus here on gesture as an example of such a phenomenon. Gestures are movements of the hands or body that people spontaneously produce while speaking or thinking through a difficult problem. Despite their ubiquity, speakers are not always aware that they are gesturing, and listeners are not always aware that they are observing gesture. We review how video technology has facilitated major insights within the field of gesture research by allowing researchers to capture, quantify, and better understand these transient movements. We propose that gesture, which can be easily missed if it is not a researcher's focus, has the potential to affect thinking and learning in the people who produce it, as well as in the people who observe it, and that it can alter the communicative context of an experiment or social interaction. Finally, we discuss the challenges of using video technology to capture gesture in psychological studies, and we discuss opportunities and suggestions for making use of this rich source of information both within the field of developmental psychology and within the field of organizational psychology.

AB  - The ability to rapidly and accurately decode facial expressions is adaptive for human sociality. Although judgments of emotion are primarily determined by musculature, static face structure can also impact emotion judgments. The current work investigates how facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR). a stable feature of all faces, influences perceivers' judgments of expressive displays of anger and fear (Studies 1a, 1b, & 2). and anger and happiness (Study 3). Across 4 studies, we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that perceivers more readily see anger on faces with high fWHR compared with those with low fWHR. which instead facilitates the recognition of fear and happiness. This bias emerges when participants are led to believe that targets displaying otherwise neutral faces are attempting to mask an emotion (Studies 1a & 1b). and is evident when faces display an emotion (Studies 2 & 3). Together. these studies suggest that target facial width-to-height ratio biases ascriptions of emotion with consequences for emotion recognition speed and accuracy.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that there is a negative relationship between ethnic diversity in a local community and social cohesion. Often the way social cohesion is assessed, though, varies across studies and only some aspects of the construct are included (e.g., trust). The current research explores the relationship between diversity and social cohesion across a number of indicators of social cohesion including neighbourhood social capital, safety, belonging, generalized trust, and volunteering. Furthermore, social psychological theories concerning the role of positive contact and its impact on feelings of threat are investigated. Using a sample of 1070 third generation 'majority' Australians and structural equation modelling (SEM), findings suggest ethnic diversity is related to positive intergroup contact, and that contact showed beneficial impacts for some indicators of social cohesion both directly and indirectly through reducing perceived threat. When interethnic contact and perceived threat are included in the model there is no direct negative effect between diversity and social cohesion. The theoretical implications of these findings are outlined including the importance of facilitating opportunities for positive contact in diverse communities.

AB  - This paper describes a novel concept of customer discrimination in the housing market, neighbor discrimination. We develop a matching model with ethnic externalities in which landlords differ in the number of apartments they own within the same building. Larger landlords are more likely to discriminate only if some tenants are prejudiced against the minority group. Observing that minority tenants are less likely than majority group tenants to live in a building with a single large landlord is thus evidence of neighbor discrimination. We show empirically that African immigrants in France are significantly less likely to live in a building owned by a single landlord. This increases the probability that African immigrants live in public housing in localities with more single-landlord private apartment blocks.

AB  - Despite societal shifts, women are still underrepresented in leadership positions. Previous research has found that women are often placed in risky and precarious leadership positions. This is likely to be the case when the context (economic, social, political) is uncertain. This article investigates (1) the support given to women leaders with leadership styles that are congruent or not with gender stereotypes, under uncertainty (Study 1) and (2) the role of counterstereotypical thinking in strengthening the support for women leaders who are role congruent (vs. incongruent) under uncertainty (Study 2). Study 1 found a preference for strong, role incongruent women leaders in times of uncertainty (vs. certainty). Study 2 found that this preference can be attenuated and role congruent women leaders perceived as more effective following a counterstereotypical thinking intervention that challenge participants' social cognitive processing styles. We discuss applied implications regarding how to effectively promote diversity in leadership.

AB  - Role congruity theory predicts that female leaders will experience prejudice because the role of leader aligns more closely with the stereotypic male gender role than it does with the stereotypic female role. Yet the theory also states that the context of leadership matters. Female leaders in communal contexts often do not experience prejudice because the communal role is congruent to the female role. The purpose of my study is to examine female leadership within the context of the religious congregation and the profession of the clergy. Using multilevel models to analyze Wave 2 of the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (50,595 congregants in 255 congregations), I tested two competing hypotheses about whether the role of clergyperson is congruous or incongruous for women based on congregants' perceptions of their leaders. I also hypothesized that female clergy using a more masculine leadership style would experience more prejudice. Results offer support for the hypothesis that female clergy experience role congruity, yet, I also found that they experience prejudice if they use a more masculine leadership style. These findings have implications that suggest that, even though there are behavioral restrictions for women, the profession of clergy is an amenable profession for female leaders.

AB  - This article investigates different sources of generalised trust among ethnic Danes and non-Western immigrants together with the gap in trust levels across the two groups. New survey data from Denmark were utilised, and the variables included socioeconomic resources, interethnic contact, perceptions of institutional fairness, timespan in Denmark, national identification and language proficiency. The results showed that interethnic contact and institutional fairness matter less for immigrants than for Danes vis-a-vis trust and that these variables alone do not explain the trust gap. The results also showed that their interactions with ethnicity reduce the trust gap for respondents with little interethnic contact or negative perceptions of institutions. Share of lifespan spent in Denmark also correlated negatively with social trust for immigrants. The results are discussed as the reflection of dynamic acculturation and changing expectations rather than socialisation or distinctly personal experiences.

AB  - Psychological research and theory have traditionally focused on bias and conflict between separate groups. Our central thesis is that the processes that shape hierarchical group relations within a society are distinctive and typically operate in ways that are frequently subtle rather than blatant. The challenges of detecting new subtle forms of bias are receiving considerable attention in the field of social psychology, internationally. Although explicit hostility toward minority groups seems to have faded in modern societies, cross-cultural data show that the status, resources, and the power of women and ethnic/racial minorities remain unequal. The present literature review integrates the findings of cross-cultural research showing the role of paternalistic legitimizing ideas and behavior for establishing, maintaining, and reinforcing group hierarchy and the disadvantage of members of traditionally underrepresented groups. Specifically, we explain how intergroup helping relations can be used as a mechanism to maintain social advantage in racial and gender relations. These theoretical and experimental insights help illuminate the dynamics of relations between socially linked groups and the nature of contemporary bias. We also highlight how this perspective suggests novel and productive directions for future research.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the causes and consequences of animosity that Sunni Arabs may harbor against Iran and Turkey - two regional powers and key players in the Middle East.
   Design/methodology/approach Using Jordanians as proxy for Sunni Arab consumers, data were collected from 218 respondents by means of an intercept survey. A systematic random sampling was used in selecting the respondents. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the role of religious/sectarian commitment (Sunni Islamic), ethnic identification (Arab), nationalism, patriotism and internationalism as potential sources of animosity of Sunni Arabs toward Iran and Turkey.
   Findings The findings show integrative/multiplicative impact of various social attributes on Sunni Arabs' animosity toward Iran and Turkey and indicate a higher prevalence of animosity toward Iran than toward Turkey among the respondents. The findings also show how animosity decreases the likelihood of buying Iranian and Turkish products by Jordanian consumers.
   Research limitations/implications This paper, while unearthing interesting relationships among five antecedent variables, consumer animosity and purchase intentions, calls for further research to examine how the relationships between feelings of animosity and willingness to purchase products could be moderated by variables such as world-mindedness and foreign travel. Future researchers should also study how consumer animosity can be reduced.
   Practical implications The findings provide insights as to how foreign marketers can adjust their marketing strategies in the lucrative Arab market.
   Social implications The findings call for a more nuanced understanding of the role of religious/sectarian commitment, ethnicity, nationalism, patriotism and internationalism in causing and/or exacerbating animosity and consequently affecting purchase decisions of consumers.
   Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by measuring the hitherto unexamined role of intra-religious sectarian feelings in consumer animosity and purchase decisions and by analyzing the mediating role of consumer animosity between the five antecedent variables and willingness to purchase products from enemy countries.

AB  - Prototypical kinds of sexism (a man derogating a woman) are more often detected than non-prototypical kinds (a woman derogating another woman) because the former ones match the mental representation of discrimination. We proposed a motivational process may also account for this prototype effect, and that the prototype effect is moderated by the observer's self-presentation concerns. In two studies, we showed that under positive self-presentation instructions and under unspecified instructions, comparable levels of prototype effect are obtained, and are larger than under negative self-presentation instructions. These results suggest that the prototype effect which is typically obtained might partially be a consequence of a motivation to appear as egalitarian by reporting blatant forms of prejudice and discrimination rather than subtle ones.

AB  - This paper investigates whether analytic philosophers who are non-native English speakers are subject to linguistic injustice and, if yes, what kind of injustice that is and whether it is different from the general disadvantage that non-native English speakers meet in a world where English is rapidly becoming the lingua franca. The paper begins with a critical review of the debate on linguistic justice, with a particular focus on the emergence of a lingua franca and the related questions of justice, both in terms of the disadvantages suffered by those groups who bear the cost of learning another language and in terms of forms of discrimination due to accents and language improprieties. We argue that being at a relative disadvantage compared to others does not necessarily translate in a proper injustice if fundamental civil, political and social provisions are in place. We suggest that a circumstance of injustice arises when such disadvantage affects those who are not yet members of such academic community such as prospective students, thus contributing in keeping the non-native group a minority. We qualify this case of disadvantage as a matter of structural injustice.

AB  - People with Down syndrome experience a type of ambivalent stigmatisation, which combines stereotypes, emotional reactions, and both positive and negative attitudes. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between ambivalent attitudes towards people with Down syndrome, and the levels of intergroup trust and anxiety felt towards them. A total of 144 university students completed a questionnaire on their social perception of people with Down syndrome, indicating the extent to which they anticipate an interaction with this group based on trust or anxiety. The results show that responses to people with Down syndrome are ambivalent. Moreover, while intergroup trust is associated with high levels of admiration and competence, intergroup anxiety is associated with high levels of aversion, compassion and low admiration. We discuss the implications of these results, taking into account how to enhance the social perception of people with Down syndrome, as well as the complex role of compassion in the assessment of stigmatised groups.

AB  - Purpose Women-led companies receive less than 5 per cent of early-stage equity investment. This paper aims to explore the disparity in equity funding between men- and women-led companies, using a social identity perspective, complemented by insights from signaling theory. We argue that in the angel group context, which is male-dominated, gender stereotypes may bias angels' interpretation of the signals sent by entrepreneurs, so that entrepreneurial ventures led by men are more favorably evaluated, thus excluding women entrepreneurs from funding. The ideas are tested on a sample of 358 entrepreneurs who applied for funding from a northeast US angel group using perceptual data from both sides of the investment dyad. Findings suggest that angel investors view women-led entrepreneurial ventures as having less legitimacy, even though we see no difference in actual legitimacy across ventures.
   Design/methodology/approach The ideas are tested on a sample of 358 entrepreneurs who applied for funding from a northeast angel group using perceptual data from both sides of the investment dyad.
   Findings The findings suggest that, in the context of angel investing, there is a subtle bias that follows from the perceived stereotype between being female and the ability to lead a legitimate new venture. Thus, this study tests the tenets of the social identity theory by finding that mostly male angel investors act in accordance to their gender prescribed roles when they evaluate businesses presented by women entrepreneurs providing some evidence of in-group and out-group effects and stereotypes.
   Research limitations/implications The findings continue the conversation about biases toward women in early-stage financing by using a social identity lens to look at the way in which adopted identities lead to particular outcomes and stereotypes. The authors have used the context of angel investing to test these ideas, finding some support for their contention that gender is pivotal when angels are making investment decisions. For researchers, this study suggests that gender should not be used solely as a control variable, but instead should be the focus of the inquiry itself.
   Practical implications For practitioners, this study reminds women seeking angel investment that they are not playing on a level field and so they should do all that they can to enhance the legitimacy of themselves and their ventures.
   Originality/value The authors contend that within an angel group that is composed of predominantly men, role stereotypes of entrepreneurs as masculine will be expected, therefore creating gender biases against women. The authors expect these biases, whether conscious or unconscious, will lead the angel investors to evaluate men entrepreneurs more favorably than women entrepreneurs as they move through the angel investment process. Therefore, for women entrepreneurs in the early stages of investment funding, the authors posit that the dearth of funding is a function of gender identity stereotypes which may be manifested in hidden and often unconscious biases on the part of the angel investor.

AB  - Despite greater recognition of rights and responsibilities around the care of cancer patients who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) within healthcare systems in the United Kingdom, recent quantitative evidence suggests that they experience poorer care than heterosexual counterparts and qualitative findings are limited. Therefore, in the present study, we present an analysis of the accounts of fifteen British LGB cancer patients (diagnosed with different forms of the disease) of the care received. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Three of the emerging themes are discussed. These include an examination of what we conceptualise as the awkward choreography around disclosure' opportunities and dilemmas for LGB patients, we describe making sense of sub-optimal care' which included instances of overt discrimination but was more frequently manifested through micro-aggressions and heteronormative systems and practices, and explore accounts of alienation from usual psychosocial cancer support'. We employ Meyer's Minority Stress Theory (2003) as a lens to interrogate the data and explore the ways in which actual or anticipated prejudice affected their experiences of treatment and support. We close with recommendations to enhance LGB-affirmative cancer care including enhanced training of healthcare professionals and explicit articulation of institutional commitment to LGB equality.

AB  - This paper argues against incorporating assessments of individual responsibility into healthcare policies by expanding an existing argument and offering a rebuttal to an argument in favour of such policies. First, it is argued that what primarily underlies discussions surrounding personal responsibility and healthcare is not causal responsibility, moral responsibility or culpability, as one might expect, but biases towards particular highly stigmatised behaviours. A challenge is posed for proponents of taking personal responsibility into account within health policy to either expand the debate to also include socially accepted behaviours or to provide an alternative explanation of the narrowly focused discussion. Second, a critical response is offered to arguments that claim that policies based on personal responsibility would lead to several positive outcomes including healthy behaviour change, better health outcomes and decreases in healthcare spending. It is argued that using individual responsibility as a basis for resource allocation in healthcare is unlikely to motivate positive behaviour changes, and is likely to increase inequality which may lead to worse health outcomes overall. Finally, the case of West Virginia's Medicaid reform is examined, which raises a worry that policies focused on personal responsibility have the potential to lead to increases in medical spending overall.

AB  - Research suggests that women weigh the perceived costs and benefits when deciding whether to confront sexism on behalf of themselves or other women. Novel to the present research, we tested whether men similarly weigh the anticipated costs and benefits when deciding whether to confront sexism on behalf of women. Using path analysis across 2 correlational studies, we also investigated how endorsement of a masculine protection ideology predicted frequency of confronting sexism on behalf of socially close (e.g., girlfriend, sister) versus distant (e.g., acquaintance, stranger) women. Results from Study 1 (N = 148 undergraduate men) revealed that men were motivated by the perceived benefit, but not the perceived cost, when deciding whether to confront sexism. In both studies (Study 2 N = 205 male MTurk workers), the extent to which men endorsed a masculine ideology of protection positively predicted their frequency of confronting for socially close, but not distant women. We conclude that in some cases paternalistic masculinity may promote antisexist behavior (confronting on behalf of socially close women), although the impact of those confrontations for sexism reduction remains to be tested.

AB  - From a theoretical perspective, there is consensus that religion is positively associated with prosocial behaviors. However, rather little is known about whether religion can increase the accessibility of prosocial concepts among nonbelievers. In the current study, we explored the influence of religion on the accessibility of such concepts among nonbelievers of Buddhism using supraliminal and subliminal priming techniques. Specifically, we employed 20 each of Buddhist and neutral words as priming stimuli, along with 20 each of prosocial and antisocial words as target stimuli. Participants were asked to determine, as quickly and as accurately as possible, if a presented word had a prosocial or antisocial meaning. In Study 1, participants were supraliminally primed (200 ms) with Buddhist words. The results showed that participants recognized prosocial words more quickly than they did antisocial words when primed with Buddhist words than with neutral words. In Study 2, we used subliminal priming (38ms), and obtained the same results as in Study 1. Taken together, the results suggest that Buddhist concepts, whether primed explicitly or implicitly, increased the mental accessibility of prosocial concepts.

AB  - There is disagreement in the literature as to whether biological attribution increases or decreases stigma. This study investigated the effect of an online biological intervention on stigma and help-seeking intentions for depression among adolescents. A three-arm, pre-post test, double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) was used to compare the effects of a biological and a psychosocial intervention delivered online. Participants comprised secondary school students (N = 327) aged 16-19 years. Outcome measures included anticipated self-stigma for depression (primary), personal stigma, help-seeking intention for depression, and biological and psychosocial attribution. Neither the biological nor the psychosocial educational intervention significantly reduced anticipated self-stigma or personal stigma for depression relative to the control. However, a small increase in help-seeking intention for depression relative to the control was found for the biological educational condition. The study was undertaken over a single session and it is unknown whether the intervention effect on help-seeking intentions was sustained or would translate into help-seeking behaviour. A brief online biological education intervention did not alter stigma, but did promote a small increase in help-seeking intentions for depression among adolescents. This type of intervention may be a practical means for facilitating help-seeking among adolescents with current or future depression treatment needs.

AB  - This study focuses on essentialist beliefs about homosexuality as determinants of discriminatory intentions against gay men and lesbian women (LG) and the readiness to engage in positive action toward them. A sample of 997 exclusively heterosexual adults participated in an online study set in Croatia, a country with high homophobia undergoing social change that threatens the higher status of the heterosexual majority. Beliefs about immutability and universality of homosexuality were associated with less intention to discriminate and more readiness to engage in positive behavior, while discreteness beliefs were inversely related to both. Furthermore, attitudes toward LGs seem to be the mechanism behind the observed links. Results suggest essentialist beliefs might be fuel for attitudes, which are in turn associated with behavioral intentions. Importantly, essentialist beliefs had both indirect (with attitudes as mediators) and direct effects on behavioral intentions speaking in favor of their robust role in explaining LG-related phenomena.

AB  - Historically, the legal system justified family law's rules and policies through morality, common sense, and prevailing cultural norms. In a sharp departure, and consistent with a broader trend across the legal system, empirical evidence increasingly dominates the regulation of families.
   There is much to celebrate in this empirical turn. Properly used, empirical evidence in family law can help the state act more effectively and efficiently, unmask prejudice, and depoliticize contentious battles. But the empirical turn also presents substantial concerns. Beyond perennial issues of the quality of empirical evidence and the ability of legal actors to use it, there are more fundamental problems: Using empirical evidence focuses attention on the outcomes of legal rules, discouraging a debate about contested and competing values. Reliance on empirical evidence overlays a veneer of neutrality on normative judgments. And uncritically adopting evidence about present conditions without interrogating the role of historical discrimination that continues to disadvantage some families can replicate that discrimination.
   Given the promise and peril of the empirical turn in family law, this Essay proposes a framework to guide the use of this evidence. The framework preserves space for debating multiple values and advises decisionmakers when to use empirical evidence, with particular attention to the dangers for nondominant families. The framework also recommends strengthening evidentiary gatekeeping and elevating the potential for legal scholarship to serve as a bridge from the broader research base to the courts. With this guidance in place, empirical evidence can take its rightful place as a useful but cabined tool in the legal regulation of families.

AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me. The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon's controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers' comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have choice; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon's critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both born-this-way and choice arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice.

AB  - Biases against the elderly and people with disabilities can lead to discriminatory behaviors. One way to conceptualize attitudes toward the elderly and people with disabilities is through the differentiation of explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) factors. Although both explicit and implicit attitudes and biases contribute to the full picture of peoples' attitudes, explicit ideas alone may not accurately reflect people's attitudes. This may be due to societal pressure to conceal explicit biases or the fact that often times, people are not aware they hold prejudiced views. The Implicit Association Test is a computer-based categorization task designed to assess implicit or unconscious attitudes. This test was used in in the current study to assess the impact of an intergenerational service-learning course. We designed this study to determine if greater exposure or contact with the elderly or people with disabilities might influence college students' implicit attitudes. Pre- and post-assessment of participating students, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, found statistically significant decreased biases after participation. Results from this study that suggest participating in an intergenerational service-learning course can positively affect implicit attitudes. This is encouraging, especially because these attitudes are developed over a long period of repeated exposure, are consistently reinforced by cultural factors, and are notoriously difficult to change.

AB  - Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at elevated risk for sexually transmissible infection (STI) acquisition globally. Yet, limited research has explored STI testing practices among MSM in contexts where same-sex practices are criminalised, such as in Jamaica. Methods: A cross-sectional, tablet-based survey with MSM in Kingston, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay, Jamaica, was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the adjusted risk ratio for lifetime STI testing and lifetime STI diagnosis. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the relative odds of having had an STI test 3-5 months ago and 6-12 months ago in comparison with <3 months ago. Results: Three-quarters (74.8%) of the 556 participants reported receiving an STI test (44% <3 months ago; 32% 3-5 months ago; 13% 6-12 months ago; 10% >12 months ago); 12.1% reported ever receiving an STI diagnosis. In adjusted multivariable analyses, STI testing was associated with sociodemographic (education, location), individual (depression, perceived risk), social (relationship status, sexual stigma) and structural (healthcare provider access) factors. In multinomial analysis, reporting a less recent STI test (>3 months ago) versus <3 months ago was associated with increased likelihood of sexual stigma and food insecurity. Lifetime STI diagnosis was associated with sociodemographic (location), individual (HIV infection) and social (lower social support) factors. Conclusions: Findings document associations between structural factors and delayed timing of STI testing. Further research is necessary to explore how to address social ecological factors in sexual health interventions with MSM in Jamaica.

AB  - Although much research suggests that intergroup contact reduces prejudice, less research has examined the effects of contact on prosocial intergroup bystander behaviors. The current study examined mediators between White undergraduate women's (N = 139) contact with racial/ethnic minority group members and their intent to help a Black woman at risk for sexual assault. As expected, White women who had more frequent and higher quality contact reported greater intent to intervene. Results showed that the effect of quality intergroup contact was mediated by diversity beliefs, or the attitude that cultural heterogeneity leads to favorable outcomes. These results suggest that promoting high-quality opportunities for intergroup contact and education regarding cultural diversity could promote the safety of racially and ethnically diverse students on predominantly White campuses.

AB  - Thinking of racism through the lens of its geographies and temporality - a transnational lens, as I understand it - is productive for our understanding of the current process of social integration of immigrants in European cities. I argue that an interactive model of racism can help us understand the spread (and revival) of racism in Europe, and develop a new take on intersections of racism and immigration. Using the example of the Polish post-enlargement immigration to England, I scrutinize how racism is altered through social networks spanning localities within and across national borders. I demonstrate how the research participants incorporate, reproduce, and transform racism present in the British multicultural public space into a cultural repertoire (habitus) they internalized before migration. I argue that racism is a transnational outcome of ongoing negotiations between past and current experiences, and between parties in two or more geographical locations.

AB  - Numerous media news items suggest on a daily basis that people tend to use harsher criteria when they judge immigrants than members of their own in-group. In the present research project, we were interested in studying individual justice judgments of a violation of a law by an Italian (in-group) or an immigrant (out-group) member and the influence of moral exclusion processes on the assessment. In particular, we examined whether those people who tend to exclude out-groups from their scope of justice will give such biased judgments and will adopt double standards, while inclusive people will not. A total of 255 people evaluated the seriousness of a crime in two different law-breaking scenarios in which the offender's and the victim's nationalities were systematically changed (either Italian or Romanian). Moreover, participants completed a scale measuring the moral inclusion/exclusion of other social groups. As hypothesized, participants who tended to exclude some groups from their moral community judged the Romanian more harshly than the Italian culprit. On the contrary, those people that tended to have a more inclusive moral community did not show any difference in evaluation. In conclusion, the present research highlights the importance of considering the effect of moral inclusion/exclusion processes on the evaluation of justice events, especially in an intergroup context.

AB  - Throughout the Guianas, people of all ethnicities fear one particular kind of demonic spirit. Called baccoo in Guyana, bakru in coastal Suriname, and bakulu or bakuu among Saamaka and Ndyuka Maroons in the interior, these demons offer personal wealth in exchange for human life. Based on multisited ethnography in Guyana and Suriname, this paper analyzes converging and diverging conceptions of the "same" spirit among several Afro- and Indo-Guianese populations. We argue that transformations in how people conceptualize bakulu reveal how supposedly radical moral differences are constructed within and between populations in the multi-ethnic Caribbean. More than figurative projections of monetized inequality or racial and ethnic prejudices, baccoo actively mediate how people throughout the Guianas think about and experience the everyday conduct of economic and racial relations.

AB  - This research examined how implicit attitudes are associated with cognitive processing and self-reported evaluation of advertisements featuring same-sex couples. Hypotheses were posited using the theoretical framework of social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1986) and perspectives on implicit attitudes. In Study 1, participants watched and evaluated 10 television advertisements while physiological measures of cognitive and affective processing were collected. Ads varied such that half used same-sex couples as protagonists while the other half used other-sex couples. Participants demonstrated less positive responses to ads featuring same-sex couples. Physiological and self-reported responses were associated with implicit attitudes toward homosexuality Negative implicit attitudes toward homosexuality were associated with more negative affect, less attention, less positivity, and less liking for ads featuring same-sex couples. Two subsequent studies replicated these findings in nonstudent samples, indicating that participants preferred ads with other-sex couples (Study 2) and that implicit attitudes were associated with this response (Study 3). This research suggests that implicit attitudes affect processing and evaluation of ads featuring same-sex couples in ways unaccounted for by explicitly measured attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of advancing theory, furthering understanding of the dynamic processing of ads featuring in-group and out-group members, and practical implications.

AB  - Scholarly research on HIV/AIDS and stigma has largely demonstrated a different experience for people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) who inhabit urban and rural areas. Largely missing from this scholarship are experiences in low prevalence areas. Low prevalence areas typically have fewer resources, social networks, and HIV infection and prevalence is less common. In this paper, we examine the challenges PLWHAs in rural and urban areas of the Midwest face and how these individuals manage, respond, and combat HIV/AIDS related stigmas in their communities. This paper utilizes interview data to understand the lived experiences of 18 persons living with HIV and AIDS. This paper reveals that respondents in rural areas are likely to be geographically dispersed, struggle with accessing healthcare services, believe their communities are less tolerant, and are less likely to disclose their positive status or seek out social support. Respondents who lived in urban areas were more likely to disclose their positive status, have access to AIDS service organizations and social support, and to participate in advocacy in the "HIV Community." Our study demonstrates how social and community context are agentic players in shaping life chances, decisions, and behavior of the PLWHAs we interviewed.

AB  - In spite of our good intentions and explicit egalitarian convictions, we habitually disfavor the underprivileged. The rapidly growing literature on implicit bias - unconscious, automatic tendencies to associate negative traits with members of particular social groups - points towards explanations of this dissonance, although rarely towards generalizable solutions. In a recent paper, Jennifer Saul (2013) draws attention to the alarming epistemological problems that implicit bias carries with it; since our judgments about each other are likely influenced by implicit bias, we have good reason to doubt their veracity. In this paper we explore a novel way to come to terms with the epistemological problem as it manifests itself in ranking situations, i.e. how we can know that the way in which we have ranked a group of people for a certain position, reflects their actual competence (or the best estimate of their competence given the evidence). On our approach, rather than attempting to make people less biased, we suggest that biased behavior can sometimes be corrected after the fact. In particular, the veracity of rankings can sometimes be improved by modifying the rankings directly. We investigate three methods that modify biased rankings, and argue that the last of these solves the epistemological problem that we are concerned with.

AB  - This paper examines how a group of white ethnic, mostly Italian American, Catholics participate in ethno-religious place making in a predominantly Latino church. In light of a growing number of Latino parishioners, white ethnic church members engage in place making activities to ascribe a white ethno-religious identity to place. Drawing on participant observations, interviews, and archival documents, I examine the impetus behind, and strategies used, in making ethnoreligious place. I find that place attachment and group threat drive white ethnics to make place. They do so by employing strategies of place making, place marking, and place marketing. The findings point to the importance of using place as a focal point of social analysis and understanding how people make place.

AB  - This study assesses individual social attitudes and ideological beliefs regarding systems of power and sexism (i.e., Authoritarianism, Conservatism, Traditionalism, Social Dominance Orientation [SDO], Hostile Sexism [HS], and Benevolent Sexism [BS]) in relationship to Bible interpretation choice about passages related to gender. Data were collected from 216 conservative Protestant Christian churchgoers. It was hypothesized that individuals with higher levels of Authoritarianism, Conservatism, Traditionalism, SDO, HS, and BS would prefer interpretations that endorse gender hierarchy. The results supported these hypotheses, finding Traditionalism and HS to be the primary factors related to interpretation choice. Additionally, it was hypothesized that any significant difference between men and women regarding interpretation choice would be explained by individual differences in these social attitudes and ideological beliefs. Men were significantly more likely than women to prefer Bible interpretations oriented toward gender hierarchy, and this difference was primarily explained by Traditionalism and HS.

AB  - Objective: As a strategy for the identification and treatment of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), we sought to reduce stigmatising attitudes concerning AN among members of their potential social network.
   Design: Three forms of stigma were focused upon: traditional, positive volitional and negative volitional. Stigmatising attitudes were captured at baseline, and after the first and second interventions.
   Setting: Male and female undergraduates at a university in Australia.
   Method: In all, 122 undergraduate students were randomly allocated into two groups where via videos one group received information about AN from a medical professional (education) followed by a person who has recovered from AN presenting her experiences (contact). The second group received a contact then education intervention.
   Results: Repeated measures ANOVA showed that participants' volitional stigma was lesser than at baseline following the presentation of the first intervention for both education and contact. However, levels of traditional stigma did not significantly differ. Contact was more effective in reducing positive volitional stigma than education for men, but both were equally effective for women.
   Conclusion: Study findings provides support for the value of using video-based interventions to change attitudes to stigmatised conditions and demonstrated that education and contact intervention strategies were effective in reducing stigmatising attitudes towards AN in university students.

KW  - SUPPORT
AB  - Most of the public opinion research about sexual and gender minorities has focused on attitudes about lesbians and gay men, support for gay rights policies, and the factors that affect these attitudes. In particular, interpersonal contact with gay and lesbian individuals consistently is shown to positively affect attitudes toward these groups. Comparable studies about transgender people and transgender rights are few in number, and these studies find inconsistent effects of interpersonal contact on attitudes toward transgender people. Through the use of two unique national surveys, we explore the influence of contact with transgender people on attitudes about transgender people and about transgender rights. Results show that contact has a positive effect on attitudes, and that this effect is consistent across the two surveys and across different specifications of interpersonal contact. We discuss the implications for interpersonal contact with transgender people.
   Interpersonal contact is a key factor shaping attitudes toward gay and lesbian individuals and their rights (Lewis 2011), but evidence regarding the effect of contact with transgender individuals(1) is unsettled. For instance, while interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians has a positive secondary transfer effect to opinions about transgender rights (Norton and Herek 2013), no such effect exists for contact with transgender people (Flores 2015). Given recent controversies related to public restroom usage, as demonstrated by debates surrounding North Carolina's contentious Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, we empirically examine whether and under what conditions contact with transgender individuals influences attitudes about transgender people and rights. We find that interpersonal contact has a positive effect on attitudes that is consistent across both surveys and multiple specifications of contact.

AB  - Abundant HCI research exists on the many assistive technologies that provide help with everyday physical and cognitive tasks. However, while a purely assistive approach often casts aging people in passive roles, recent studies suggest that adults may be 'flourishing' way into advanced age, even though implicit ageist prejudices are difficult to eradicate. Negative age-related stereotypes are the hidden and yet urgent issue we address in this study. There is a clear opportunity for an anti-ageist perspective in HCI, an approach that we propose as complementary to assistive technologies: in addition to providing solutions for the aging population, we urgently call for designs about aging, to spark a conversation on age, raise awareness and ultimately contrast ageist stereotypes. We point at empathy as a key element to reconceptualize, at least in part, HCI's contribution to research on aging. We present a design critique of two interactive pieces that, although not without flaws, suggest how future empathy-raising artifacts might be. Our analysis combines pragmatist aesthetics, interaction criticism and ludology, and yields four design tactics (recurring configurations of significant elements) that are generative in bringing about broader design implications towards a different, empathy-based concept of aging in HCI.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   We situate our work in the general agenda of designing for 'aging well.'
   Empathy is already a familiar notion in HCI research, and we point at it to reconceptualize - at least in part - how HCI relates to aging adults.
   We select two artifacts, The Graveyard and Alz, as 'objects to think with,' and we produce a design critique leveraging pragmatist aesthetics and interaction criticism.
   In the artifacts, we tease out four configurations of significant elements that reveal a different conceptualization of age and aging.
   Our design critique exemplifies how age-related HCI may move beyond purely assistive approaches, and present aging adults not only as people to assist but also to empathize with.
   More generally, it also suggests a broader reconceptualization of HCI research for/about/with aging people, expanding its scope to include also empathy-raising designs.

AB  - Civil Rights theories upon which this study is based are the conviction, social change and culture's constraints theories of Civil Rights, whilst moral competence has been considered from the perspective of moral intelligence, moral competence and dual-aspect theories of morality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between perceived Civil Rights and moral competence; to analyze the role of perceived Civil Rights in the prediction of moral competence; and to investigate the role of gender on these constructs in a sample of Iranian adults. The randomly selected sample consisted of 400 adult participants (M = 190 and F = 210) from the cities of Abadeh, Bavanat, Eghlid and Khorambid; the north of Fars Province, Iran. A demographic questionnaire, the Perceived Civil Rights Scale (PCRS) and the Moral Competency Inventory (MCI) were used in this study. Findings showed that perceived Civil Rights and its subscales had significant relationships to the MCI and its subscales. The personal space subscale of perceived Civil Rights predicted 18 % of the total of the moral competency's variability in this sample. It was also found that males had higher scores on the free confession and testimony subscale of perceived Civil Rights, whilst females had higher scores on the standing up for rightness subscale of moral competency.

AB  - Credibility is central to the legal treatment of sexual violence, as epitomized by the iconic "he said/she said" contest. Over time, the resolution of competing factual accounts has evidenced a deeply skeptical orientation toward rape accusers. This incredulous stance remains firmly lodged, having migrated from formal legal rules to informal practices, with much the same result-an enduring system of disbelief. Introducing the concept of "credibility discounting" helps to explain the dominant feature of our legal response to rape. Although false reports of rape are uncommon, law enforcement officers tend to default to doubt when women allege sexual assault, resulting in curtailed investigations as well as infrequent arrests and prosecutions. Credibility discounts, which are meted out at every stage of the criminal process, involve downgrades both to trustworthiness (corresponding to testimonial injustice) and to plausibility (corresponding to hermeneutical injustice).
   By conceptualizing prejudiced disbelief as a distinct failure of justice, one deserving of separate consideration, we may begin to grasp the full implications of credibility discounting, beyond faulty criminal justice outcomes. Attending to this failure of epistemic justice on its own terms advances a conversation about how best to reform institutions so that credibility judgments do not perpetuate inequality. To this end, credibility discounting should count as actionable discrimination. Under certain conditions, moreover, this recognition raises constitutional concerns. When rape victims confront a law enforcement regime predisposed to dismiss their complaints, they are effectively denied the protective resources of the state.

AB  - The magnitude of the happy categorisation advantage, the faster recognition of happiness than negative expressions, is influenced by facial race and sex cues. Previous studies have investigated these relationships using racial outgroups stereotypically associated with physical threat in predominantly Caucasian samples. To determine whether these influences generalise to stimuli representing other ethnic groups and to participants of different ethnicities, Caucasian Australian (Experiments 1 and 2) and Chinese participants (Experiment 2) categorised happy and angry expressions displayed on own-race male faces presented with emotional other-race male, own-race female, and other-race female faces in separate tasks. The influence of social category cues on the happy categorisation advantage was similar in the Australian and Chinese samples. In both samples, the happy categorisation advantage was present for own-race male faces when they were encountered with other-race male faces but reduced when own-race male faces were categorised along with female faces. The happy categorisation advantage was present for own-race and other-race female faces when they were encountered with own-race male faces in both samples. Results suggest similarity in the influence of social category cues on emotion categorisation.

AB  - We address the relationship between educational attainment and radical right voting (i.e., voting for the PVV) in the Netherlands. We tested whether lower educated people are overrepresented among the electorate of the PVV - as often found in earlier research - and considered underlying explanations for this relationship. Using data derived from the Religion in Dutch Society (SOCON, 2011/2012) survey, we were able to empirically test a set of innovative mediators (e.g., interethnic contact, euroscepticism, associational involvement and social trust) simultaneously next to theoretically well-established mediators (e.g., perceived ethnic threat, nationalistic attitudes and authoritarianism). Our results indicated that lower educated people are more likely to cast their vote for the PVV than higher educated people, due to their level of perceived ethnic threat, anti-Muslim attitudes and authoritarianism. Using boot-strapping, only ethnic threat perceptions turned out to significantly mediate the relationship between educational attainment and radical right voting, ruling out many other explanations. Our findings underline the importance of precluding spurious influences when addressing radical right voting and show that radical right parties' emphasis on the economic and cultural threats that immigrants would pose for Western societies seems to bear fruit in terms of mobilizing lower educated people, at least among the Dutch electorate.

AB  - Information drawn from faces at the very first encounter can be essential in guiding current and subsequent behavior. These decisions also rely on expectations about what are the characteristic features of those who can be trusted or not. After novel experiences these expectations will be revised, and the facial prototypes stored in the memory will be updated. The aim of the recent experiment was to test whether behavioral information about individuals will be transferred to composite facial images. We created composite faces of individual images which were previously presented with either positive or negative behavioral descriptions. We found that the composite made from faces shown with traits referring to high social desirability, was rated as significantly more trustworthy. We propose that exposure to faces and acquisition of socially relevant information shape facial prototypes, ensuring that the evaluation of unknown individuals reflects expectations based on real-life experiences. We further propose that this process is mediated by the generalization of behavior information and facial features, rather than the detection of visual similarity.

AB  - Whites' sense of their racial vulnerability has been established as a key facet of U.S. post-civil rights racial ideology. This paper analyzes Whites' victim claims attached to a historical era, via recent in-depth interviews with elder White Southerners, and argues that, through invoking civil rights-era racial vulnerabilitiesmistreatment from social changes and African AmericansWhite Southerners downplay institutional racism, delegitimize the Civil Rights Movement, and construct White innocence and Black pathology. In contrast, younger Whites' victim claims assert Whites as racially innocent and equitably vulnerable to racism, but these narratives of the racial past achieve similar ends. By constructing the civil rights era as dangerous and unjust, elder White Southerners lay claim to a lifelong nonracist identity and deny systemic racism. This analysis suggests that White threat and victim narratives are not products of a post-civil rights milieu, but rather are generated by Whites' use of racial framing to construct a sense of self, other, and society.

AB  - People often disagree about what constitutes sexism, and these disagreements can be both socially and legally consequential. It is unclear, however, why or how people come to different conclusions about whether something or someone is sexist. Previous research on judgments about sexism has focused on the perceiver's gender and attitudes, but neither of these variables identifies comparative standards that people use to determine whether any given behavior (or person) is sexist. Extending Devine and colleagues' values framework (Devine, Monteith, Zuwerink, &Elliot, 1991; Plant & Devine, 1998), we argue that, when evaluating others' behavior, perceivers rely on the morally-prescriptive values that guide their own behavior toward women. In a series of 3 studies we demonstrate that (1) people's personal standards for sexism in their own and others' behavior are each related to their values regarding sexism, (2) these values predict how much behavioral evidence people need to infer sexism, and (3) people with stringent, but not lenient, value-based standards get angry and try to regulate a sexist perpetrator's behavior to reduce sexism. Furthermore, these personal values are related to all outcomes in the present work above and beyond other person characteristics previously used to predict sexism inferences. We discuss the implications of differing value-based standards for explaining and reconciling disputes over what constitutes sexist behavior.

AB  - We investigated intercultural competence among immigrant and non-immigrant background adolescents in multiethnic schools in relation to intercultural contact, age, and ethnic identity exploration. The sample included 631 adolescents in Germany (49.4% of immigrant background, 48.2% female), aged 11 to 18 years (M-age = 13.69 years, SDage = 1.83). Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and situational judgment tests capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural conflicts. Intercultural contacts and ethnic identity exploration were measured using self-report questionnaires. Results showed that among immigrant and non-immigrant background adolescents, intercultural contact and ethnic identity exploration were positively related to different aspects of intercultural competence. As predicted, self-reported intercultural competence was unrelated to age in both groups, whereas this competence, as measured by the situational judgment tests, increased with age. Thus, learning about others (e.g., by engaging in intercultural contact) and learning about yourself (e.g., by exploring your own ethnic background) are both important for developing pivotal intercultural skills.

AB  - Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10-15 years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last edition of 'Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi' in 2008 are provided. The notes include the number of accepted species, classification, type species (with location of the type material), culture availability, life-styles, distribution, and selected publications that have appeared since 2008. This work is intended to provide the foundation for updating the ascomycete component of the "Without prejudice list of generic names of Fungi'' published in 2013, which will be developed into a list of protected generic names. This will be subjected to the XIXth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen in July 2017 agreeing to a modification in the rules relating to protected lists, and scrutiny by procedures determined by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The previously invalidly published generic names Barriopsis, Collophora (as Collophorina), Cryomyces, Dematiopleospora, Heterospora (as Heterosporicola), Lithophila, Palmomyces (as Palmaria) and Saxomyces are validated, as are two previously invalid family names, Bartaliniaceae and Wiesneriomycetaceae. Four species of Lalaria, which were invalidly published are transferred to Taphrina and validated as new combinations. Catenomycopsis Tibell & Constant. is reduced under Chaenothecopsis Vain., while Dichomera Cooke is reduced under Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. (Art. 59).

AB  - Two experiments illustrate that the perception of a given time duration slows when white participants observe faces of black men, but only if participants are concerned with appearing biased. In Experiment 1 the concern with the appearance of bias is measured as a chronic state using the external motivation to respond without prejudice scale (Plant & Devine, 1998). In Experiment 2 it is manipulated by varying the race of the experimenter (black versus white). Time perception is assessed via a temporal discrimination task commonly used in the literature. Models of time perception identify arousal as a factor that causes perceived time to slow, and we speculate that arousal arising in intergroup interactions can alter time perception.

AB  - Teachers' judgments of students' academic achievement are not only affected by the achievement themselves but also by several other characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, and minority status. In real-life classrooms, achievement and further characteristics are often confounded. We disentangled achievement, ethnicity and minority status and examined whether the achievement of ethnic minority students is judged according to the predominant expectation (expectation hypothesis) and whether teachers' judgment accuracy is influenced by students' ethnicity or their minority status (ethnicity hypothesis or minority hypothesis). We conducted 4 experimental studies with a computer simulation (the Simulated Classroom). In Studies 1 and 2 with N = 34 and N = 30 participants, we implemented Turkish (Study 1) and Asian students (Study 2) as minorities. In contrast to the expectation hypothesis, the expectations attributed to the achievement of ethnic minority students did not bias teachers' judgments. In both studies we found greater judgment accuracy for ethnic minority students, thereby probing the ethnicity hypothesis. In Study 3 with N = 48 participants, we further disentangled ethnicity and minority using German students as minority students, thus probing the minority hypothesis. Again, minority students were judged more accurately. Implementing gender (male vs. female) as the minority characteristic in Study 4, with N = 52 participants, yielded the same result: Minority students were judged more accurately, therefore supporting the minority hypothesis. Thus, classroom characteristics need to be considered in research on teachers' judgment accuracy to clarify the influence of individual student characteristics and composition effects beyond individual effects.

AB  - This research aimed to analyse interpersonal behaviour towards immigrants by exploring related psychosocial variables such as intergroup similarity and quality of intergroup contact. A new interpersonal behavioural tendencies scale was developed. In Study 1, Spanish participants reported their willingness to take different actions towards a Moroccan (i.e. a devalued target, n=132) or an Ecuadorian (i.e. a valued target, n=138), perceived intergroup similarity and quality of intergroup contact. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis identified the expected dimensions: active facilitation (AF), passive facilitation (PF), passive harm (PH) and active harm (AH). Participants reported less similarity, less pleasant contact, less AF and less PF, and more PH with respect to Moroccans relative to Ecuadorians. Quality of contact mediated the effect of perceived similarity on interpersonal behaviour (especially facilitative behaviour) towards immigrants. Study 2 (N=134) confirmed that this mediation effect also applied to Romanian immigrants, and tested a serial mediation pathway, in which perceived similarity affected symbolic threat, which in turn affected quality of contact, which finally affected behaviour. Changing perceived intergroup similarity might be a way of improving the quality of contact with minority groups, and this would be expected to increase pro-social behaviour towards such groups.

AB  - The growing body of literature on the recognition of sexual orientation from voice (auditory gaydar) is silent on the cognitive and social consequences of having a gay-/lesbian- versus heterosexual-sounding voice. We investigated this issue in four studies (overall N = 276), conducted in Italian language, in which heterosexual listeners were exposed to single-sentence voice samples of gay/lesbian and heterosexual speakers. In all four studies, listeners were found to make gender-typical inferences about traits and preferences of heterosexual speakers, but gender-atypical inferences about those of gay or lesbian speakers. Behavioral intention measures showed that listeners considered lesbian and gay speakers as less suitable for a leadership position, and male (but not female) listeners took distance from gay speakers. Together, this research demonstrates that having a gay/lesbian rather than heterosexual-sounding voice has tangible consequences for stereotyping and discrimination.

AB  - There is good evidence that many people harbour attitudes that conflict with those they endorse. In the language of social psychology, they seem to have implicit attitudes that conflict with their explicit beliefs. There has been a great deal of attention paid to the question whether agents like this are responsible for actions caused by their implicit attitudes, but much less to the question whether they can rightly be described as (say) racist in virtue of harbouring them. In this paper, I attempt to answer this question using three different standards, providing by the three dominant kinds of accounts of racism (doxastic, behavioural and affective). I argue that on none of these accounts should agents like this be described as racists. However, it would be misleading to say, without qualification, that they are not racists. On none of these accounts are agents like this entirely off the hook.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that simply imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member reduces prejudice, especially if the outgroup member is typical of the whole outgroup. In this research, We tested how a multicultural vs. colorblind mindset might impact the efficacy of imagined contact with a typical or atypical outgroup member. Specifically, we tested the interactive effects between ideologies (multiculturalism vs. colorblindness) and the typicality of the outgroup member (typical vs. atypical) in the imagined encounter. Results revealed that participants exposed to the multicultural ideology who imagined an encounter with an atypical outgroup member expressed fewer positive perceptions (warmth and competence) toward both primary and secondary outgroups compared with respondents exposed to the multicultural ideology who imagined an interaction with a typical outgroup member, and compared with respondents exposed to a colorblind ideology (irrespective of typicality of the outgroup member). The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between cultural ideologies and typicality during intergroup contact when designing interventions aimed at promoting positive intergroup perceptions.

AB  - Recently, a dynamic-interactive model of person construal (DI model) has been proposed, whereby the social categories a person represents are determined on the basis of an iterative integration of bottom-up and top-down influences. The current study sought to test this model by leveraging the high temporal resolution of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as 65 participants viewed male faces that varied by race (White vs Black), fixating either between the eyes or on the forehead. Within face presentations, the effect of fixation, meant to vary bottom-up visual input, initially was large but decreased across early latency neural responses identified by a principal components analysis (PCA). In contrast, the effect of race, reflecting a combination of top-down and bottom-up factors, initially was small but increased across early latency principal components. These patterns support the DI model prediction that bottom-up and top-down processes are iteratively integrated to arrive at a stable construal within 230 ms. Additionally, exploratory multilevel modeling of single trial ERP responses representing a component linked to outgroup categorization (the P2) suggests change in effects of the manipulations over the course of the experiment. Implications of the findings for the DI model are considered.

TI  - Making the "Other" from "Us": The Representation of British Converts to Islam in Mainstream British Newspapers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MUSLIM MINORITY AFFAIRS
LA  - English
AB  - There is now a great deal of literature that shows how Islam and Muslims are routinely represented in negative ways in the mainstream newspapers. With overt or covert reliance on Orientalist discourse, discourses of cultural clash and extremism, including terror, are prevalent. Not only are Muslims less likely to feature in "normal" stories, abuse and prejudice against them is also more unlikely to constitute "news". British converts to Islam have only recently begun to receive more focused attention, both in academia and in the mainstream press. Occupying a unique position in respect to the idea of the "other" and of integration in a multicultural society, converts offer a powerful point of critique of these concepts. The aim of this study is to understand how and in what discourses British converts to Islam are represented, and thereby contribute empirical knowledge to these theoretical concerns.

AB  - In this paper, I use data from the General Social Survey, FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics, and other sources to consider differences in attitudes about punishment among four groups Black men, Black women, White men, and White women as well as how these differences vary according to county crime rates. Centering my expectations about group-specific attitudes within conflict theory and prior empirical findings, I am guided by the presumption that race and gender are cultural categories that shape attitudes about punishment by influencing our interactions with the criminal justice system, and that the meaning of these cultural categories varies by context. Analyses provide some evidence that race, gender, and context interact to shape attitudes about punishment. Overall, this research improves our understanding of group differences in punitive attitudes and of the cultural context in which the US system of incarceration operates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Social categorization has been viewed as necessarily resulting in stereotyping, yet extant research suggests the two processes are differentially sensitive to task manipulations. Here, we simultaneously test the degree to which race perception and stereotyping are conditionally automatic. Participants performed a sequential priming task while either explicitly attending to the race of face primes or directing attention away from their semantic nature. We find a dissociation between the perceptual encoding of race and subsequent activation of associated stereotypes, with race perception occurring in both task conditions, but implicit stereotyping occurring only when attention is directed to the race of the face primes. These results support a clear conceptual distinction between categorization and stereotyping and show that the encoding of racial category need not result in stereotype activation.

AB  - Objective People often evaluate others using fragmentary but meaningful personal information in recent days through social media. It is not clear that whether this process is implicit or explicit and what kind of information is more important in such process. We examined the effects of several meaningful fragmentary information onattitude.
   Methods Thirty three KAIST students were provided four fragmentary information about four virtual people that are meaningful in evaluating people and frequently seen in real life situations, and were asked to imagine that person during four follow-up sessions. Explicit and Implicit attitudes were measured using Likert scale and Implicit Association Test respectively. Also, eye tracking was done to find out the most important information.
   Results Strong explicit attitudes, were formed toward both men and women, and weak but significant implicit attitudes, were generated toward men only. Eyetracking results showed that people spent more time reading morality information.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that explicit attitudes are made by propositional learning, which is the main component for evaluating others with several meaningful fragmentary information, and implicit attitudes are formed by top down process. And as well as those of previous studies, morality information was suggested as the most important factor in developing attitudes.

AB  - Introduction. - Although obesity stigma is pervasive, relatively little research has examined the extent to which the discrimination obese individuals experience extends to helping behavior.
   Objectives. - The purpose of the current set of experiments was to determine whether strangers help heavy individuals less than non-heavy individuals, and to examine the impact that moderating cues (e.g., justifying or suppressing prejudice, Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) of weight-based discrimination and gender might have on helping behavior.
   Study 1. - The first study was an experiment conducted online through MTurk. Participants rated their willingness to support a proposed charity event and their perceptions of the event organizer, whose picture was manipulated to be heavy or non-heavy. We found evidence that people were less willing to help and held more negative perceptions of heavy (than non-heavy) individuals.
   Study 2. - The second study was a field experiment in which confederates either wearing or not wearing obesity prosthetics solicited help from others on a college campus. Relative to the non-heavy, heavy individuals again were less likely to be helped and received more impolite interpersonal treatment, as rated by observers. Additionally, women were denigrated more than men for being heavy, but cues that suppressed discrimination helped increase the amount of help received and the politeness of strangers.
   Conclusion. - The overt and subtle discrimination overweight individuals experience extends to situations when they are asking for help, and this is especially the case for heavy women. However, displaying stereotype-inconsistent cues benefit overweight individuals by increasing the likelihood of them being helped and treated well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite post-racial rhetoric, stereotypes remain salient for American youth. We surveyed 150 elementary and middle schoolers in Northern California and conducted case studies of 12 students. Findings showed that (a) students hold school-related stereotypes that get stronger in middle school, (b) African American and Latino students experience greater divergence between stereotype awareness about their group and endorsement than other students, and (c) students who eschewed the applicability of stereotypes to them demonstrated higher engagement and achievement in math. This study has implications for studying race in schools and mathematics, and the need for urban educators to facilitate racialized counter-narratives.

AB  - Despite growing interest, the content and political correlates of contemporary global culture remain to be systematically explicated. Global culture is argued to be an extension of American-Western culture, and thus, to propagate an economically conservative agenda alongside a liberal-progressive social agenda. These conflicting emphases require the decomposition of conservatism into its economic and social facets, as suggested by the dual-process motivational (DPM) model. The current studies tested lay perceptions of this global culture and its political correlates, within a Jewish Israeli context. Studies demonstrated that the global culture cluster together with Western culture (Preliminary Study and Study 1) to form a globalized-Western culture (GWC). Endorsement of GWC was found to positively associate with economic conservatism and through its mediation with SDO (Studies 1 and 2). Contrarily, social conservatism, best indexed by RWA (Study 1), and negative evaluations of gender unorthodoxy (Study 2), was demonstrated to link with lower endorsement of GWC. The results are discussed in the context of Jewish-Israeli society, and future directions for a political psychology of globalization are suggested.

AB  - Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) can contribute to the realization of more sustainable mobility systems. The actual adoption rate however of BEVs in Germany remains low, and strategies for enhancing BEV acceptance are required. Providing direct experience can, for instance, help to overcome prejudices relating to relatively new products, with this being a potential marketing strategy. The present research contributes to the question of what role direct experience plays in acceptance of BEVs.
   Two studies were conducted to address the relationship between these variables: (1) an online survey (N = 286) and (2) a 24-h field test (N = 34 Both studies showed several experience-based differences in evaluations of BEV attributes, attitude and purchase intention, with most BEV attributes being evaluated more positively when people had BEV experience. Path analyses revealed a direct experience effect on purchase intention in the online study. Findings from the 24-h field test, showed effects of BEV experience on BEV attributes and attitudes, but no BEV experience effect for purchase intention was found. Based on the results of both studies, we can conclude that practical (and also short-term) experience with BEVs has the potential to change the evaluation of BEVs and psychological factors relevant for determining behavioral intention. As many effects were positive, providing short-term BEV experience to enhance acceptance has the potential to change BEV evaluation as well as the satisfaction with such a vehicle and might be a promising strategy for promoting BEVs.

AB  - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer people of color (LGBTQ-POC) are regularly exposed to unique and contextual forms of prejudice and stigma, which have been linked to stress and increased likelihood of mental and physical health problems. In order to better understand the experiences of this multiply marginalized population, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 LGBTQ-POC to examine how they describe their experiences with identities, communities, discrimination, and health. Data consisted of verbatim interviews, which were guided by intersectionality theory and minority stress theory and analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Using intersectionality theory, this study addresses the simultaneity of oppressions and the ways in which having different combinations of marginalized identities may impact LGBTQ-POC well-being. Common issues discussed by respondents include disconnect from communities, relationships between identities, coming out, and stress and anxiety. The primary concepts introduced in this study include positive intersectionality and come out stress.

AB  - This study undertakes an empirical exploration of attitudes towards tax evasion and welfare fraud in New Zealand. Prior research indicates that society has different attitudes towards these two crimes. However, it is not known why this is the case, particularly as both crimes are conceptually similar. The study has two aims. The first is to measure the extent to which society views tax evasion and welfare fraud differently in New Zealand. The second, and primary, objective of this research is to offer an explanation for why different views exist. The dual-process model, using social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism is used for analytical purposes. Responses from 1500 survey participants show that New Zealanders do have different attitudes towards welfare fraud and tax evasion. In contrast to previous research findings, this study shows that harsher attitudes are held towards tax evasion than welfare fraud. Education and income level provide the greatest level of significance in explaining attitudes towards welfare fraud; and age and income source provide the greatest level of significance in explaining attitudes towards tax evasion.

AB  - Populist radical right (PRR) parties have attracted anti-migration voters by claiming to serve the interests of nationally defined in-groups. Recently, several European PRR parties have shifted focus from protecting traditional values to protecting so-called modern Western values, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights. Here, we study whether PRR parties managed to attract voters who hold these modern values. In contrast with previous research, we do not position these voters with modern values' as necessary opponents of nativist voters. European Social Survey data linked to 29 elections demonstrate that the likelihood to vote for PRR parties is somewhat lower among lesbian and gay rights people, but not for those who have strong anti-migration attitudes. However, this effect differs across countries and in some cases, the sexually modern nativists' have the highest PRR voting likelihoods. This is not directly related to the parties' position on modern family values, but to the party system and alternative right-wing parties present.

AB  - The influx of immigrants into Malaysia is becoming a subject of controversy. Some local groups claim that since immigrants are demanded in certain industries namely plantation, agriculture, mining, manufacturing and construction sectors, their benefits and impact in the rural sectors needs to be studied. This study identifies the implications of migration on the rural community. The objective of this study is to explore local people's perceptions on the socio-economic impacts of Indonesian immigrants in their rural areas. The data is collected using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Surveys were carried out to 671 local people in six villages through a purposive sampling technique. Results showed locals acknowledge the importance of immigrant labour in rural sectors and contribute to the positive impact on rural development. Generally, Indonesian workers play a significant role and have a huge impact on the economic development in rural areas. Indonesian immigrants are well known as labour replacements or seasonal immigrants and have the positive attitude as hardworking and obedient workers. Thus, policy on immigrants in Malaysia needs to be further revised due to a xenophobic reaction by the locals that create prejudices towards immigrants.

AB  - This study investigates the relation between age stereotypes and perceived age discrimination. Existing evidence for such a relation is notoriously ambiguous with regard to its direction-age stereotypes can predict (perceived) discrimination, but experiencing discrimination may also change views on ageing-which is why we used a dataset with two waves to disentangle the direction of the associations. Considering research on the multi-dimensionality of views on ageing and perceived age discrimination, we addressed this question from a domain- and age group-specific perspective. Drawing on data from two measurement points of the German Ageing Survey (DEAS;t(1):2008, t(2): 2011; age range at t(1): 40-93 years, n = 6092 participants at t (1)), we examined reciprocal relations between views on ageing and perceived age discrimination. Cross-lagged models revealed that domain-specific views on ageing predict subsequent changes in perceived discrimination in corresponding domains: Negative views on ageing regarding personal competence, physical decline, and social interactions were associated with increases in perceived discrimination in the domains of work, medical care, and social life, respectively. However, we did not find evidence for a reciprocal effect of perceived age discrimination on views on ageing. In sum, results indicate that negative views on ageing act as self-fulfilling prophecies by predisposing people to categorize other people's behaviour as age discrimination or to act themselves in a way that might elicit ageist behaviour in others.

AB  - The semantics of cultural diversity, based on the political discourses of immigration as they appear in integration and anti-racist policies in Andalusia, underline the sense of Otherness of immigrant groups. In this article, Castano, Martinez and Perianez focus on the most relevant texts in the Planes Integrales para la Inmigracion en Andalucia (Comprehensive Plans for Immigration in Andalusia). To date, these texts have formed the most significant discursive framework for representations of the third sector, trade unions and public agencies involved in the management of diversity. The key ideas in the plans revolve around transnational political references in the context of the European Union (EU). They impose a sense of Europeanness on Andalusia that is in opposition to its historical heritage, endogenous diversity and cultural specificity, and thus steer the imaginary of Andalusia's identity towards a Eurocentric idea that enhances the region's peripheral position. Immigration is regarded in the hegemonic media discourse and the social imaginary as a risk and a social problem. Integration policies, despite being couched in anti-racist rhetoric, are specifically targeted at immigrants, further enhancing the idea of Otherness. The notion of interculturality is the leitmotiv of these policies. In practical terms, however, action is limited to empty measures in the field of education. These policies, in sum, neutralize, rather than reinforce, the sense of equality on which interculturality is based. The examination of the intertextuality of Andalusian, Spanish and European discourses reveals the conformity of the discourse of Andalusia's coloniality within the framework of the EU.

AB  - Research typically reveals that outgroups are regarded with disinterest at best and hatred and enmity at worst. Working from an evolutionary framework, we identify a unique pattern of outgroup attraction. The small-group lifestyle of pre-human ancestors plausibly limited access to genetically diverse mates. Ancestral females may have solved the inbreeding dilemma while balancing parental investment pressures by mating with outgroup males either via converting to an outgroup or cuckolding the ingroup. A vestige of those mating strategies might manifest in human women as a cyclic pattern of attraction across the menstrual cycle, such that attraction to outgroup men increases as fertility increases across the cycle. Two studies, one using a longitudinal method and the other an experimental method, evidenced the hypothesized linear relationship between attraction to outgroup men and fertility in naturally cycling women.

AB  - Therapists working with couples are likely to see gay male couples in their practice yet there is a lack of training to prepare therapists to work with gay couples. Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is an empirically supported approach to couples therapy and offers a clear structure and map for working with gay male couples. This article reviews some of the issues that are specific to EFT work with gay men. Given the range of minority stressors that gay men contend with EFT is particularly appropriate for work with gay male couples because of the focus on the attachment bond. Building a secure relationship is an important source of resilience that can buffer against prejudice and discrimination and provide a secure base for individual and couple exploration.

AB  - This article analyses perceived in-group discrimination of 29,189 first and second generation immigrant respondents from 201 different countries of origin currently living in one of 27 EU countries. In addition to testing effects of individual factors, the article estimates the effects of macro-characteristics of both origin and destination countries and community variables. The migration history of these groups is relevant for perceived discrimination: immigrants with citizenship, who speak the majority language at home and have at least one native parent perceive less in-group discrimination, whereas religious respondents, especially from religions that differ more in comparison to the majority, perceive more in-group discrimination. Furthermore, macrocharacteristics of the country of origin are most important in explaining differences between European countries. Immigrants from socio-economically more developed countries with higher living standards-and for that reason more comparable to the native population-are less likely to perceive in-group discrimination.

AB  - Indigenous peoples in Australia, the United States and Canada are significantly overrepresented as defendants in criminal trials and yet vastly underrepresented on juries in criminal trials. This means that all-white juries mostly determine the guilt of Indigenous defendants or white defendants responsible for harming Indigenous victims. In this article, we explore cases in which Indigenous defendants have perceived that an all-white jury's prejudice against Indigenous people would prevent them receiving a fair trial. It focuses on Indigenous defendants (often facing charges in relation to protesting against white racism) challenging the array of all-white juries. Across these cases, Australian courts rely on formal notions of fairness in jury selection to dismiss the Indigenous defendant's perception of bias and foreclose an inquiry into the potential prejudices of white jurors. We compare the Australian judicial 'colour-blindness' towards all-white juries with that of the United States and Canada. We argue that the tendency for courts in the United States and Canada to question jurors on their biases provides useful lessons for Australian judiciaries, including in relation to the impending trials of Indigenous defendants in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, accused of committing crimes in response to white racist violence. Nonetheless, across all jurisdictions where there is a challenge to the array based on racial composition, courts consistently uphold all-white juries. We suggest that the judicial view of the racial neutrality of white jury selection misapprehends the substantive biases in jury selection and the injustice perceived by defendants in having a white jury adjudicate an alleged crime that is committed in circumstances involving protest against white prejudice.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Tolerance Tendency Enhancement Program (TTEP) which was prepared to enhance tolerance tendency and reduce bullying level of the fifth grade students. Pretest, posttest, follow up test, control and placebo group experimental design has been used in this research. This study was carried out with a sample of 42 fifth grade students (14 for experimental group, 14 for placebo group, and 14 for control group). The data used in this study was obtained through the Tolerance Tendency Scale (TTS) and Peer Bullying Scale (PBS). Wilcoxon Signed Ranks, Kruskal-Wallis H Tests were used to analyze the data. The results of the study showed that there was a significant change between post-tests of the placebo, control and experimental groups in favor of the experimental group. It can be said that the TTEP enhance tolerance tendency and reduce bullying level of the experimental group. Besides, the TTEP applied on the experimental group was understood to have permanent effects on tolerance tendency. Conclusion part of the study, some suggestions and recommendations were provided for the counseling practices and researchers in the light of findings.

AB  - This study explores who Turkish citizens view as the Other, their perceptions, evaluations, and the degree of Othering of these groups in the private and public spheres. Drawing from varied political science and social psychology literature, it also examines the role of social contact, perceived threat, and the strength of national and religious identification in predicting levels of Othering. Using a national representative sample, the findings reveal that Kurds are the most Othered group in the private sphere, while both Kurds and AKP (Adalet ve Kalknma Partisi - Justice and Development Party) supporters are the most Othered groups in the public sphere. Regardless of who the Other is, lower social contact and higher levels of perceived threat are associated with higher levels of Othering of Kurds, Alevis, AKP supporters, and AKP opponents in both the private and public spheres.

AB  - Background: Ambiguity in understanding what professionalism means, and uncertainty in how best to teach it, remains. This study aimed to explore experiences of senior faculty in their endeavor to develop and include professionalism within a curriculum reform (CR), and illuminate challenges encountered.Methods: Using a qualitative case study approach, data were collected from interviews with faculty who were involved in a major CR, plus archived document analysis to provide context, and aid triangulation. Data coding and analysis were inductive, using thematic analysis to generate initial coding scheme; exploring themes in the data.Results: Seventeen interviews were undertaken and approximately 90 documents were reviewed. Analysis revealed: faculty may unintentionally influence, through mixed messages and hidden meanings, the content and processes of professionalism teaching and learning. We identified several intersecting tensions related to the nature of the existing curriculum, staff knowledge, resources, and lack of clear guidance about the what and how to teach professionalism.Conclusion: This study illustrates, hidden messages and contextual factors can enable or inhibit the translation of professionalism into curricula. Those involved in implementing professionalism must be reflective, keep the hidden curriculum in the spotlight to consider how presuppositions and prejudices of their cultural milieu may shape curricular outcomes.

AB  - Conspiracy theories have been seen as important supporting components in extreme political beliefs. This paper considers conspiracy theories in the counter jihad movement, an international network combining cultural nationalism with xenophobia towards Muslims. This paper evaluates the nature of conspiracy belief through the analysis of several key texts published by counter jihad activists, and of content published on a daily basis by three core websites. The findings show the Islamisation conspiracy theory to be highly modular, with authors able to mix and match villains. The analysis of daily published content demonstrates that, at the routine level, conspiracy theory is rarely used openly as a call to action. This is in keeping with other examples of conspiracy theory in extreme right wing movements in which conspiracy is seen as justification for existing prejudices. However, the political and security context the counter jihad operates in also affords the movement opportunities to support some of their claims, often by reproducing or reinterpreting mainstream or quasi-mainstream reporting, without reverting openly to conspiracy tropes. In the case of the counter jihad movement, as well as potentially other far-right movements, conspiracy theory may be taking a back seat to a more sophisticated public relations approach.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine statistical predictors of homophobic attitudes among the residents of Tbilisi, Georgia. We analyze 2013 survey data from a representative sample of the Tbilisi adult population. Residents were asked about their attitudes, beliefs, and political and social values in the context of the May 17, 2013 attack on LGBT activists on the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT). Findings show that homophobia is significantly predicted by male gender, lower levels of education, acceptance of social inequality, nonliberal attitudes, and perceiving homosexuals as a threat to national security. However, psychological perceptions and personal experiences also indirectly influence homophobic attitudes: the findings suggest that males report homophobic attitudes more often than females do and tend to be even more homophobic when they believe that homosexuality is inborn rather than acquired. The study also found that people without liberal attitudes tend to be more homophobic when they have personal contacts with homosexuals. This article highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to education and the promotion of liberal values as well as legal equality for LGBTQ individuals to decrease the level of homophobia in Georgian society and, specifically, in Tbilisi.

AB  - While a great deal of attention has been paid to how political media can divide and polarize politicized groups in the U.S., little is understood about its effects within those groups. In this study, I use a population based survey experiment to explore whether targeted political media are affecting two factors associated with political voice - perceptions of political homogeneity and perceptions of political power. Drawing on theories from social psychology, I outline and test a set of theoretical predictions to explore this relationship in the context of Spanish-language political ads. The results suggest that Spanish-language political ads do, in fact, increase perceptions of collective political power among Latinos, but not in a way that unequivocally promote perceptions of political homogeneity. In doing so, the findings provide some of the first evidence of a causal relationship between targeted political media and perceptions of targeted political groups.

AB  - Cross-culturally, misfortune is often attributed to witchcraft despite the high human and social costs of these beliefs. The evolved cognitive features that are often used to explain religion more broadly, in combination with threat perception and coalitional psychology, may help explain why these particular supernatural beliefs are so prevalent. Witches are minimally counter intuitive, agentic, and build upon intuitive under-standings of ritual efficacy. Witchcraft beliefs may gain traction in threatening contexts and because they are threatening themselves, while simultaneously activating coalitional reasoning systems that make rejection of the idea costly. This article draws possible connections between these cognitive and environmental features with an eye toward future empirical examination.

AB  - Political blogs have come to constitute important channels for expressing nationalist and anti-immigration political views. The new forms that this rhetoric may take, comprising an intricate intermingling of verbal, digital, (audio-)visual, and communicative elements, present challenges for qualitative research. In this article we propose a way for analysing this new" nationalist political discourse from a qualitative social psychological perspective. The suggested approach combines analytical procedures form critical discursive and rhetorical psychology with social semiotic and rhetorical studies of images, completed with analytical tools and concepts from narrative psychology and research into online political communication. Using two empirical examples of nationalist and anti-immigration political blog-entries written during the 2015 refugee crisis," we show this approach enables the researcher to adequately study how such political messages are conveyed through the multitude of elements provided by the blogs. In so doing, our ultimate goal is to contribute to the analytical capacity of qualitative social psychological research into contemporary political communication and persuasion.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and questioning (LGBTQ) discrimination continues to be common on college campuses. While a number of studies have examined blatant victimization among students, little attention has been given to LGBTQ microaggressions. In this study, we examine both blatant victimization and microaggressions and their association with psychological distress among LGBTQ college students (N = 497) and look at whether gender identity moderates these relationships. Both forms of discrimination are associated with lower self-esteem and greater stress and anxiety. Victimization is more negatively associated with self-esteem among trans* students. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing both blatant and subtle forms of discrimination targeting LGBTQ college students.

AB  - Relatively few studies have assessed theoretically relevant predictors of individual's perceptions of racial profiling by law enforcement officers. The current study addresses this limitation by drawing on theoretical frameworks highlighted in the growing body of literature examining disproportionate minority contact (DMC) with the criminal justice system. Specifically, we draw on the racial and symbolic threat perspectives with the objective of identifying theoretically relevant individual and community level predictors of perceptions of racial profiling by public and private police bodies in airports, malls, and on the roads. Results of our analysis of data on White and Black individuals nested within communities support the racial threat perspective in documenting the influence of racial heterogeneity and interracial labor market competition on perceptions of racial profiling. However, in contention to predictions derived from the symbolic threat perspective, the results fail to uncover a link between interracial socioeconomic inequality and perceptions of racial profiling by law enforcement officers. These results highlight the importance of moving beyond individual explanations of profiling and other forms of DMC and suggest community characteristics and perceptions of intergroup threat are particularly salient to understanding perceptions of race-based distinctions in formal social control.

AB  - In higher education, students are exposed to people with diverse backgrounds and opinions and frequently are challenged to participate in scientific discussions on controversial issues. The article discusses the implications of two theoretical approaches within psychology for the meaning of identity in dealing with diversity. Social and developmental psychologists have opposing views on identity: While the former claim that a strong sense of identity leads to competition for resources, to intolerance, to the devaluation of outgroups and, finally, to conflict, the latter argue that a weak sense of identity leads to totalitarian ideologies and intolerance towards deviating beliefs. We review literature on the implications and effects deriving from social and developmental psychology and integrate them in a model which explains how building a strong sense of identity can promote tolerance and the endorsement of human rights. In particular, we explore the importance of tolerance defined as acting towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood because the devaluation of the 'other' often is seen as the first step towards violence.

AB  - Racism and racialisation can be framed as a threat to one's ontological security. This article draws from qualitative life history interviews conducted with 11 Aboriginal people who are part of an existing longitudinal health study based in the city of Brisbane. The narratives revealed that perceptions of racism and racialisation were a significant consideration for these people when asked to reflect on their identity and wellbeing over time. Though less frequently overt, racism was often seen to be perpetrated from within one's social circle, revealing the complicated process of engaging, contesting, rejecting, ignoring, minimising, avoiding and defining racism. The findings highlight the agency of Aboriginal people in adapting their behaviour to avoid or minimise the dread of ontological insecurity.

AB  - In most parts of the world, hegemonic masculinity requires men to endorse traditional masculine ideals, one of which is rejection of homosexuality. Wherever hegemonic masculinity favours heterosexuality over homosexuality, gay males may feel under pressure to negotiate their conflicting male gender and gay sexual identities to maintain positive self-perceptions. However, globalization, as a source of intercultural interaction, might provide a beneficial context for people wishing to create alternative masculinities in the face of hegemonic masculinity. Hence, we tested if global identification would predict higher levels of gay-male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well-being, via alternative masculinity representations for gay and male identities. A community sample of 219 gay and bisexual men from Turkey completed the study. Structural equation modelling revealed that global identification positively predicted gay-male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well-being; however, alternative masculinity representations did not mediate this relationship. Our findings illustrate how identity categories in different domains can intersect and affect each other in complex ways. Moreover, we discuss mental health and well-being implications for gay men living in cultures where they experience high levels of prejudice and stigma.

AB  - Rwanda's postgenocide government has implemented policies that resemble social psychological models of single recategorization, banning references to ethnic groups and replacing these with a superordinate, Rwandan identity. While social psychological research suggests problems with this approach, little is known about how people make sense of recategorization in the aftermath of ethnic conflict and genocide. The present interview study investigates the responses of 56 Rwandans to these single recategorization policies. Despite strong societal pressures, a variety of positions were apparentshowing how people actively construe categories, and the complexity of single recategorization in real-world settings. The findings suggest several novel insights and policy implications, including the need for context-specific approaches, utilitarian reasons for single recategorization, the role of malleability of identities in promoting social recategorization, and the potential use of recategorization models as transitional measures in postconflict societies.

AB  - This article aims to add to the relatively small body of literature on online hatred. In particular, it focuses on the role social networking sites may play in the development of polarisation, by exploring how online users respond to explicit online hate materials. Specifically, this article discusses the ways in which a self-selected sample of YouTube users responded, via posting online comments, to a video clip in which a White female train passenger (called Emma) could be seen to racially to abuse other passengers. Thematic analysis of the YouTube comments identified four main themes: (1) Making Sense of Emma, which encapsulated posters' attempts to find explanations for Emma's behaviour; (2) Meeting Hatred with Hatred, which described posters' attempts to oppose Emma's racism by means of resorting to aggressive, hateful language; (3) Us versus Them, which encapsulated posters' tendencies to categorise themselves and other posters into in- and outgroups, based on their particular stance on racism; (4) Contesting Britishness, which expressed posters' attempts to articulate (and contest) what it means to be British. Whilst the current analysis provides some evidence that hateful web content can fuel aggressive and hateful responses, many of the comments analysed here emphasised common group membership, alongside people's right to claim membership in a particular social category (i.e. Britishness). The current evidence, therefore, suggests that, at least in the specific context of this study, hateful web content may not necessarily lead to an automatic endorsement or escalation of hatred.

AB  - Racist views expressed on the Internet have damaging consequences for social harmony and well-being. This article examines how and why individuals express support or opposition to racist behaviour in a prominent online medium: comments on news websites. Specifically, we examine how supporters and opponents of racist behaviour use a particular type of subtle discursive strategies known as moral disengagement in their online responses to three notable racist incidents that occurred in Australia in 2013. Moral disengagement strategies allow individuals to avoid distress, self-condemnation, and social-sanctions when supporting or engaging in harmful behaviour by making that behaviour appear moral and acceptable. We show that supporters, but not opponents, of racist behaviour consistently use moral disengagement strategies in their rhetoric, and demonstrate that moral disengagement provides a powerful theoretical framework through which racist rhetoric on online news websites can be understood.

AB  - Although sexist attitudes are generally thought to undermine support for employment equity (EE) policies supporting women, we argue that the effects of benevolent sexism are more complex. Across 4 studies, we extend the ambivalent sexism literature by examining both the positive and the negative effects benevolent sexism has for the support of gender-based EE policies. On the positive side, we show that individuals who endorse benevolent sexist attitudes on trait measures of sexism (Study 1) and individuals primed with benevolent sexist attitudes (Study 2) are more likely to support an EE policy, and that this effect is mediated by feelings of compassion. On the negative side, we find that this support extends only to EE policies that promote the hiring of women in feminine, and not in masculine, positions (Study 3 and 4). Thus, while benevolent sexism may appear to promote gender equality, it subtly undermines it by contributing to occupational gender segregation and leading to inaction in promoting women in positions in which they are underrepresented (i.e., masculine positions).

AB  - Research has shown that members of the national majority group generally consider host culture adoption by immigrants as desirable. However, so far, this positive effect of perceived host culture adoption on attitudes toward immigrants has not been explained. We argue that majority members infer national identification of immigrants from their cultural adoption. Moreover, we predict that this inference should decrease majority members' feeling of ingroup threat, therefore also improving their attitudes toward immigrants. We conducted two experimental studies. In Study 1, majority members who were presented an immigrant group that adopted the host culture held more positive attitudes than those who were presented one that disregarded it. In line with our hypothesis, this effect was fully mediated by perceived identification of the immigrants with the host nation, itself decreasing perception of ingroup threat. Study 2 reproduced the same experimental design, but used descriptions of individual immigrants' acculturation strategies, and the immigrant group's status - valued vs. devalued origin - was also manipulated. In addition, Study 2 focused on dimensions of the "Big Two" of social perception. Results replicated the mediational effect of perceived identification on attribution of both warmth and competence traits. The status manipulation had no significant effect and did not interact with cultural adoption. These two studies provide robust evidence that perception of host nation identification explains the effects of perceived cultural adoption on attitudes towards immigrants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - South Africa is a regional hub for migration on the African continent and is home to a growing documented international migrant community. Foreigners in the country, however, often face violations of their established rights and are the victims of abuse. This paper examines public support for policies that would exclude international migrants from the country. Data from the 2013 South African Social Attitudes Survey, a nationally representative opinion poll (N=2739) of all adults in the country, are used. This poll found that many South Africans favoured restrictive immigration policies and opposed granting foreigners the same rights as citizens. Multivariate analysis is employed to discern determinants of this opposition. Respondents' perceptions of the population sizes of foreigners in their communities did not affect support for inclusion. It can be inferred, therefore, that the growth of the immigrant population has not provoked exclusionary attitudes in the country. Rather, results revealed, it is national pride (cultural versus political) and fears about the consequences of immigration that drive such attitudes. Programmes and policies designed to improve public perceptions of how foreigner impact society and the promotion of a nationalism characterised by inclusive multicultural civic patriotism may improve public support for the inclusion of international immigrants.

AB  - Chinese professional immigrants make up the 2nd largest visible minority group in Canada. Their successful resettlement in the host country is inextricably tied to the prosperity and success of the general Canadian society that depends heavily on its immigration practice for the country's development and growth. However, there is a dearth of literature and research on this particular population, especially in the areas of career development and vocational psychology based on the unique cultural context of Canada. To address the pivotal career needs of Chinese professional immigrants, this article identifies and discusses 6 prominent career-related barriers they face in the resettlement process: migration-related stressors; language proficiency; cultural nuances and knowledge; discrimination and prejudice; foreign-earned experiences, education, and credentials not recognized; and family separation and fragmentation. Strategies to tackle these career development barriers are proposed from a life-career integrated perspective, alongside ideas and strategies for effective career interventions.

AB  - Research on the societal-level causes and consequences of stigma has rarely considered the social conditions that account for destigmatization, the process by which a group's worth and status improve. Destigmatization has important implications for the health of stigmatized groups. Building on a robust line of stigma reduction literature in psychology, we develop a sociological framework for understanding how new cultural constructions that draw equivalences and remove blame shape public and structural stigma over time. We examine historical transformations of cultural constructions surrounding three stigmatized groups in the United States: people living with HIV/AIDS, African Americans, and people labeled as obese. By tracing this process across cases, we find that the conditions that account for destigmatization include the credibility of new constructions, the status and visibility of actors carrying these constructions, the conclusiveness of expert knowledge about stigmatized groups, the interaction between new constructions and existing cultural ideologies, and the perceived linked fate of the stigmatized and dominant groups. We also find that the reduction of structural and public forms of stigma often depend on distinct processes and constructions. To conclude, we propose a framework for the comparative study of destigmatization as an essential component of promoting a culture, of health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heterosexual marking occurs when people behave in ways that are interpreted by others as evidence of heterosexuality. In an exploratory comprehensive study of this phenomenon, we conducted 12 focus groups with 57 individuals: four groups composed of heterosexual women, four composed of heterosexual men, and four composed of mixed-gender sexual minorities. In this article, we present our findings on participant conceptions of heterosexual marking that are related to gender stereotypes, gender differences, and gender inequality. Much of the heterosexual marking described by our participants reflects and reinforces stereotypes that equate gender conformity and heterosexuality. Our data suggest that heterosexual marking by men/boys and women/girls differs in several ways, including gender conformity, sexual prejudice, extent of marking, and types of marking. Furthermore, some aspects and types of heterosexual marking described by our participants reflect and reinforce gender inequality. As a result, our discussion notes some problematic implications of the heterosexual marking we describe, including rendering gender non-conformity among heterosexuals invisible and unacceptable, supporting discrimination against gender non-conformity, and more directly reinforcing gender inequality.

AB  - In Canada, hijab wearing Muslim women have increasingly faced discrimination in the post 9-11 era. In this study, we investigate Muslim women's experiences with the hijab and how they are viewed as the "other" in a multicultural country like Canada. Interviews were conducted with twenty-six Muslim women who describe their experiences with the hijab. The study focuses on how the hijab is perceived in public and how experiences with discrimination have motivated Muslim women to reclaim their voices in a space that perceives Muslim women to be oppressed. Thematic network analysis of the data revealed three central themes: religiosity, societal prejudice and internal struggle. Discrimination was experienced by all participants and internal struggles resulted in resolution techniques that helped in mitigating negative experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports on three studies examining people's belief about race as biological. Study 1 (N = 155) found that the relationship between early exposure to diversity as a child and belief in race as biological was moderated by socioeconomic status. Study 2 (N = 210) found that belief in race as biological was related to greater social distance toward out-group members, and this relationship was mediated by out-group discomfort. Study 3 found that participants (N = 31) had significant decreases in belief in race as biological immediately following a daylong race relations workshop and in a 6-week follow-up, and this "unlearning" trajectory was particularly prominent among students who experienced greater social distance from out-groups. Results are interpreted and discussed in relation to reconceptualizing beliefs about race as rationalizing rather than proactive ideologies and for promoting positive race relations through education aimed at deessentializing race.

AB  - This study examines the interplay between presence of stigmatized immigrants, threat, and intergroup contact that underlies radical right voting (voting propensity and actual district-level vote results). On the one hand, low-status immigrants are often stigmatized and depicted as threats. Thus, presence of stigmatized immigrants should heighten threat perceptions, thereby increasing radical right voting. On the other hand, as positive contact with stigmatized immigrants is known to reduce anti-immigrant prejudice, it should also attenuate radical right voting. As predicted, multilevel path analyses with the Swiss Election Studies 2011 data (N=1,736 respondents in 136 districts) revealed that the proportion of stigmatized immigrants (from former Yugoslavia and Albania) in districts heightened perceived threat. Threat perceptions, in turn, increased propensity to vote for the Swiss People's Party, the major radical right party. In contrast, experiencing positive, everyday contact with former Yugoslav and Albanian immigrants reduced voting propensity through attenuated threat perceptions. Contact and threat perceptions were also related to the actual vote through voting propensity.

AB  - Findings from previous studies corroborate the hypothesis that universalism and conservation values are associated with negative attitudes toward immigration. In the current study we examine whether universalism and conservation values also play a critical role in the explanation of attitudes toward other minority groups. Drawing on previous research on group-focused enmity, we explore its relations with universalism and conservation values in a German sample. Employing structural equation modeling, we find that individuals who prioritize universalism values approve of various minorities more whereas those who prioritize conservation values exhibit more disapproval.

AB  - It may be argued that the emerging discourses focusing on the social, emotional, educational, and economic disadvantages identified for Australia's First Peoples (when compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts) are becoming increasingly dissociated with an understanding of the interplay between historical and current trends in racism. Additionally, and if not somewhat related to this critique, it can be suggested that the very construction of research from a Western perspective of Indigenous identity (as opposed to identities) and ways of being are deeply entwined within the undertones of epistemological racism still prevalent today. It is the purpose of this article to move beyond the overreliance of outside-based understanding Western epistemologies, and to explore not only the complex nature of both racism and identity from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives, but to also explore the role of education and research in perpetuating varying levels of racism and resistance to Indigenous identity(ies) from a contemporary insider-based standpoint. It is hoped this article will shed some light on the pervasive nature of racism directed at Indigenous Australians, and highlight the need for the continual acceptance, respect, and promotion of Indigenous voices and identities within the educational environment and beyond.

AB  - The Amazon Delta and Estuary (ADE) is a region of continental and global ecological importance. Controversy, many of the basic infrastructure and services essential for quality of life and sustainable development of this delta are absent. Using a conceptual model to define socio-economic vulnerability in the urban ADE, a thorough assessment of indicators including sanitation services, housing conditions, household income, population, flood risk and unplanned settlements was conducted in 41 cities at the census sector scale (n = 2938). A multi criterion index was applied to classify urban vulnerability from three dimensions: flood exposure, socio-economic sensitivity and infrastructure. This is the first study to examine urban vulnerability within and between urban areas of the ADE. Results indicated that most of the urban sectors of the ADE are exposed to potential risks due to a combination of flood hazards, poverty and basic structural deficiencies such as insufficient drinking water or inadequate waste water collection, with several sectors being afflicted by similar problems. The assessment of vulnerability indicates that 60-90 % of the urban population live in conditions of moderate to high degree of vulnerability. The ADE cities presented a pattern where vulnerability increases from city center to their newly developed urban areas. Inadequate planning coupled with rapid urbanization has contributed to the development of unplanned settlements in almost half of the urban sectors of the ADE. Combined, these factors contribute to widespread socio-economic vulnerability along the urban spaces of the ADE, increasing exposure to health risks and more frequent seasonal and stochastic events such as storm surges and high flooding levels.

AB  - Third millennium B.C. anthropomorphic marble sculpture from the Aegean Cyclades, the so-called Early Cycladic figures and figurines, have fascinated art aficionados and scholars alike for over a century. This has led to a tremendous amount of aesthetic appreciation and monetary value for the aforementioned artifacts. However, a distorted and more important dissociated and decontextualized view of the figurines as objets d' art has traditionally impeded interpretative approaches to a great extent. With recent advances in the neurosciences and especially the rapprochement between the neuro- and the social sciences a new range of possibilities is offered for the study of the brain as manifested in technical acts, in this case the making, using, and sometimes breaking, of sculpture, and the reciprocal shaping of the world by the mind and the mind by the world that surrounds it. A multisensory view of EC sculpture is suggested here corroborated by ethnographic evidence as a research avenue of great potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

FX  - "The psychiatrist is a pragmatist, drawing on everything that works" (Sadock et al., 2009, Preface): apparently, so is the archaeologist. The present chapter in its current form emerged from a long-standing process of thinking, studying, talking, teaching, researching, and writing on art, prehistory, archaeology, the human condition in general, our prejudices, the distinction between looking and seeing, the dependence of our inferences on art on the visual, and exchanges of views and ideas with a (happy) few very interesting people. It is also part of a broader endeavor that I hope will be completed in due time. A preliminary account of some of the ideas expressed herein was presented in the Conference Vergearts, hosted by Langley University in 2009, facilitated by a grant by the Open University of Cyprus; related material has been presented to and discussed with my students in Anthropology, Archaeology and Art History courses in the past decade or so. A special thanks to Dr. Alexandros Chatzis, M.D., for help with the neuroscience and psychiatry material, discussion and references; my esteemed colleague and dear friend Ms. Toula Marketou for facilitating access and encouraging study of a very lonely EC figurine from the Archaeological Museum of Rhodes and for endless inspiring discussions on the past and the present. A thank you is also owed to Professor Adamantios Sampson who kindly invited me to talk about Euboean EC (and other) figurines that marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration. Last but not least, I extend my thanks to the editors of the present volume, Dr. Antonis Iliopoulos, for the kind invitation to contribute to Material Cognition and guidance throughout as well as editorial suggestions; and Dr. Duilio Garofoli for constructive comments on both drafts submitted during the review process; Duilio, your comments helped my chapter gain clarity and my arguments gain strength, for this I owe you a sincere thanks; as well as the anonymous reviewer for his/her input and partially accurate points. Naturally, any opinions expressed here remain my own.

AB  - Objectives. This article examines cross-national variation in interreligious favorability across the globe. We develop and test several hypotheses linking globalization to attitudes toward the religious other through mechanisms of religious belonging and contact. Methods. Utilizing cross-national data in 20 countries from the Pew Global Attitudes Surveys (2011), we run a series of multilevel and logistic regression estimations to test our hypotheses about global contact, religious identity, and interreligious favorability. Results. We find that global contact has a positive effect on interreligious favorability, whereas holding religious identity increases negative sentiments toward religious outgroups. We also find that increased levels of globalization inhibit the negative impact of religious belonging and threat perceptions on favorable views of the religious other. Conclusion. Although globalization increases the salience of religion as an exclusive identity category at the expense of decreased interreligious favorability, individuals become more conducive to interreligious tolerance thanks to frequent social contact at higher levels of globalization.

AB  - Although recent research suggests that the proportion of the US population identifying as non-religious has been rapidly expanding over the course of the last decade, relatively little research has examined the implications of this development for health and well-being. This study uses data from a large representative survey study of religion and health in the adult US population (N = 3010) to examine group differences among religious group members (N = 2401) and three categories of non-religious individuals: atheists (N = 83), agnostics (N = 189), and those stating no religious preference (N = 329). MANCOVA was used to analyze group differences on five outcome dimensions, incorporating 27 outcome variables. Religious non-affiliates did not differ overall from affiliates in terms of physical health outcomes (although atheists and agnostics did have better health on some individual measures including BMI, number of chronic conditions, and physical limitations), but had worse positive psychological functioning characteristics, social support relationships, and health behaviors. On dimensions related to psychological well-being, atheists and agnostics tended to have worse outcomes than either those with religious affiliation or those with no religious preference. If current trends in the religious composition of the population continue, these results have implications for its future healthcare needs.

AB  - Fairness toward job applicants differing in gender and ethnicity in a video-based assessment interview was explored. For this purpose, 103 female and 105 male participants, including 38 who declared to have a migration background of their own, rated a behavior anchored rating scale after having watched the videotaped answers of a potential applicant. The domains assessed were communication skills and the capacity to work in a team. The videos of the applicants were generated with the help of standardized scripts and semi-professional actors. Eight videos were made operationalizing a two (Turkish migration background-native German) by two (male-female) by two (more positive applicant answers-moderately good applicant answers) experimental design. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a small to moderate main effect only for migration background of the applicants. Subsequent ANOVAs found that in three of the four dependent variables this effect reached significance of p<.05. The effects were robust against consideration of the raters' agreeableness and the raters' own migration background as covariates. Applicants with Turkish background scored higher in the evaluation of their videotaped answers than German native applicants did. Social Identity Theory (Taijfel & Turner, ) provides an approach to integrate these findings.

AB  - Discussions of outgroup activism in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality reflect two shortcomings. First, such discussions generally present uncritically positive views of ally activism; second, research on ally activism has overly focused on individual allies. The aim of this article is twofold: to suggest that action toward LGBT equality may often be influenced by sexual prejudice and may thus recapitulate longstanding power dynamics between majority and sexual minority groups, and to expand our understanding of ally behavior beyond individuals by presenting an ethnographic study exploring the development of institutional ally identity in a mainstream church that underwent a marked shift from an explicit anti-LGBT to an expressly LGBT-supportive stance. The study employed critical discourse analysis to examine interview, textual, and participant-observation data. Dimensions of individual and institutional ally activism, and potential pitfalls in each, are explored. Suggestions for promoting more constructive collective action are offered.

AB  - Introduction: Limited evidence suggests that transgender individuals smoke at significantly higher rates than the general population. We aimed to determine whether structural or everyday discrimination experiences predict smoking behavior among transgender individuals when sociodemographic, health, and gender-specific factors were controlled.
   Methods: Data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4781), a cross-sectional online and paper survey distributed to organizations serving the transgender community, were analyzed in order to determine the association between current smoking and discrimination experiences and other potential predictors. Logistic regression models were used to establish factors that predict smoking.
   Results: Participants reported experiencing both structural (80.4%) and everyday (65.9%) discrimination. Multivariate analyses showed that participants who reported attending some college, graduating college, or having a graduate degree were less likely to smoke compared to those with a high school degree or less. Uninsured participants were more likely to report smoking compared to those with private insurance. Those who used alcohol or drugs for coping were also more likely to smoke. Participants whose IDs and records listed their preferred gender were less likely to smoke (OR = 0.84); those who had experienced structural discrimination were more like to report smoking (OR = 1.65).
   Conclusions: Further research is needed in order to explore the relationship between smoking and legal transition among transgender individuals. Strategies to prevent smoking and encourage cessation among this vulnerable population are also needed. In addition, comprehensive collection of gender identity data in the context of national surveys, tobacco-related research, and clinical settings is sorely needed.
   Implications: This study establishes a link between experiences of structural discrimination among transgender individuals and smoking status.

AB  - Individuals that perceive stigma surrounding their identity and fear rejection of support requests may experience a paradox whereby they seek support indirectly from support networks (friends and family) to avoid rejection and are met with unsupportive responses. This study extended this paradox to sexual minorities using survey data from a sample of 133 individuals self-identified as gay and lesbian. Results of structural equation modeling showed self-stigma and fear of support rejection linked to increased indirect support seeking, which in turn explained unsupportive network responses, providing support for a paradox among gays and lesbians. Findings may have implications for interventions to improve support exchanges in the lives of sexual minorities.

AB  - Research suggests that context influences judgments and implicit evaluations (e.g., attitudes toward a person depend upon the context in which we encounter that person). Importantly, previous research presents contextual cues at encoding, such that participants learn about a target person in context. Here, we decouple the process of learning about targets from manipulations of context. Participants in our studies learned about the intelligence and athleticism of a novel male target in a neutral context. Subsequently, we implicitly measured participants' attitudes toward the target in an intelligence-related or neutral context (Study 1) and in intelligence-related and athletic-related contexts (Study 2). In both studies, contextual cues (which were absent during encoding) influenced attitudes at retrieval.

AB  - This Note applies social identity threat literature to the legal context in order to improve access to justice. Social identity threat literature indicates that stereotypes, associations, and similar methods center environments on particular identities. Social identity threat occurs when an individual who does not have the centered identity enters the environment, implicitly perceives marginalization, and thereby experiences psycho-physiological effects that burden engagement. Social identity threat, as it applies to litigants of marginalized identities inside the courtroom, is termed the "implicit pushback burden" because the social identity threat implicitly repels or pushes the individual back from the courtroom and its proceedings. While this burden may limit access to justice for people of various identities, this Note explains how it affects working-class pro se plaintiffs in employment law cases. The limited amount of literature concerning social identity threat as it applies to the legal context and the working-class identity makes drawing solutions difficult. Still, this Note provides an overview of solutions outlined in the most relevant literature, and suggests how those solutions may be applied in the courtroom.

AB  - The Latin Americanization thesis posits that the racial hierarchy in the United States is now composed of Whites, Honorary Whites, and Collective Blacks, with skin tone being the primary determinant of one's placement within this tripartite system of social status. Extant research mostly examines this approach at the macro level; relatively little is known about the thesis at the micro level. By examining goal-oriented task groups, our experiment tests whether Whites exhibit transitive levels of influence, a behavioral indicator of social status, in a manner consistent with this three-tier system. Furthermore, with applications of graph-theoretic models from status characteristics and status cue theories, we assess the social psychological mechanisms buttressing the proposed racial hierarchy by comparing propositions from four theories put forth by scholars of race/ethnicity (we translate their propositions into graphs and mathematical calculations). In so doing, we pose the question: In our experimental setting, which matters more, skin tone or ethnic background, or do both have equal effects on behavior? Our results support the purported racial hierarchy of the Latin Americanization thesis. On average, Whites were influenced the most by White confederates; Whites were influenced less by their light-skinned Latino/a confederates, and even less by dark-skinned Latino/a confederates. Model fit statistics for the propositions translated into graphs and values demonstrate that ethnic distinctions and skin tone are independent stratifiers in the form of status characteristics. This finding supports the notion that skin tone and ethnic background have the equivalent capacity to invoke processes to create the tripartite system of racial/ethnic inequality.

AB  - Cross-border welfare rights for citizens of European Union member states are intensely contested, yet there is limited research into voter opposition to such rights, sometimes denoted welfare chauvinism'. We highlight an overlooked aspect in scholarly work: the role of stereotypes about beneficiaries of cross-border welfare. We present results from an original large-scale survey experiment (N=2525) among Swedish voters, randomizing exposure to cues about recipients' country of origin and family size. Consistent with a model emphasizing the role of stereotypes, respondents react to cues about recipient identity. These effects are strongest among respondents high in ethnic prejudice and economic conservatism. The findings imply that stereotypes about who benefits from cross-border welfare rights condition public support for those rights.

AB  - The effect of mental illness stigma can be greater in the developing world where sufferers are additionally affected by destitution. This study investigated the attitudes of the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria toward mental illness to establish the extent and determinants of negative attitudes. Multistage sampling was used to select participants (n = 602), to whom questionnaires were administered. More than half of all the demographic groups demonstrated authoritarian attitude and primary social distance. A third of the sample equally endorsed social restrictiveness, anticommunity care, and secondary social distance. Low education, male gender, older age, Protestant denomination, and not being familiar with people with mental illness predicted more negative attitudes. Culture, stereotypes, causal explanations, and poor mental health knowledge were the leading mediators of negative attitudes. The determinant role of culture and demographic variables in the stigma dynamics indicate that contextualized and targeted interventions could be more effective than general campaigns.

AB  - This study examined the correlates of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) in older adults. Participants were given tasks measuring emotion recognition, executive functions and fluid IQ and questionnaires measuring RWA, perceived threat and social dominance orientation. Study 1 established higher age-related RWA across the age span in more than 2,600 New Zealanders. Studies 2 to 4 found that threat, education, social dominance and age all predicted unique variance in older adults' RWA, but the most consistent predictor was emotion recognition, predicting unique variance in older adults' RWA independent of all other variables. We argue that older adults' worse emotion recognition is associated with a more general change in social judgment. Expression of extreme attitudes (right-or left-wing) has the potential to antagonize others, but worse emotion recognition means that subtle signals will not be perceived, making the expression of extreme attitudes more likely. Our findings are consistent with other studies showing that worsening emotion recognition underlies age-related declines in verbosity, understanding of social gaffes, and ability to detect lies. Such results indicate that emotion recognition is a core social insight linked to many aspects of social cognition.

AB  - Pervasive stereotypes linking Black men with violence and criminality can lead to implicit cognitive biases, including the misidentification of harmless objects as weapons. In four experiments, we investigated whether these biases extend even to young Black boys (5-year-olds). White participants completed sequential priming tasks in which they categorized threatening and nonthreatening objects and words after brief presentations of faces of various races (Black and White) and ages (children and adults). Results consistently revealed that participants had less difficulty (i.e., faster response times, fewer errors) identifying threatening stimuli and more difficulty identifying nonthreatening stimuli after seeing Black faces than after seeing White faces, and this racial bias was equally strong following adult and child faces. Process-dissociation-procedure analyses further revealed that these effects were driven entirely by automatic (i.e., unintentional) racial biases. The collective findings suggest that the perceived threat commonly associated with Black men may generalize even to young Black boys.

AB  - This study utilized a comparative case study analysis to investigate how gender influenced the experiences of participants in a leadership development program (principal preparation program) designed to lead public K-12 schools identified as requiring turnaround. We closely focused on two participants, a man and a woman, and compared the ways each participant made meaning of his/her experiences as developing leaders in the program. Although both participants conceptualized effective leadership in similar communally-oriented ways, the way they came to construct their identities as leaders varied greatly. These differences were largely influenced by different and, what appeared to be, gendered feedback occurring during the program and when participants entered the job market.

AB  - One view in the study of attitudes towards immigration is that public reactions depend on who the immigrants are. Using a survey experiment, we confirm that group cues matter: South Koreans are more likely to support liberal immigration policies, when immigrants are framed as North Korean defectors (coethnic group). When other groups cuesKorean Chinese (semi-coethnic group) or guest-workers from Indonesia (non-coethnic group)are given, the level of support becomes significantly lower. Apparently clear evidence on the existence of favouritism towards coethnic group notwithstanding, the relationship between in-group favouritism and immigration threat is not simple, as demonstrated by the finding that individuals exposed to Korean Chinese cues are more likely to feel culturally and socially threatened than those exposed to Indonesian cues. Also, South Koreans experience higher levels of economic threat from North Korean defectors than from Korean Chinese and Indonesians. Additional analysis reveals that ethnic group cues affect public attitudes towards immigration policies not necessarily by heightening perceived threat towards immigrants, but by facilitating individuals' emotional reactions to them.

AB  - Although stigma and its relationship to health and disease is not a new phenomenon, it has not been a major feature in the public discourse until the emergence of HIV. The range of negative responses associated with the epidemic placed stigma on the public agenda and drew attention to its complexity as a phenomenon and concept worthy of further investigation. Despite the consensus that stigma is one of the major contributors to the rapid spread of HIV and the frequent use of the term in the media and among people in the street, the exact meaning of 'stigma' remains ambiguous. The aim of this paper is to briefly re-visit some of the scholarly deliberations and further interrogate their relevance in explaining HIV-related stigma evidenced in South Africa. In conclusion a model is presented. Its usefulness - or explanatory potential - is that it attempts to provide a comprehensive framework that offers insights into the individual as well as the social/structural components of HIV-related stigma in a particular context. As such, it has the potential to provide more nuanced understandings as well as to alert us to knowledge-gaps in the process.

AB  - Previous research on heterosexuals' beliefs about sexual orientation (SO) has been limited in that it has generally examined heterosexuals' beliefs from an essentialist perspective. The recently developed Sexual Orientation Beliefs Scale (SOBS; Arseneau, Grzanka, Miles, & Fassinger, 2013) assesses multifarious "lay beliefs" about SO from essentialist, social constructionist, and constructivist perspectives. This study used the SOBS to explore latent group-based patterns in endorsement of these beliefs in 2 samples of undergraduate students: a mixed-gender sample (n = 379) and an all-women sample (n = 266). While previous research has posited that essentialist beliefs about the innateness of SO predict positive attitudes toward sexual minorities, our research contributes to a growing body of scholarship that suggests that biological essentialism should be considered in the context of other beliefs. Using a person-centered analytic strategy, we found that that college students fell into distinct patterns of SO beliefs that are more different on beliefs about the homogeneity, discreteness, and informativeness of SO categories than on beliefs about the naturalness of SO. Individuals with higher levels of endorsement on all 4 SOBS subscales (a group we named multidimensional essentialism) and those who were highest in discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness beliefs (i.e., high-DHI) reported higher levels of homonegativity when compared with those who were high only in naturalness beliefs. We discuss the implications of these findings for counseling and psychotherapy about SO, as well educational and social interventions.

AB  - Drawing upon archival research conducted in the British Library as well as on interviews with trans* individuals in Pakistan, this discussion examines the historical cultural presence of transgendered and transsexual identities in the Indian subcontinent. Focussing on khwaja sara, hijras and zananas, I argue that the contradictions within historical debates attempting to regulate trans* communities into the normative masculine helped ensure that such attempts were only partially successful. Moreover despite the Supreme Court's political recognition of trans* communities in 2009, they continue to face prejudice codified through colonial laws which remain on the books in contemporary Pakistan. Interviews with my respondents reveal however that, despite being subjected to ongoing discrimination, trans* individuals creatively negotiate and expand the spaces they inhabit. Further, every day practices that sustain the communities draw upon technology to strengthen their networks as they both challenge and embrace mainstream political space in Pakistan.

AB  - Gay and bisexual men in Jamaica encounter stigma and discrimination due to criminalization of and negative attitudes towards same-sex sexuality. Disclosure of sexual orientation may be self-affirming, but could increase exposure to negative responses and stressors. Outcomes of an online survey among 110 gay and bisexual Jamaican men ages 18 to 56years suggest that disclosure to family is affected by level of economic independence. Furthermore, negative familial responses to sexual identity significantly predicted depression. Social and structural interventions, and efforts to strengthen positive family relationships, are needed to foster an environment that enables well-being among sexual minorities in Jamaica.

AB  - Human capital theory presumes that skill-accredited immigrant professionals can access positions in the labour market to match their skills and qualifications. It implies that employers have little power to influence the labour market outcomes of immigrant professionals. Using social identity theory, we examine the influence of similarity effect in recruitment decision-making involving immigrant information technology (IT) professionals in New South Wales, Australia. We assess how decision makers (N=331) hiring IT professionals need to associate and identify with people that resemble themselves in some way more than those that do not, can influence their perception of the immigrant candidate's fit into their organisation. Particularly, we examine how the level of exposure to diversity, the decision maker's origin and the diversity of clientele can moderate the assessment of the candidate's fit to the organisation. We also assess how attire, name, accent and any overtly expressed religious affiliations influence employer perceptions. The findings indicate decision makers with lower levels of exposure to diversity or working in organisations with mostly Anglo clients tend to be more concerned of the fit regarding the Indians, South-east Asians and the Chinese. They were also more likely to be negatively influenced by the non-Anglo personal attributes.

AB  - Since the Jim Crow era, overtly racist attitudes toward African-Americans have decreased. During this same period, however, racial inequalities have persisted and the approach to addressing such inequalities has shifted away from social assistance and toward punitive controls. This article poses an explanation for this seeming paradox, drawing on measures of implicit racial affect in a nationally representative survey to reveal a persisting relevance of racial bias in understandings of and support for public policieseven among those explicitly denying such bias. Among non-Hispanic whites, implicit racial bias is significantly associated with opposition to policies designed to ameliorate these inequalities as well as support for punitive crime policies. Racial bias appears to play a less important role in support or opposition to these policies among Hispanic whites and especially among African-Americans. Implications for public policy debates are discussed.

AB  - A growing body of research suggests that participation in intergroup dialogue (IGD) is associated with a variety of positive outcomes related to diversity and social justice (Dessel & Rogge, 2008; Gurin, Nagda, & Zuniga, 2013). Research on intergroup contact (Pettigrew, 1998; Stephan & Finlay, 1999) suggests that this may be because of the affective component of IGD, but little research has examined session-level experiences of emotion in IGD. We examined participants' experiences of positive and negative emotions across 8 sessions in 18 IGD groups at a large public university, and their relationships to group members' perceptions of session depth and smoothness. Across the 8 weeks, we found significant quadratic changes in positive and negative affect, and in session depth and smoothness. In addition, we found significant, positive relationships between positive affect and group members' perceptions of both session depth and smoothness; and a significant, negative relationship between negative affect and perceptions of session smoothness. Results are examined in relation to the 4-stage model of IGD, and session-level implications for cofacilitators of IGD are discussed.

AB  - Objective: In this paper we introduce the construct of "internalized gay ageism," or the sense that one feels denigrated or depreciated because of aging in the context of a gay male identity, which we identify as an unexplored aspect of sexual minority stress specific to midlife and older gay-identified men.
   Methods: Using a social stress process framework, we examine the association between internalized gay ageism and depressive symptoms, and whether one's sense of mattering mediates or moderates this association, controlling for three decades of depressive symptom histories. The sample is 312 gay-identified men (average age = 60.7 years, range = 48-78, 61% HIV-negative) participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984/85, one of the largest and longest running studies of the natural history of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., who provided contemporary (2012/13) reports of stress experiences.
   Results: We find that internalized gay ageism can reliably be measured among these men, is positively associated with depressive symptoms net of an array of other factors that may also influence symptomatology (including depressive symptom histories), and mattering partially mediates but does not moderate its effect on depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: Midlife and older gay men have traversed unparalleled historical changes across their adult lives and have paved the way for younger generations of sexual minorities to live in a time of less institutionalized discrimination. Still, they are at distinct risk for feeling socially invisible and devalued in their later years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intergroup bias-the tendency to behave more positively toward an ingroup member than an outgroup member-is a powerful social force, for good and ill. Although it is widely demonstrated, intergroup bias is not universal, as it is characterized by significant individual differences. Recently, attention has begun to turn to whether neuroanatomy might explain these individual differences in intergroup bias. However, no research to date has examined whether white matter microstructure could help determine differences in behavior toward ingroup and outgroup members. In the current research, we examine intergroup bias with the third-party punishment paradigm and white matter integrity and connectivity strength as determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found that both increased white matter integrity at the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and connectivity strength between the right TPJ and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) were associated with increased impartiality in the third-party punishment paradigm, i.e., reduced intergroup bias. Further, consistent with the role that these brain regions play in the mentalizing network, we found that these effects were mediated by mentalizing processes. Participants with greater white matter integrity at the right TPJ and connectivity strength between the right TPJ and the DMPFC employed mentalizing processes more equally for ingroup and outgroup members, and this non-biased use of mentalizing was associated with increased impartiality. The current results help shed light on the mechanisms of bias and, potentially, on interventions that promote impartiality over intergroup bias. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The longstanding issue of extrajudicial police shootings of racial and ethnic minority members has received unprecedented interest from the general public in the past year. To better understand this issue, researchers have examined racial shooter biases in the laboratory for more than a decade; however, shooter biases have been operationalized in multiple ways in previous studies with mixed results within and across measures. We meta-analyzed 42 studies, investigating five operationalizations of shooter biases (reaction time with/without a gun, false alarms, shooting sensitivity, and shooting threshold) and relevant moderators (e.g., racial prejudice, state level gun laws). Our results indicated that relative to White targets, participants were quicker to shoot armed Black targets (d(av) = -.13, 95% CI [-.19,-.06]), slower to not shoot unarmed Black targets (d(av) =.11, 95% Cl [.05,.18), and more likely to have a liberal shooting threshold for Black targets (d(av) = -.19, 95% Cl [-.37,-.01]). In addition, we found that in states with permissive (vs. restrictive) gun laws, the false alarm rate for shooting Black targets was higher and the shooting threshold for shooting Black targets was lower than for White targets. These results help provide critical insight into the psychology of race-based shooter decisions, which may have practical implications for intervention (e.g., training police officers) and prevention of the loss of life of racial and ethnic minorities.

AB  - In three experiments we investigated the impact that exposure to counter-stereotypes has on emotional reactions to outgroups. In Experiment 1, thinking about gender counter-stereotypes attenuated stereotyped emotions toward females and males. In Experiment 2, an immigrant counterstereotype attenuated stereotyped emotions toward this outgroup and reduced dehumanization tendencies. Experiment 3 replicated these results using an alternative measure of humanization. In both Experiments 2 and 3 sequential meditational analysis revealed that counter-stereotypes produced feelings of surprise which, in turn, elicited a cognitive process of expectancy violation which resulted in attenuated stereotyped emotions and an enhanced use of uniquely human characteristics to describe the outgroup. The findings extend research supporting the usefulness of counter-stereotype exposure for reducing prejudice and highlight its positive impact on intergroup emotions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous analyses of Stand Your Ground (SYG) cases have been primarily descriptive. We examine the relationship between race of the victim and conviction of the defendant in SYG cases in Florida from 2005 to 2013. Using a regression analytic approach, we allow for simultaneous examination of multiple factors to better understand existing interrelationships. Data was obtained from the Tampa Bay Times SYG database (237 cases) which was supplemented with available online court documents and/or news reports. After excluding cases which were, still pending as of January 2015; had multiple outcomes (because of multiple suspects); and missing information on race of victim and weapon of victim, our final analytic sample has 204 cases. We chose whether the case resulted in a conviction as the outcome. We develop logistic regression models using significant bivariate predictors as candidates. These include race of the victim (White, non-White), whether the defendant could have retreated from the situation, whether the defendant pursued the victim, if the victim was unarmed, and who was the initiator of the confrontation. We find race of the victim to be a significant predictor of case outcome in this data set. After controlling for other variables, the defendant is two times (OR 2.1, 95% Cl [1.07, 4.10]) more likely to be convicted in a case that involves White victims compared to those involving non-White victims. Our results depict a disturbing message: SYG legislation in Florida has a quantifiable racial bias that reveals a leniency in convictions if the victim is non-White, which provides evidence towards unequal treatment under the law. Rather than attempting to hide the outcomes of these laws, as was done in Florida, other states with SYG laws should carry out similar analyses to see if their manifestations are the same as those in Florida, and all should remediate any injustices found.

AB  - This article aims to improve our understanding about why and how individuals' signals of cognitive and noncognitive skills influence labour market outcomes. We study how employers use skills signals when hiring labour market entrants. These demand-side microprocesses are investigated at the apprenticeship market in Germany, which functions as the main entry labour market below tertiary-level education. Qualitative studies and personnel psychology research suggest multistage hiring processes. We concentrate on the first stage at which employers narrow the applicant pools based on written application documents. Their information is limited to applicants' school reports-including their grades (as signals of cognitive skills) and teachers' evaluations of their behaviours (as signals of noncognitive skills). We conducted two linked field experiments, applying the correspondence test method. Analysing the unbiased employers' responses to randomly varied fictitious applicant profiles enables us to discover whether, and if so how, applicants' skills signals are used as 'screens' at the first selection stage. The experiments reveal that both skills signals are important selection criteria, but employers prefer noncognitive skills signals. Moreover, the findings confirm that firms use thresholds (cut-off values) for selection criteria instead of linear rankings.

AB  - Recent research suggests that attributions of aliveness and mental capacities to faces are influenced by social group membership. In this article, we investigated group related biases in mind perception in participants from a Western and Eastern culture, employing faces of varying ethnic groups. In Experiment 1, Caucasian faces that ranged on a continuum from real to artificial were evaluated by participants in the UK (in-group) and in India (out-group) on animacy, abilities to plan and to feel pain, and having a mind. Human features were found to be assigned to a greater extent to faces when these belonged to in-group members, whereas out-group faces had to appear more realistic in order to be perceived as human. When participants in India evaluated South Asian (in-group) and Caucasian (out-group) faces in Experiment 2, the results closely mirrored those of the first experiment. For both studies, ratings of out-group faces were significantly predicted by participants' levels of ethnocultural empathy. The findings highlight the role of intergroup processes (i.e., in-group favoritism, out-group dehumanization) in the perception of human and mental qualities and point to ethnocultural empathy as an important factor in responses to out-groups.

AB  - Applicants belong to multiple categories (e.g., male, ethnic minority) and a complex set of factors affects category activation and inhibition when making hiring decisions. Two field experiments with recruiters who regularly engage in resume screening showed that the role of multiple categories (applicants' ethnicity and sex) in discrimination depended on job type and prejudice. Specifically, in both low- and high-demand (i.e., complex) jobs, Arab women were rated more favorably than Arab men, particularly when considering levels of client contact. Across both studies, recruiters high in explicit ethnic prejudice were discriminatory only when applicants' job qualifications fit the job position less, lending support for the attributional-ambiguity effect. Implicit attitudes did not play a strong role. Our study findings point to the complex nature of multiple categorization effects in the hiring process. Implications are considered as to how to avert hiring discrimination during resume screening.

AB  - Racial prejudice and stereotyping in gay and bisexual communities may be important contextual factors that contribute to racial disparities in HIV. In an effort to challenge race-based stereotypes regarding gay and bisexual men's sexuality, we sought to determine the extent to which race and ethnicity were associated with (1) racial homophily (i.e., same-race partnerships), (2) sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, condomless anal sex (CAS), sexual position (top/versatile/bottom)), and (3) perceived penis size and size satisfaction. Data were taken from a survey of 1,009 gay and bisexual men recruited using a street-intercept method at gay, lesbian, and bisexual community events in NYC in 2006-15 % Black, 61 % White, 18 % Latino, and 6 % Asian/Pacific Islander (mean age, 35.7). There was strong evidence of racial homophily (i.e., having a partner of the same race) among men who were in relationships, particularly for White and Black men. Race and ethnicity was largely unassociated with multiple dimensions of sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, CAS, sexual positioning). Although we observed some racial and ethnic differences in perceived penis size that were consistent with stereotypes, the magnitudes of the differences were insufficient to justify the stereotype. As well, there were no significant differences with regard to satisfaction with penis size or lying to others about penis size. The disproportionate HIV prevalence among Black and Latino men does not appear to be as a result of differences in sexual behavior (e.g., CAS, number of partners) and race-based sexual stereotypes were largely unsupported by empirical data.

AB  - This research explores the possibility that the very accomplishments that are critical to success during the hiring process (e.g., educational attainment, promotion history) can lead to a drop in future performance evaluations for women. We theorized that evaluators may see such competence signals as a threat to the traditional gender hierarchy, which leads to a negative bias when evaluating women's on-the-job performance. In Study 1, we examined this hypothesis among commanding officers in the U.S. military, who gave lower performance ratings to female subordinates whose pay grade approached their own. The same was not true for male subordinates. Studies 2, 3a, and 3b experimentally tested the boundary conditions of this effect using two additional competence signals (educational attainment and past career successes) and 2 different populations. Across these studies, we replicated the negative relationship between competence signal strength and performance evaluations for female subordinates but only under conditions in which the evaluator would be particularly likely to experience gender hierarchy threat. Specifically, it emerged when the evaluator was male and high social-dominance oriented and when the female subordinate's objective on-the-job performance was high. Finally, Study 3a demonstrated how organizations can mitigate this negative bias by using objective (rather than subjective) performance evaluations.

AB  - It has been well established in the literature that affirming the individual self reduces the tendency to exhibit group-favoring biases. The limited research examining group-affirmation and bias, however, is inconclusive. We argue that group-affirmation can exacerbate group-serving biases in certain contexts, and in the current set of studies, we document this phenomenon directly. Unlike self-affirmation, group-affirmation led to greater ingroup-favoring evaluative judgments among political partisans (Experiment 1). This increase in evaluative bias following group-affirmation was moderated by political party identification and was not found among those who affirmed a non-political ingroup (Experiment 2). In addition, the mechanism underlying these findings is explored and interpreted within the theoretical frameworks of self-categorization theory and the multiple self-aspects model (Experiments 2 and 3). The broader implications of our findings for the understanding of social identity and affirmation theory are discussed.

AB  - Prior research finds that liberals and conservatives process information differently. Predispositions toward intuitive versus reflective thinking may help explain this individual level variation. There have been few direct tests of this hypothesis and the results from the handful of studies that do exist are contradictory. Here we report the results of a series of studies using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) to investigate inclinations to be reflective and political orientation. We find a relationship between thinking style and political orientation and that these effects are particularly concentrated on social attitudes. We also find it harder to manipulate intuitive and reflective thinking than a number of prominent studies suggest. Priming manipulations used to induce reflection and intuition in published articles repeatedly fail in our studies. We conclude that conservatives-more specifically, social conservatives-tend to be dispositionally less reflective, social liberals tend to be dispositionally more reflective, and that the relationship between reflection and intuition and political attitudes may be more resistant to easy manipulation than existing research would suggest.

AB  - Four experiments examined whether information implying imminent threat to safety would interact with regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997) to affect the utilization of threat-relevant stereotypes. Because information suggesting imminent danger is more relevant to the safety goals of prevention-focused individuals than the advancement goals of promotion-focused individuals, utilization of threat-relevant stereotypes was expected to increase under such conditions only under prevention focus. Support for this prediction was obtained in four distinct and socially important domains. Using scenarios describing a violent crime committed by an African-American male (Experiment 1) or a petty crime committed by an undocumented immigrant (Experiment 2), prevention-focused individuals made judgments consistent with stereotypes when threat was perceived to be high rather than low. In studies that manipulated the stereotypicality of the target in a terrorism scenario (Experiments 3 & 4), prevention-focused individuals were more likely to endorse scrutinizing a stereotypical compared with a non-stereotypical target when terrorism was described as an increasing problem. Implications for models of stereotyping, self-regulation, and responding to threat are discussed. (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hate crime has become an increasingly familiar term in recent times as the harms associated with acts of bigotry and prejudice continue to pose complex challenges for societies across the world. However, despite the greater recognition now afforded to hate crimes by scholars, policy makers and law enforcers, uncertainty continues to cloud the scope and legitimacy of existing policy frameworks. This article draws from an emerging body of inter-disciplinary scholarship and empirical research to highlight a series of important realities about hate crime victimization and perpetration that tend to remain peripheral to the process of policy formation. It suggests that the focus on particular strands of victims and particular sets of motivations has overshadowed a range of significant issues, including the experiences of marginal groups of victims, and the way in which identity characteristics intersect with one anotherand with other situational factors and contextto leave some targets of hate crime especially vulnerable. The article calls for a more fluid and multi-layered approach to policy formation, which engages with these realities, and which maximizes the real-life value of hate crime discourse.

AB  - We investigated whether viewing September 11 footage affected peoples' perceived distress spanning past, present, and anticipated future. Participants (n = 174) were randomly assigned to a 9/11, fear, or neutral condition and completed measures of temporal perceived distress, distress of future terrorism, Islamophobia, and restriction of civil liberties attitudes. Participants in the neutral and fear conditions perceived their 9/11-related distress as declining over time. Those in the 9/11 condition perceived their distress as higher at present and declining from present (vs. past ratings). Those viewing 9/11 (vs. neutral or fear) footage reported greater future terrorism distress, more prejudice, and greater restriction of civil liberties. These differences were explained by higher 9/11-related distress ratings for past 5 years, present, and future.

AB  - ObjectiveWe empirically demonstrate that the long-held political distinction between the Deep South and the Peripheral South persists to this day.
   MethodsData from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) are employed in logistic regression models to assess differences in the likelihood of voting Republican among Deep and Peripheral South whites in gubernatorial, senatorial, and presidential contests. Additionally, recent data on the partisan and racial composition of various elective offices document the sharp decline in Democratic officeholders.
   ResultsIn contemporary Southern elections, Deep South whites, after controlling for several factors such as partisanship, ideology, religion, and income, are consistently and significantly more likely to vote Republican than their Peripheral South peers.
   ConclusionsRace remains the most salient issue in Southern politics and it structures the alignment of whites and blacks into opposing parties. Because of this, whites are more Republican in their voting behavior in the more culturally conservative subregion where the proportion of African Americans is higher: the Deep South. Dixie is now dominated by the GOP, and especially in the Deep South, with grim representational implications for African Americans because they are no longer part of coalitional majorities at virtually every level of governance.

AB  - The growing demand of human populations for food supplies has led to an increase in the use of synthetic products, mainly pesticides, which induce adverse effects not only to target organisms, but also to nontarget biota of agroecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems in the proximity of agricultural areas are particularly vulnerable to pesticides, which cause underperformance or extinction of non-target sensitive species. Once in the aquatic system, these chemicals can affect biological processes at multiple levels (molecular, individual, populational), causing ecosystem imbalance across multiple scales. In this study, the effect of a commercial formulation of a herbicide (Primextra (R) Gold TZ) and its main active ingredient (a.i., S-metolachlor) was studied on a freshwater cladoceran species (Daphnia longispina), at different levels of biological organization and temporal scales. S-metolachlor is used in many herbicide formulations applied in corn/maize cultures, which is a relevant culture worldwide. As a first step, the acute and chronic effects of both commercial formulation and a.i. were quantified, and both formulations negatively affected the cladoceran's survival and reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction, number of offspring and number of broods), as well as the population's rate of increase. Whilst acute effects were comparable, the commercial formulation was slightly more toxic (EC50 was two-times lower) than the a.i. in chronic exposures, being prejudicial to D. longispina populations above 4.0 mg/L of S-metolachlor. In a second experimental step, we focused on the potential multi-generational impacts of the exposure to the a.i. alone on biochemical (lipid biomarkers, namely fatty acids) and populational responses, because of the relevance of S-metolachlor as a biosynthesis inhibitor in many herbicidal formulations. The herbicide caused a significant decrease in Daphnia fecundity (in the size of the 1st clutch), but no concomitant alterations were found in fatty acid profiles of mothers or offspring. More important, this experiment showed that S-metolachlor did not cause effects in the subsequent generation, thus suggesting that biotic communities may recover after exposure to the xenobiotic.

AB  - Does a board with greater gender diversity make better investment decisions? Drawing on Austrian economic cycle theory and work groups theory, we argue that such board openness will help male board members to overcome gender biases, discrimination, and conflicts; integrate different perspectives under the economic cycle and crisis; and foster an environment in which better decisions are made. The results of an empirical study of 14,609 firm-quarter observations from 1,555 listed firms in China between 2007 and 2009 strongly support our arguments. We find that a Chinese board is more likely to accept female directorship during an economic crisis than during an economic prosperity stage. Boards with greater gender diversity are more likely to make tough, counter-cyclical investments to improve firm performance during a crisis. Our study enriches the board decision-making literature by exploring the impacts of board gender diversity on firm performance within the context of an economic crisis. The results of our study also carry significant managerial implications for overcoming gender stereotypes, biases, and prejudices on a board.

AB  - Anthropomorphism is a phenomenon that describes the human tendency to see human-like shapes in the environment. It has considerable consequences for people's choices and beliefs. With the increased presence of robots, it is important to investigate the optimal design for this technology. In this paper we discuss the potential benefits and challenges of building anthropomorphic robots, from both a philosophical perspective and from the viewpoint of empirical research in the fields of human-robot interaction and social psychology. We believe that this broad investigation of anthropomorphism will not only help us to understand the phenomenon better, but can also indicate solutions for facilitating the integration of human-like machines in the real world.

AB  - Although many of the world's most serious outbreaks of conflict and violence center on religion, social science research has had relatively little to say about religion's unique role in shaping individuals' attitudes about these events. In this paper we investigate whether Americans' religious beliefs play a central role in shaping attitudes toward the continuing threat of terrorism and their willingness to assist officials in countering these perceived threats. Our analysis of an original data collection of almost 1600 Americans shows that more religious respondents are more likely to express concerns about terrorism. However, this relationship is mediated by their level of conservatism. We also find that more religious respondents are more likely to claim that they will assist government officials in countering terrorism. This relationship remained even after accounting for conservatism, and people's general willingness to help police solve crimes like breaking and entering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ideologically objectionable premise model posits that biased political judgments can emerge across the political spectrum. Previous tests of ideological differences in political judgment biases have utilized between-subjects designs (i.e., separate comparisons). In this study (N = 410), we examined whether these biases also emerge in within-subjects designs (i.e., joint comparisons) and compared the strengths of judgment biases in between-subjects and within-subjects designs. Across designs, both liberals and conservatives favored sympathetic over unsympathetic targets in scenario judgments, but biases were attenuated in the within-subjects design. No ideological differences in bias strength emerged, although liberals reported a stronger internal motivation to respond without prejudice toward ideologically dissimilar others. Further, consistent with the ideological conflict hypothesis, both liberals and conservatives were prejudiced toward ideologically dissimilar targets, although biases in prejudice ratings were stronger among liberals than conservatives. Together, results support the ideological symmetry perspective on political bias and prejudice.

AB  - Biological lay theories of race have proven to have pernicious consequences for interracial relations, yet few studies have examined how intergroup contact itself (particularly with those who naturalistically challenge these conceptions) affects beliefs about race. Three studies (a correlational study, an interaction study, and an experimental study) examine whether exposure to racially ambiguous individuals reduces Whites' biological lay theories of race across time. Study 1 demonstrates that increased exposure to racial ambiguity across 2 weeks reduced White individuals' biological lay theories. Study 2 shows that Whites who interacted in a laboratory setting with a racially ambiguous individual were less likely to endorse biological lay theories, an effect that sustained for 2 weeks. Study 3 finds that the reduction in biological lay theories after exposure to racial ambiguity is mediated by the tendency for Whites' lay theories of race to conform to beliefs they presume racially ambiguous individuals hold.

AB  - Citizenship representations within national populations have mainly been deduced from state policies on migration. Yet, at the individual level, no studies have investigated whether citizenship representations are reliably associated with preferences for specific migration policies (i.e. the underlying assumption for deducing citizenship representations from state policies). Because several studies have shown that state policies may not reflect understandings of citizenship within national populations, it may be more relevant to study citizenship representations at the individual level, in relation to personal preferences regarding migration policies. This study examined how ethnic, cultural and civic citizenship representations relate to migration policy preferences at the individual level among majority group high-school students (N = 1,734) in seven EU countries. Findings add to the understanding of citizenship representations and may have implications for the implementation of migration policies.

AB  - Framed by role congruity and ambivalent sexism, the current study is designed to investigate perceptions of male and female nurses. Specifically, 167 Canadian undergraduates from Southern Ontario viewed a potential nursing recruitment advertisement (female nurse, male nurse, or masculinity emphasized male nurse), reported their perceptions of the nurse in the advertisement, and rated the appropriateness of nursing as a career for men and women. MANOVAs revealed that participants viewed the male nurses more negatively (less competent and more deviant) in the masculinity emphasized condition than the male nurse condition, which is consistent with role congruity theory. Correlations further revealed that men in the male nurse condition and women in the masculinity emphasized condition who were higher in hostile sexism were more likely to rate the depicted male nurse as deviant than their lower scoring peers. Female participants rated nursing as a more appropriate career for men than did male participants, suggesting that resistance toward male nurses may stem primarily from other men. The ambivalent sexism scores of men and women related differently in each condition to ratings of the appropriateness of nursing as a career for men and women, suggesting a complex relationship between sexism and acceptance of male nurses. The findings imply that attempts to challenge current stereotypes by emphasizing the masculinity of men in female dominated careers may instead lead to perceptions of greater role incongruity-and more negative perceptions of men in these careers. Moreover, ambivalent sexism may be contributing to resistances toward men in nursing.

AB  - Individuals exercise self-control daily to achieve desired goals; at the same time, people engage in social interaction daily and influence (feel powerful) or are influenced (feel powerless) by others. Does controlling the self have an unforeseen consequence for people's perception of their capacity to control others? Five studiesone correlational and four experimentaldemonstrate that ego depletion from prior self-control determines one's personal sense of power; low-level, concrete mental construals account for this relationship. Our results showed that people with higher trait self-control reported a greater sense of power (Study 1). People who had depleted their self-control-related regulatory resources (vs. those who had not) experienced a lower sense of power (Study 2). The relationship between ego depletion and low sense of power was mediated by construal level (Study 3) and observed only when low-level, concrete construals were present, but not under high-level, abstract construals (Studies 4 and 5).

AB  - This article advocates the concept of race trouble as a way of synthesizing variation in racial discourse, and as a way of studying how social interaction and institutional life continue to be organized by conceptions of race' and racism'. Our analysis of an online discussion at a South African University about the defensibility of a characterization of (black) student protesters as savages' revealed a number of familiar strategies: participants avoided explicit racism, denied racism, and denied racism on behalf of others. However, the aim of this analysis was not to identify the real' racism, but to show how race and racism were used in the interaction to develop perspectives on transformation in the institution, to produce social division in the University, and to create ambivalently racialized and racializing subject positions. We demonstrate how, especially through uses of deracialized discourse, participants' actions were observably shaped by the potential ways in which others could hear race' and racism'. Race trouble thus became manifest through racial suggestion, allusion, innuendo, and implication. We conclude with a call to social psychologists to study the ways in which meanings of race' and racism' are forged and contested in relation to each other.

Study 1 assessed the effects of these factors on a subtle measure of linguistic discrimination, namely, linguistic abstraction. Study 2 considered the explicit level of verbal abuse. Results highlighted that target's reduced humanity led to enhanced linguistic discrimination toward the target, while group membership moderated this effect in specific conditions. Overall, the evidence of this set of studies sheds light on the role of humanity and its interplay with social categorization on discrimination outcomes.

AB  - Virtually all previous studies of domestic economic redistribution find white Americans to be less enthusiastic about welfare for black recipients than for white recipients. When it comes to foreign aid and international redistribution across racial lines, I argue that prejudice manifests not in an uncharitable, resentful way but in a paternalistic way because intergroup contact is minimal and because of how the media portray black foreigners. Using two survey experiments, I show that white Americans are more favorable toward aid when cued to think of foreign poor of African descent than when cued to think of those of East European descent. This relationship is due not to the greater perceived need of black foreigners but to an underlying racial paternalism that sees them as lacking in human agency. The findings confirm accusations of aid skeptics and hold implications for understanding the roots of paternalistic practices in the foreign aid regime.

AB  - Although performance on laboratory-based implicit bias tasks often is interpreted strictly in terms of the strength of automatic associations, recent evidence suggests that such tasks are influenced by higher-order cognitive control processes, so-called executive functions (EFs). However, extant work in this area has been limited by failure to account for the unity and diversity of EFs, focus on only a single measure of bias and/or EF, and relatively small sample sizes. The current study sought to comprehensively model the relation between individual differences in EFs and the expression of racial bias in 3 commonly used laboratory measures. Participants (N = 485) completed a battery of EF tasks (Session 1) and 3 racial bias tasks (Session 2), along with numerous individual difference questionnaires. The main findings were as follows: (a) measures of implicit bias were only weakly intercorrelated; (b) EF and estimates of automatic processes both predicted implicit bias and also interacted, such that the relation between automatic processes and bias expression was reduced at higher levels of EF; (c) specific facets of EF were differentially associated with overall task performance and controlled processing estimates across different bias tasks; (d) EF did not moderate associations between implicit and explicit measures of bias; and (e) external, but not internal, motivation to control prejudice depended on EF to reduce bias expression. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of global and specific EF abilities in determining expression of implicit racial bias.

AB  - A cross sectional survey was administered to 670 men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) in San Salvador through respondent driven sampling to identify determinants of ever testing for HIV using a minority stress framework. A positive association was found between ever testing and older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.10], past experience of sexual assault (aOR 2.92), perceiving that most social acquaintances had tested (aOR 1.81), and knowing a PLHIV (aOR 1.94). A negative association was found between homelessness and ever testing (aOR 0.43). Among the MSM sub-sample (n = 506), similar results were found for older age (aOR 2.63), and past experience of sexual assault (aOR 2.56). Internalized homonegativity was negatively associated with ever testing for HIV among MSM (aOR 0.46), and HIV testing stigma and experienced provider discrimination further strengthened this relationship. It is important to mitigate sexual minority stigma in order to increase HIV testing among MSM. Future research should explore this construct among TW.

AB  - In secularized modern Western societies, moral opposition to the liberalization of abortion, gay adoption, euthanasia, and suicide often relies on justifications based on other-oriented motives (mainly, protection of the weak, e.g., children). Moreover, some argue that the truly open-minded people may be those who, against the stream, oppose the established dominant liberal values in modern societies. We investigated whether moral and religious opposition to, vs. the acceptance of, the above four issues, as well as the endorsement of respective con vs. pro arguments reflect (a) "compassionate openness" (prosocial, interpersonal, dispositions and existential flexibility), (b) "compassionate conservatism" (prosocial dispositions and collectivistic moral concerns), or (c) "self-centered moral rigorism" (collectivistic moral concerns, low existential quest, and low humility instead of prosocial dispositions). The results, to some extent, confirmed the third pattern. Thus, compassionate openness does not seem to underline modern moral opposition, possibly in contrast to some rhetoric of the latter.

AB  - Heteronormativity has been defined as the enforced compliance with culturally determined heterosexual roles and assumptions about heterosexuality as'natural' or 'normal'. Cross-disciplinary theoretical literature suggests that heteronormativity may be linked to a range of attitudes, social phenomena and outcomes and that it may be a fundamental prerequisite for institutional and interpersonal manifestations of heterosexism. Yet, this construct is in need of empirical elaboration. Operationalising heteronormativity along two dimensions (essential, binary beliefs about sex and gender and normative behavioural attitudes), this article describes initial development of the Heteronormative Attitudes and Beliefs Scale. Across three studies, this newly developed measure has demonstrated an adequately supported two-factor model, expected group differences (e.g., higher scores among men vs. women and among heterosexual vs. sexual minority participants) and significant correlations with relevant personality and attitudinal variables such as right-wing authoritarianism, openness to experience (OE), attitudes towards sexual minorities and tolerance of ambiguity. In addition to establishing further construct validity and replication of the observed factor structure with more racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse samples, future research could more closely examine the potential causes, consequences and malleability of heteronormativity.

AB  - This article reviews a growing body of social science research indicating that race, ethnicity, and culture can influence the judgments and behaviors of juries. The first section addresses research on jury bias, which shows that jurors often make harsher judgments of defendants from other racial and ethnic groups and are more likely to give death sentences in cases involving Black or Latino defendants and White victims. However, these effects are moderated by several factors related to the trial parties, context, and crime. Further, juror bias often involves subtle or implicit psychological processes that can be difficult to recognize and correct. The second section discusses research conceptualizing jurors as agentic forces whose judgments and behaviors may reflect their racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. This work shows that jurors' backgrounds may influence their reactions to defendants, trial judgments, and deliberation behaviors. The final section offers recommendations for future research in these areas.

AB  - We investigated the role of certain individual and group processes on intergroup bias in the context of Cyprus, an island that has endured over 40 years of interethnic tension. One hundred and fifty Turkish Cypriots were asked to complete a survey which assessed intergroup contact and intergroup bias toward Greek Cypriots. Political affiliation, ingroup favoritism and intergroup contact played a role in predicting prejudice toward Greek Cypriots. Path analysis showed the relationship between ingroup favoritism and outgroup prejudice was partially mediated by low intergroup contact. The findings highlight the theoretical and practical implications for prejudice reduction techniques in Cyprus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current investigations examine how globalization signifying either identity threat or realistic threat has a differential role in mediating the effect of competitive victimhood on Muslims' religious fundamentalism. Study 1 (N = 119) revealed that identity globalization threat and not realistic globalization threat significantly mediated the effect of competitive victimhood on Muslims' religious fundamentalism. Study 2 (N = 155) successfully replicated the finding in Study 1. Moreover, Study 2 also revealed that such mediating role of identity globalization threat was stronger among participants perceiving Muslims as having high than low group entitativity, which refers to the extent to which Muslims as a group are considered to be a one, homogenous collective rather than an aggregation of individuals. Theoretical implications for understanding situational or social factors of Muslims' religious fundamentalism are discussed, as are strategies to reduce competitive victimhood among members of this religious group.

AB  - Incarceration has pervasive negative effects on life outcomes, including employment, but explanations for these effects (apart from those based on selection) tend to be divided between those that focus on the lingering pains of imprisonment and those that focus on discrimination. In this Article, we attempt to provide a bridge between these two foci by situating both within a larger sociocognitive context. This involves reviewing the contemporary literature on prisonization with an eye toward identifying corollaries in the social-psychological literature. It also involves situating research on the "mark" of a criminal record within the larger social-psychological literature on stigma. Recasting the incarceration literature using sociocognitive terms and concepts sheds some additional light. In particular, some of the self-defeating behavior of former inmates, including disengagement, can be seen as reflecting the psychological dilemmas former inmates face after release. Furthermore, a sociocognitive perspective sheds light on some of the unique features of incarceration stigma. Although coping with stigma is difficult for all stigmatized persons, the situation of former inmates may be especially difficult given a confluence of factors, including some atypical features of incarceration stigma, institutional pressures that amplify that stigma, and the lingering psychological pains of imprisonment, which mitigate effective coping.

AB  - Emotional expressions can signal intentions and so possess the power to moderate social inferences. Here, we test whether stereotypes implicitly elicited by a stigmatized racial outgroup member are moderated by facial expression. Participants classified pictures of guns and tools that were primed with pictures of Black and White male faces posing angry, happy, and neutral expressions. Across the 3 measures examined-response latencies, error rates, and automatic processing, facial expression modulated implicit stereotyping (Study 1, n = 71; Study 2, n = 166). A Black angry prime elicited implicit stereotyping, while a Black happy prime diminished implicit stereotyping. Responding after neutral primes varied as a function of the expression context. When viewed alongside more threatening expressions (Study 1), neutral Black targets no longer elicited implicit stereotyping, but when viewed alongside more threatening expressions (Study 2), neutral Black targets primed crime and danger-relevant stereotypes. These results demonstrate that an individual can activate different associations based on changes in emotional expression and that a feature present in many everyday encounters (a smile) attenuates implicit racial stereotyping.

AB  - Organs recovered from donors after circulatory death (DCD) suffer warm ischemia before cold storage which may prejudice graft survival and result in a greater risk of complications after transplant. A period of normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) in the donor may reverse these effects and improve organ function. Twenty-one NRP retrievals from Maastricht category III DCD donors were performed at three UK centers. NRP was established postasystole via aortic and caval cannulation and maintained for 2h. Blood gases and biochemistry were monitored to assess organ function. Sixty-three organs were recovered. Forty-nine patients were transplanted. The median time from asystole to NRP was 16min (range 10-23min). Thirty-two patients received a kidney transplant. The median cold ischemia time was 12h 30min (range 5h 25min-18h 22min). The median creatinine at 3 and 12 months was 107 mu mol/L (range 72-222) and 121 mu mol/L (range 63-157), respectively. Thirteen (40%) recipients had delayed graft function and four lost the grafts. Eleven patients received a liver transplant. The first week median peak ALT was 389IU/L (range 58-3043). One patient had primary nonfunction. Two combined pancreas-kidney transplants, one islet transplant and three double lung transplants were performed with primary function. NRP in DCD donation facilitates organ recovery and may improve short-term outcomes.
   This study shows that the use of normothermic regional perfusion for organ recovery from controlled donation after circulatory death leads to an increased organ recovery rate and may improve short-term transplant outcomes.

AB  - In cultural contexts in which sexist beliefs are considered traditional, shifts toward gender equality represent an example of cultural change. Polyculturalism is defined as the belief that cultures change constantly through different racial and ethnic groups' interactions, influences, and exchanges with each other and, therefore, are dynamic and socially constructed rather than static. Thus, polyculturalism may involve openness to cultural change and, thereby, would be expected to be associated with lower sexist attitudes. Four studies (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) with undergraduate and community samples in the Northeastern United States tested whether endorsement of polyculturalism is inversely associated with sexism, above and beyond potentially confounding belief systems. Across studies, for both women and men, endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with lower sexist attitudes for two classes of sexism measures: (a) attitudes toward the rights and roles of women and (b) ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Associations remained significant while controlling for potentially confounding variables (colorblindness, conservatism, egalitarianism, gender and ethnic identity, gender and race essentialism, multiculturalism, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation). Greater openness to criticizing one's culture mediated polyculturalism's association with attitudes toward the rights and roles of women but not with ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Studying polyculturalism may provide unique insights into sexism, and more work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Two experiments investigated self-reported emotional reactions to photographs of people with attractive, unattractive, or structurally disfigured faces. In Experiment 1, participants viewing disfigured faces reported raised levels of sorrow and curiosity but not raised levels of negative emotions. In Experiment 2, there was more negative emotion and less positive emotion reported under conditions of relatively high anonymity, compared to low anonymity, specific to disfigured faces, suggesting that self-reports are influenced by social desirability. Trait empathy was associated with sorrow and negative emotions when viewing disfigured faces. Disgust sensitivity was associated with negative emotions and inversely associated with positive emotions.

AB  - Tarr analyses the representation of Islam in five feature films made since 2006 that centre on the changing identities of Muslims in contemporary France. She locates the films within the context of the rise in Islamophobia in France following 9/11 and anxieties about immigration and terrorism, but also in relation to France's troubled postcolonial history and French republican ideology. In particular, the French notion of laicite (secularism) has given rise to active hostility to any public expression of religious or cultural difference, particularly on the part of Muslims. Cinematic representations of Muslims, and particularly of the children of migrants from the Maghreb, have, therefore, since the mid-1980s, been treated with caution in order not to alienate mainstream Franco-French audiences and to facilitate the second generation's integration into French society. However, the five feature films addressed here-two mainstream popular comedies, Mauvaise foi/Bad Faith (2006) and L'Italien/The Italian (2010), and three independent, low budget, auteur-led, realist films, Dans la vie/Two Ladies (2008), Dernier maquis (2008) and La Desintegration/Disintegration (2012)-offer new narratives that challenge fears of Islam by foregrounding the protagonists' negotiation of their Muslim identities in a French context and, by implication, argue for the integration of Islam as a legitimate referent of French identity. However, their construction of Islam does not extend to positive representations of young veiled women, and they thus still risk confirming the oppressive majority view that certain practices associated with Islam, such as the wearing of the veil, are incompatible with the secularism of the French Republic.

AB  - A religious prosociality stereotype exists such that religiosity and prosociality are presumed to be positively associated, as evidenced by proxy measures such as personality traits. However, studies using self- and peer-ratings of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness have not simultaneously controlled for the religiosity of the participant and the target. One hundred and sixty students completed measures of religiosity in a prescreening survey. Later, participants rated an array of targets, including a Christian and an atheist, on adjectives corresponding to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Regardless of participant religiosity, atheist targets were rated as being lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness relative to those labeled as Christians. This bias was greater for highly religious participants. This effect was mediated by perceptions of the morality of the target independent of participants' broader attitudes concerning the target's religious group. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Contact theory and threat group theory offer contradictory hypothesis regarding the effect of contact with immigrants. Does contact reduce or increases negative attitudes towards immigration? This article integrates both approaches and tests the effect of contact towards immigrants when different contexts are considered. We investigate the effect of the economic environment and the immigrant group size on modifying attitudes towards immigration in the context of Catalonia, which offers a complex environment where traditional hypotheses can be tested. Results show that close contact and family contact with immigrants reduce prejudices. However, mixed results are reported regarding the effect of the economic environment or the immigrant group size. Findings also show that Catalan identity is related to lower levels of negative attitudes towards immigrants, regardless of having experienced contact with foreigners. Results have implications on the impact of context when dealing with the impact of contact on attitudes towards immigration.

AB  - Previous studies of the relationship between interethnic attitudes and the ethnic composition of neighbourhoods have overlooked the impact of neighbourhood problems in ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. This paper examines the influence of neighbourhood disorder and decline (i.e. increasing disorder) on interethnic attitudes, controlling for the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood. Neighbourhood disorder and decline are measured by indicators of social and physical neighbourhood problems. Additionally, we examine the extent to which the impact of (increasing) disorder on interethnic attitudes depends on the particular ethnic composition of the neighbourhood. Using a geocoded data set covering 1435 neighbourhoods in The Netherlands, we analyse interethnic attitudes among four ethnic minority groups and the native Dutch population. Multilevel analyses show that for both ethnic minority and native Dutch residents neighbourhood decline is associated with negative attitudes towards ethnic minority groups, particularly in neighbourhoods with many ethnic minority residents.

AB  - Stanley Milgram was motivated to show how something as horrible as the Holocaust could happen. To what extent does his research provide understanding of this? This article reviews a conception of the origins of genocide and other mass violence, based on case studies of actual instances, ranging from the Holocaust to the genocide in Rwanda and great violence in the Congo, in which psychological and social science principles were applied to historical data. This analysis and conception shows that a multiplicity of societal conditions and cultural characteristics together lead to group violence. Under certain societal and cultural conditions, many people rather than obey, seek, and join, and then subsequently follow, leaders, and groups. However, one cultural characteristic that is usually present and is relevant to Milgram's work, strong authority orientation, promotes the tendency to obedience and reduces the likelihood of resistance. The article also discusses the multiplicity of influences present both in Milgram's experiments and other violence-producing situations, which includes people following rules of conventional behavior, and the multiplicity of psychological processes that arise, and questions some interpretations of Milgram's findings. It discusses the neglected but important role of personality, and the potential inherent in socialization and education to promote inclusive caring and resistance to violence producing situations. It points to the great potential of bystanders, their authority, in preventing violent behavior.

AB  - Objectives: Test hypotheses drawn from Smith and Alpert's social conditioning theory that explains biased policing as the result of implicit racial stereotypes. Distinguishing between frisks and searches, we hypothesize that (1) Black drivers are more likely than White drivers to be frisked and searched; (2) racial disparity is greater in frisks than searches; (3) racial disparity in frisks, but not searches, is conditional upon the racial composition of the community; and (4) that drivers' race is not related to the productivity of searches. Methods: Data are all traffic stops made by the Rhode Island State Police in 2006, exclusive of those in which a search was mandatory. Multinomial and binary logistic regressions are employed to estimate models of frisks, searches, search productivity, and to test the conditional effect of community context. Results: Each of the four hypotheses is supported. Conclusion: Biased policing is largely the product of implicit stereotypes that are activated in contexts in which Black drivers appear out of place and in police actions that require quick decisions providing little time to monitor cognitions. This insight has important implications for police training. Because of limitations in this study, additional research that distinguishes frisks and searches is needed.

AB  - This research examines for the 1st time the effects of relative deprivation and relative gratification, based on social comparison, on implicit and overt forms of discrimination toward the outgroup in a minimal group setting. Study 1 showed that compared to a control condition, relative deprivation and relative gratification enhanced implicit discrimination-measured through variations of linguistic abstraction in intergroup descriptions. Whereas both relative deprivation and relative gratification produced linguistic ingroup favoritism, linguistic productions of relatively deprived groups also conveyed outgroup derogation. Study 2 showed that relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups were overtly discriminatory in intergroup allocations of negative outcomes. The effects of relative deprivation were mediated by perceived intergroup rivalry and, in part, by perceived common fate. Perceived common fate partly accounted for the effects of relative gratification. Study 3 focused on mediators of relative gratification. First, members of relatively gratified (vs. control) groups worried about losing the ingroup advantage, which together worked as sequential mediators of discrimination. Second, relatively gratified groups reported higher existential guilt, which, in turn, was related to expectations of discrimination by the relatively deprived outgroup, and these sequentially mediated the effects of relative gratification. Overall, these studies highlight that both relative deprivation and relative gratification enhance intergroup discrimination and contribute to the understanding of the underlying processes.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 self-identified homosexual university students. The data on the strategies employed by homosexuals suggested a categorization of these strategies into four interrelated areas: strategies employed in the process of self-acceptance; strategies to manage sexual stigma and prejudice; strategies specific to the coming-out process; and the strategies used while openly expressing their sexual identities.

AB  - This article examines which individual-level factors are related to people's likelihood of discriminating against ethnic minority job applicants. It moves beyond describing to what extent discrimination occurs by examining the role of individuals' interethnic contacts, education and religion in shaping their behavior towards ethnic minority job applicants. We derive expectations from theories from the interethnic attitudes literature. Data are collected via (1) a laboratory experiment in which student participants (n = 272) reviewed r,sum,s of fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience and (2) a survey amongst the same participants. During the experiment, participants assess applicants' suitability for a job and select applicants for an interview. Additionally, participants complete a questionnaire including questions on several personal and background features. Results show that individuals who have more positive interethnic contacts, higher educational levels and higher educated parents are less likely to discriminate against ethnic minority applicants. Individuals whose parents are church members are more likely to discriminate, as are males. We find interesting differences regarding the role of decision makers' features between different stages of the recruitment process. First assessments of applicants' suitability for a job are predominantly affected by applicants' features. Differences between decision makers here are relatively small. Eventual choices about which applicants to invite for a job interview, however, are affected by both applicants' and decision makers' features; here differences between decision makers are more pronounced. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Implicit bias is defined, in part, by a lack of intent. Yet the implicit attitudes literature has made little contact with research on the experience of conscious will, which suggests that the feeling of conscious intent is an inference rather than a direct report of how actions are caused. We tested the hypothesis that inferences about one's intentions shape whether an automatically activated attitude is endorsed explicitly. In a first study, individuals who perceived their attitudes toward gay men to be intended showed stronger implicit-explicit correspondence. In a second study, we manipulated perceptions of intent. Inferences that implicit bias was intended caused participants to express those biases on an explicit measure. A third study replicated the experimental effects and found that metacognitions of intent were especially influential among individuals who were motivated to be unprejudiced. Results suggest that metacognitive inferences about intent can shape whether automatically activated bias becomes explicitly endorsed prejudice.

AB  - A hot moment' is an emotion-laden moment of conflict or tension that threatens to derail teaching and learning. In this study, an educational development workshop used interactive theater depicting a hot moment to prepare university instructors for diverse classrooms. Participants in three workshops wrote short reflections, both before and after the theater-based experience, about whether instructors should consider differences among students. After the workshop, many participants took new dimensions of difference into consideration. Surprisingly, after the interactive theater experience, almost all participants reflected exclusively on instrumental issues in teaching (e.g. classroom management strategies), but not structural issues of difference, power, and privilege that underlie hot moments. The empirical findings and the author's reflections on a personal hot moment are theorized in terms of concepts from and critiques of critical and feminist pedagogy.

AB  - Most studies on ethnic diversity and social trust rely on the standard measure of generalized trust. This study complements existing work on this topic by examining the effect of diversity on trust toward outgroups. This innovation is motivated by two closely connected arguments: At first, most existent studies are conducted in the framework of intergroup contact and conflict theory. These theories directly allude to trust toward outgroups. Second, recent empirical studies show that the standard measure of generalized trust is much less generalized than theoretically assumed. Instead it is blurred by a great deal of particularized trust. Explicit outgroup trust therefore seems to be better suited to empirically testing the extent to which growing ethnic diversity influences trust toward people different from oneself. The cross-national analysis yields a positive relationship between diversity and outgroup trust, which is an interesting finding given the current debate dominated by conflict theoretical reasoning.

AB  - The goal of this research was twofold: 1) investigate whether the attractiveness bias is moderated by the type of jobs to be filled or by the gender of the applicants, and 2) examine the way this bias is implicitly echoed through the recruiters' discourse in non-discriminatory settings. Using a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subject factorial design, 120 recruiters had to evaluate the hireability of an average or attractive candidate, being male or female, for either a frontline or a back-office position, and to justify their decision in writing. As predicted, the hireability ratings showed that being unattractive was a drawback, particularly for recruitment in frontline position. This was also expressed implicitly as recruiters used rhetorical and discursive markers to express their discriminatory thoughts. The social and empirical implications of the results are discussed, and suggestions for future researches are offered.

AB  - The authors' purpose is to investigate the relationship between religiosity, authoritarianism, and moral authority by considering religiosity as a multidimensional construct and morality from its sources of influence. Religiosity, authoritarianism, and moral authority scales were applied to a sample of 109 students from one high school and one university college in Semirom city in the province of Isfahan, Iran. Results showed that religious beliefs, feelings and consequences are related to external sources but only religious beliefs and feelings correlate with the principal source of moral authority. Findings also demonstrated a significant relationship between religious consequences and authoritarianism, and that their combination significantly predicts the external source of moral authority. Findings are discussed in relation to previous studies and we argue that previous conclusions about the authoritarian tendency of religious people and their reliance on external sources of moral reasoning are mostly about the religious consequences dimension.
   Resume L'objectif des auteurs est d'etudier la relation entre la religion, l'autoritarisme et l'autorite morale, en considerant la religion comme un concept multidimensionnel et en etudiant l'impact de la morale sur l'homme. Pour connaitre leurs rapports a la religion et ses principes moraux, 109 etudiants d'un lycee et d'un college de Semirom, dans la province d'Ispahan en Iran, ont ete sondes. Les resultats ont montre que les croyances religieuses, les sentiments et leurs consequences sont lies a une source externe. Mais l'autorite morale a une veritable influence sur les croyances et les sentiments religieux. Les resultats ont egalement demontre une correlation totale entre consequences religieuses et autoritarisme. Leur combinaison laisse a penser que l'autorite morale joue un role determinant dans le quotidien des personnes sondees. Avec les resultats obtenus precedemment, nous en avons conclu que les personnes religieuses qui aient une tendance autoritaire et s'appuyent surtout sur une moralite externe sont pour la plupart influencees par la dimension religieuse.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between Openness and political orientation and activism in Europe. Analyses were conducted on the 4 waves of the European Social Survey, including large representative samples in up to 26 European countries (total N > 175,000). In line with previous studies, a robust, positive relationship between Openness and left-wing political orientation was obtained in Western Europe. However, in Eastern Europe, the relationship between Openness and political orientation was weaker, and reversed in 3 out of 4 waves. Moreover, Openness yielded significant positive relationships with unconventional activism and to a lesser degree with conventional activism. The magnitude of the relationship between Openness and activism was dependent on political orientation and region. Stronger associations between Openness and activism were found for those having a left-wing orientation in Western Europe, whereas in Eastern Europe, Openness was somewhat stronger related to activism for those having a right-wing orientation. In the discussion we elaborate on the role of the geopolitical context in the relationship between Openness and political variables.

AB  - The present study examines the role of familiarity and satisfaction with foreign vs. Israeli home care as predictors of attitudes towards social rights to foreigners. A random stratified sample of home care recipients in the center of Israel was drawn. A total of 388 older adults and 686 family members were interviewed. Of these, 666 relied on foreign home care services, and the remaining sample relied on Israeli home care services. Satisfaction with services was a stronger predictor of one's willingness to grant rights to foreigners among those who employ foreign home care workers than among those who employ Israeli workers. The findings are discussed within the frameworks of the contact theory and in relation to the global trend of foreign home care services to older adults.

AB  - How does segregation shape intergroup violence in contested urban spaces? Should nominal rivals be kept separate or instead more closely integrated? We develop an empirically grounded agent-based model to understand the sources and patterns of violence in urban areas, employing Jerusalem as a demonstration case and seeding our model with microlevel, geocoded data on settlement patterns. An optimal set of parameters is selected to best fit the observed spatial distribution of violence in the city, with the calibrated model used to assess how different levels of segregation, reflecting various proposed virtual futures for Jerusalem, would shape violence. Our results suggest that besides spatial proximity, social distance is key to explaining conflict over urban areas: arrangements conducive to reducing the extent of intergroup interactionsincluding localized segregation, limits on mobility and migration, partition, and differentiation of political authoritycan be expected to dampen violence, although their effect depends decisively on social distance.

AB  - Although replication is a central tenet of science, direct replications are rare in psychology. This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect - imagined contact reducing prejudice - showed weak support for replicability. And two effects - flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification - did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.

AB  - According to social cognition textbooks, stereotypes are activated automatically if appropriate categorical cues are processed. Although many studies have tested effects of activated stereotypes on behavior, few have tested the process of stereotype activation. Blair and Banaji (1996) demonstrated that subjects were faster to categorize first names as male or female if those were preceded by gender congruent attribute primes. The same, albeit smaller, effects emerged in a semantic priming design ruling out response priming by Banaji and Hardin (1996). We sought to replicate these important effects. Mirroring Blair and Banaji (1996) we found strong priming effects as long as response priming was possible. However, unlike Banaji and Hardin (1996), we did not find any evidence for automatic stereotype activation, when response priming was ruled out. Our findings suggest that automatic stereotype activation is not a reliable and global phenomenon but is restricted to more specific conditions.

AB  - Background: Throughout history, people have soothed their fear of disease outbreaks by searching for someone to blame. Such was the case with the April 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. Mexicans and other Latinos living in the US were quickly stigmatized by non-Latinos as carriers of the virus, partly because of news reports on the outbreak's alleged origin in Mexican pig farms.
   Methods: In this exploratory study we examined the psychological processes of cue convergence and associative priming, through which many people likely conflated news of the H1N1 outbreak with pre-existing cognitive scripts that blamed Latino immigrants for a variety of social problems. We also used a transactional model of stress and coping to analyze the transcripts from five focus groups, in order to examine the ways in which a diverse collection of New England residents appraised the threat of H1N1, processed information about stereotypes and stigmas, and devised personal strategies to cope with these stressors.
   Results: Twelve themes emerged in the final wave of coding, with most of them appearing at distinctive points in the stress and coping trajectories of focus group participants. Primary and secondary appraisals were mostly stressful or negative, with participants born in the USA reporting more stressful responses than those who were not. Latino participants reported no stressful primary appraisals, but spoke much more often than Whites or Non-Hispanic Blacks about negative secondary appraisals. When interactions between participants dealt with stigmas regarding Latinos and H1N1, Latinos in our focus groups reported using far more negative coping strategies than Whites or Non-Hispanic Blacks. When discussions did not focus on stereotypes or stigmas, Latino participants spoke much more often about positive coping strategies compared to members of these same groups.
   Conclusions: Participants in all five focus groups went through a similar process of stress and coping in response to the threat of H1N1, though individual responses varied by race and ethnicity. Stigmatization has often been common during pandemics, and public health and emergency preparedness practitioners can help to mitigate its impacts by developing interventions to address the social stressors that occur during outbreaks in highly-localized geographic regions.

We randomly altered the resumes to indicate affiliation in one of seven religious groups or a control group. Resumes that mentioned any religious affiliation received about one-quarter fewer phone calls than did the control group but there were no significant difference in e-mails received. Muslim applicants received one-third fewer responses from employers, either as phone calls or e-mails, than did the control group. There was also evidence of discrimination against atheists, Catholics and pagans. These findings are consistent with theoretical models of secularization and cultural distaste theory.

AB  - The present study examined the generalizability of the factor pattern, structural parameters, and latent structure of a multidimensional hierarchical model of ethnocultural empathy in males and females. The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE) (Wang et al., 2003) was administered to a sample of 610 Italian undergraduates to examine the generalizability and reliability of its factor structure across gender, the psychometric properties and the validity of the scale. Two models were tested through multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA): a confirmatory factor-analytic model that hypothesized a multidimensional model of ethnocultural empathy; and a structural equation model that proposed a multidimensional, hierarchical structure with global ethnocultural empathy as a superordinate construct that explained the covariances among the subdomains of the SEE. Both models satisfied multiple criteria for goodness-of-fit with the data. Full metric invariance of factor loadings and factor covariances, and partial invariance of error variances across gender for the four-factors model were supported. Scale reliability was also satisfactory, showing good internal consistency. As regard scale validity, evidence was found for a positive moderate association with a measure of general empathy and a negative high association with a measure of prejudice. Implications are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A known consequence of stereotype suppression is post-suppressional rebound (PSR), an ironic activation of the suppressed stereotype. This is typically explained as an unintended by-product from a dual-process model of mental control. Relying on this model, stereotype rebound is believed to be conceptual. Alternative accounts predict PSR to be featural or procedural. According to the latter account, stereotype rebound would not be limited to the suppressed social category, but could occur for a target from any social category. The occurrence of procedural stereotype rebound was examined across five experiments. Suppression of one particular stereotype consistently led to rebound for social targets belonging to the same or a different stereotype in an essay-writing task (Experiments 1-3) and led to facilitation in recognition of stereotype-consistent words (Experiment 4). Finally, stereotype suppression was shown to impact on assessments of stereotype use but not on heuristic thinking (Experiment 5).

AB  - In the current paper we examined whether women and men view gender discrimination as having changed over time, and if so: 1) how it has changed and 2) whether changes in anti-women bias are viewed as directly associated with changes in anti-men bias. Based on prior research (Norton and Sommers, 2011; Sidanius and Pratto, 1999), it was hypothesized that older men (35 years and older) compared to younger men (18-34 years of age) would hold a zero-sum view of gender discrimination trends in that older men would perceive increases in anti-men bias to accompany decreases in anti-women bias. Conversely, women, regardless of age, were expected to perceive changes in anti-women bias as unrelated to changes in anti-men bias. Results based on data from an online U.S. national sample (n = 499) supported the hypotheses for older men (n = 58), younger men (n = 160), older women (n = 96) and younger women (n = 185) and corroborated parallel past findings that the historically dominant social group (older men in this case) perceive any status gained by a socially subordinate group (women) as coming at the dominant group's expense.

AB  - The lack of engagement of fathers by child welfare services is well-documented in the literature as a serious problem. Towards addressing this problem, this paper reports the findings of interviews with 18 fathers about their involvement with child welfare services in Ontario, Canada. Qualitative analysis of the interviews yielded themes about what men saw as the positive and negative aspects of their involvement with child welfare. Positive aspects of service involvement for fathers included understanding and supportive workers, useful assistance from workers, being connected to useful resources and being given a wake-up call'. Negative aspects of service involvement included uncaring, unhelpful and unprofessional workers; prejudice against fathers; and experiencing the child welfare system as unresponsive, uncaring and rigid. Implications for practice are discussed with a view to improving the engagement of men in, and their experiences with, child welfare services.

AB  - The Islamophobia Scale (IS) is a self-report measure of an individual's fear-related attitudes toward Muslims and the religion of Islam (S. A. Lee, J. A. Gibbons, J. M. Thompson, & H. S. Timani, 2009, The Islamophobia Scale: Instrument development and initial validation, International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, Vol. 19, pp. 92-105). In order to further validate the psychometric properties of the IS, the current study conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and a test-retest reliability analysis (Study 1), a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) study (Study 2), and an incremental validation study (Study 3). In addition, construct validity was examined across all of the studies using correlations with other instruments. The results demonstrated that the IS is reliable across time, is more factorially sound as a two-factor model, and is correlated with expected instruments. The MTMM demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity, rivaling forgiveness and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) measures for the cognitive component, but not for the affective-behavioral component. However, the affective-behavioral component explained variance over and above RWA and Arab prejudice measures for sympathetic reactions to a suffering Muslim. Implications, limitations, and opportunities for future research are discussed.

AB  - Because of their meritocratic ideology, Western countries might promote the belief that every individual is responsible for his or her socioeconomic position. These beliefs might enhance discrimination which, in turn, might affect health. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the role of perceived discrimination within income-related health inequalities.
   Two-year follow-up data (2008-2010) from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences panel (N = 2,139) were used to examine the relation between income, perceived discrimination, and self-rated health and feeling hindered by health problems.
   Results showed that poor health was more prevalent in the low income and in the discriminated group. Participants from the low income group were also more likely to perceive discrimination (OR = 1.57, 95 % CI = 1.03-2.42). However, there was no substantial evidence for a mediating effect of perceived discrimination on the income-health association.
   The results emphasise the importance of a more in-depth study of discrimination in relation to socioeconomic health inequalities. Since ethnicity was a major confounder, it is recommended to take account of the complex interplay between discrimination and both the socioeconomic and ethnic background.

AB  - Previous studies have reported that when people self-reflectthey typically judge the self as more positive (or less negative) compared to others on a range of dimensions (such as health, social skills, or achievement). In the present study, we investigated whether viewing the self through the eyes of other people reduces this egocentric (self-centered) bias. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were examined in 17 subjects who performed judgments of adjectives in positive or negative valences from either self-perspective or other-perspective. Reaction times revealed an interaction between the factors perspective and emotional valence. Faster responses occurred after positive words in the self-perspective condition. A similar interaction was observed in the ERP waveforms in the time range of the N400 component: smaller N400 amplitudes were elicited by positive stimuli compared to negative stimuli in the self-perspective condition, but not in the other-perspective condition. Similarly, a reversed pattern was found in the late positive component (LPC) at 415-815 ms. The present study suggests that shifts in perspectives between self and others can change self-appraisal, which in turn reduces egocentric biases of the self. On a neural level, this modulation may be associated with an increase in self-monitoring processes.

AB  - The current studies explore situational and individual factors affecting non-target perceivers' reactions and behavior following a racist comment, focusing on verbal confronting behavior. Two studies were conducted in which participants reported about recent situations in which they witnessed a racist comment that was not directed specifically at their own racial group. Results indicated that only one third of participants directly confronted the commenter. Strength of verbal confrontation was predicted by affective reactions and judgments of the offensiveness of the prejudicial comment. Analyses also revealed that strength of confrontation for females was predicted by the experience of negative emotions, but that males confronted more with stronger ratings of the offensiveness of the racist remarks. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.

AB  - The current study examined the extent to which H1N1 was stigmatized at the height of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. and explored the role that H1N1 stigma played in people's desire for physical distance from others with H1N1. H1N1 was the most stigmatized disease, with participants endorsing greater prejudice toward people with H1N1 than people with cancer or HIV/AIDS. Further, H1N1 stigma partially mediated the relationship between participants' perceptions that H1N1 was threatening and their desire for physical distance from people with H1N1. Therefore, H1N1 stigma played a role in, but was not entirely responsible for, the relationship between perceptions that H1N1 was threatening and the desire for distance from others with H1N1.

AB  - This article aims to study to what extent the share of immigrants in a country influences individuals' perceptions of ethnic threat and how this can be explained by theories of economic and cultural threat. Following an economic logic, people with a weak socio-economic position should have a greater perception of ethnic threat. This would be more so if the share of low-educated immigrants in a country was relatively high. Following a cultural logic, greater perceptions of ethnic threat should be found among individuals with a weak cultural position, which would apply more strongly if the share of non-Western immigrants in a country was relatively high. Both theories are studied using data from the first round of the European Social Survey, enriched with country-specific variables. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the theories under scrutiny and in the light of current scientific debates about the influence of immigration on Western societies.

AB  - Using a model of the stigmatization of flexible work based on status legitimation theory, we analyze the experiences of a sample of 54 mothers who opted out of professional jobs. Qualitative text analysis reveals that features of women's workplaces are conducive to the creation and maintenance of flexibility stigma and bias and that women working flexibly are subjected to various forms of stigmatizing treatment, which plays a role in their decision to suspend their careers. We find limited evidence, however, that women perceive high levels of stigma and differential treatment as reflecting bias or prejudice. Instead, the majority appears to accept the legitimacy of professional time norms and view their treatment as justifiable. We identify factors that moderate or inhibit their perception of flexibility bias, as distinct from stigma per se, and discuss the limitations of our research as well as its implications for future research and policy.

AB  - Intergroup contact has been demonstrated to reduce prejudice toward out-groups under the right conditions; however, real contact experiences are often difficult to arrange. Imagined contact may be an alternative. The current study randomly assigned participants to imagine or to have real contact with a person with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Results demonstrated that both imagined and real contact had positive effects on attitudes toward people with schizophrenia, as compared to the effects of imagined and real interactions with an age-matched control person. We discuss the strengths and limitations of imagined contact interventions with an eye toward future research.

AB  - This review examines the phenomenon of hate crimes in the United States. Findings derived from the FBI data for the period 19962008 revealed that the incidence of anti-racial hate crimes varied among different racial groups, that antireligious hate crimes were committed toward Jews and Muslims more than toward others, and that antisexual orientation hate crimes focused on male homosexuals more than others. Antireligious hate crimes were more likely to be directed against property, whereas anti-racial and antisexual orientation hate crimes were more likely to be directed against people. We discuss these findings in the light of some relevant theoretical perspectives from social psychology. Potential solutions to hate crimes could be developed by focusing on the most relevant predictive factors.

AB  - Rural spaces in settler nations like Australia are commonly perceived as 'white', with low numbers of 'non-white' ethnic minorities. Perhaps because of this, although ethnic diversity is a feature of some rural communities, there is a paucity of research into issues of cultural exclusion. This is surprising in view of recent federal government initiatives to encourage non-Anglo immigrants to settle in rural areas. How welcoming are the receiving communities? Set within a constructivist paradigm, racism is analysed here as a social construction within places, reflecting the local ethnic mix and socio-demographic profiles. From a telephone survey in 2007 and questions looking at 'old', 'new' and 'symbolic' racisms, this study finds that levels of tolerance and intolerance are everywhere different. Traditional associations between racism and higher education or increasing age are sometimes true, sometimes not; degree of contact is sometimes associated with acceptance, sometimes not. Particulars of the ethnic mix are especially important. Consistent with new racist attitudes, dispositions towards 'out-groups' varies between acceptance of immigrants from Britain and Europe and lesser acceptance of those from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, or the Middle East (Muslims). However, while rural South Australians are less tolerant than people living in metropolitan Adelaide, low levels of experience of racist behaviour are found among ethnic minority group members than analysis of attitudes might have suggested.

AB  - In Germany, Turkish students are overrepresented on lowest school tracks. Research has provided evidence that stereotypical expectations can color judgments. We experimentally investigated whether student information that strongly confirmed or disconfirmed Turkish stereotypical expectations led to student teachers' judgments that were biased against nationality. Furthermore, we explored whether judging an expectation-confirming or expectation-disconfirming Turkish student resulted in changes in stereotypical beliefs. Results showed that student teachers' judgments were biased against nationality when it came to an expectation-confirming student and that the expectation-disconfirming student could change stereotypical beliefs into slightly more positive ones. Results are discussed with regard to their theoretical relevance as well as to their importance for teacher education.

AB  - An evolutionary approach to stigmatization suggests that disease-avoidance processes contribute to some instances of social exclusion. Disease-avoidance processes are over-inclusive, targeting even non-threatening individuals who display cues of substandard health. We investigated whether such cues motivate avoidance of physical contact in particular. In Studies 1 and 2, targets with disease (e.g., leprosy) or atypical morphologies (e.g., amputated leg, obesity) were found to arouse differentially heightened discomfort with physical (versus nonphysical) contact, whereas a criminal target (stigmatized for disease-irrelevant reasons) was found to arouse elevated discomfort for both types of contact. Study 3 used a between-subjects design that eliminated the influence of extraneous factors. A diseased target was found to arouse differentially heightened discomfort with physical (versus nonphysical) contact, and to do so more strongly than any other type of target.

AB  - Processes of globalisation, migration, and increasing cultural diversity within nations have resulted in a growing need to understand intercultural relations in plural societies. Accordingly, this paper highlights the relations between immigrants and members of host societies and considers how social and demographic changes may affect acculturation and intercultural relations and shape future psychological theory and research in these areas. Based on a combination of empirical data and informed speculation, we discuss three significant changes. First is the growing importance of transnational relations due to a large degree of faster and cheaper forms of communication and traveling. A second important factor is changing demographics characterised by the growth of mega-cities and the increasing proportion of first and second generation of immigrants in contemporary immigration nations and consequently the diminishing size of native majority groups. Third is the greater acceptance of a global culture, which is shaped by globalisation and coloured by local multi-ethnic characteristics and creolisation processes in each country of settlement.

AB  - This study examined age discrimination in between-vs. within-career job transitions. We expected that older workers transitioning into a new field would experience greater age discrimination than those who change jobs within the same field, particularly when amount of prior job experience is not made salient, and particularly when decision-makers were highly prejudiced. Results suggested that younger job applicants received higher suitability ratings than older job applicants, and job applicants making a within-career transition were rated higher than those making a between-career transition. As hypothesized, older job applicants making between-career transitions would receive the lowest ratings of suitability for hire when no information regarding experience was presented, and when decision-makers were highly prejudiced. Implications for the aging workforce are discussed.

AB  - Previous research has shown that the neuropeptide oxytocin promotes various prosocial sentiments, such as trust, generosity and cooperation. Here we investigate whether it plays a role in evaluating self- vs. other-owned objects. Brain potentials were recorded in participants who judged the ownership of objects that were described in either positive or negative terms. Results showed that self-owned objects framed by positive adjectives elicited more positive-going brain responses than those framed by negative adjectives, irrespective of oxytocin or placebo being administrated. Negatively described other-owned objects evoked more positive-going responses than positively described other-owned objects, but the opposite pattern was found with the administration of oxytocin. Thus, oxytocin abolishes other-derogation but does not affect self-enhancement in object evaluation, consistent with the proposal that oxytocin enhances affilliative and approach motivations during social interaction.

AB  - Using a community sample of 197 people living with HIV/AIDS, we examined how awareness of societal stigma (felt stigma) and negative feelings toward oneself as a member of a stigmatized group (self-stigma) are related to psychological well-being. Both felt stigma and self-stigma were significantly correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, but controlling for felt stigma reduced self-stigma's association with depressive symptoms to nonsignificance. Global self-esteem and social avoidance fully mediated the associations between self-stigma and distress but only partially mediated the associations between felt stigma and distress. Felt stigma mediated the relationship between distress and HIV-related changes in physical appearance.

AB  - The present research investigates leniency for out-group offenders and differentiates it from the black sheep effect. The authors assume that leniency for out-group offenders can be used by in-group members to protect their group's image by displaying that they are not prejudiced. Thus, leniency should disappear when in-group members have otherwise shown that they are not prejudiced (i.e., moral credentials). In two experiments, offenders' group membership and participants' opportunity to establish moral credentials were manipulated. Results showed that out-group offenders received the lowest punishment severity ratings (Studies 1 and 2). However, this leniency effect vanished when participants had established moral credentials by either endorsing the participation of out-group members in lobby groups (Study 1) or writing about a positive experience with an out-group member (Study 2). These findings suggest that lenient punishments for out-group offenders may sometimes reflect a relatively easy strategy to display the in-group as being unprejudiced.

AB  - The media plays an important role in how the American public understands controversial social and political issues, such as immigration. The purpose of this article is to examine how key features of the media, such as location (Arizona vs. National) and political ideology (Liberal vs. Conservative), affect the framing of arguments supporting and opposing the anti-immigration bill (Arizona SB 1070). A content analysis was conducted using 3 weeks of newspaper articles from two Arizona newspapers (one Conservative, one Liberal) and five national newspapers (three Conservative, two Liberal). Analyses revealed that both location and political ideology influenced the framing. Specifically, the national newspapers were more likely than Arizona newspapers to frame arguments supporting the bill in terms of threats (e.g., threats to economic and public safety) and to frame arguments against the bill in terms of civil rights issues (e.g., racial profiling). In terms of political ideology, Conservative newspapers were more likely than Liberal newspapers to frame the bill in terms of economic and public safety threats, but did not differ in mentions of civil rights issues. The implications for attitudes toward immigrants and legal ethnic minorities and for defining the boundaries of the American national identity are discussed.

AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed.

AB  - The authors investigated the effects of perspective taking on opinions about reparations for victims of historical harm. In two studies, they showed that when non-Indigenous Australians took an Indigenous Australian perspective, this increased perceived entitlement to, and decreased anger toward, monetary compensation. Moreover, perceived entitlement mediated the relationship between anger about monetary compensation and perspective taking. Study 2 demonstrated the mutual influence of emotions and perceived entitlement. In particular, self-image shame rather than group-based guilt or anger predicted support for reparation when an Indigenous Australian perspective was adopted. The results suggest that taking the perspective of people who have experienced harm from one's own group can bolster a commitment to positive social change in relation to a pressing social issue.

AB  - One of the most heavily debated questions in implicit social cognition is the extent to which implicit measures can be voluntarily controlled. The experiment reported here is the first to employ a novel strategy for intentionally controlling performance in the autobiographical Implicit Association Test (aIAT). Specifically, when explicitly instructed to do so, participants were able to speed up their responses in the incongruent blocks of the aIAT and thus influence the outcome of the test. This effect was larger when the experimental instruction was followed by practice in speeding responses than when the instruction was given alone. A process-dissociation analysis suggested that the effect was due to reductions in the ability of participants' automatic associations to influence responses when instructions to speed up were provided. This experiment provides new insight into the potential for strategic control in the performance of implicit measures and into the interplay between automatic and controlled processes underlying performance on implicit measures.

AB  - This research, conducted in the Netherlands, examines whether native adolescents' tolerance of practices by Muslim immigrants (e. g., the founding of Islamic schools) is affected by the type of considerations (e. g., educational freedom vs. integration of Muslims in Dutch society). Using an experimental questionnaire design (N = 970), the findings show that adolescents (13-17 years) became less tolerant when considerations against these practices were presented, whereas tolerance was not affected by considerations in favor of the practices. In addition, the level of tolerance of adolescents who strongly identified as Dutch was not affected by the different considerations, but lower identifiers were less tolerant when considerations against the practices were given. The effects of the different considerations did not differ for age and for educational level. The implications of this research for improving adolescent's tolerance of practices by Muslim actors are discussed.

AB  - This paper assesses the residential segregation of German immigrants from Turkey, Italy, the Balkans and eastern Europe with a special focus on the link between social and ethnic segregation. Microdata from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (SOEP) are used. A new dataset provided by the microm Micromarketing-Systeme und Consult GmbH makes accessible information on participants' immediate residential environments at the micro-neighbourhood level where an average neighbourhood contains only eight households. Substantial levels of residential isolation in the form of own-group overexposure are found for all four migrant groups. Based on previous research, an enhanced methodology is proposed to measure the effect of socioeconomic neighbourhood sorting on ethnic residential segregation. It is shown that differences in income, education, language skills and village/city size have the potential to account for 29-84 per cent of the residential isolation of the four migrant groups.

AB  - Results from a nationally representative sample of the New Zealand European majority and Maori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand) indicated that dual ideologies of symbolic exclusion and historical negation were differentially ameliorated and heightened through ingroup and outgroup contact (N=4718). For New Zealand Europeans, contact with Maori friends increased the symbolic projection of Maori culture as representative of the national category. For Maori, contact with New Zealand European friends decreased the symbolic projection of ingroup culture as representative of the nation. Ingroup contact, in contrast, heightened support for the symbolic exclusion of Maori for New Zealand Europeans, and promoted symbolic projection for Maori. For both groups, outgroup contact was unrelated to levels of historical negation, an ideology relating to material reparation for colonial injustice. These results indicate that post-colonial ideologies relating to the symbolic promotion versus exclusion of indigenous culture are more amenable to change via contact than ideologies linked directly to reparative attitudes based on historical injustice. Furthermore, for indigenous peoples, contact with the majority group may increase system-favoring ideologies that exclude their own culture from representations of the nation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Previous research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the expression of race bias by impairing control-related processes. The current study tested whether simple exposure to alcohol-related images can also increase bias, but via a different mechanism. Participants viewed magazine ads for either alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages prior to completing Payne's (2001) Weapons Identification Task (WIT). As predicted, participants primed with alcohol ads exhibited greater race bias in the WIT than participants primed with neutral beverages. Process dissociation analyses indicated that these effects were due to automatic (relative to controlled) processes having a larger influence on behavior among alcohol-primed relative to neutral-primed participants. Structural equation modeling further showed that the alcohol-priming effect was mediated by increases in the influence of automatic associations on behavior. These data suggest an additional pathway by which alcohol can potentially harm inter-racial interactions, even when no beverage is consumed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Past research shows that attachment security is linked to low prejudice (Hofstra, Van Oudenhoven & Bunnk, 2005; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2001). We extend this research by examining the role of attachment security in discriminatory choices and discriminatory behaviour. The current study examines the influence of primed attachment security (vs. neutral prime) on self-reported discrimination and actual discriminatory behaviour towards Muslims. Results illustrate that primed attachment security (vs. a neutral prime) significantly predicts both the choice to discriminate against Muslims and subsequent behavioural discrimination towards a Muslim. Implications for increasing attachment security as a means of reducing prejudice and discrimination are discussed.

AB  - Although inter-group contact reduces prejudice, intra-group contact is most typically preferred. Understanding factors contributing to out-group avoidance, therefore, is imperative. Unlike previous correlational studies, other-stereotype (out-group is biased) and meta-stereotype (out-group sees one's in-group as biased) information was manipulated in an inter-group contact setting, at the personal (you/partner) or group (in-group/out-group) level. Whites under threat generally indicated positive expectations and intentions to approach Black interaction partners. However, at the behavioural level, personal meta-stereotype manipulations (your partner thinks you are biased) generated out-group avoidance several times stronger than in the other threat conditions. Implications for the development of prejudice interventions are discussed within an aversive racism framework.

AB  - 1. We aimed to investigate the effects of high-fat and high-energy (HFHE) diets on the hepatic expression of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) in developing female rats.
   2. The pups of the dams fed with the standard diet were defined as the NN group and those fed the HFHE diet were defined as the NH group. The mRNA and protein expression, the protein localization and activity was determined.
   3. The mRNA expression of CYP3A1 on day 3 in the NH group were higher versus NN groups (p < 0.05) and the expression of the NH group on days 28 and 56 were lower versus the NN group (p < 0.01). CYP3A1 immunolabeling had a zonal-restricted expressions pattern on day 28 and after in the NN groups, while the obvious zonal expression pattern was observed in the NH group on day 84. The mean activity for the NH groups on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 was higher versus the NN groups (p < 0.05). On day 84, the activity was lower for the NH group versus the NN group (p < 0.05).
   4. Our findings provide a basis for further studies on appropriate medication regimen in obese children.

AB  - A number of cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a significant co-variation of patriotism and nationalism with prejudice against immigrants. This study examines the causal relationship between the three variables among 551 adult German respondents without migration background. Employing a longitudinal cross-lagged design with two measurements 4 years apart, a positive and significant effect of nationalism on prejudice was found. Patriotism predicted ethnic prejudice negatively when nationalism was controlled for. However, in a separate cross-lagged model where the common variance between nationalism and patriotism was not controlled for, patriotism had no causal effect on prejudice. In the discussion, these contradictory effects of patriotism on prejudice against immigrants are interpreted as the result of different dimensions composing patriotism, namely national identification and adherence to democratic norms. Consequences and political implications of the results are discussed, referring to the negative effects of enforcing both nationalism and patriotism.

AB  - This paper is a report on a qualitative study which considered the issue of how lecturers feel about teaching and managing the topic of culture and racism within their role as nurse educators. The issue of cultural diversity and the related issue of racism within nursing and society more generally means that the problem cannot be ignored since one of the central tenets of nursing is that care should be delivered in nondiscriminatory ways. We interviewed a group of lecturers within a UK university to explore their views on the topic. We produced six themes: Culture; the existence of racism within nursing; challenging racism; political correctness; strategies adopted to address issues in the classroom and the presence of cultural diversity within the curriculum. We identified that the lecturers in our study were keen to address the issue but were also very concerned about their own abilities and confidence in this area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined how priming Whites with colorblind or multicultural approaches to diversity prior to an interracial interaction affects ethnic minorities' cognitive functioning. Although ethnic minorities did not explicitly know which prime their White partner received, ethnic minorities paired with Whites primed with colorblindness (vs. multiculturalism) showed poorer cognitive performance on the Stroop (1935) color-naming task following the interaction. Furthermore, Whites in interracial interactions primed with colorblindness exhibited more behavioral prejudice, which mediated ethnic minorities' decreased cognitive performance. These findings suggest that Whites' exposure to certain ideologies may affect the cognitive performance of the ethnic minorities they encounter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Commitment is an important topic for discussion both for social and religious practices. What we understand by 'commitment' is obedience to affiliation rules and adherence to in-group principles. In psychology of religion, we discuss commitment in terms of congregational and intrinsic/extrinsic motivation.
   In this paper, the issue of commitment is being discussed in conjunction to intrinsic/extrinsic motivational attitudes. The hypothesis explores whether congregational commitment forms part of intrinsic/extrinsic motivational attitudes. To investigate the hypothesis two measures were employed: The Allport-Ross Religious Orientation Scale consisted of nine and twelve items, and the Three Components Scale (affective commitment/continuance commitment/normative commitment) of the Organisational Commitment Questionnaire, each one composed of eight items, slightly modified for the purpose of this study. Two small studies of one-way repeated measures ANOVA design were carried out.
   Among the issues investigated were congregational commitment and intrinsic/extrinsic motivation as addressing social imperatives in a religious orientation context, as well as whether both measures employed in this study could be re-formulated and presented as one. Through this study a suggestion for an introvert-extrovert congregational attitude inventory for psychology of religion has emerged which combines the aforementioned questionnaires in the sense of a congregational behaviour referred both to motivational and organisational attitude.

AB  - The present research examined the influence of education on attitudes toward affirmative action. Studies 1 and 2 showed no impact of education on attitudes toward soft policies of affirmative action. In contrast, they showed less support of the more educated to hard policies of affirmative action. Neither prejudice (Study 2), nor understanding of the affirmative-action policies (Study 3) accounted for this effect. Study 4 demonstrated that the education effect is mediated by the threat posed by strong plans to meritocratic beliefs. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This article explores the geographical mobility intentions of students aged between 18 and 24 years in the Republic of Ireland after the end of the economic boom commonly referred to as the 'Celtic Tiger'. Focusing upon a sample of undergraduates in Dublin and Cork, the article looks at how many respondents intend to move abroad in the future, where the potential leavers intend to go and for how long they envisage staying away, in addition to elaborating mobility decision-making processes. Results show that 59% had plans for to leave, largely to English language speaking destinations, with most sojourns envisaged as temporary. The evidence also suggests that more young women than young men are seeking an exit and that a wide range of factors can influence mobility decision-making, most prominently personal development and friendship ties, but not economic fears. The concluding discussion considers the meaning of these outcomes for these young people and the potential significance of spatial reflexivity in transitions from education to work, particularly in an economic crisis context.

AB  - What impact does ideology have on American attitudes and policy preferences toward China? Based on two large N surveys, we first utilize exploratory factor analysis to uncover six distinct American ideological dimensions and two distinct dimensions of attitudes toward China that distinguish between its government and its people. We then utilize structural equation modeling to explore how attitudes toward the Chinese people (i.e. prejudice) and attitudes toward the Chinese government differentially mediate relationships between ideological beliefs, on the one hand, and Americans' China policy preferences, on the other. Results suggest both direct and indirect effects of ideology on policy preferences, with the latter effects being differentially mediated by prejudice and attitudes toward the Chinese government.

AB  - Despite the cultural ubiquity of ideas and images related to God, relatively little is known about the effects of exposure to God representations on behavior. Specific depictions of God differ across religions, but common to most is that God is (a) an omnipotent, controlling force and (b) an omniscient, all-knowing being. Given these 2 characteristic features, how might exposure to the concept of God influence behavior? Leveraging classic and recent theorizing on self-regulation and social cognition, we predict and test for 2 divergent effects of exposure to notions of God on self-regulatory processes. Specifically, we show that participants reminded of God (vs. neutral or positive concepts) demonstrate both decreased active goal pursuit (Studies 1, 2, and 5) and increased temptation resistance (Studies 3, 4, and 5). These findings provide the first experimental evidence that exposure to God influences goal pursuit and suggest that the ever-present cultural reminders of God can be both burden and benefit for self-regulation.

AB  - The results of three experiments provide evidence that the relative accessibility of stereotypes about sex difference influences people's memory of very recent emotions. Being under high rather than low cognitive load caused females compared with males to recall experiencing more intense emotional reactions to saddening stimuli (Experiments 1 and 2), and relatively less intense reactions to angering stimuli (Experiment 2). Being directly primed with stereotypes about sex differences and being under high cognitive load both caused females to recall more intense reactions to saddening stimuli compared with females who were neither primed with stereotypes nor under cognitive load (Experiment 3). These results imply that the relative accessibility of stereotypes influences memories of emotion in a manner similar to stereotypes' influence on social perception. Implications of these findings for theories of emotion memory and for self-perpetuating stereotypes about emotional sex differences are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper outlines the ways in which the conception of social integration and its practical realization have developed over time in Australia, and the various pathways that models of integration have followed. It makes a distinction between the approaches to inclusion of the indigenous population, the Australian Aborigines in broader Australian social life and social institutions, and those dealing with populations of incoming migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. Although there are similarities in the models of integration mobilized in both arenas, the differences and interactions are also significant and characteristic of what is specific about settler-colonial societies. The central models in both fields are assimilation, integration and multiculturalism, and the paper will sketch briefly how each model has operated both in theory and in practice, how they have succeeded and interacted with each other, how they have intersected with other types of concerns, such as citizenship, civilization and security, as well as what might be distinctive about the Australian approach to social integration in comparison with other countries.

AB  - Social psychologists place high importance on understanding mechanisms and frequently employ mediation analyses to shed light on the process underlying an effect. Such analyses can be conducted with observed variables (e. g., a typical regression approach) or latent variables (e. g., a structural equation modeling approach), and choosing between these methods can be a more complex and consequential decision than researchers often realize. The present article adds to the literature on mediation by examining the relative trade-off between accuracy and precision in latent versus observed variable modeling. Whereas past work has shown that latent variable models tend to produce more accurate estimates, we demonstrate that this increase in accuracy comes at the cost of increased standard errors and reduced power, and examine this relative trade-off both theoretically and empirically in a typical 3-variable mediation model across varying levels of effect size and reliability. We discuss implications for social psychologists seeking to uncover mediating variables and provide 3 practical recommendations for maximizing both accuracy and precision in mediation analyses.

AB  - Queen bees are senior women in male-dominated organizations who have achieved success by emphasizing how they differ from other women. Although the behavior of queen bees tends to be seen as contributing to gender disparities in career outcomes, we argue that queen-bee behavior is actually a result of the gender bias and social identity threat that produce gender disparities in career outcomes. In the experiment reported here, we asked separate groups of senior policewomen to recall the presence or absence of gender bias during their careers, and we measured queen-bee responses (i.e., masculine self-descriptions, in-group distancing, and denying of discrimination). Such gender-bias priming increased queen-bee responses among policewomen with low gender identification, but policewomen with high gender identification responded with increased motivation to improve opportunities for other women. These results suggest that gender-biased work environments shape women's behavior by stimulating women with low gender identification to dissociate with other women and to display queen-bee responses as a way to achieve individual mobility.

AB  - The present study examined attitudes toward diversity as a moderator of outcomes of diversity in workgroups. Two studies were conducted that focused on the development of the Attitudes Toward Diverse Workgroups Scale (ADWS) and on the impact of diversity attitudes on task performance and psychological reactions in actual face-to-face diverse brainstorming groups. The first study supported the internal consistency and stability of the ADWS and revealed that it was related, in the predicted way, to the Big Five and general prejudice. The second study revealed that high scores on the productive and affective dimensions of the ADWS enhanced brainstorming performance (quality of ideas) in actual diverse groups and positive psychological reactions to the group experiences, respectively.

AB  - Facial electromyography (EMG) was used to gauge emotional responding towards images of slim and overweight individuals, and findings were compared with data from a series of alternative measures including two implicit attitudinal procedures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and explicit measures of anti-fat prejudice and discriminatory behavior. Images of slim individuals elicited EMG responses consistent with more positive affect. Data from both the IRAP and IAT indicated higher levels of bias than were revealed on the explicit measures, and the IRAP also corroborated the EMG pattern by indicating responses consistent with pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias. The IRAP was moderately correlated with both EMG and the IAT and was the only measure to predict behavioral intentions. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: An implicit measure of early-life family conditions was created to help address potential biases in responses to self-reported questionnaires of early-life family environments. We investigated whether a computerized affect attribution paradigm designed to capture implicit, affective responses (anger, fear, warmth) regarding early-life family environments was (a) stable over time, (b) associated with self-reports of childhood family environments, (c) able to predict adult psychosocial profiles (perceived social support, heightened vigilance), and (d) able to predict adult cardiovascular risk (blood pressure) either alone or in conjunction with a measure of early-life socioeconomic status. Method: Two studies were conducted to examine reliability and validity of the affect attribution paradigm (Study 1, N = 94) and associated adult psychosocial outcomes and cardiovascular risk (Study 2, N = 122). Results: Responses on the affect attribution paradigm showed significant correlations over a 6-month period, and were moderately associated with self-reports of childhood family environments. Greater attributed negative affect about early-life family conditions predicted lower levels of current perceived social support and heightened vigilance in adulthood. Attributed negative affect also interacted with early-life socioeconomic status (SES) to marginally predict resting systolic blood pressure (SBP), such that those individuals high in early-life SES but who had implicit negative affect attributed to early-life family conditions had SBP levels that were as high as individuals low in early-life SES. Conclusion: Implicit measures of early-life family conditions are a useful approach for assessing the psychosocial nature of early-life environments and linking them to adult psychosocial and physiological health profiles.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse the five steps of the evidence-based practice (EBP) model and argue that this model has serious limitations, both theoretical and practical. We argue that the relationship between evidence and practice cannot be that of supplying a basis, at least not if that notion is understood in any strict logical or methodological sense. Other factors have to be taken account of in addition to evidence and their relation to the evidence has to be explained. Following others, we advocate a more comprehensive view of practice as informed by evidence and theory. Evidence-informed practice (EIP) should be understood as excluding non-scientific prejudices and superstitions, but also as leaving ample room for clinical experience as well as the constructive and imaginative judgements of practitioners and clients who are in constant interaction and dialogue with one another. Under the EIP model, there is no need for the five-steps procedure of the EBP model, but only that practitioners will become knowledgeable of a wide rang of sources-empirical studies, case studies and clinical insights-and use them in creative ways throughout the intervention process.

AB  - Three studies demonstrated that a salient multicultural ideology increases hostile treatment of threatening outgroup interaction partners. The effect of multiculturalism on hostile behavior was evident regardless of whether threat was operationalized in terms of disagreement with an outgroup partner on important social issues (Studies 1 and 3) or rejection by the partner (Study 2). Moreover, the results clearly point to the learning orientation fostered by multiculturalism-as opposed to other factors such as enhanced other-focus, group-level attributions, or focus on differences-as the critical mediator of its effect on hostile behavior under threat. Thus, it appears that multiculturalism enhances the expression of hostility because it prompts individuals to really engage with and attach meaning and importance to threatening behaviors exhibited by outgroup members. The effects of multiculturalism were distinct from those of anti-racism and color-blindness, which set in motion processes that in many respects are directly opposite to those instantiated by multiculturalism. The findings highlight that the behavioral implications of multiculturalism may be quite different in conflictual interactions than they have previously been demonstrated to be in less threatening exchanges.

AB  - Our experience and prejudice concerning food play an important role in modulating gustatory information processing; gustatory memory stored in the central nervous system influences gustatory information arising from the peripheral nervous system. We have elucidated the mechanism of the 'top-down" modulation of taste perception in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and demonstrated that gustatory imagery is mediated by the prefrontal (PFC) and insular cortices (IC). However, the temporal order of activation of these brain regions during gustatory imagery is still an open issue. To explore the source of "top-down" signals during gustatory imagery tasks, we analyzed the temporal activation patterns of activated regions in the cerebral cortex using another non-invasive brain imaging technique, magnetoencephalography (MEG). Gustatory imagery tasks were presented by words (Letter G-V) or pictures (Picture G-V) of foods/beverages, and participants were requested to recall their taste. In the Letter G-V session, 7/9 (77.8%) participants showed activation in the IC with a latency of 401.7 +/- 34.7 ms (n = 7) from the onset of word exhibition. In 5/7 (71.4%) participants who exhibited IC activation, the PFC was activated prior to the IC at a latency of 315.2 +/- 56.5 ms (n = 5), which was significantly shorter than the latency to the IC activation. In the Picture G-V session, the IC was activated in 6/9 (66.7%) participants, and only 1/9 (11.1%) participants showed activation in the PFC. There was no significant dominance between the right and left IC or PFC during gustatory imagery. These results support those from our previous fMRI study in that the Letter G-V session rather than the Picture G-V session effectively activates the PFC and IC and strengthen the hypothesis that the PFC mediates "top-down" control of retrieving gustatory information from the storage of long-term memories and in turn activates the IC.

AB  - In this article, we consider how the factors driving Anglo attitudes toward immigration changed in the post-9/11 era. We argue that in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the immigration issue became nationalized, framed in a threat context. In this context, acculturation fear and anti-Latino sentiment are strong predictors of restrictionist sentiment; in the pre-9/11 period, these factors have little substantive impact on Anglo attitudes. We theorize that the current climate has helped "activate" social identities, which in turn has deleterious consequences for the Latinos in the United States. Using data from the 2000 and 2004 National Election Studies, we estimate a model of Anglo immigration attitudes. We show indicators of acculturation fear, anti-Latino sentiment, and media exposure significantly relate to Anglo immigration attitudes in the post-9/11 period but not the pre-9/11 period.

AB  - In repetitive tasks, latencies typically display non-random variation called 1/f noise, but the magnitude of 1/f noise can depend on effort. Between-participant variation in 1/f noise might therefore predict differences in performance for tasks that are sensitive to effort. Feedback was manipulated to suggest that participants had (or had not) shown bias on a preliminary task. Participants then completed a computer-based measure of prejudice. Consistent with an ironic process account, participants who were falsely informed that they had shown bias ultimately did show increased prejudice. But ironic processes should depend on control-related effort. Taking 1/f noise as a proxy for effort, results show that the effect of the feedback was moderated by 1/f noise. Participants demonstrating a low-effort 1/f pattern were unaffected by the manipulation (eta(2)(p)<.01), whereas those demonstrating a high-effort 1/f pattern showed larger effects (eta(2)(p) = .19). Results thus suggest that 1/f noise can provide novel explanatory power regarding behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within social psychology, studies of the nation have typically been understood in terms of national identity. Criticisms have been made of the tendency to conflate 'being' a member of a national category with psychological attachment to the group and its members. Furthermore, ethnomethodologically informed approaches have argued that little has been said about when and how social actors frame matters as one of national identity. Taking the example of national football support, this study considers the circumstances under which football may be cast as a matter of national identity, and when such ascriptions are resisted. Interviews were conducted with participants born and resident in England and Scotland, whereas in Scotland national football support is treated as a matter of national identity for Scottish and English people, in England it is separated from a collective sense of English identity. Adopting a discursive analytic stance, this study examines the internal and external attribution of national stereotypes and considers their role in managing issues of social causality, justification of in-group behaviour, and the differentiation of national groups.

AB  - Objective
   The objective of this article is to examine the trend in attitudes toward gay marriage through the analysis of data from the General Social Survey.
   Methods
   Using linear decomposition techniques, I explain the change in attitudes toward gay marriage from 1988 to 2006.
   Results
   Attitudes significantly liberalized over time; 71 percent opposed gay marriage in 1988, but by 2006, this figure dropped to 52 percent. Approximately two-thirds of this change was due to an intracohort change effect, or individuals' modifying their views over time, and one-third was due to a cohort succession effect, or later cohorts replacing earlier ones. This pattern was replicated across many subgroups of the U.S. public, including age, sex, residential, educational, and religious groups.
   Conclusion
   The results suggest that the use of the "equality/tolerance" framing of gay marriage by its supporters and other societal events or "moments" may have convinced some people who used to disapprove of gay marriage in 1988 to approve of it by 2006.

AB  - In the present article we re-examine one of the most deeply entrenched assumptions in modern attitude research, namely, that implicit social cognition is a product of associations between mental representations. More precisely, we argue that the analysis of implicit social cognition in psychology is curtailed by the widespread adoption of the associative assumption. We open with a brief overview of the attitude literature, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental structure, measurement, and conceptual differences that have emerged between implicit and explicit attitudes in recent times. Thereafter we address the influence of the associative assumption in shaping our methodologies, research questions, and theories regarding implicit and explicit attitudes. In the third and final section, we offer two alternative and perhaps complementary nonassociative models for understanding implicit cognition. While the first model situates its explanation at the mental (propositional) level of analysis and the second at the functional, each potentially allows for novel theoretical and empirical predictions and insight into attitudes above and beyond the boundaries of traditional associationism.

AB  - Although some have heralded recent political and cultural developments as signaling the arrival of a postracial era in America, several legal and social controversies regarding "reverse racism" highlight Whites' increasing concern about anti-White bias. We show that this emerging belief reflects Whites' view of racism as a zero-sum game, such that decreases in perceived bias against Blacks over the past six decades are associated with increases in perceived bias against Whites-a relationship not observed in Blacks' perceptions. Moreover, these changes in Whites' conceptions of racism are extreme enough that Whites have now come to view anti-White bias as a bigger societal problem than anti-Black bias.

AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed.

AB  - The theory of essentialism suggests that biological explanations of stigmatized behavior may not be effective at decreasing stigmatizing attitudes. The effects of biological explanations on stigmatizing attitudes were the topic of two experiments. In the first experiment, participants (N = 243) perceived a biological explanation as a less effective in relation to dangerousness and social distancing attitudes about mental illness than about homosexuality. The second experiment (N = 113) compared the effect of biological and free choice explanations on stigmatizing attitudes about abnormal sexual and eating behaviors. The results indicated that a biological explanation increased belief in essentialism and was most effective for attitudes related to anger and blame. These results suggest that the effectiveness of biological explanations as an antistigma tool varies according to the attitude and stigmatized group.

TI  - Home: The place the older adult can not imagine living without
T2  - BMC GERIATRICS
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Rapidly aging populations with an increased desire to remain at home and changes in health policy that promote the transfer of health care from formal places, as hospitals and institutions, to the more informal setting of one's home support the need for further research that is designed specifically to understand the experience of home among older adults. Yet, little is known among health care providers about the older adult's experience of home. The aim of this study was to understand the experience of home as experienced by older adults living in a rural community in Sweden.
   Methods: Hermeneutical interpretation, as developed by von Post and Eriksson and based on Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, was used to interpret interviews with six older adults. The interpretation included a self examination of the researcher's experiences and prejudices and proceeded through several readings which integrated the text with the reader, allowed new questions to emerge, fused the horizons, summarized main and sub-themes and allowed a new understanding to emerge.
   Results: Two main and six sub-themes emerged. Home was experienced as the place the older adult could not imagine living without but also as the place one might be forced to leave. The older adult's thoughts vacillated between the well known present and all its comforts and the unknown future with all its questions and fears, including the underlying threat of loosing one's home.
   Conclusions: Home has become so integral to life itself and such an intimate part of the older adult's being that when older adults lose their home, they also loose the place closest to their heart, the place where they are at home and can maintain their identity, integrity and way of living. Additional effort needs to be made to understand the older adult's experience of home within home health care in order to minimize intrusion and maximize care. There is a need to more fully explore the older adult's experience with health care providers in the home and its impact on the older adult's sense of "being at home" and their health and overall well-being.

In New Zealand (NZ), changes in immigration policy have seen a rapid increase in diverse groups of migrants with varied cultural backgrounds entering the country in the past two decades. Given its unique colonial history and 'settler nationality in a bicultural nation' (Bell, 2009), we explored how young NZ adults talk about and produce meanings and understandings of immigration, immigrants and cultural diversity. Appealing to notions of NZ as 'one society', as English speaking, and as English looking participants constructed NZ, NZ national identity and the NZ economy in particular ways. This constituted a nationalist rhetoric that was taken up in common-sense ways by participants to legitimize racist talk whilst simultaneously acting to locate participants themselves as reasonable and moral individuals. It is concluded that nationalist discourses function to reinforce patterns of social dominance and perpetuate the notion of New Zealanders as largely white, European-looking and English-speaking.

AB  - The study examined the ability of implicit responses to predict dental flossing behavior. It was hypothesized that adding implicit responses would increase the predictive power of models containing variables suggested by social cognitive theories. To test the hypothesis, 125 participants completed measures of social cognitive variables (e.g., self-efficacy, task-efficacy, planning intention, behavior intention) and performed a procedure designed to measure their implicit responses to flossing. Flossing behavior was measured with retrospective self-reports and a follow-up measure of flossing. As predicted, the addition of implicit responses to models containing the social cognitive variables increased the predictive power of the models for both the self-report and follow-up measures.

AB  - Evangelios Zappa, a Greek from Epirus, came to Wallachia, where he died in 1865 after amassing an impressive fortune. In his will, he entrusted the usufruct of his fortune to his cousin, Constantine Zappa, who was also the executor of Evangelios's will. At Constantine's death, the Olympia Commission in Athens was to become the sole heir. When the succession was opened, the fortune was claimed by Romania, Greece and, last but not least, by Evangelios's heirs.
   In this study we analyze the articles published in the central Liberal newspapers Vointa Nationala and Lupta concerning the Zappa issue; we also pay attention to the opinions expressed in these newspapers regarding the legacy. The Liberals were against the government's decision not to claim Zappa's fortune, in case his natural heirs proved to be legitimate. Given its attitude, the Conservative Party was accused that it had caused prejudice to the state. This is why the Liberals proposed their own solution to the case: the application of article 7 of the Constitution, which prevented foreigners from owning real estate on the Romanian territory. Another reproach Liberals made to the Conservative Party was the government's uninspired action regarding the Zappa issue, and the fact that the national interests in this matter had been ignored.

AB  - Substantial research has focused on stigmatized groups who are widely protected from discrimination under national legislation. In the current article, however, we focus our attention on those stigmatized groups who are relatively early in their quest for civil rights. In particular, we consider gay and lesbian individuals, and heavy individuals, for whom existing research is considerable enough to allow for a review. We summarize the discrimination these individuals face on a daily basis and how this discrimination, on some level, is socially supported. One way to reduce this discrimination is to enact legislation. We discuss the importance of such legislation and provide preliminary empirical evidence showing that such laws can serve as a symbolic and instrumental mechanism for remediating formal and interpersonal discrimination.

AB  - Objective
   In the wake of Turkey's EU candidacy and the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Turkey's Kurdish question has drawn international attention. Due to previous data limitations, ours is the first article to analyze what explains anti-Kurdish beliefs in Turkey using nationally representative survey data.
   Methods
   Through descriptive analyses and partial proportional odds models of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (2002), we examine the extent and sources of these beliefs.
   Results
   We find high levels of anti-Kurdish beliefs in Turkey, but little evidence of group competition/material interests shaping these beliefs; rather, nationalism, secularism, and, somewhat surprisingly, favorable evaluations of globalization better explain anti-Kurdish beliefs.
   Conclusion
   Although broad processes of social-dominance orientation and authoritarianism may be factors working in the background, anti-Kurdish beliefs are better explained by the peculiar case of modernization in Turkey and these anti-Kurdish beliefs may be different from negative beliefs about other minorities.

AB  - Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) has been conceptualized and measured as a unidimensional personality construct comprising the covariation of the three traits of authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. However, new approaches have criticized this conceptualization and instead viewed these three "traits" as three distinct, though related, social attitude dimensions. Here we extend this approach providing clear definitions of these three dimensions as ideological attitude constructs of Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and Traditionalism. These dimensions are seen as attitudinal expressions of basic social values or motivational goals that represent different, though related, strategies for attaining collective security at the expense of individual autonomy. We report data from five samples and three different countries showing that these three dimensions could be reliably measured and were factorially distinct. The three dimensions also differentially predicted interpersonal behaviour, social policy support, and political party support. It is argued that conceptualizing and measuring RWA as a set of three related ideological attitude dimensions may better explain complex sociopolitical phenomena than the currently dominant unidimensional personality based model.

AB  - This article presents results on nursing and midwife students' willingness to care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). An international cross-sectional survey design was used and the data were collected from educational institutions in Finland (N = 169), Estonia (N = 132) and Lithuania (N = 170) between autumn 2005 and spring 2006. Participants (N = 471) were nursing and midwife students training to be RN, public health nurses or midwives. A modified version of a scale developed by Duppert et al. (1994) was applied to measure willingness to care for patients with HIV/AIDS. The study found a general willingness on the part of students to provide care for patients with HIV/AIDS. However, nursing and midwife students willingness varied between countries and was also related to specific nursing interventions. Factors associated with students willingness also varied within each country, depending on nurses' age, nursing experience (Finland), positive attitudes to treating patients with HIV/AIDS in general (Finland, Estonia), and previous experience in taking care of a patient with HIV/AIDS (Lithuania). It is important to develop strategies for nursing vulnerable patient populations and international nursing curricula to identify prejudicial thinking and intolerance towards patients with HIV/AIDS.

AB  - Conservatives tend to make dispositional whereas liberals make situational attributions for social problems and alleged misconduct (the "ideo-attribution effect"). Three studies demonstrated a reversal of the ideo-attribution effect. Conservatives made stronger situational attributions than liberals for the behavior of Marines accused of killing Iraqi civilians (Studies 1 and 2) and police officers accused of wrongly killing a cougar running loose in a Chicago neighborhood (Study 3). Reversals of the ideo-attribution effect occurred because conservative values were more consistent with excusing the Marines' and police officers' behavior, whereas liberal values were more consistent with blaming the Marines and police officers. These results suggest that the ideo-attribution effect-and attributions more generally-are shaped by whether people's attributional conclusions are consistent or inconsistent with their salient values.

AB  - The present study examined whether student evaluations of college teaching (SETs) reflected a bias predicated on the perceived race and gender of the instructor. Using anonymous, peer-generated evaluations of teaching obtained from RateMyProfessors.com, the present study examined SETs from 3,079 White; 142 Black; 238 Asian; 130 Latino; and 128 Other race faculty at the 25 highest ranked liberal arts colleges. Results showed that racial minority faculty, particularly Blacks and Asians, were evaluated more negatively than White faculty in terms of overall quality, helpfulness, and clarity, but were rated higher on easiness. A two-stage cluster analysis demonstrated that the very best instructors were likely to be White, whereas the very worst were more likely to be Black or Asian. Few effects of gender were observed, but several interactions emerged showing that Black male faculty were rated more negatively than other faculty. The results of the present study are consistent with the negative racial stereotypes of racial minorities and have implications for the tenure and promotion of racial minority faculty.

AB  - Nondiscrimination policies are intended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of specified characteristics. It is also argued that they send a message to minority groups that they are protected and welcomed within that jurisdiction. This study tested the latter supposition by exploring whether lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) residents of states and cities with nondiscrimination policies that included sexual orientation perceived a more positive and less negative environment and experienced less minority stress. An online survey of 2,511 LGB individuals confirmed that inclusive nondiscrimination policies are positively associated with perceptions of fewer negative messages and more positive messages in the environment, higher levels of disclosure of sexual identity and social support, and lower levels of internalized homophobia. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for policy, as well as the limitations of the data.

AB  - Two studies investigated the extent to which empathizing with a single member of a stigmatized group can yield positive attitudes toward other stigmatized groups. Participants read a scenario in which a member of a socially stigmatized group described the experiences of group membership. Participants then reported their attitudes toward the target group and a second group. Both studies revealed a generalization effect such that experiencing empathy for the target was associated with more positive attitudes, both toward the target group and the second group. Study 2 demonstrated that this generalization effect is confined to those groups located within the same superordinate category. Implications of these findings for attempts to structure people's orientation to stigmatized groups are discussed.

AB  - Psychological resilience refers to the human capacity to cope with distressing events such as abuse, disaster, and other stressful or traumatic circumstances. Previous investigations by using self-report questionnaires have focused exclusively on explicit aspects of psychological resilience. The present study investigated the relationship between implicit and explicit aspects of psychological resilience. We used a self-report questionnaire consisting of four types of psychological resilience scales as a measure of explicit aspects of psychological resilience. At the same time, we measured implicit aspects of psychological resilience by employing an implicit association test (IAT) that was designed to reveal participants' implicit associations between closely related people (family member, companion, and friend), and calm/anxiety attitudes. Our results showed that TAT scores exhibited significant interactions with questionnaire scores. We discuss potential links between explicit and implicit aspects of psychological resilience in terms of the availability of companion as environmental resources.

AB  - This article presents several covalent inhibitors, including examples of successful drugs, as well as highly selective, irreversible inhibitors of emerging therapeutic targets, such as fatty acid amide hydolase. Covalent inhibitors have many desirable features, including increased biochemical efficiency of target disruption, less sensitivity toward pharmacokinetic parameters and increased duration of action that outlasts the pharmacokinetics of the compound. Safety concerns that must be mitigated include lack of specificity and the potential immunogenicity of protein-inhibitor adduct(s). Particular attention will be given to recent technologies, such as activity-based protein profiling, which allow one to define the proteome-wide selectivity patterns for covalent inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. For instance, any covalent inhibitor can, in principle, be modified with a 'clickable' tag to generate an activity probe that is almost indistinguishable from the original agent. These probes can be applied to any living system across a broad dose range to fully inventory their on and off targets. The substantial number of drugs on the market today that act by a covalent mechanism belies historical prejudices against the development of irreversibly acting therapeutic small molecules. Emerging proteomic technologies offer a means to systematically discriminate safe (selective) versus deleterious (nonselective) covalent inhibitors and thus should inspire their future design and development.

AB  - Information on the institutional arrangements of citizenship is increasingly available. However, we currently have only limited knowledge on the contours of public opinion towards citizenship. We seek to remedy this neglect by documenting patterns of support toward the most dominant citizenship principles: jus soli, jus sanguinis, and jus domicile. Specifically, we combine responses to questions on these principles to create a single measure of opinion toward citizenship law that encompasses three dominant citizenship approaches: assimilationist, exclusionary, and pluralist. Using data from the 2003 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) module on National Identity, we examine cross-national differences in support for the three approaches. Our results indicate that only two regime-types can clearly be identified - a pluralist regime, which centers on the importance of jus soli and includes traditional settler societies and Sweden, and an assimilationist regime, which is typified by its acceptance of jus domicile and includes the post-colonial empires of France and Britain. On the individual level, our analysis highlights the importance of perceptions of threat, either economically or culturally, in shaping public opinion toward citizenship. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The authors tested the effectiveness of implementation intentions as a strategy for limiting the behavioral expression of implicit stereotypes. Implementation intentions are if-then plans that link an intended response to an anticipated situational cue, thereby enabling a reflexive form of control. The authors examined whether two different types of implementation intentions could improve response accuracy on the Shooter Task, a reaction time measure of implicit stereotyping. In Study 1, participants used a distraction-inhibiting implementation intention designed to engage control over the perception of goal-irrelevant stimuli (e.g., race). In Study 2, participants used a response-facilitating implementation intention designed to promote goal-directed action. Across studies, implementation intentions improved accuracy, thereby limiting the behavioral expression of implicit stereotypes. Furthermore, process dissociation analyses indicated that the distraction-inhibiting implementation intention increased controlled processing while reducing automatic stereotype activation, whereas the response-facilitating implementation intention increased only controlled processing. Implications for goal strategy approaches to reducing prejudice are discussed.

AB  - In light of rapid demographic shifts and legal challenges to affirmative action in the United States, the issue of diversity on college campuses is of increasing importance. Most synthesis of research on diversity interactions and educational outcomes have focused on attitude change, such as reductions in prejudice or racial bias. Despite the presence of numerous studies on college diversity experiences and cognitive development, no research has systematically reviewed the literature on this topic. The current study uses meta-analysis to examine this relationship systematically. The findings suggest that several types of diversity experiences are positively related several cognitive outcomes, but the magnitude of the effect varies substantially depending on the type of diversity experience, the type of cognitive outcome, and the study design. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Previous research on political orientations, which can be understood as one's left- versus right-wing attitude, has shown that some personality factors yield explanatory power. In the current work, we consider the role of altruism - a personality construct which does not exclusively map onto one of the broad personality dimensions typically studied. Altruism was predicted to relate to left-wing attitudes due to an overlap regarding concerns for social equality, and a discrepancy between well-known attributes of right-wingers and altruistic individuals, respectively. Moreover, altruism was expected to explain unique variance in political orientation beyond the 'Big Six' broad dimensions as it relates to aspects not covered by the latter. Both hypotheses were tested in a web-based questionnaire study (N = 137). Besides replicating findings of previous research, results corroborated a strong positive association between altruism and left-wing attitudes, and altruism was found to account for substantial variance in political orientation after controlling for the HEXACO factors of personality. We conclude that altruism is an important construct which deserves attention whenever political attitudes or other topics relating to social equality are at stake. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Attitudes toward homosexuality are complex. To get a comprehensive view on the attitudes of people, different dimensions need to be included in research. Based on a review of the literature, we distinguish five dimensions: acceptance of homosexuality in a general sense; attitude toward equal rights; reactions to homosexuality oat close quarterso; reactions to homosexuality in public; and so-called modern homonegativity. In a study on a representative sample of Dutch Defence personnel (N = 1,607) we tested this model. Structural equation modeling of several items measuring the attitude toward homosexuality offers a six factor solution. These six factors are more or less comparable to the five dimensions we distinguished. The dimension oreactions to homosexuality at close quarterso is, however, empirically split in a dimension on affective reactions to homosexuality and homosexual persons in general and a dimension on affective reaction to homosexual friends or acquaintances.

AB  - The concept of ideological configuration is proposed to refer to a complex of ideological attitudes - Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) - based on a shared core of derogation of outgroups. This concept is used in two surveys, in Chile and in Germany, to predict attitudes toward foreigners. Analyses using structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that a second-order factor involving RWA and SDO predicts hostility toward foreigners in Germany and affection toward Peruvian and Argentinean immigrants in Chile. This prediction was stronger in Germany than in Chile. The difference in strength is discussed in terms of the kind of measurements, different contexts of migration, and characteristics of the immigrants. Further research using the concept of ideological configuration is proposed.

AB  - In situations that are ambiguous with regard to the presence of discrimination, how do people arrive at their conclusions that discrimination has (or has not) taken place? This question was examined from a motivated social cognition perspective via the interaction of two factors: the prototype effect-the notion that ambiguously discriminatory behavior is more likely to be perceived as discriminatory when the executor is prototypical and the need for cognitive closure-the tendency to jump hastily to and seize on an answer. Results provided replicating evidence of the prototype effect among European American participants but not among African American participants. Specifically, European Americans were likely to perceive ambiguously racist behavior enacted by a prototypical executor (i.e., a White person) as more discriminatory than the same behavior exhibited by a non-prototypical executor (i.e., a Black person). African American participants, on the other hand, showed no reliance on this simple cognitive heuristic. Furthermore, results showed that European Americans with a higher need for cognitive closure were more likely to rely on the easy-to-use information offered by prototypes. These findings are discussed from a motivated social cognition perspective.

AB  - Differences among people in the actions they take or the opinions they express do not always reflect differences in underlying attitudes, preferences, or motivations. When people differ in the extent to which they are psychologically licensed (i.e., feet able to act without discrediting themselves), they will act differently despite having similar attitudes, preferences, and motivations. Wanting to do something is not sufficient to spur action; one must also feel licensed to do it. We show that feeling licensed can liberate people to express morally problematic attitudes that those who do not feel licensed are inhibited from expressing. We also show that feeling one lacks license can inhibit people from expressing even morally nonproblematic attitudes that those who feel licensed are comfortable expressing. This chapter explores a wide range of social phenomena in which licensing plays a role and identifies a number of variables that grant or revoke psychological license.

AB  - The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) is used in many areas of psychological science based on the assumption that it not only taps into attitudes and biases but does so without a person's awareness. Across eight preregistered studies (N = 1603) plus meta-analyses, we reexamined the 'implicitness' of AMP effects, and in particular, the idea that people are unaware of the prime's influence on their evaluations. Results indicated that AMP effects and their predictive validity are primarily moderated by a subset of influence-aware trials (within individuals), and high rates of influence awareness (between individuals). Interestingly, an individual's influence-awareness rate on one AMP predicted how they performed on an earlier AMP, even when the two assessed different attitude domains. Taken together, our results suggest that AMP effects are not implicit in the way that has been claimed, a finding that has implications for the procedure, past findings, and theory.

AB  - In 2019, the HBO limited television series Watchmen aired to critical acclaim. A contemporary extension of the world established by the 1986-87 Watchmen comic, viewers and commentators alike have viewed the show as a critical commentary on racial politics in the United States. Using Nexis Uni's News Database, we conducted an inductive qualitative content analysis of 31 news articles written by mainstream television critics and/or writers about the show. Across reviews, three primary themes emerged-White supremacy, revisionist history (specifically pertaining to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921), and the power of masks. The role of critics/writers in engaging audiences with themes about race is discussed.

AB  - Female faculty earn 81.4% of what male faculty earn. Salary negotiation is a critical component of job offers and can have lasting implications for pay during a career. To better understand the salary negotiation process for female sport management professors, this study examined perceived barriers held by participants. A qualitative approach was taken, utilizing in-person and phone interviews to collect the participant's experiences with salary negotiation. Results indicated that female sport management professors perceived the main barrier in salary negotiation to be the expected adherence to gender roles. Subthemes that emerged from the expected adherence to gender roles included believing stereotypes and lacking confidence. Understanding the influence of gender role adherence in salary negotiations can contribute to the education and skills necessary for students as well as professors in implementing pedagogical strategies related to salary negotiation. Implementing these strategies can contribute to a field that continues to strive to embrace diversity and promote an inclusive environment.

AB  - Recognition of the causes and consequences of systemic racism, particularly related to the criminal justice system, has increased in recent years, in part because of the Black Lives Matter movement. Awareness of racism and how it intersects with the justice system is a first step to addressing it; thus, it is critical to understand the sentiment of justice employees regarding systemic racism. This content analysis assessed the sentiment of 632 judges who responded to The National Judicial College's Question of the Month. Approximately 65% believed that systemic racism exists in the criminal justice system. Assessment of open-ended responses revealed many themes. Some judges pointed toward disparate treatment, while others denied racism exists. Some claimed that racism occurs but is not systemic. Many said that disparities are not a result of racism, but a result of SES, education, etc. Judges specified training and reforms (e.g., bail) that are needed. Suggested solutions included increasing accountability for police, prosecutors, and judges who display discriminatory behavior. These solutions indicated that judges are amenable to training and other reforms; such policy shifts should be pursued.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: The stereotype content model is a unifying theory of the makeup of stereotypes and their consequences on emotions and behaviors. There is a need to study this theory from the perspectives of those most affected by them-targets of stereotypes. Research Method/Design: Blind adults (n = 264) living in the United States completed the stereotype content measure asking participants to rate the extent to which they believed members of wider society held certain beliefs about Blind persons. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses showed good fit for the four-factor model of stereotype content: warmth, competence, status, and competition. Conclusions: This study confirms the stereotype content model and begins to extend the stereotype content model to be inclusive of the perspectives of those who are the targets of stereotypes.
   Impact and Implications Understanding the content of stereotypes has significant implications for promoting marginalized populations in education, employment, and health. This research is the first to confirm the Stereotype Content Model from the perspectives of Blind Americans. By doing so, this study extends the model to include the perspectives of those who are targets of stereotypes.

AB  - The Olympic Games, the biggest international event, with participants that exceed the number of United Nations' member states, were initiated as a peace education platform for embracing internationalism, global solidarity, and humanity. The Olympic idea, however, throughout history, was used as a vehicle for militarism, inter-group hatred, propaganda, and supremacy (Lyras, 2020). Despite this paradox, Sport, enriched with the humanistic intentionality of the Olympic idea, combined with established peace and conflict theory, can serve as a peace and democracy platform. The first condition necessary to achieve such objectives is to engage peace psychology researchers and practitioners in evidence-based programs and initiatives that foster internationalism and collective change. In other words, moving away from reduction-ism and individualism, an alarming trend of contemporary psychology (Moghadam, 2021) and Sport and Olympic Studies mainstream. The aim of this article is to highlight the robust connections and prospects between Sport and Olympism with peace research and practice.

AB  - The stigmatization of people with pedophilic sexual interests is a topic of growing academic and professional consideration, owing to its potential role in moderating pedophiles' emotional well-being, and motivation and engagement in child abuse prevention schemes. Thus, improving attitudes and reducing stigmatization toward this group is of paramount importance. Prior research has suggested that narrative humanization-presenting personal stories of self-identified non-offending pedophiles-could be one route to doing this. However, this work has only been conducted with students or trainee psychotherapists, meaning the public generalizability of this method is still unknown. In this study, we compared two stigma interventions to test whether narratives reduce stigma toward people with pedophilic interests more effectively than an informative alternative (scientific information about pedophilia). Using a longitudinal experimental design with a lack of non-intervention control (initial N = 950; final N = 539), we found that narratives had consistently positive effects on all measured aspects of stigmatization (dangerousness, intentionality), whereas an informative alternative had mixed results, and actually increased perceptions of pedophiles' levels of deviance. These effects were still present four months after the initial presentation. We discuss these data in relation to ongoing debates about treating pedophilia as a public health issue requiring a broad societal approach to well-being and child abuse prevention.

AB  - This study investigated the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-Stigma (AAQ-S-K) in people with diabetes. A total of 208 patients with diabetes participated in the study. After performing forward and backward translation of the original version of the AAQ-S into Korean, its validity (construct and concurrent validity) and reliability were assessed. Construct validity measured using confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit. Concurrent validity was confirmed through the significant correlation between the AAQ-S-K, acceptance and action, diabetes self-stigma and diabetes distress. The AAQ-S-K was positively correlated with acceptance and action and had a negative correlation with diabetes self-stigma and diabetes distress. The reliability of the AAQ-S-K ranged from 0.82 to 0.88. The AAQ-S-K can be applied to assess stigma acceptance and action in Korean patients with diabetes and to compare the level of psychological flexibility of patients with diabetes internationally.

AB  - Stereotyping is defined as generalising an attribute to a whole group and overlooking individual differences. In this study, we investigated whether Iranians' stereotypes of nations affected their empathy for the citizens of those nations. First, in a pilot study we explored common national stereotypes by using the stereotype content model (SCM) based on which six countries with different perceived warmth and competence scores were selected as nationalities of the protagonists of the vignettes in our experiment. In the next phase, 21 participants were asked to rate the degree of sadness associated with each vignette in an fMRI scanner. The results showed no significant differences in brain activity while participants were exposed to scenarios in which negative events befell people from different nations. This may be due to the individuation of victims by providing personal information about them.

AB  - The most striking element in the delimitation of collective dismissal is the establishment of a numerical-percentage threshold from which an essentially individual act, such as dismissal, is transformed, for procedural purposes, into another act of collective significance. This quantitative component becomes qualitative when the focus of attention is established in the literal reference to "habitually employed workers". Here, the first of the elements of interest for the study appears, given by the notion of worker. Next to this, the personal nature of this component is translated into two other unavoidable references, such as the habitual nature of the service and the causes not inherent to the worker's person.

AB  - Scholars continue to wrestle with determining the extent and ways in which religiosity - and particularly more strict religious views and practices - provides fertile ground for the emergence and growth of terrorism. Using large samples of Muslim respondents from across the Indonesian archipelago, we find that: (1) higher levels of orthodox religiosity are associated with more negative attitudes to non-Muslims, and (2) higher levels of orthodox religiosity are associated with lower support for terrorist groups. We propose that this finding is consistent with the type of orthodox religiosity of Indonesian santri - that is, observant Muslims - which is usually characterised by collective religious practices, affiliation with religious mass organisations and religious education. In the Indonesian context, orthodox religiosity might provide vehicles but not motives of terrorist mobilisation, and - although it can foster negative views of out-groups - it can actually constitute a barrier to broader support for terrorism.

AB  - Background Ageist and helping attitudes among undergraduate homecare students are a concern for educators, healthcare professionals and home care workers due to their potential to increase the marginalisation of older people and negatively impact quality of care.
   Objectives The current study evaluated the effect of extended contact with community-dwelling older adults on the ageist and helping attitudes of home care students.
   Methods Fifty-five students attending a public university in Turkey were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 27) or control group (n = 28). The intervention group received positive theoretical education and had extended contact with community-dwelling older adults, while the control group only received positive theoretical education. Before and after the intervention, the students' ageist attitudes were evaluated with Kogan's Attitudes towards Old People scale (KAOP) and helping attitudes were evaluated with the Helping Attitude Scale (HAS).
   Results There were statistically significant differences between pre- and post-test mean KAOP total, positive ageism and negative ageism subscale scores in the intervention group (p < 0.05) and in KAOP negative ageism score in the control group (p < 0.05). HAS scores showed no significant post-intervention change in helping attitudes in either group.
   Conclusion Extended contact with community-dwelling older adults had a favourable influence on undergraduate health students' ageism attitudes. These results suggest that contact with older adults may be an effective strategy to reduce ageism but may not increase helping behaviours.
   Implications for practice Positive contact experiences with community-dwelling older adults can be used to reduce ageism in home care students.

AB  - The aim of the present research was to test whether involvement in a 14-days training program in the performing arts could reduce implicit biases. We asked healthy participants to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess biased attitudes to physical illness in two separate sessions, before and after the training program. Two separate control groups matched by age, gender and educational level completed the two IAT sessions, separated by same number of days, without being involved in the training program. Results showed that participants who were involved in the training program reduced their implicit bias toward illness measured through IAT in the second session. This reduction in IAT measures was not observed in the control samples, despite the two IAT measures being matched in temporal delay with the experimental group. These findings suggest that an interventional program based on the performing arts could be effective in reducing levels of implicit biases among the general population.

AB  - Objectives: This study addresses a need for quantitative research examining factors supporting the frequent use of homophobic language (e.g., fag) in male team sports which has a range of negative health impacts on gay and bisexual males. Intervention methods are needed to stop this behaviour, but little is known about why this language remains common.
   Design: Cross-Sectional survey.
   Method: Male Rugby Union (n = 97; ages 16-18 years) and Ice Hockey players (n = 146; ages 16 - 31 years) self-reported their use of homophobic language and completed measures of homophobic attitudes and descriptive and injunctive norms related to language use on their team. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined factors associated with this behaviour.
   Results: Over half of participants (53.8%) self-reported using homophobic language at least once in the previous two weeks. No relationship was found between homophobic attitudes and language use. In contrast, norm measures had a strong, positive relationship with this behaviour. In multivariate analyses, norms uniquely accounted for almost one-half of the variance in language use. The addition of descriptive norms into the full model led to the largest increase in R-2 of.340 (F(1,200) = 130.816, p<.001).
   Conclusions: Homophobic language use was related to norms, rather than homophobic attitudes. Interventions targeting changes to these norms could be an effective method to change this behaviour. This finding contributes to a growing body of evidence that norms are associated with a range of negative behaviours by male athletes. (C) 2020 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The authors describe two research experiments exploring the influence of race on the Kohler motivation gain effect with exercise tasks. Experiment 1 tested whether partner racial dissimilarity affects individual performance. Experiment 2 created a team identity recategorization intervention to potentially counter the influence on performance observed in Experiment 1. White male participants were partnered with either a Black or Asian partner (Experiment 1) or with a Black partner utilizing team names and shirt colors as a team identity recategorization strategy (Experiment 2). Racially dissimilar dyads completed two sets of abdominal plank exercises with a Kohler conjunctive task paradigm (stronger partner; team performance outcome dependent upon the weaker-ability participant's performance). The results of Experiment 1 suggest attenuation of the previously successful group motivation gain effect in the racially dissimilar condition. The simple recategorization strategy utilized in Experiment 2 appeared to reverse motivation losses under conjunctive-task conditions in racially dissimilar exercise dyads.

AB  - The present study strengthens the view that residues of drugs of abuse may become widespread surface water contaminants following a local music festival. Overall, 10 illicit drugs were detected from the aquatic environment after the festival; cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were present in the highest concentrations. The presence of illicit drugs and their metabolites over 3 monitored festival yr suggested that consumption of these drugs was temporally linked with events. Weather conditions seriously influenced detection of contaminants deriving from events at the lakeshore. Most of the illicit drugs retained their pharmacological activities, with a potentially adverse impact on wildlife. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-8. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, the decades-long, pan-continental globalization consensus was being questioned. In our view, the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which the globalization consensus is being defied. To better understand the implications of this defiance, we turn to research on people, organizations and international competition to see whether this defiance weakens the cohesion needed to keep globalization moving apace. People and organizations create cohesive forces that can link and constrain the differences that are encountered when people and organizations move across international borders. Meanwhile, the nature of international competition, particularly as connected to the level of active involvement by state actors, can lead to fractures that reduce cohesion across polities and societies.

AB  - Heavier bodies-particularly female bodies-are stigmatized. Such fat stigma is pervasive, painful to experience, and may even facilitate weight gain, thereby perpetuating the weight-stigma cycle. Leveraging research on functionally distinct forms of fat (deposited on different parts of the body), we propose that body shape plays an important but largely underappreciated role in fat stigma, above and beyond fat amount. Across three samples varying in participant ethnicity (White and Black Americans) and nation (United States, India), patterns of fat stigma reveal that, as hypothesized, participants differently stigmatized equally overweight or equally obese female targets as a function of target shape, sometimes even more strongly stigmatizing targets with less rather than more body mass. Such findings suggest value in updating our understanding of fat stigma to include body shape and in querying a predominating, but often implicit, theoretical assumption that people simply view all fat as 'bad' (and more fat as 'worse').

AB  - Aims:
   To develop a questionnaire to examine attitudes among employees and managers to include people with various health problems into their work group, and to test the questionnaire in one relevant population within the labour market.
   Methods:
   A questionnaire was developed through a process involving discussions in a scientific forum and pilot testing with group discussions. The final questionnaire, which was tested in a survey study of managers and employees in 33 Norwegian kindergartens (N=485), contained 10 short case stories followed by questions concerning workplace inclusion. The case stories described individuals with musculoskeletal and mental disorders, as well as individuals with potentially stigmatising behavioural history and lifestyle, and control cases. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the case stories. Cases with high risk ratios had an increased risk of not being included compared to a control case.
   Results:
   Attitudes for workplace inclusion varied between the different case stories. Cases portraying mental illness had the highest risk ratios, indicating that employees and managers are less likely to include people with mental illness than people with musculoskeletal illness. Furthermore, unspecific or chronic illness had higher risk ratios than specific and acute illness. The most important barriers also varied between case stories.
   Conclusions:
   The workplace inclusion questionnaire fulfills the need for a quantitative measure of attitudes to include individuals with various health problems into the workplace. Comparison of risk ratios showed clear differences between case stories, indicating that the workplace inclusion questionnaire is a valuable tool to measure the variance in workplace inclusion.

AB  - Assessing levels of anti-immigrant bias and moral reasoning in university students was the objective of this research.(2) The Defining Issues Test measurement of moral reasoning (Rest et al., 1999) and a new measure of anti-immigrant bias were translated into German, pilot tested in both the United States and Germany, and used to assess levels of anti-immigrant bias and moral reasoning. Findings showed no significant differences in bias levels against Muslim versus non-Muslim immigrants. There were statistically significant lower moral reasoning levels and higher bias levels found among foreign students studying at the universities in both countries. Regression analysis showed conservativism was statistically significantly positively related to bias, but humanitarian liberalism was significantly negatively related to bias. Formal education was significantly negatively related to bias. In the moral reasoning regression model, bias negatively predicted principled moral reasoning, religious orthodoxy negatively predicted principled moral reasoning and Muslim immigrant identity versus non-Muslim immigrant identity had no statistically significant predictability on principled moral reasoning or bias levels. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Bias toward individuals with overweight/obesity (OV/OB) exists among health professionals and trainees with the potential to affect the quality of healthcare interactions. Given most research is adult-focused, this study aimed to examine the influence of weight status on clinical judgments in a pediatric context. Sixteen virtual human scenes representing hypothetical medical encounters of pediatric patients and their mothers were presented to prehealth profession undergraduates (n = 92). Characteristics, or cues, of patient and mother weight status (healthy weight vs. obese) and dyad race (Caucasian vs. African American) were manipulated across scenes. Participants provided ratings for assessment questions, including perceived treatment adherence and responsibility for health, for each scene. Data were examined via idiographic (i.e., individual-level) analysis, which involved generation of separate multiple regressions per participant per assessment question to capture the influence of the cues on participants' ratings. Results represent secondary outcomes from another study published elsewhere. Current analyses revealed that 12%-22% of participants relied on cues of weight status when making assessments about patient and mother adherence and responsibility for health. The majority of these participants equated higher weight status with poorer anticipated treatment adherence and greater health responsibility. Results suggest that the weight status of pediatric patients and their mothers' plays a considerable role in prehealth profession undergraduates' clinical judgments, with the future potential to affect disparities in pediatric care. This study highlights the importance of considering child and maternal factors and utilizing a novel approach that may serve as a model for further investigation of this issue.

AB  - Mounting evidence reveals considerable racial inequities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in the United States (US). Area-level racial bias has been associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, but its association with COVID-19 is yet unexplored. Combining county-level data from Project Implicit on implicit and explicit anti-Black bias among non-Hispanic Whites, Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and The New York Times, we used adjusted linear regressions to estimate overall COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates through 01 July 2020, Black and White incidence rates through 28 May 2020, and Black-White incidence rate gaps on average area-level implicit and explicit racial bias. Across 2994 counties, the average COVID-19 mortality rate (standard deviation) was 1.7/10,000 people (3.3) and average cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate was 52.1/10,000 (77.2). Higher racial bias was associated with higher overall mortality rates (per 1 standard deviation higher implicit bias b = 0.65/10,000 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 0.91); explicit bias b = 0.49/10,000 (0.27, 0.70)) and higher overall incidence (implicit bias b = 8.42/10,000 (4.64, 12.20); explicit bias b = 8.83/10,000 (5.32, 12.35)). In 957 counties with race-specific data, higher racial bias predicted higher White and Black incidence rates, and larger Black-White incidence rate gaps. Anti-Black bias among Whites predicts worse COVID-19 outcomes and greater inequities. Area-level interventions may ameliorate health inequities.

AB  - Previous research on microaggressions has emphasized the frequency of and distress produced by microaggressions as reported by people of color. The current research supplements the existing literature by developing a self-report measure of White individuals' microaggressive likelihood against Black people, theCultural Cognitions and Actions Scale(CCAS). Study 1 developed the CCAS through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of responses to CCAS items from a sample of 978 non-Hispanic White undergraduate students. The final scale comprised four factors (Negative Attitudes,Colorblindness,Objectifying, andAvoidance) assessing microaggressive likelihood, and CCAS total and factor scores were significantly related to several other indicators of racism and bias. Study 2 involved 31 of the previous participants in a lab-based discussion of race-related issues with a confederate and provided initial support for the predictive validity of the measure. Overall, this report supports a growing literature that microaggressions are more than innocuous, harmless behaviors, unrelated to racism, and instead represent relevant processes within the science of racism and bias. It also provides a potential means of testing the effectiveness of interventions intended to reduce the commission of microaggressions.

AB  - Mental illness remains as one of the most stigmatizing conditions in contemporary western societies. This study sheds light on how mental health professionals and rehabilitants perceive stigmatization. The qualitative study is based on stimulated focus group interviews conducted in five Finnish mental health rehabilitation centers that follow the Clubhouse model. The findings were analyzed through inductive content analysis. Both the mental health rehabilitants and the professionals perceived stigmatization as a phenomenon that concerns the majority of rehabilitants. However, whereas the professionals viewed stigma as something that is inflicted upon the mentally ill from the outside, the rehabilitants perceived stigma as something that the mentally ill themselves can influence by advancing their own confidence, shame management, and recovery. Improvements in treatment, along with media coverage, were seen as the factors that reduce stigmatization, but the same conceptualization did not hold for serious mental illnesses. As the average Clubhouse client was thought to be a person with serious mental illness, the rehabilitation context designed to normalize attitudes toward mental health problems was paradoxically perceived to enforce the concept of inevitable stigma. Therefore, it is important for professionals in rehabilitation communities to be reflexively aware of these tensions when supporting the rehabilitants.

AB  - Indian Buddhist literary sources contain both systematic and casual rejections of, broadly speaking, the caste system and caste discrimination. However, they also provide ample evidence for, possibly subconscious, discriminatory attitudes toward outcastes, prototypically candalas. The rhetoric found in Indian Buddhist literature regarding candalas is examined in this paper.

AB  - Hostile sexism expresses derogation of women's competence and emphasizes that women will exploit men's relational dependence. Men who endorse hostile sexism perceive their female partners more negatively, but do these negative perceptions stem from motives for dominance or insecurities about dependence? We tested both perspectives by assessing bias in perceptions of partners' behaviors that challenge dominance (criticism, instruction, taking over) versus affirm partners are dependable (love, care, availability). Both members of 100 heterosexual couples reported how much they received and enacted these behaviors in (a) a lab-based discussion and (b) six monthly retrospective reports about an ongoing important goal. In both support contexts, men's hostile sexism was associated with underestimating dependability-relevant support, particularly when partners reported providing low support. This pattern did not emerge for dominance-relevant behaviors. These results indicate that men's hostile sexism involves insecurities about dependence, producing perceptions that female partners are less dependable than they actually are.

AB  - This article measures discrimination in the reality TV show Big Brother, a high-stakes environment. Data on contestants' nominations are taken from 35 series of the British version of the show, covering the years 2000-2016. Race and age discrimination are found, with contestants more likely to nominate those of a different race and those different in age from themselves. However, no discrimination is identified on the basis of gender, geographical region of origin, or level of education. Racial discrimination is driven by males, but females exhibit stronger age discrimination than males. Age discrimination is driven by the younger contestants discriminating against the older. Regional differences emerge, particularly between contestants from Greater London and those from the north of England; northerners have a stronger tendency to engage in racial and age discrimination, and to discriminate in favour of the opposite gender.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale, which measures 2 forms of ageism, namely benevolent and hostile ageism.
   Materials and Methods: Data were collected from 222 adults through an online survey. Participants completed Turkish versions of the 13-item Ambivalent Ageism Scale and the Implicit Association Test adapted for ageism. Construct validity was assessed through confirmatory factor analyses. Internal consistency and split-half consistency were also calculated. Criterion validity was assessed by correlating ambivalent ageism and its subscales with implicit ageism scores.
   Results: The results of confirmatory factor analysis of 12-items confirmed the original structure by exhibiting a good fit to the data (goodness of fit index = 0.93, p <.001, comparative fit index = 0.97, and root mean square error of approximation = 0.07). Internal consistency of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale and its 2 subscales were found to be satisfactory, with Cronbach's alpha being .89 for benevolent ageism (9 items), .79 for hostile ageism (3 items), and .89 for the total scale. Scale had a high split-half reliability coefficient (0.95). Implicit ageism positively correlated with ambivalent ageism (total score) and both benevolent ageism and hostile ageism (.22, .21, and .16, respectively). Except for cognitive assistance/protection, which was a sub-factor of benevolent ageism, no age and gender difference was found in any of the ageism scores.
   Conclusion: It was decided that the Turkish version of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale is a valid and reliable measure of negative attitudes toward older adults.

AB  - Dehumanization, defined as the psychological process through which others are perceived as being non-human, has been of interest to researchers for many years, in part because of its potential to inform our understanding of how human beings justify harm toward out-groups. The current research extends the literature by using a novel experimental manipulation to investigate dehumanization's effect on automatic behavior toward out-groups (e.g., racial shooter biases) and examined perceived threat as a moderator. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (African-American dehumanization, white dehumanization, and control). Across two studies (Study 1, n = 290; Study 2, n = 318), those in the African-American dehumanization condition were quicker to correctly shoot armed African-American (vs. white) targets (d = - .21, 95% CI [- .38, - .04]) compared to the other two conditions. This effect was only significant among participants who perceived African-Americans as relatively more threatening.

AB  - People often draw trait assessments of unfamiliar persons on the basis of minimal visual information like facial features. Most studies focus on explicit person evaluations, even though automatic processes of perception are the underlying basis. Furthermore, previous experiments on automatic processes only address very general levels of association. We conducted two experiments employing the multidimensional IAT (md-IAT) to examine automatic processes of perception in a more differentiated way, testing essential variables that are often used to characterize aliens. Results show that personality trait associations of people perceived and categorized as aliens (acquired solely through usage of paraphernalia) are not consistently negative in comparison to more familiar-looking people but might point to the core variables of xenophobic stereotypes (e.g., being aggressive, threatening, and untrustworthy). Proceeding in revealing such variables and testing them might help to understand the main cognito-emotive pattern behind xenophobia and help challenging and tackling stereotypes against aliens.

AB  - Cross-cultural partnerships can provide a competitive edge for organizations, but also hinder trust between individuals, and thus the flow of diverse knowledge that facilitates positive organizational outcomes. We investigate whether openness to experience (openness, in short) protects against lower trust in cross-cultural partnerships by weakening the effect of cultural diversity on trust formation processes (defined by perceived similarity and trustworthiness, serially). We randomly assigned White, American participants to partners from either the same or different (i.e., Chinese) cultural background. After introductions, participants rated their partner's similarity and trustworthiness, and played a game assessing behavioral trust. Openness was measured 3-7 days prior. People high (versus low) on openness were more trusting towards culturally dissimilar partners because they perceived them as more similar, and thus more trustworthy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 'Intersectional stigma' is a concept that has emerged to characterize the convergence of multiple stigmatized identities within a person or group, and to address their joint effects on health and wellbeing. While enquiry into the intersections of race, class, and gender serves as the historical and theoretical basis for intersectional stigma, there is little consensus on how best to characterize and analyze intersectional stigma, or on how to design interventions to address this complex phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to highlight existing intersectional stigma literature, identify gaps in our methods for studying and addressing intersectional stigma, provide examples illustrating promising analytical approaches, and elucidate priorities for future health research.
   Evidence from the existing scientific literature, as well as the examples presented here, suggest that people in diverse settings experience intersecting forms of stigma that influence their mental and physical health and corresponding health behaviors. As different stigmas are often correlated and interrelated, the health impact of intersectional stigma is complex, generating a broad range of vulnerabilities and risks. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches are required to reduce the significant knowledge gaps that remain in our understanding of intersectional stigma, shared identity, and their effects on health.
   Stigmatized identities, while often analyzed in isolation, do not exist in a vacuum. Intersecting forms of stigma are a common reality, yet they remain poorly understood. The development of instruments and methods to better characterize the mechanisms and effects of intersectional stigma in relation to various health conditions around the globe is vital. Only then will healthcare providers, public health officials, and advocates be able to design health interventions that capitalize on the positive aspects of shared identity, while reducing the burden of stigma.

AB  - Mainstream media and public figures are often criticized for readily attributing terrorism committed by White perpetrators to mental illness, while attributing the same behavior committed by non-Whites to ideological motivation. Using a data-driven reverse-correlation approach, we show that attributing terrorism to mental illness results in a phenotypically more White mental representation of the perpetrator as compared with attributing terrorism to ideology or providing no information about its motivation. Importantly, we show that, because terrorists who are described as being motivated by mental illness are perceived as more White than those motivated by ideology, they are subsequently judged as less guilty for alleged terrorist activities. We present further evidence that this effect may be due to perceived Whiteness signaling higher socio-economic status, which reduces perceptions of culpability. In sum, our research demonstrates that extreme violence attributed to unintentional causes is perceptually associated with White perpetrators, leading to leniency in criminal judgments.

AB  - People often hold negative attitudes toward out-groups and minority groups. We argue that such intergroup biases may result from an interaction of basic cognitive processes and the structure of the information ecology. This cognitive-ecological model assumes that groups such as minorities and out-groups are often novel to a perceiver. At the level of cognition, novel groups are primarily associated with their unique attributes, that is, attributes that differentiate them from other groups. In the information ecology, however, unique attributes are likely to be negative. Thus, novel groups, and by proxy minorities and out-groups, tend to be associated with negative attributes, leading to an evaluative disadvantage. We demonstrated this disadvantage in three experiments in which participants successively formed impressions about two fictional groups associated with the same number of positive and negative attributes. Participants preferred the first group over the novel group as long as the groups' unique attributes were negative.

AB  - Objectives: Examine how the subtype "black athletes" differs from that of black men. More centrally, to illustrate that the category black athletes can be triggered and lead to implicit bias. This bias is implicit and impacts a perceiver's evaluation outside conscious awareness.
   Design and method: Participants were white residents of the United States. Experiment one assessed familiarity with three qualities comprising the cultural stereotype of black athletes. Experiment two explored implicit bias from the stereotype using a within subjects design. Participants read a series of quotes and rated how strongly they implied these stereotypical qualities. Each participant rated such quotes from a black athlete, white athlete, black salesman, and a white salesman.
   Results: Implicit bias was revealed in the type of ratings provided of black athletes. The ratings for the black athletes along these two stereotypical dimensions significantly differed from the ratings made to the same quotes when uttered by other men.
   Conclusions: The stereotype guided how participants viewed the person's actions/words. The stereotype of black athletes is distinct from black men generally. Participants did not rate men negatively along the stereotypic dimensions when they were black salesmen, only when they were black athletes. Additionally, although the quality "athletic," which is part of the global stereotype of black men, has a positive connotation, the stereotype that is built around this quality is not positive. It is a stereotype that this group has natural athletic ability that leads to an arrogance and lack of work ethic (since one is naturally gifted).

AB  - Perceived discrimination contributes to the development of internalized stigma among those with schizophrenia. Evidence on demographic and clinical factors related to the perception of discrimination among this population is both contradictory and scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study is to determine the demographic and clinical factors predicting the perception of discrimination among Mexican patients with schizophrenia. Two hundred and seventeen adults with paranoid schizophrenia completed an interview on their demographic status and clinical characteristics. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; and perceived discrimination using 13 items from the King's Internalized Stigma Scale. Bivariate linear associations were determined to identify the variables of interest to be included in a linear regression analysis. Years of education, age of illness onset and length of hospitalization were associated with discrimination. However, only age of illness onset and length of hospitalization emerged as predictors of perceived discrimination in the final regression analysis, with longer length of hospitalization being the independent variable with the greatest contribution. Fortunately, this is a modifiable factor regarding the perception of discrimination and self-stigma. Strategies for achieving this as part of community-based mental health care are also discussed.

AB  - Introduction: The main goal of the present study was to examine the stereotype content model (SCM) assumption for universality and to test whether the mediating role of cultural views about older adult caregivers is maintained in other health care contexts.
   Methods: One hundred and sixty professionals and volunteers who worked with older adults in day care centers (DCCs) and senior citizen centers (SCCs) and 1,151 participants from a representative sample of the Spanish population were examined using the SCM questionnaire; older adult and personnel functioning were assessed through an observation procedure with two subscales of the Evaluation Scale from the Sistema de Evaluation de Residencias de Ancianos.
   Results: The results showed that the context does not seem to influence the cultural views about older adults held by caregivers. All results support the cultural stereotype pattern in which members of the older adult group are viewed with high warmth (HW) and low competence (LC) as posited by the SCM model. With respect to the mediation of cultural stereotypes on caregivers/older adult functioning, this has not been supported in this study. Neither cultural views of warmth (predicted by the SCM) nor views of competence (from our previous studies) influence either caregiver functional behaviors or older adult functioning.
   Conclusion: Two post hoc hypotheses can be inferred: 1) there is more variability in competence and warmth in DCCs and SCCs and 2) although we did not find significant differences in the pattern of competence and warmth in perceived cultural stereotypes about older adults, more healthy environments could reduce the influence of cognitive views on behavior.

AB  - Developing a healthy bisexual consciousness within an oppressive, monosexual society is difficult. The present article offers a framework for considering bi-consciousness utilizing the work of W. E. B. Du Bois (1903/1994) related to double consciousness in freed slaves and the work of Gloria Anzalciaa (1987/2012) about people indigenous to the border between Mexico and the United States. In the spirit of this autoethnographic tradition, the author's reflections on navigating hostility and invisibility and becoming liberated from society's view of bisexuality are shared in an article that best resembles a series of brief essays. As a by-product of this process, recommendations are offered for revising the American Psychological Association's guidelines for psychological practice with bisexual clients.

AB  - Presenting a comprehensive measurement instrument of 12 statements expressing resentments toward Americans and America, this study shows that anti-Americanism can be conceptualized as a robust and stable attitude transcending everyday politics. In a test-retest design applied in Germany in 2011 and 2012, we found a fair to moderate temporal stability of anti-American attitudes. Furthermore, we tested for consistency of potential correlates of anti-Americanism-anomia, globalization critique, and capitalism critique-and gained slightly different estimates when comparing multiple regression models of both years. Yet, further analysis suggests that those differences are not due to changes in anti-American attitudes but to the temporal instability of their correlates. Taken together, our study indicates that simple measurement instruments of anti-Americanism, as used in many previous studies, might be more prone to "everyday politics measurement errors" than multi-item measurements.

AB  - There is a growing debate in the research literature and subsequently in the news media and public about the accuracy and utility of gaydar'. Although many gaydar studies report that people can accurately and quickly guess a person's sexual orientation without direct knowledge, there are others that suggest gaydar can be inaccurate and stereotype-based. Most recently, research on the use of gaydar in artificial intelligence sparked a public outcry about the application and production of gaydar research suggesting that the study of gaydar is a high-stakes public issue in today's world.The purpose of this article is to highlight this debate, identify the major areas of disagreement and consider a wider range of questions than previously addressed in the literature. This article critically examines conceptual, statistical and analytical problems in the research literature on gaydar and is organised around three central themes: (1) differences in how gaydar is conceptualisedand operationalised, (2) data analyses that tend to emphasise accuracy over error and(3) studies that validate long-heldstereotypes about LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming people. This article provides a nuanced discussion about the existence and meaning of gaydar in the context of this ongoing debate.

AB  - Domestic abuse frequently appears in news headlines among professional athletes and has ignited much debate about personal conduct off the field. From Ray Rice and football to Hope Solo and soccer - domestic abuse has occurred. This study examined if and how participants differentiate between male and female victims and perpetrators of violence; specifically, whether participants placed blame differently when presented with a health message in a sports context when it involved a male or female athlete as perpetrator. Media influence topics of public conversation, and domestic abuse is an especially important public health issue. Sports media may be an outlet by which to reach both victims and perpetrators of domestic abuse. Results and practical implications are discussed.
