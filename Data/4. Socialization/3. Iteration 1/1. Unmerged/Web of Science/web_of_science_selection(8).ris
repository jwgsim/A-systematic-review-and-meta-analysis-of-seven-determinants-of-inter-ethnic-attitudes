AB  - In this study, it is aimed to analyze the relationship between critical thinking skills and problem behaviours of children at social risk through visual arts education. In this context, Mixed method including both quantitative and qualitative dimension was used. Convergent parallel design was used to structure the study. In dimension quantitative of research, one group pre-test-post-test model as one of the pre-experimental models was used by applying the retention test. In the scope of the qualitative dimension, holistic single case design was used as a design of case study. The study was carried out on a group of 54 people (27 females, 27 males) who are identified to be at risk. Quantitative data were collected using the Art Criticism Target Behaviour Scale (ACTBS) that consisted of twenty questions and developed by the researchers. Qualitative data were collected by in-class activities, self-assessment form and performance task developed in two phases including both children's drawing and critical dimension. According to the results; as critical thinking skills develop, the students follow a more sensitive and inquisitive development of behaviours, their prejudices decrease, they gain a positive point of view to establish cause-effect relationship, they develop the ability to control negative behaviours, so their consciousness and awareness increase regarding family, environmental and social fact. As a result, it is recommended that visual arts education should be used effectively in relation to other disciplines in the teaching-learning process.

   Parents, spouses, and children of hospitalized patients: evaluation of nursing care.
   Aim.
   This paper is a report of a study of the effect of kinship type and gender on family members' evaluation of nursing care for patients and their families in hospital units.
   Background.
   With increasing competition in the healthcare system, hospitals attribute great importance to client satisfaction, which is strongly related to the quality of nursing care. However, to date there has been little research into family members' evaluation of nursing care.
   Methods.
   Questionnaires were administered to spouses, parents and children (n = 441) of hospitalized patients in three Israeli hospitals during 2007-2008.
   Results.
   Kinship type interacted with gender in affecting family members' evaluation of the quality of nursing care. Among men, husbands were the most satisfied with nursing behaviour, treatment of the patients, and the information they receive. Fathers were the least satisfied. Overall family evaluation of the service was predicted by their evaluation of caring, treatment, and the patient's environment; departmental reputation was predicted by evaluation of treatment.
   Conclusion.
   Nurses should be trained to develop sensitivity to the diverse expectations and needs of relatives, as well as awareness of how their own preconceptions affect their behaviour toward patients' families. Nurses should develop self-awareness of possible stereotypes and prejudices that may bias their behaviour towards family members. Reactions of family members should also be included in surveys of client satisfaction with nursing care.

AB  - The study investigated experiences of dropouts in schools in rural secondary schools in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Ten learners who previously dropped out of school described their experiences in school subsequent to re-enrolling. The implications of these experiences for educational leadership were explored. Using a qualitative approach, which included focus group interviews with 10 participants, the study found that social hostility and an impetus to pursue their academic work, defined the experiences of these dropouts. Social hostility reflected itself in prejudices and bullying. The dropouts lived with, inter alia, inner conflicts, self-doubt and oscarso associated with their reasons for dropping out of school. Various lessons emerged for educational leadership. The study argues that the presence of dropouts in school poses a challenge to educational leadership and theorises that the integration of these learners into the school population could be made less problematic not only through a recognition of the potential risk that they quite often pose, but also through the provision of support strategies aimed at helping a resettlement of dropouts into the schools and classes. Suggestions have been made regarding possible support strategy.

AB  - As part of their "essentialist" intuitions, young children tend to form personal attributions for observed intergroup differences - attributing them to groups' intrinsic natures or inborn characteristics. Much research has linked this essentialist view of social groups with prejudiced attitudes. However, less research has explored children's capacity to form structural attributions for observed intergroup differences - attributing them to groups' extrinsic circumstances or access to opportunities - or how structural attributions relate to social attitudes. Structural attributions could enable children to view low-status groups as extrinsically disadvantaged rather than intrinsically inferior. We were interested in whether verbally highlighting the extrinsic causes of novel social status disparities could support young children in forming structural attributions for them, thereby mitigating the formation of prejudice toward novel low-status groups. To investigate, we introduced participants (n=106 5- and 6-year olds) to novel social status disparities that could be attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic causes, and we framed the disparities in either intrinsic, neutral, or extrinsic terms. We then assessed children's attributions for the disparities (through two measures: explanations and interventions) and their social attitudes toward the groups (through two measures: friendship preferences and prize allocations). Results indicated that participants tended to provide mostly personal attributions overall but that extrinsic framing led them to provide significantly more structural attributions. Extrinsic framing did not significantly impact social attitudes overall, but exploratory analyses revealed that it impacted participants' friendship preferences in particular. Together, results suggest that verbally highlighting extrinsic causes can disrupt children's intuitive tendency toward personal attributions, with promising implications for their views of low-status groups.

AB  - Lesbian-parented families challenge the heteronormative dominant discourse of family in major social institutions such as schools. This study explores Greek lesbian mothers' experiences and perceptions of their interaction with the school personnel and other parents. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data obtained through in-person interviews with 14 lesbian mothers. The study revealed three overarching themes: (a) anticipating teachers' rejection, (b) non-traditional family models are not addressed in school curricula, and (c) Managing disclosure. Participants' experiences of anticipated rejection, of hiding and concealing their family structure and sexual identity confirm that LGBTQ+ individuals live in a macro- and micro-environmental context which adds to minority stress and produces essential new challenges. The findings of this study are discussed in the light of the institutional sources of minority stress that affect lesbian mothers.

AB  - Suburban schools, particularly those with majority white histories experiencing demographic shifts, are increasingly in need of addressing issues of racial equity. This qualitative study, using the extended case method, examined one suburban school district's efforts to promote racial equity and focused particularly on how professional development was experienced by school personnel and on the perceived outcomes. Data sources for this study included focus groups with teachers, pupil personnel services professionals, and other school staff and administrators as well as observational data from participation in district events and meetings. This study is grounded in Gloria Anzaldua's nepantlera framework, which conceptualizes the in-between space between two or more cultures and those who occupy that space as "border crossers," and nepantleras as cultural navigators, bridge builders, and advocates. Noteworthy themes included perceptions of the district's level of commitment to racial equity; common barriers to facilitating racial equity training, such as white racial prejudice, resistance, and defensiveness; and the challenge of navigating self- and student social identities for teachers and staff of color. Implications for equity work in schools and the role of school social workers training are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the present study is twofold. First, we evaluate to what extent Turkish ethnic minority members experience ethnic prejudice in the Flemish society. Experiencing ethnic prejudice could affect the orientation of minority members towards the majority group, their own (migrant) community and towards the country of origin (of their parents). Therefore, in the second part we assess the effect ethnic prejudice has on a specific type of interethnic social contact: partner selection. To what extent Turkish parents prefer a Turkish partner (living in Turkey) for their children, or do they show openness towards Belgian partners? We apply linear and multinomial logistic regression models on data retrieved form a representative survey in the Turkish ethnic minority in Flanders (n = 430). First, we find that ethnic prejudice is very common in the lives of Turkish minorities in Flanders. Men, respondents with a lower socioeconomic status, and partner migrants are especially at risk of experiencing prejudice. Second, we conclude that although the majority of the parents prefers ethnically homogeneous partnerships, openness towards mixed is found among more than 25% of the parents. Experiencing ethnic prejudice and having a lower educational attainment lowers that likelihood of being open towards mixed partnerships with Belgian partners.

AB  - The Integrative Model for the Study of Developmental Competencies in Minority Children argues that while discrimination and prejudice are normative experiences for ethnic minority children, promoting environments, family factors and adaptive culture may help minority youth develop effective coping strategies to deal with discrimination. Although this model emphasizes the critical role of family, there are relatively few studies on discrimination that include data from both parents and youth. In the current study, we qualitatively investigated themes of teen discrimination experiences and youth/parent responses in a sample (N = 40) of Mexican descent parents (n = 20) and middle school aged (11-15 years old) adolescents (n = 20) who participated in separate youth and parent focus groups. Adolescents indicate that stereotypes are pervasive, as evidenced in media, anti-immigrant comments, and insults from peers. Yet, adolescents expressed few specific strategies to deal with discrimination, and often expressed concern that standing up to discrimination may lead to physical altercation. Parents discussed the pervasiveness of prejudice and ethnic slurs, and specifically identified school as a setting where teens experience discrimination. Parents discussed strategies of teaching children not to use derogatory terms against others, telling them not to engage in fighting, encouraging children to report school incidents to teachers, and trying to prevent criminalization of male youth by talking to them about clothing choices. Mixed race families especially talked about inclusivity, ethnic/racial pride, and sharing family history (immigration, language, racial diversity). The Integrative Model for Developmental Competencies guides our discussion of implications for adolescent well-being and future research.

AB  - Our knowledge on the personality basis of ideological attitudes and prejudice, while based on a substantial body of research, suffers from a potentially serious methodological limitation: an overreliance on the method of self-reports. Across 2 studies (Ns = 193, 424), we examined associations between the Big Five personality dimensions, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), and generalized prejudice, using both self-report and peer-report data stemming from I (Study 1) or 2 (Study 2) peer rater/s. Correlational and regression analyses as well as structural equation modeling showed that (a) the associations between personality dimensions, ideological attitudes, and prejudice were largely similar to previous research for both data sources; (b) RWA and prejudice showed a similar level of self-peer agreement to personality dimensions; (c) most of the known associations between personality, ideological attitudes, and prejudice were replicated also when measured by independent methods; (d) peer reports had some incremental validity in predicting ideological attitudes and prejudice; and (e) there was evidence that Openness to Experience and Agreeableness predicted prejudice directly and not only indirectly via RWA and SDO, respectively. Implications for the status of RWA, SDO, and prejudice as individual-difference constructs and for their bases in personality dimensions are discussed.

AB  - Background Much research has been devoted to the emotional burdens of having a child with intellectual disability (ID), but very little of this has focused on the burdens imposed by negative public attitudes towards disability. Adjustment has primarily been thought of as adjustment to the actual disability rather than adjustment to attitudes or prejudices towards disability.
   Aim The aim of the present study was to study expectations of and reactions to disability and normality experienced by parents of children with ID in their everyday life in Sweden.
   Research questions Do the parents relate to the tragedy discourse and, if so, how? Do parents relate to other expectations and disability discourses and, if so, how? What subject positions do the discourses offer?
   Method The analysis was based on 17 semi-structured interviews with nine fathers and eight mothers of nine children with different IDs. The children were newly diagnosed and were from 6 months to 5 years of age.
   Results Four discourses (tragedy and the lived experience, tragedy and the outsider perspective, the clinical gaze and the super-parent ideal) and subject positions relating to these discourses are discussed.
   Discussion The results of this study show that parents of young children with disabilities relate to a wide range of social processes and practices, which could be thought to affect their emotional well-being and parental identity negatively.

AB  - One of the difficulties in social research has been to disentangle the effects of race/ethnicity from social class. In two experimental studies with samples of both students and general population (total N = 416), we analyzed the effect of social class, ethnicity and their interaction on prejudice and discrimination using experimental methods. Social class (High vs. Low) and ethnic group (Roma vs. Non-Roma) were manipulated through a cover story. Study 1 showed a main effect of social class, not of ethnicity, on prejudice and discrimination. In Study 2 the effect of social class was replicated, and the interaction effect was also significant for all dependent variables. Results show that negative effects of social class are higher among Roma than non-Roma. Pooled analyses corroborated these findings. Social class is a predictive factor, especially in interaction with ethnicity and should be considered for predicting and reducing prejudiced attitudes and intergroup behaviors fostering inequality.

AB  - One of the appeals of conspiracy theories in times of crises is that they provide someone to blame for what has happened. Thereby, they increase distrust, negative feelings, and hostility toward implicated actors, whether those are powerful social outgroups or one's own government representatives. Two studies reported here examine associations of COVID-19 conspiracy theories with prejudice, support for violence, and other and negative social outcomes. In Study 1 (N = 501), the endorsement of the more specific conspiracy theories about the alleged role of China was associated with more prejudiced views of Chinese and Italian people. In Study 2 (N = 1024), lowered trust in government regulations and increased hostility associated with the COVID-19 and generic conspiracy beliefs were correlated with justification of and willingness to engage in non-compliance with regulations, violent attacks on 5G masts, and anti-government protests. Across both of the studies, higher exposure to news about COVID-19 was associated with lower endorsement of conspiracy theories, but also with increased feelings of anxiety and lack of control, which in turn were correlated with higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs endorsement. We highlight the potential social problems which are associated with the wide-spread endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories.

AB  - Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is a valued patient-related outcome measure. HR-QoL is typically measured using a psychometric tool. Although there are a number of general and illness-specific HR-QoL measurement tools available globally, no tool has been validated for Australian Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children. The purpose of this study was to gather Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parent/carer perspectives of HR-QoL in children in order to inform the development of a culturally appropriate tool. Yarning circles and face to face interviews were used to document the experiences of parents and carers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who had experienced a chronic illness. Participants were recruited through word of mouth and via established social and professional networks in Queensland and the Northern Territory of Australia. Information collected was transcribed and analysed thematically and placed into a concept map. HR-QoL was defined as more than just physical, social and psychological wellbeing. Family and social support were valued aspects of HR-QoL, as was knowledge, communication and the relationship with the health system. Participants described the importance of being heard; their voice trusted and valued by health practitioners. Racism and prejudicial behaviour had negative impacts on HR-QoL. The concepts of HR-QoL identified in this study are not included in conventional HR-QoL measurement tools. Consideration should be given to concepts proposed by Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in order to adequately capture perceived HR-QoL.

AB  - Why do essentialist beliefs promote prejudice? We proposed that essentialist beliefs increase prejudice toward Black people because they imply that existing social hierarchies reflect a naturally occurring structure. We tested this hypothesis in three studies (N = 621). Study 1 revealed that racial essentialism was associated with increased prejudice toward Blacks among both White and Black adult participants, suggesting that essentialism relates to prejudice according to social hierarchy rather than only to group membership. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally demonstrated that increasing essentialist beliefs induced stronger endorsement of social hierarchies in both Black and White participants, which in turn mediated the effect of essentialism on negative attitudes toward Black people. Together, these findings suggest that essentialism increases prejudice toward low-status groups by increasing endorsement of social hierarchies and existing inequality.

AB  - In this study, we investigate the association between a school's ethnic composition, the track in which teachers teach, and their level of involvement with multicultural teaching (MCT) in the Flemish context, taking into account the ethnic prejudice of teachers. Multilevel analyses of data from 590 Flemish teachers in 40 Belgian secondary schools suggest that teachers in schools with more ethnic minority pupils, teachers in vocational education, and ethnically unprejudiced teachers implement more MCT. These findings highlight the need for more research into the relationship between school features, the sociopsychological characteristics of teachers, and their involvement with MCT.

AB  - Anti-fat prejudice (weight bias, obesity stigma) is strong, prevalent, and increasing in adults and is associated with negative outcomes for those with obesity. However, it is unknown how early in life this prejudice forms and the reasons for its development. We examined whether infants and toddlers might display an anti-fat bias and, if so, whether it was influenced by maternal anti-fat attitudes through a process of social learning. Mother-child dyads (N = 70) split into four age groups participated in a preferential looking paradigm whereby children were presented with 10 pairs of average and obese human figures in random order, and their viewing times (preferential looking) for the figures were measured. Mothers' anti-fat prejudice and education were measured along with mothers' and fathers' body mass index (BMI) and children's television viewing time. We found that older infants (M = 11 months) had a bias for looking at the obese figures, whereas older toddlers (M = 32 months) instead preferred looking at the average-sized figures. Furthermore, older toddlers' preferential looking was correlated significantly with maternal anti-fat attitudes. Parental BMI, education, and children's television viewing time were unrelated to preferential looking. Looking times might signal a precursor to explicit fat prejudice socialized via maternal anti-fat attitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Elementary school-age children (N = 137, 70 boys, ages 4-10) were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of lessons aimed at increasing the inclusiveness of peer relations and improving children's ability to identify bias in media. Children in the pro-social condition were taught to identify and respond to undesirable/unfair social behaviors (e.g., teasing), whereas children in the pro-egalitarian condition were taught to respond to these same behaviors, with additional attention to gender bias (e.g., teasing about gender role nonconformity). After five lessons, children completed immediate and 6-month delayed measures of egalitarian attitudes, intergroup liking, responses to hypothetical peers' sexist remarks, and ability to identify sexism in media. The lessons did not differentially affect children's gender egalitarian attitudes and intergroup liking. As expected, however, children in the pro-egalitarian condition were better able to identify sexism in media and to respond to peers' sexist comments than were children in the pro-social condition.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine prejudiced attitudes as a factor associated with social distance from people with mental illness. A total of 289 university students from Greece completed written measures assessing social distance from, prejudiced attitudes about, and familiarity with mental illness. A structural equation model with manifest variables was tested. Participants who reported to be more familiar with mental illness held stronger social care and weaker prejudiced beliefs, and consequently expressed a less strong desire for social distance. Implications of the results and suggestions for future research are outlined. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Forty Italian gay father families formed by surrogacy were compared with 40 Italian lesbian mother families formed by donor insemination, all with a child aged 3 to 9 years. Standardized interview, observational, and questionnaire measures of parenting quality, parent-child relationships, stigmatization, and children's adjustment were administered to parents, children, teachers, and a child psychiatrist. The only differences across family types indicated higher levels of stigmatization as reported by gay fathers. Externalizing and internalizing problems in both groups scored within the normal range. When family structure and processes were entered together as predictors of child adjustment, a hierarchical linear model analysis showed that factors associated with children's externalizing problems were the child's male gender, high stigmatization, and negative parenting; children's internalizing problems were higher in lesbian mother families and were predicted by stigmatization. Of note, neither gay fathers nor lesbian mothers tended to underestimate their children's adjustment problems relative to teachers. Finally, for children of gay fathers, comparison between teacher SDQ ratings and teacher SDQ normative data on Italian children in a similar age range showed that teachers reported children of gay fathers to show significantly fewer internalizing problems than the normative sample. No differences in children's externalizing problems emerged. A bootstrapping simulation confirmed all results, except the effect of stigmatization on child internalizing problems. Findings suggest that the practice of surrogacy by gay men has no adverse effects on child health outcomes. Implications for our theoretical understanding of child socialization and development, and law and social policy, are discussed.

AB  - The effects of group membership on brain responses to social exclusion have been investigated in adults, revealing greater anterior cingulate responses to exclusion by members of one's in-group (e.g., same-gender). However, social exclusion is a critical aspect of peer relations in youth and reaches heightened salience during adolescence, a time when social anxiety disorders are also emergent. While the behavioral and neural correlates of social exclusion in adolescence have been extensively explored, the effects of group membership on peer rejection are less clear. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the differential neural correlates of being excluded by peers of one's same- versus opposite-gender during an online ball-toss game. Participants were a group of typically developing children and adolescents (7-17years). As predicted, anterior cingulate cortex showed a main effect of social exclusion versus fair play. However, unlike a previous adult study, this region did not show increased activation to same-gender exclusion. Instead, several regions differentiating same- versus opposite-gender exclusion were exclusively more sensitive to exclusion by one's opposite gender. These results are discussed in the context of adolescent socio-emotional development.

AB  - A project with children and juveniles in a detention centre confronts social work students with their own perceptions and experiences of being direct or indirect victims of crime, with their own values and with integrating the values and principles of social work. Within an ecological perspective, past and present issues in the country's context influence perceptions and personal values. The project challenges these perceptions and value systems. Feedback include that students realise they should not judge the young people; that these youngsters have dignity and worth in spite of where they come from and the crime they committed; that they deserve respect and should be accepted for who they are. The article discusses professional values and principles in social work and provides a case study of dealing with undergraduate social work students' fears, emotions and prejudices in teaching and integrating social work values and principles.

AB  - Social essentialism entails the belief that certain social categories (e.g., gender, race) mark fundamentally distinct kinds of people. Essentialist beliefs have pernicious consequences, supporting social stereotyping and contributing to prejudice. How does social essentialism develop? In the studies reported here, we tested the hypothesis that generic language facilitates the cultural transmission of social essentialism. Two studies found that hearing generic language about a novel social category diverse for race, ethnicity, age, and sex led 4-y-olds and adults to develop essentialist beliefs about that social category. A third study documented that experimentally inducing parents to hold essentialist beliefs about a novel social category led them to produce more generic language when discussing the category with their children. Thus, generic language facilitates the transmission of essentialist beliefs about social categories from parents to children.

AB  - This article compares child welfare workers' perspectives on Black and Minority Ethnic parents in England and Norway. It is based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with forty-seven front line child welfare workers conducted in 2008. We found that Norwegian and English child welfare workers' perspectives of minority parents significantly differ along two dimensions: workers' expectations about the role that minority parents should play in the lives of their children, and their assumptions about parents' relationship with the child welfare system. Norwegian workers embrace a racism-blind, individualistic, change-oriented perspective that views minority parents as responsible service users. Workers conceive of parents and children as individuals with different struggles and needs and classify minority parents primarily as service users with responsibilities towards their children. They expect parents to become bi-lingual and bi-cultural to facilitate their children's access to the opportunities provided by the Norwegian education and child welfare systems. English workers demonstrate an anti-racist and culturally sensitive, holistic and defensive perspective that categorises minority parents and children as clients. They think of minority children and parents as families (as opposed to individuals) of colour who encounter racism and prejudice. English workers do not expect bi-cultural competency from immigrant parents.

AB  - In the first half of the 21st century, it is clear that racism and prejudice are prevalent worldwide and begin in childhood-as children can be perpetrators, victims, and bystanders of racism and prejudice. Reducing racism in youth is a critical step toward improving the society we all live in. This special issue reviews and synthesizes the latest research on racism and prejudice in childhood and adolescence, examining the role of families, schools, media, and friendships in reducing prejudice in youth and highlighting how to enhance collective well-being. By focusing on research over the past two decades, and including a range of international perspectives, this special section helps make theoretical, conceptual, and methodological advances on the topic of reducing and protecting children from racism.

AB  - This article presents a developmental model of anti-racism among White children and youth. Informed by a structural-psychological framework (Syed & McLean. 2021), the model proposes that anti-racist development is inseparable from the structures and systems that uphold racial inequality in the United States. In articulating the processes by which children and early adolescents move toward becoming anti-racist, the model emphasizes foundational abilities (e.g., socio-cognitive skills and moral development), a developing sense of self and society (e.g., recognition of racism and understanding of White privilege), and the importance of anti-racism action and promotive contexts (especially within schools and families). This paper concludes with advancing a research agenda for developmental scientists studying the development of anti-racism among White children and youth and implications for parents, practitioners, and educators.

AB  - The effects of virtual cooperative video games have not yet been explored within the setting of hostile intergroup contexts; nor have they been tested among school-aged children. We present results from a longitudinal school-based intervention that enabled virtual contact between Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli children. The program included six virtual and two face-to-face sessions. We find that relative to an intragroup contact control group, children who participated in the intergroup program showed reduced intergroup bias on both cognitive and emotional indicators, including reduced stereotypical views, negative emotions and discriminatory tendencies toward members of the other ethnic group, as well as increased willingness to engage in social contact with outgroup members. These effects were long lasting and preserved six months after termination of the program. The intervention's effectiveness was consistent across measures, gender, and ethnic groups. Thus, the program we developed offers a feasible, relatively cost-effective gaming intervention that can be applied even in areas characterized by severe ethnic tension and hostile conflict.

AB  - Although right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) are the two most studied individual difference correlates of prejudice, debate remains over their status as enduring constructs that precede generalized prejudice. We contribute to this discussion using 10 annual waves of longitudinal data from a nationwide random sample of adults to investigate the stability and temporal precedence of RWA, SDO, and prejudice among members of an ethnic majority group (Ns = 23,383-47,217). Results reveal high wave-to-wave rank-order stability for RWA, SDO, and generalized prejudice. Adjusting for their between-person stability, RWA and SDO predicted within-person increases in generalized prejudice. Results replicated when predicting (a) prejudice toward three specific minority groups (namely, Maori, Pacific Islanders, and Asians) and (b) anti-minority beliefs. These findings demonstrate that RWA and SDO are highly stable over 10 consecutive years and that they independently precede within-person annual increases in generalized prejudice and anti-minority beliefs.

Cooperation and competition between individuals are considered simultaneously in a social network. Similar to the signed DeGroot model, we adopt a weighted average update rule in our model. We derive conditions under which opinions converge to a fixed opinion distribution. In particular, we find conditions under which opinions reach consensus or polarization (bipartite consensus). Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

AB  - In Argentina, as well as in many countries, indigenous people have been the target of prejudice for centuries. This situation mostly dates to the "Conquest of the Desert", a military campaign waged by the Argentine government against the indigenous population during the late 19th century. Although in the last three decades, indigenous groups' claims for reparation and equal social rights have increased in visibility, most are still victims of cultural segregation and poverty. This study analyzes the relations among social representations and prejudice against indigenous people in a small city, where the descendants of both military people and the European immigrants who arrived at the beginning of the 20th century to settle in the "conquered" lands, live alongside descendants of the Mapuche indigenous groups who originally inhabited that same territory. Our analyses suggest a contradiction in the attempts to vindicate the indigenous people while maintaining their subordinated and segregated status in the community. That opposition is reinforced by imaginary frontiers created by the organization of urban spaces and representations of the relations between past and present that relegate indigenous people to the past and place them into the poorest and most violent neighborhood, implicitly marking them as criminals. Hence, social representations may be at the basis of the subtle expressions of prejudice that are very frequent. However, when the inhabitants of the city have to actually face indigenous people who are not clearly very different from them and when these indigenous people's claims become more visible, more blatant forms of prejudice become manifest.

AB  - An increasing number of migrant social workers are employed in the UK social work sector. This article explores the acculturative integration experiences of a small group of migrant social workers. We critically observe that research on migrant professionals' trajectories should adopt theories that emphasise people's empowerment and potential for agency. We use a framework drawing on liberation psychology for analysing the autobiographical narratives of a sample of migrant social workers employed in England. Findings indicate that the participants perceived prejudice on a number of occasions and circumstances. Even though in their narrative of survival they talked about activating several psychosocial resources, they were skeptical about their professional development and dissatisfied at work. The paper discusses the emerging findings while highlighting the framework's relevance for understanding these experiences from an empowering acculturation perspective and suggesting ways of improving migrant social workers' acculturative integration by addressing systemic barriers.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the social representations of people living with HIV/AIDS and their experiences of prejudice. Method: One hundred fifty-four (154) people living with HIV/AIDS participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and underwent a descending hierarchical analysis through the IRaMuTeQ software. Results: The study results showed that for these individuals the moment of diagnosis was perceived as a turning point, but after a while they eventually anchored their health condition as a chronic disease. Infection occurred mostly due to intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. Discussion: The participants reported that dealing with social prejudice was more difficult than living with HIV/AIDS. Prejudice was a recurring daily experience for those who decided to reveal their serological status, and led to a practice of concealing their condition from society to avoid being rejected.

AB  - Significant increase of internal migration in Albanian post-socialist society affected people's connections and their identity. New social phenomena were differently perceived by the existing city inhabitants and the newcomers. On the one hand, the concept of social identity struggled between inclusionary/exclusionary boundaries; on the other hand, prejudice and stigma triggered from this complex reality. This paper applies Social Identity Theory to examine how internal migration affects social identity and its implications on prejudice and stigma in Albanian post-socialist society. This qualitative study is based on desk research and secondary data drawn by national statistics and cross-sectional research conducted in Albania during the period 1991-2017. It concludes that more longitudinal studies should be conducted to understand the dynamics of social identity construction within the context of internal migration in Albania. This is necessary to promote a more inclusive society in order to accommodate social diversity and view internal migrants as local agents of development rather than objects of prejudice and stigma.

AB  - Members of the same household share similar social attitudes, but the source of the similarity in attitudes may be attributed to many processes. This study uses data from a randomized field experiment to identify contagion in attitude change about anti-transgender prejudice. During a face-to-face canvassing experiment, registered voters who answered the door were exposed to either a message encouraging active perspective taking intended to reduce transphobia or a recycling message. Here, I show that the messages delivered to one household member are likely to reduce anti-transgender prejudice in the cohabitants as well. This finding suggests that door-to-door canvassing messages intended to elicit attitude change are likely to be socially transmitted.

AB  - The study sought to identify the influential factors of stereotypes, social distance, and prejudice toward racial/ethnic minorities in the United States. We used data from the American General Social Survey (GSS) of 2012, and analysed the data of 4 820 individuals (3 700 Caucasians, 722 African Americans, and 398 others; males = 44.2%, females = 55.8%). Data were analysed using the SPSS 18.0 Statistics Program. In order to test for differences in racial prejudice by demographic characteristics by stereotyping and social distancing, we utilised variance and regression analyses procedures. Results suggest that stereotypes and social distance effects on prejudice toward African Americans vary according to ethnicity, gender, age, education, and income. Specifically, older and less-educated white males were more prejudiced toward African Americans than were individuals from other sociodemographic groupings. There was a direct relationship between the holding of stereotypical views and social distance, in that those who showed higher levels of stereotyping maintained a greater social distance from African Americans and showed greater implicit prejudice toward them. Racism toward African Americans remains a major social concern in the USA, and is largely influenced by sociodemographic factors.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of the current study is to test a recently established model of racial-ethnic socialization (Langrehr, 2014) among 2 samples of White transracially adoptive parents and to assess whether the proposed model functions similarly after accounting for adopted child race. Method: Based on a modified version of the Racial Bias Preparation Scale (Fisher, Wallace, & Fenton, 2000), confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the 3-factor model (i.e., Prejudice Awareness, Racial-Ethnic Pride, and Egalitarianism) among 172 White transracially adoptive parents with Asian children (M-age = 45.72) and 140 White transracially adoptive parents with Black children (M-age = 42.62). In addition, multigroup invariance testing was used to assess whether the proposed model functioned similarly across the 2 groups of parents. Results: Results indicate that the proposed 3-factor model demonstrated partial measurement invariance such that the subconstruct of Egalitarianism functioned similarly across groups, whereas Racial-Ethnic Pride and Prejudice Awareness were deemed noninvariant. Conclusions: Findings are intended to help expand the concept of racial-ethnic socialization for transracially adoptive families and address the degree to which current research on racial-ethnic socialization can be applied to different transracially adoptive families. Results are intended to highlight ways that various social-cultural dimensions of family can culminate into different socialization experiences.

AB  - The relationships between social value orientation, socio-political attitudes and prejudice was investigated in three studies (total N = 1069). Participants filled in questionnaires containing measures of social value orientation, left-right political orientation, social worldviews (i.e. dangerous world and competitive jungle), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and prejudice towards immigrants. Study 1 showed that a proself orientation was associated to right-wing political orientation through the mediation of RWA and SDO. Study 2 revealed that social worldviews mediated the relationships of a proself orientation with RWA and SDO. Finally, Study 3 indicated that a proself orientation was related to prejudice through the intervention of social worldviews, RWA and SDO. Overall, these findings provided robust evidence about the elevant role of interpersonal orientation underpinning socio-political attitudes and prejudice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Between January 7 and 9, 2015, a succession of terrorist attacks in France shocked the whole world. Public reaction was strong, as was demonstrated by the huge turnout for the "marches for the Republic" held on January 10 and 11. The present paper is based on data collected from 162 participants just before the January 2015 attacks and during two successive two-week periods immediately after the attacks. Our objective was to determine whether the attacks led to an increase, even temporarily, in prejudice, social dominance orientation (SDO), and attachment to the principle of laicite(1). Results showed a short-lived increase in prejudice against immigrants and North-Africans during the two weeks following the attacks, but no increase in SDO or attachment to the principle of laicite. Contrary to our expectations, we found a substantial decrease in attachment to the principle of laicite during the third data collection period (between two and four weeks after the attacks) compared with the first two periods. We discuss these results in the light of the social psychology literature on the effects of terrorist attacks on the perceptions and attitudes of citizens of the countries targeted.

KW  - Testimonial Injustice
AB  - Ignorance of one's privileges and prejudices is an epistemic problem. While the sources of ignorance of privilege and prejudice are increasingly understood, less clarity exists about how to remedy ignorance. In fact, the various causes of ignorance can seem so powerful, various, and mutually reinforcing that studying the epistemology of ignorance can inspire pessimism about combatting socially constructed ignorance. I argue that this pessimism is unwarranted. The testimony of members of oppressed groups can often help members of privileged groups overcome their ignorance. This paper argues that a particular type of speaker's trust-hopeful trust-can motivate hearers to become cognizant of their privilege and prejudice. I argue that hopeful trust is a powerful way of eliciting trust-responsiveness that can be an effective mechanism for challenging privilege and prejudice. To make this case, I draw on case studies of online attempts to challenge ignorance. While the problems of testimonial injustice, defensive ignorance, and the absence of privilege-cognizant role models can be barriers to challenging ignorance, I show that acts of hopeful trust can effectively overcome these barriers. Thus, hopeful trust can be a useful tool in remedying socially constructed ignorance.

AB  - This study examines differences in prejudice, perceived similarity, and social dominance in members of the majority who favor integration as a means of minority acculturation. A total of 342 non-Gypsy Spanish participants filled out a questionnaire about their relationship to one of three outgroups: Maghrebians, Gypsies, and Latin Americans. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that a three-cluster solution was most fitting for every outgroup. ANOVAs applied to the three clusters indicated significant differences in prejudice, perceived similarity, and social dominance. Referring to Gypsies the largest effect size was observed in manifest prejudice (eta(2) = .63), in Maghrebians, the largest effect size was observed in subtle prejudice (eta(2) =.77), while for Latin Americans, perceived similarity had the largest effect size eta(2) ( = .60). The results reveal a need to modify existing measures of integration; we recommend using questionnaires to measure behaviors that members of the majority would be willing to implement.

AB  - Northern Ireland has been and remains a religiously divided community. This study sets out to examine outgroup prejudice among a sample of 1799 13-15-year-old students attending Catholic or Protestant schools and employs both bivariate analyses and hierarchical modelling to chart the associations between outgroup prejudice and personal factors (sex and age), psychological factors (extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism), and religious factors (affiliation, church attendance, and personal prayer). After taking personal, psychological, and religious factors into account, little variance in levels of outgroup prejudice between students could be attributed to the type of school they attended.

AB  - Objective and Background:Patterns of brain-damaged individuals' deficits in categorizing living versus non-living things indicate separation of semantic knowledge categories in the brain. Recent work in patients with dementia suggested that semantic knowledge about social groups differs from knowledge about living and non-living things. In this study we analyzed patients' social appraisal by testing whether their degree of impairment in social-group knowledge predicted their social-group evaluative reactions (prejudice). We hypothesized that impaired knowledge about social groups would correlate with either heightened or reduced prejudice.Methods:In Rumiati et al, Cogn Neurosci (2014) http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17588928.2013.876981, we had given a sorting task to 21 patients with frontotemporal dementia or dementia of the Alzheimer type and 23 healthy controls, to test their knowledge of social groups and living and non-living things. In this study we asked the same participants to evaluate social groups. We used controls' evaluations to rank 20 social groups from extremely negative to extremely positive. We used patients' severity of deficit in sorting social groups to predict the patients' evaluations of the groups, controlling for their levels of deficit in sorting living and non-living items. We also compared the evaluations by patientsdeficits in social-group sorting to controls' evaluations.Results:The patients with impaired social-group knowledge evaluated the less-admired groups more positively than did controls, and the more-admired groups less positively.Conclusions:Impaired social-group knowledge, not a general semantic loss, predicts reduced evaluative bias. Our findings are consistent with neuroimaging evidence for a relationship between semantic and evaluative social-group processes.

AB  - Using correlational and experimental data, we examined the degree to which personal and perceived normative support for the acculturation ideologies of assimilation, multiculturalism, and colorblindness mediated and moderated the relationship between social dominance orientation (SDO) and prejudice among 299 White students at three American colleges. Correlational results indicated that personal support for the acculturation ideologies mediated the SDO-prejudice relationship. Personal support for assimilation (a hierarchy-enhancing ideology) positively related to SDO; multiculturalism and colorblindness (hierarchy-attenuating ideologies) negatively related to SDO. An experimental manipulation varied whether assimilation, multiculturalism, or colorblindness was considered normative in the United States. In addition to a control, a fifth condition primed the Obama presidency. SDO related most strongly to prejudice toward American immigrants and ethnic minorities when assimilation norms and the Obama presidency were primed. Efforts to reduce the associations between SDO and prejudice are discussed in terms of highlighting hierarchy-attenuating national norms of multiculturalism and colorblindness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It has been suggested that the relation between personality and prejudice varies as a function of identity salience but previous empirical results are not conclusive. Extending previous research, we conducted an experimental study (N = 122) with pre- and post-manipulation measures of personality, and a post-manipulation measurement of prejudice, under conditions of control (no identity manipulation), personal or national identity. The results revealed no differences in the magnitude of the personality-prejudice correlations across conditions, neither for the pre- nor post-manipulation scores. Correlations based on pre- and post-manipulation variables, within each condition, did not differ significantly either. This indicates that neither prejudice nor personality variables were affected by identity salience. Thus, the study provides no support for the contention that the personality-prejudice relation varies as a function of social identity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Researchers in the evolutionary sciences have long understood men's desire to mate with a variety of women. Because men's obligatory investment in offspring production is relatively small, men can directly increase their number of descendants by mating with multiple partners. Relatively less is known, however, about the conditions that favor sexual variety seeking in women. Drawing on insights from evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology, we examined the relationship between the perceived pathogen load in an environment and women's desire for sexual variety. Across 5 experiments, we primed women with cues indicating that the rate of disease is increasing in their environment. We then measured their desire for novel sexual and dating partners. Results revealed that women with a history of vulnerability to illness respond to these cues by desiring a greater number of novel partners. This shift was not found in men and did not predict variety seeking in a nonsexual domain. In addition to providing evidence of a novel conceptual link between the pathogen load and patterns of human mating behavior, this research also provides new insights into women's mating psychology and the conditions that favor sexual variety seeking in the greater investing sex.

AB  - The present study draws on socio-cultural theories and socio-cognitive theories as guiding frameworks to examine responses to bias-based bullying among 481 middle school youth (49% female; 15% immigrant; 36% minoritized ethnicity). Based on student self-report data, we examined: (1) whether middle-schoolers response strategies' from the perspective of the victim being excluded or bullied varied across three hypothetical bias-based bullying scenarios based on participant's immigrant background and gender and by target victim's ethnic im/migrant background (e.g. Arab, Latinx, Black); and (2) whether youth disclosure of actual bullying experiences (i.e. to whom they disclosed their bullying experience) differed by their immigrant background and gender. Findings revealed that none of the immigrant girls reported that they would hit the excluder from the perspective of the Latina hypothetical victim compared to when the hypothetical victim was Black and Arab. In response to their actual experiences, immigrant girls were least likely to tell anyone (e.g. peer, teacher, or parent) if they were bullied at school. Results highlight the importance of fostering family and school administration awareness of bullying victimization and the creation of culturally sensitive school interventions and policies for reporting and preventing the bullying victimization of immigrant children, particularly for immigrant girls.

AB  - Introduction This study explored the impact of sexual orientation and cultural context on the way lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), and heterosexual cisgender adults without children from Portugal, Israel, and the UK anticipate the parenting experience. Higher levels of parenthood aspirations (e.g., desires and intentions) and more positive perceptions of the parenting experience (e.g., emotional enrichment upon having children) have been reported among heterosexual individuals than LGB ones and more so in familistic societies than in individualistic ones. However, perceptions of the parenting experience have rarely been examined across different cultural contexts. Methods One-hundred and sixty-eight adults without children (57 self-reported as LGB) in Portugal were matched on sociodemographic variables with 168 participants from the UK and 168 participants from Israel, resulting in a convenience sample of N = 504 (heterosexual: n = 333, M-age = 27.48, SD = 5.47; LGB: n = 171, M-age = 29.77, SD = 7.12). Results Overall, participants from Israel and Portugal, as well as heterosexual participants in general, perceived parenting in a more positive way than either their counterparts in the UK or LGB participants, respectively. Parallel patterns also appeared separately for LGB and heterosexual participants, with higher levels of social support and lower levels of stigma anticipated in both Portugal and Israel than the UK. Conclusions Both sexual orientation and the socio-cultural context are associated with parenting perceptions. However, the effect of the cultural context seems to surmount that of sexual orientation, with both LGB and heterosexual individuals from more familistic countries anticipating parenthood in a more positive way, than their peers from the UK. Policy Implications Repercussions of the findings include consideration of the needs of prospective LGB parents in terms of social support, culturally competent and affirmative interventions regarding LGB parenthood, and policies targeting prejudice and counteracting heteronormativity.

AB  - Among sexual minorities, bisexual individuals experience higher rates of victimization and symptoms of PTSD than their lesbian and gay peers as well as heterosexual individuals. Despite these disparities, little work has examined factors contributing to PTSD symptoms among bisexual adults. The current study examined the associations between bisexual-specific minority stress and PTSD symptoms in a sample of adults with bisexual orientation and tested social support as a potential mediator of this association. Participants were 488 adults (378 cisgender women, 49 cisgender men, 61 transgender individuals), ages 18 to 66 years, with bisexual orientation based on identity and/or attraction to multiple genders. Greater anti-bisexual prejudice was associated with greater PTSD symptoms (beta = 0.16) and lower social support (beta = -.16), while accounting for sociodemographics and sexual identity-based victimization. Social support was associated with lower PTSD symptoms (beta = -.25), while accounting for sociodemographics, sexual identity-based victimization, and anti-bisexual prejudice. Mediation analyses indicated that anti-bisexual prejudice was indirectly associated with greater PTSD symptoms through lower social support. Addressing bisexual-specific minority stress and its role in diminishing social support for bisexual individuals represents a critical component of trauma-informed research and intervention development in the bisexual community.

AB  - When women teach management in U.S. business schools they are likely to experience more gender inequities than men. In this essay we examine three dimensions of management teaching where gender inequities are likely to occur: (1) student-faculty interactions; (2) student evaluations of teaching; and (3) interactions between faculty peers. The types of inequities experienced by women when they teach include feeling social pressure to submit to ad hoc student demands for personal favors and emotional support that infringe on a professor's time; having their teaching performance judged from student evaluations of teaching that are subject to gender bias; and experiencing lower levels of organizational inclusion compared to their male colleagues. We utilize theoretical logic from social role theory, relational practice, and perceived organizational inclusion frameworks supported by the research literature to provide greater insight as to why women are likely to experience more adversity when they teach management in business schools. After we explain the basis for gender inequities we prescribe action steps that should improve equity for all faculty who teach management. Finally, we provide a call-to-action for business school administrators to implement action steps to make an equitable teaching culture a reality.

TI  - Feelings and perceptions of French parents of internationally adopted children with special needs (SN): Navigating the triple stigma of foreignness, adoption, and disability
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
LA  - English

AB  - Introduction: Both adoption status and ethnic differences may contribute to stigmatization and microaggressions experienced by adopted individuals and their families. Internationally adopted children have been increasingly recognized to have elevated rates of special needs (SN), especially learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotional-behavioral problems, and medical-physical issues. However, relatively little is known about the feelings, perceptions, and stigma experienced by families of internationally adopted children with SN.
   Methods: 461 French parents responded to a questionnaire (308 on-line, 153 paper) regarding their feelings and perceptions after international adoption (feelings of difference, ease of attachment, similarities to and dissimilarities from their child), as well as their views of their child's feelings and experiences (difference, exclusion, and prejudice). Parents were asked if their children were diagnosed by professionals as having special needs, specifically: (1) medical/physical conditions, (2) ADHD, (3) learning disabilities, or (4) emotional-behavioral difficulties. Results were compared for parents of children with or without SN.
   Results: The children (57%M; 43%F) of the parent respondents were adopted from 47 countries. The children were age (mean +/- SD) 3.19 +/- 2.59 years old at arrival and 11.33 +/- 5.03 years old at the time of the survey. 301 (65%) parents reported that their child had at least one SN: physical-medical SN (13% of children) were reported significantly less often than the other 3 categories (ADHD 39%, learning disabilities 36%, emotional-behavioral problems 40%). Overall, parents reported 652 distinct SN among these 301 children: 102/301 (34%) had a diagnosis in a single category, whereas 199/301 (66%) had diagnoses in at least two categories. SN diagnoses varied by continent of origin: Eastern European children had proportionally more ADHD, learning disabilities, and emotional-behavior problems, as well as more diagnoses per child. Compared with parents of non-SN children, parents of SN children (especially those with learning disabilities or emotional-behavioral problems) significantly more often endorsed feelings of difference, more difficulties attaching to their child, and fewer similarities to and more dissimilarities from their child. The SN parents also more often reported that their child experienced exclusion and/or prejudice. The more SN diagnosed in their children, the more likely their parents' feelings and perceptions differed from parents of children without SN. These relationships remained significant after controlling for arrival age, current age, gender, and adoption visibility, and after adjusting for exclusion due to adopted status or country of origin.
   Conclusions: Compared to adoptive parents of children without SN, parents of children with SN report differing patterns of perceptions and feelings. Child SN represent an additional burden for parents of internationally adopted children, and for their children's feelings and experiences (difference, exclusion, and prejudice, as reported by the parents). These perceptions and feelings are present, even when the SN are not physically obvious. SN must be recognized as an increasingly common, complex, and added dimension to the issues of adoptive status and (often) ethnic differences faced by internationally adopted children and their parents.

AB  - Responding to international calls for critical thinking programs to address social polarisations and extremism through education, this article examines the cognitive and socio-psychological foundations of a critical thinking programme for secondary schools in England called "Living Well With Difference" (LWWD). The aim of LWWD is to develop critical thinking about issues of social polarisation, prejudice and any kind of extreme thinking. These issues often involve the interaction of emotion and thinking, which is understood using a dual systems framework, illustrated with examples of course methodology and content. The learning process aims to promote more cognitively flexible, complex and integrated thinking, measured by integrative complexity, and is supported by meta-awareness to enable emotion management. The aim is for participants to engage with difficult social issues through structured group activities, while becoming aware of social, emotional, textual, visual and rhetorical influences to increase Media Information Literacy, as a foundation for engaging with differing perspectives in order to reduce barriers between groups in society.

AB  - The role of the military as a 'school for the nation' has been debated in many contexts. It seems that, at best, the effect of military service on bridging social schisms and promoting national cohesion is limited. However, despite scholarship, many Israelis believe that their military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has caused them to accept members of out-groups as part of their own in-group. Likewise, some Western countries have begun to discuss reinstating conscription for similar reasons. This paper examines the extended effect of contact hypothesis in the military, both in practice and as an element capable of bringing about a change in veterans' thinking. It asks: are veterans who had diverse friendships during their service more willing to have diverse friendships in the future? If so, do they attribute their ability and willingness to include others within their in-group to their military service? Based on the findings from a study of Israeli undergraduates, the paper demonstrates that while indeed service friendships ('army buddies') may be short-lived, service alongside members of out-groups has certain longer-term effects and influences the social perception of veterans, in both positive and negative ways. This seems to indicate that conscription can have social effects and impacts veterans' social thinking.

AB  - Prejudice towards Muslim people in Western countries is common and increasing. This paper describes an educational intervention aimed at increasing positive attitudes and actions to support Muslim Australians. University students participated in a 12-week educational programme that drew on prejudice reduction principles and a pedagogical approach that emphasised active discussion. Results (N = 94) showed an increase in positivity towards Muslim people, increased intention to take bystander action to confront prejudice, and social identification (as a supporter of positive relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Australians). Boosts in positivity towards Muslim people and intention to confront prejudice were mediated by increases in social identity, although changes in social identification only explained increased commitment to confront prejudice in a low risk scenario. Results suggest that educational interventions such as these can foster new, inclusive identities that provide a basis for action to support Muslim people.

AB  - Introduction The intergroup contact variable has been widely studied in the literature, and it has been shown to be closely related to less prejudice. The present article analyzes the role of an affective mediator in the relationship between the degree of contact-rejection of the outgroup (same-sex parents) variables, linked to the variable quality of contact or satisfaction with contact with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Methods The sample is composed of 401 Spanish university students (67 males, 16.2%, and 347 females, 83.8%) with a mean age of 21 years (SD = 3.20). The data collection took place between November 2016 and March 2017. Results The results show a complete mediation effect in the case of open or traditional prejudice (individual opposition), and partial mediation when analyzing modern or subtle rejection of same-sex parents (normative opposition). Conclusions Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce the rejection of same-sex parents must take into account the individual's positive evaluation of the contact because it is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between degree of contact and rejection. Social policy implications Homophobia intervention programs must consider the intergroup contact variable, taking into account that it is also necessary to act on positive emotions and affectivity toward relationships with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Increasing positive contact with same-sex parents could be a key element in reducing rejection toward the effects of their child-rearing on their children.

AB  - The health threats of radiation-release incidents are diverse and long term. In addition to direct radiation effects, it is imperative to manage the indirect effects of radiation such as stigma, prejudice and broader mental health impacts. Six years after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident of March 2011, bullying caused by stigma and prejudice toward evacuees, including children, has become a social problem in Japan. This phenomenon may be associated with the fact that knowledge about radiation has still not reached the general public, and to a potential lack of motivation among Japanese citizens to learn about radiation and bullying. Continuous and sustained education regarding radiation is warranted in order to enhance the general knowledge level about the effects of radiation in Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, and this education will become an important reference for education after future nuclear disasters.

AB  - Few studies have examined lesbians' and gay men's parental decision-making processes. Our goal in this work was to review what literature says about this understudied area of research. We first looked at transformations that have made it possible for lesbian- and gay-parented families to gain visibility. We then described how parental aspirations of lesbians and gay men have been operationalized. Factors shaping parental decisions were categorized as sociodemographic (gender, age and cohort, and race/ethnicity), personal (internalization of anti-homosexual prejudice and openness about one's non-heterosexual orientation), relational (one's partner's parental motivation and social support), and contextual (work conditions, access to LGBT support networks, information and resources, and social, legal, and medical barriers). Research findings were discussed and implications for future research and social policies regarding the issue of prospective lesbian and gay parenthood were drawn.

AB  - The reduction of racial prejudice is an important challenge of intercultural education. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze racial prejudice, as well as the different profiles and the possible educational implications in secondary school students. A total of 327 third form students completed the scales of blatant and subtle prejudice and also a scale of emotions towards North Africans. The results showed significant levels of subtle prejudice and four profiles of racial prejudice, with a low number of students showing equalitarian tendencies. A multivariate analysis showed significant differences in prejudice depending on social distance as well as the academic level of the participants' families. Finally, we discuss the results from the perspective of intercultural education and we suggest some lines of intervention in order to promote the integration of students from different cultures.

AB  - We investigated gender differences in the association between gender-segregated peer preferences and sexism in adolescents (15-17 years, 60 boys and 85 girls). To assess gender-segregated peer preferences, adolescents nominated peers for interaction in two contexts: hanging out' at home and working on a school project. The Modern Sexism Scale [Swim, J. K., K. J. Aikin, W. S. Hall, and B. A. Hunter. 1995. Sexism and Racism: Old-Fashioned and Modern Prejudices. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 68 (2): 199-214] measured two dimensions of sexism: Antagonism towards Women's Demands (believing feminist issues are unimportant) and denial of continuing discrimination (believing gender discrimination no longer exists). For boys, Antagonism towards Women's Demands was associated with gender-segregated peer preferences in the school and home context. For girls, Denial of Continuing Discrimination was associated with gender-segregated peer preferences in the home context. Results are informative for educators and for other professionals interested in reducing inequality and sexism among adolescents.

AB  - This article examines the experiences of Traveller children in schools. It uses data from two studies (one in Scotland and the other in England) to examine Traveller children's views about attending school (particularly in relation to their values and ambitions), their experiences of racism and prejudice and their views on how teachers perceive them. In our research, we draw from case study data to argue that despite public policy discourse around citizenship, the reality is one in which Traveller children continue to be viewed as outsiders. Due to this positioning, they do not enjoy the same rights as other children and they are not regarded as full citizens in the school environment. We argue that in order for schools to consider issues of diversity and inclusion, they must address ways in which Traveller children can be included as full citizens in schools, particularly in relation to their marginalised position in society.

AB  - Conventional behavior theories that assert adolescent risk behaviors are determined by peer and parental relationships are being challenged as research begins to consider broader socioenvironmental factors. This study, using data from the Longitudinal Study for Adolescent Health (Add Health), Wave II, Public Use Data, and the Social Determinants of Adolescent Risk Behaviors (SDOARB) framework, examines relationships among socioeconomic status (SES), academic performance, perceived peer prejudice, and perceived teacher discrimination as predictors of depressive symptoms among high school adolescents. Overall, the study found that GPA was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms across all three racial groups (Black, White, and Other Minority). Teacher discrimination predicted depressive symptoms among White and Other minority adolescents, but not Black adolescents. These findings suggest the need for interventions within schools for both students and teachers around racial differences in perceptions of prejudice and discrimination. Failure to address overt and covert subtleties of discrimination and prejudice within schools and policies which affect these interpersonal dynamics may have a significant impact on the overall mental wellbeing of adolescents.

AB  - Background: The attitudes toward people with epilepsy are influenced by the degree of knowledge of the condition. The social problems encountered by school children with epilepsy as a result of negative attitude and beliefs are quite enormous. Objectives The study therefore looked at the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of teachers, who see a lot of epileptics, relate to them on a daily basis and have influence on them. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered questionnaire obtained from the author of a similar study in the United States, was carried out among 269 school teachers randomly selected from various secondary schools in Osogbo, the Osun State capital in South-West Nigeria. The questionnaire included the scale of attitudes toward persons with epilepsy and knowledge about epilepsy as well as demographic and teaching experience survey among others. Results Despite the high level of education of the teachers ranging from Masters Degree to National Certificate in Education, there were significant deficits in terms of general knowledge about epilepsy (70 of the respondents reported their general knowledge about epilepsy in the lower half of the scale). There was also poor knowledge of the first aids measures in the classrooms. Below one-third (29.2) felt it was contagious and 40 of respondents reported that sufferers should not be kept in regular classes. However, their attitudes toward epilepsy were generally positive. Conclusions and Recommendations: We concluded that teachers need to have health education courses on common disease conditions such as epilepsy that are prevalent in school age; this might help to reduce the prejudice and increase the acceptance of epileptic individuals in the classrooms. Also, generally public health campaigns should be encouraged in this field.

AB  - Data from the New Canadian Children and Youth Study (NCCYS), a national study of immigrant children and youth in Canada, are used to examine the mental health salience of putatively universal determinants, as well as of immigration-specific factors. Universal factors (UF) include age, gender, family and neighbourhood characteristics. Migration-specific (MS) factors include ethnic background, acculturative stress, prejudice, and the impact of region of resettlement within Canada.
   In a sample of children from Hong Kong, the Philippines and Mainland China, the study examined the determinants of emotional problems (EP), and physical aggression (PA). A two-step regression analysis entered UF on step 1, and MS variables on step 2.
   Universal factors accounted for 12.1% of EP variance. Addition of MS variables increased explained variance to 15.6%. Significant UF predictors: parental depression, family dysfunction, and parent's education. Significant MS variables: country of origin, region of resettlement, resettlement stress, prejudice, and limited linguistic fluency. UF accounted for 6.3% of variance in PA scores. Adding migration-specific variables increased variance explained to 9.1%. UF: age, gender, parent's depression, family dysfunction. MS: country of origin, region of resettlement, resettlement stress, and parent's perception of prejudice.
   Net of the effect of factors affecting the mental health of most, if not all children, migration-specific variables contribute to understanding immigrant children's mental health.

AB  - School violence is a global public health epidemic, with students with disabilities at a significantly greater risk than their non-disabled peers. Students with disabilities are more vulnerable to school violence from peers, teachers, and school staff due to stereotypes and prejudice. Teachers are pivotal in preventing violence and intervening, but literature on the role that teachers play in responding to disability-based violence is limited. Guided by the social-ecological framework of bullying, this qualitative study explored educators' responses to school violence against students with disabilities in Zambia. Data generation included document review, interviews, and focus groups with 33 teachers and 12 parents, and child-friendly methods with 90 students with disabilities. Findings illuminated that students with disabilities are less safe in schools. Teachers are not responding to violence seen or heard about due to stigmatizing beliefs and cultural norms surrounding disability and violence, with students with disabilities blamed for the violence and the response being their burden. Students with disabilities felt protected by special education teachers; however, disability-based stigma did not end with the student. By association, special education teachers were experiencing stigma from other teachers and were discouraged to respond. This stigma undermined the support special education teachers could provide to decrease school violence. Findings provide direction so teachers can respond to school violence in prosocial ways that create an environment where students with disabilities feel safe.

AB  - In an attempt to address the paucity of research examining the childhood experience of people living with albinism within family context, the present study explored family-based violence and prejudicial treatments against children born with albinism in Nigeria. In addition, issues that traumatized children with albinism (CWA) within their family setting, and the coping strategies they found effective were identified. The research was located within an interpretive qualitative paradigm and framed within the theories of 'othering,' self-esteem, and family system. Interviews were conducted with 62 adults living with albinism who were raised in family settings. The prejudicial treatments and family-based violent behaviors experienced by participants were explored, and a thematic analysis of the narratives was carried out. Findings confirm the existence of family violence and prejudice regarding albinism. Prejudices on albinism were found to result in parents denying CWA of educational and vocational sponsorship, cordial family relationship, social interactions and attendance of social events. Family members' perceptions of CWA were reportedly influenced by social and religious inclinations. Families were found not to be only violent with CWA but also facilitating institutional violence by religious organizations. Participants expressed developing emotional problems like paranoia, anger, depression, feelings of powerlessness, and low self-esteem, while they utilized varieties of emotion-oriented coping strategies during their childhood experiences. CWA are subjected to prejudice and violence within their families that are unique and deserving of research and policy interventions. Therefore, family-based orientations, screening for family violence, religious and social groups' support for people living with albinism (PWA) were suggested.

AB  - This paper brings an ethnographic experience to bear on the existing research field of school bullying, rounding out our understanding by focusing on an essential aspect: children's culture. Based on 14 months of fieldwork and a close analysis of the case of Anat, a 9-year-old victim of bullying, the paper identifies a unique formation of school bullying with no leading bully. Drawing from theoretical approaches which focus on pupils' everyday life, the paper asserts that bullying without a leading bully is rooted in children's culture which effectively enforces bullying as a binding norm by constructing its object as disgusting. The paper explores how disgust shapes school bullying into a collective omnipresent rejection. It also discusses intervention programmes and suggests that within such a social position, one practice to consider would be transferring to a new environment where bullied pupils will not be forced to cope with collectively enforced prejudices.

AB  - The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has brought increased incidents of racism, discrimination, and violence against "Asians," particularly in the United States, with reports of hate crimes of over 100 per day. Since January 2020, many Asian Americans have reported suffering racial slurs, wrongful workplace termination, being spat on, physical violence, extreme physical distancing, etc., as media and government officials increasingly stigmatize and blame Asians for the spread of Covid-19. The links with social media are increasingly evident, as anti-Asian sentiment increases, with reports of anti-Asian sentiment spreading and Asian-Americans fighting hate via social media. Using integrated threat theory, this study explores the links between prejudice/hate toward Asians-Americans, in particular Chinese, and social media use. Three key results emerged from the study. First, the more a social media user believes their most used daily social media is fair, accurate, presents the facts, and is concerned about the public (social media believe), the more likely that user is to believe Chinese pose a realistic and symbolic threat to America. Second, men and women significantly differed on each type of prejudice, with men scoring higher on intergroup anxiety and women higher on symbolic and realistic threat. Third, respondents who do not use social media on a daily basis are less likely than those who use Facebook to perceive Chinese as a symbolic threat. Implications and recommendations for practitioners, health workers and government are proposed.

AB  - In the face of movements like #me too and Time's Up, clinicians are challenged to navigate the intricacies of socio-political multi-dimensionalities of prejudice and the ways prejudice weaves through various aspects of psychological work. In this paper, I suggest that the intersubjective experience of prejudice is a collapse of thirdness, a collapse of the dialectical recognition of sameness and difference, or self and other. Furthermore, leaning on principles of intersubjectivity and relational psychoanalysis, I also offer a refinement of the concept of thirdness in relation to prejudice by pointing to the need to bring into focus larger socio-political currents and layers of experience that are intricately woven into the fabric of thirdness, thus constituting a social thirdness. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding the clinical pertinence, as well as collapse and repair of social thirdness in the context of gender and sexuality. I will use several carefully disguised clinical examples to illustrate these ideas and their relevance to psychotherapeutic work.

AB  - Research has documented an overlap between people's aversion toward nonsocial pattern deviancy (e.g., a row of triangles with 1 triangle out of line) and their social prejudice. It is unknown which processes underlie this association, however, and whether this link is causal. We propose that pattern deviancy aversion may contribute to prejudice by heightening people's dislike of statistical minorities. Infrequent people in a population are pattern deviant in that they disrupt the statistical regularities of how people tend to look, think, and act in society, and this deviancy should incite others' prejudice. Nine studies (N = 1,821) supported this mediation. In Studies 1.1 and 1.2, adults' and young children's nonsocial pattern deviancy aversion related to disliking novel statistical minorities, and this dislike predicted prejudice against Black people. Studies 1.3 and 1.4 observed this mediation when experimentally manipulating pattern deviancy aversion, although pattern deviancy aversion did not directly impact racial prejudice. Study-set 2 replicated the proposed mediation in terms of prejudice against other commonly stigmatized individuals (e.g., someone with a physical disability). Importantly, we also found pattern deviancy aversion to affect such prejudice. Study-set 3 provided additional support for the mediation model. Pattern deviancy aversion predicted prejudice dependent on group-size, for instance, greater racial prejudice in cases where Black people are the statistical minority, but decreased racial prejudice when Black people are the statistical majority. Taken together, these findings indicate that people's aversion toward pattern deviancy motivates prejudice, and that this influence is partially driven by a dislike of statistical minorities.

AB  - Australia is one of the last Western countries to legalize marriage between same-sex couples. Research suggests that the delay in marriage equality may be a consequence of societies' conceptual connection between marriage and family being an ultimately heterosexual experience. The aim of this study was to investigate attitudes toward same-sex parenting within the marriage equality debate. Members of an Australian sample (n = 436) were randomly allocated to 1 of 9 conditions, where they received a vignette of either a heterosexual couple, a male same-sex couple, or female same-sex couple in 1 of 3 family structures (marriage/no children; marriage/children; no marriage/children). Participants rated their level of acceptance toward their allocated vignette, deciding whether the couple deserved the same rights as anyone else. Results demonstrated a significant division between acceptance of same-sex couples and heterosexual couples getting married and having children, with more negative attitudes toward same-sex couples present. Findings also highlighted a prejudice toward couples having children out of wedlock, regardless of sexual orientation of the couple. The implication for marriage equality advocates is challenging society attitudes toward marriage and family, by educating the community about same-sex parenting as well as parenting beyond marriage.

AB  - A sample of adoptive parents, including an oversampling of lesbian mothers (n = 125), was surveyed regarding their family's school experiences related to adoption, satisfaction with how the school handled adoption-related issues, and their child's experiences with teasing at school. Linear and logistic regression analyses showed that lesbian mothers were more likely than heterosexual parents and gay fathers to disclose their child's adoption status in the school record and to ensure that the school was aware of the child's adoption. Lesbian mothers were also more likely than heterosexual parents and gay fathers to report talking to teachers about adoption issues. There were no differences as a function of parent sexual orientation regarding rates of children being teased about adoption status. However, rates of teasing regarding child race/ethnicity were higher for children of lesbian mothers and gay fathers than for children of heterosexual parents. The implications of the findings for future research and the provision of services for lesbian mothers are considered.

AB  - Objective To describe the issues associated with heightened levels of discriminatory behaviors and their effects on children and youth. We then describe efforts to ameliorate discriminatory behaviors at the school level, placing emphasis on practices that can be implemented within current school initiatives. Method We employed a thematic review approach to examine the effects of discriminatory behaviors on children and youth, as well as on school-based practices employed to redress such behaviors. Results Schools can act as change agents to curb the negative experiences youth have with discrimination, hateful speech and actions, and harassment. Many schools are successfully addressing these issues through their use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, social and emotional learning programs, bullying prevention programs, and interventions, which are designed to positively influence discriminatory behaviors and biased attitudes. Conclusion Schools should address issues like harassment, bullying, racism, and discrimination through the use of programs or interventions designed to reduce them, in order to provide more equitable schooling experiences and more equitable educational outcomes for all.

AB  - Background/Objectives If people who hold anti-fat attitudes believe these attitudes to be true, then anti-prejudice appeals are likely to be unsuccessful, if only because the targets will not see their attitudes as in need of change. The current study examined processes that may lead people to see their anti-fat attitudes as 'truth' or as 'prejudice'. Subjects/Methods Participants (N = 482) read anti-fat statements and were then presented with an interpretation of these statements as 'truth' or 'prejudice'. The source of this interpretation was either an (i) in-group or out-group member and (ii) expert or non-expert. Participants' judgements of the statements were expected to vary such that in-group others and experts would exert more influence than would out-group others and non-experts. Results Participants aligned their own interpretations of an anti-fat statement with those of an expert, but not with those of a non-expert, F(1,466) = 8.97, p < 0.05, eta(2)(p) = 0.02. The group membership variable had no effect on judgements of 'truth' or 'prejudice' of the anti-fat statement. Conclusion The expressions that people believe constitute anti-fat prejudice versus truth about people described as overweight are influenced by exposure to expert opinion (in this case, by medical doctors). Implications for the success of weight-based anti-prejudice appeals and for healthcare provision are discussed.

AB  - Same-sex parenthood is controversial subject. In this paper, we provide insights into the attitudes and experiences of self-reported lesbians regarding parenthood or the prospect of becoming a parent in the current Greek social and cultural context. In Greece, lesbians are not allowed access to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), while a solitary ('single') woman is allowed access for medical reasons. Fifty-nine (59) semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with women. What emerged from our data was a clear trend for participants to wish to have their own biological children based mostly on the belief that pregnancy would lead to a sense of self-completeness and/or fulfilment. Women also reported the negative impact of prejudice and social oppression on their reproductive autonomy. Interviewees reported that their reproductive choices were negatively influenced by their family and the wider socio-cultural environment. Even within a semi-permissive legal framework, impaired social acceptance of lesbian parenthood prohibits lesbians from becoming mothers. A major reason responsible for the positive attitude of most participants to shared biological motherhood was an altruistic attitude towards their partners.

AB  - Mindfulness is associated with being less judgmental and with a reduction in feelings of anxiety. It is believed to increase non-judgmental cognitive processing and reduce negative associations as a consequence of automatic processing. We hypothesized that mindfulness is negatively correlated with prejudiced attitudes. In a series of five studies, with sample sizes ranging from 93 to 184, participants from Prolific, psychology research sites, or college completed measures online. We examined the relation of three mindfulness measures, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills with three markers of prejudice: attitudes to outgroups, an affective thermometer scale, and social worldviews. The attitudinal instrument focused on stigmatized groups, such as newcomers, homeless persons, handicapped individuals, and Blacks. The affective thermometer measured feelings of warmth to individuals classified as dissident, derogated, or dangerous. The two social worldviews assessed were Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism, both associated with prejudice. Few significant associations were found. The only significant associations found were between the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, and Social Dominance Orientation. These findings provide little support for the relation between trait mindfulness and attitudinal expressions of prejudice.

AB  - Secularism in France is both a state principle and a cultural construct, that enforces a State neutrality towards religion. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of a lay conception called 'New Secularism' (NS) that is used to legitimize expression of prejudice towards North African minorities. However, none have been able to yet demonstrate links between NS and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), which would further corroborate those beliefs' role as prejudice justification. Using Social Representations Theory, we created a Secularism questionnaire and used it in a cross sectional survey (N = 261) that also included SDO and Generalized Prejudice measures. In order to test social representation of Secularism's legitimizing function, we derived the hypothesis that NS will mediate the link between SDO and expressed Prejudice from a Social Dominance perspective. Results support our predictions and are discussed in light of intergroup status quo legitimization processes and their links with social representations.

AB  - Guided by the contact hypothesis, this study examined host culture adoption of Chinese students sojourning in France as a mediator between their host-national contact (i.e., face-to-face contact and online contact) and social connectedness, perceived social support and reduced prejudice in the mainstream society. We also examined whether face-to-face contact served as a moderator that modified the impacts of online contact. A group of 211 Chinese students in France responded to a web-based survey. Results from structural equation modeling analysis revealed that face-to-face contact significantly predicted Chinese students' adoption of the host culture. Host culture adoption, in turn, influenced social connectedness, perceived social support and prejudice. In contrast, online contact was not predictive of host culture adoption, but had significant direct effects on social connectedness, perceived social support and prejudice. However, direct face-to-face contact did not moderate the relationship between online contact and the predicted variables. Bootstrapping methods were employed to investigate the mediating effects of host culture adoption and revealed that host culture adoption was a full mediator between face-to-face contact and the outcome variables.

AB  - The prejudices about mental illness and the related social stigma are still present in the population. People suffer from both the disease and the marginalization behaviors implemented by the "so-called healthy" towards them and their relatives. Even psychiatric professionals can get sick and suffer for the same reason. The authors of this multicentric study have focused their attention on the presence or absence of groups of psychiatric pathologies among the "insiders". The most frequent pathologies encountered were the mood and anxiety disorders, in a percentage similar to that of the general population. To continue the research on the stigma begun in a previous study, the authors asked themselves if there could be prejudices and/or stigma among psychiatric professionals towards sick colleagues, how they relate in the workplace and how they react to the behavior of colleagues. The stigma questionnaire has been used on psychiatric professionals, and 130 Italian colleagues were tested in the provinces of Avellino, Brindisi and Trento. The data were compared with those of the research on the stigma "Thinking of Psychiatric Disorders as" Normal "Illness" (Tavormina et al. 2016) and it emerged that among the attending professionals there are no statistically significant behaviors of marginalization, exclusion or stigma against sick colleagues, even if there is a certain discomfort in working together. Above all, it emerged that 80% of the interviewees, who have had work experience with sick colleagues, have replied that the latter can treat those who are also sick of their own disease, thus showing esteem and confidence in their work, in analogy with the Jungian thesis of the "wounded Healer" in the myth of the centaur Chiron.

AB  - This article describes and attempts to explain the reasons for the conservative and nationalist character of Polish schools. The author uses data from surveys, analyzes political programs, postulates concerning education put forward by conservatives, and quotes poems emphasizing national identity from textbooks used at schools to teach reading skills. According to the author, it can be observed that nationalists build an atmosphere of aversion to immigrants, which affects racism in the school hallways. The article also presents the phenomenon of so-called school chambers of national remembrance, which are part of patriotic rituals practiced by Polish society. The author emphasizes that nationalism is the basis for changes in history programs of study, which are part of the educational reform implemented by the Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc - PiS) government. The cultural soft power, which is used to make reality more "national," complements the administrative and political hard power of the PiS party - both tools are used to create an authoritarian-nationalist vision of social order.

AB  - This article discusses the role of child protection and residential care institutions in mediating the tension between women's productive and reproductive responsibilities in early state socialist Hungary. At a time when increasing numbers of women entered paid work in the framework of catch-up industrialization but the socialization of care work was inadequate, these institutions substituted for missing public child care services. Relying on not only policy documents but more than six hundred children's case files, including Romani children's files, from three different locations in Hungary as well as interviews with former children's home residents and personnel, the article examines the regulatory framework in which child protection institutions and caseworkers operated. It points to the differentiated forms of pressure these institutions exercised on Romani and non-Romani mothers to enter paid work between the late 1940s and the early 1950s from the intersectional perspective of gender and ethnicity. Showing that prejudice against Gypsies as work-shy persisted in child protection work across the systemic divide of the late 1940s, the article contributes to scholarship on state socialism and Stalinism that emphasizes the role of historical continuities. At the same time, reflecting on parental invention in using child protection as a form of child care, the article also complicates a simplistic social control approach to residential care institutions in Stalinist Hungary.

AB  - Previous research has obtained mixed findings as to whether feelings of self-worth are positively or negatively related to right-wing ideological beliefs and prejudice. We propose to clarify the link between self-worth and ideology by distinguishing between narcissistic and non-narcissistic self-evaluations as well as between different dimensions of ideological attitudes. Four studies, conducted in three different socio-political contexts: the UK (Study 1, N = 422), the US (Studies 2 and 3, Ns = 471 and 289, respectively), and Poland (Study 4, N = 775), investigated the associations between narcissistic and non-narcissistic self-evaluations, social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and ethnic prejudice. Confirming our hypotheses, the results consistently showed that after controlling for self-esteem, narcissistic self-evaluation was positively associated with SDO (accounting for RWA), yet negatively associated with RWA (accounting for SDO). These associations were similar after controlling for psychopathy and Machiavellianism (Study 3) as well as collective narcissism and Big Five personality characteristics (Study 4). Studies 2-4 additionally demonstrated that narcissistic self-evaluation was indirectly positively associated with prejudice through higher SDO (free of RWA) but indirectly negatively associated with prejudice through lower RWA (free of SDO). Implications for understanding the role of self-evaluation in right-wing ideological attitudes and prejudice are discussed. Copyright (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Psychological essentialism is a set of lay beliefs about categories, according to which certain categories are seen as natural and arising from an inborn, causal force or "essence." Social categories, including gender, are often essentialized by both adults and children. The current study examines how gender essentialism relates to other gender-relevant beliefs and preferences, in both a child sample (5- to 7-year-olds) and an adult sample (the children's parents). Children's and parents' essentialism predicted children's gender-typed preferences, but not children's prescriptive stereotyping. In contrast, parents' essentialism predicted their own prescriptive stereotyping, but not their gender-typed preferences. Implications of these findings are discussed in the contexts of (a) past findings linking essentialism with stereotyping and (b) the practical implications of developmental shifts in the correlates of essentialism, including ways in which stereotyping and rigid beliefs about gender may be reduced.

AB  - Until very recently, the New York City Police Department's Stop, Question, and Frisk policy (i.e., Stop-&-Frisk) allowed NYPD officers to legally stop and detain New Yorkers under the suspicion that they may be involved in criminal activity. Previous research found that New Yorkers' attitudes toward Stop-&-Frisk were generally mixed, and the current study tested whether authoritarianism, preferences for inequality, and prejudice predicted support for Stop-&-Frisk. One hundred forty-eight New York City college students reported their levels of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), prejudice, and support for the NYPD's Stop-&-Frisk policy. Both RWA and SDO had indirect effects through prejudice on support for Stop-&-Frisk. Limits and possible future developments of this research are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: To improve detection of child abuse and neglect (CAN), many emergency departments use screening methods. Apart from diagnostic accuracy, possible harms of screening methods are important to consider, especially because most children are not abused and do not benefit from screening. We performed a systematic literature review to assess parents' opinions about CAN screening, in which we could only include 7 studies, all reporting that the large majority of participating parents favor screening. Recently, a complete physical examination (called "top-toe" inspection [TTI], a fully undressed inspection of the child) was implemented as a CAN screening method at the emergency department of a teaching hospital in The Netherlands. This study describes parents' opinions about the TTI.
   Methods: We used a questionnaire to assess parents' opinions about the TTI of their children when visiting the emergency department. During the study period, 1000 questionnaires were distributed by mail.
   Results: In total, 372 questionnaires were returned (37%). A TTI was performed for 194 children (52%). The overall attitude of parents whose children underwent a TTI was positive; 77.3% of the respondents found the TTI acceptable, and 1.5% (N = 3) found it unacceptable. Seventy percent of the respondents agreed with the theorem that all children who visit the emergency department should have a TTI performed, and 7.3% (N = 14) disagreed.
   Discussion: Contrary to what is commonly believed, both in our systematic literature review and in our questionnaire study, the majority of participating parents agree with screening for CAN in general and with the TTI specifically. Sharing the results of this study with ED personnel and policy makers could take away prejudices about perceived disagreement of parents, thereby improving implementation of and adherence to CAN screening.

AB  - Previous research within a dual-process cognitive-motivational theory of ideology and prejudice has indicated that dimensions of generalized prejudice are structured around attitudes towards dangerous, derogated and dissident groups, and that these prejudice dimensions are differentially predicted by the ideological attitudes of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). However, to date, these findings have been restricted to New Zealand samples. We describe two studies examining whether the structure of prejudiced attitudes and the differential prediction by RWA and SDO replicate in the Brazilian context, incorporating context-relevant examples of each grouppoliticians, those from the northeast region of Brazil, and environmentalists. Results broadly supported the three-factor structure of dangerous, derogated, and dissident groups. Consistent with previous research, regression and structural equation analyses showed that RWA explained prejudice against dangerous groups, SDO explained prejudice against derogated groups, and both RWA and SDO explained prejudice against dissident groups. This research provides some evidence for the generalizability of the three-dimensional structure of generalized prejudice and differential prediction by RWA and SDO.

AB  - This study examined the imbalance of power thesis by investigating the link between ethnic classroom composition and peer victimization in 94 Turkish-Dutch (minority) and 374 native Dutch (majority) preadolescents (ages 9-13) living in the Netherlands. These children came from the same multi-ethnic classrooms (N = 31) and were considered as mutual out-group members. Analyses showed that children with more out-group classmates reported more peer victimization but only when those classmates evaluated their own ethnic group more positively than the out-group. This interaction effect was similar for minority and majority children, and no longer significant once children's experiences with ethnic peer discrimination were partialled out. Results indicate that ethnicity is not inevitably used as a criterion to victimize out-group members who are less well represented in the classroom. The findings partly support the imbalance of power thesis.

AB  - The compliance of parents with child passenger safety (CPS) has been mainly explained by their level of knowledge. Social, ethnic and cultural factors have not been investigated in detail. This study investigated the rate of compliance of parents with CPS guidelines, as well as the factors hindering it. Parents of infants aged 2-10 days were enrolled. The proportions of families obtaining a car safety seat (CSS; 57%) and complying with CPS recommendations (2%) were very low. Most of the parents thought CSS were harmful for infants (mother, 57%; father, 63%), despite having already purchased one. Parents believed their children to be too small to use CSS and cannot sit in CSS because they should lie flat on their backs at all times. These prejudices may be due to the social and cultural circumstances specific to Turkey, or corresponding findings may be found in countries with similar socioeconomic status.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is a skin disease affecting many young people and, if it continues into their twenties, can be a substantial barrier to social relationships. Although there is evidence that sufferers are adversely psychologically affected, what is less apparent from research to date is whether this is because of negative self-beliefs or the discriminatory attitudes of others. This study set out to explore how far young people with moderate acne are viewed less favourably compared to their clear-skinned peers. The design was quasi-experimental. The faces of two male and two female 21-year-old volunteers with clear skin were photographed and then photographed again after having had facial signs of moderate acne simulated by a professional make-up artist. Photographs of a male and female face were given to 143 participants who were divided randomly into two conditions: Clear and acne. The former were shown the unblemished faces and the latter were given the faces with acne. The participants were asked to estimate the age of the person in the photograph and then rate the volunteer on a scale of 16 personality items. It was found that the participants in the clear condition estimated the volunteers as two years older and more mature than in the acne condition. In terms of personality, the photographs in the clear condition were given higher scores for potential friendship, attractiveness and overall positive personality features than the photographs in the acne condition. The conclusion is that moderate acne vulgaris could be a potential barrier to social relationships for young people not simply because of their social anxiety but because they may well be meeting with prejudice. It is suggested that attitudes might be changed by more accurate information about the condition.

AB  - This study tested the effects of multiple ideologies on support for restrictive policies against gay and lesbian individuals and organizations and if these effects were mediated by sexual prejudice. Social dominance orientation (SDO), conservatism, and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) each had significant direct and indirect effects. SDO had the most consistent direct effects in addition to its effects through sexual prejudice. The direct effects of conservatism were smaller and similar in size to its indirect effects through prejudice. Although the direct effect of RWA was significant for policy attitudes, its effect was entirely mediated through sexual prejudice for organization opposition. Results suggest that high-RWA individuals adopt their positions largely because of prejudice toward sexual minorities, while high-SDO individuals adopt their positions partly out of prejudice and partly because these positions perpetuate hierarchies between heterosexuals and sexual minorities. Results also diminish the principled conservatism argument that conservative positions on these policies and organizations are absent of prejudice. As policies continue to be enacted that affect the sexual minority community, research is needed to identify the underlying motivations for individuals' positions toward these policies.

AB  - Adults and children seem to essentialize certain social categories. Three studies investigated whether, and how, exposure to ethnic diversity affects this bias. Participants were 516 kindergarten, 2nd grade, and 6th grade Israeli Jewish and Arab children attending regular (mono-cultural) or integrated schools. Study 1 revealed that exposure increased the salience of ethnicity, especially for Jewish children. Study 2 showed no differences among groups at kindergarten regarding the relevance of recalling a story character's ethnicity, but by 2nd grade, Jewish children attending integrated schools were the most likely to mention such information. Finally, Study 3 revealed that while all kindergarteners started off at a similar level of essentialism towards ethnicity, exposure affected Arab, but especially Jewish, children's essentialist beliefs. Moreover, there were negative correlations between the salience of and essentialism towards ethnicity. Thus, interethnic exposure alleviated children's essentialist bias towards ethnicity and did so via making children aware of, rather than blind to, ethnic categories.

AB  - In this essay, I argue the value of integrating aspects of social identity theory with informal logic generally. Interpretation and judgment can break break down in rhetorical contexts where social differences are significant. This is often the result of "residual prejudice" (Fricker, 2007) and unconscious bias. Using several examples from a study on classroom dialogue in an inner city Midwestern elementary school, I show how bias was the result of unreflective and unconscious social attitudes. I propose a 4 stage process of "intellectual empathy" as a route to more socially reflective thinking, drawing on the strengths of informal logic and social theory.

AB  - A Dual Process Model (DPM) approach to prejudice proposes that there should be at least two dimensions of generalized prejudice relating to outgroup stratification and social perception, which should be differentially predicted by Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). The current study assessed the causal effects of SDO and RWA on three dimensions of prejudice using a full cross-lagged longitudinal sample (N= 127). As expected, RWA, but not SDO, predicted prejudice towards 'dangerous' groups, SDO, but not RWA, predicted prejudice towards 'derogated' groups, and both RWA and SDO predicted prejudice towards 'dissident' groups. Results support previously untested causal predictions derived from the DPM and indicate that different forms of prejudice result from different SDO- and RWA-based motivational processes.

AB  - The search for the personological roots of generalized prejudice (or ethnocentrism) began with the authoritarian personality, but in recent years, the twin constructs of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation have been widely treated as the dual processes that lead to generalized prejudice. However, studies conducted for this article show that other constructs, notably empathy and principled moral reasoning, contribute important additional variance. Whereas authoritarianism and social dominance positively predict generalized prejudice, empathy and principled moral reasoning are related negatively to it. For the final study, a structural model of these relationships was tested. To fully understand individual differences in the propensity for generalized prejudice, it is necessary to move beyond the dual processes union of authoritarianism and social dominance.

AB  - False beliefs and negative myths about sexuality in old age lead to stereotypes and prejudices towards this group. These negative opinions germinate from a lack of knowledge about a subject. In an ageing society, education plays an important role, attending to the needs of these people throughout their lives and offering information that encourages optimistic attitudes towards this group and about a subject that seems to be frowned upon or forbidden in old age.
   To this end, this research aims to analyse the knowledge and attitudes that young people studying for the degree in Social Education and older people attending the training course of the experience classroom at the University of Huelva have towards sexuality in old age. The method used is descriptive-correlational and comparative-causal. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 304 subjects between 18 and 78 years of age. For data analysis, descriptive statistics, group comparisons and multiple linear regression model were used to identify factors that condition sexuality in old age. The results showed that the older population has more knowledge and a more conservative attitude towards sexuality in old age than the younger participants. Age, knowledge and educational qualifications are noted as conditioning factors of sexuality in old age. The research provides elements to be considered when drawing up educational-sexual initiatives to help improve certain attitudes and contribute to a more positive conception regarding the elderly.

AB  - This qualitative study aims to learn about the stereotypes and experiences of 14-year-old students in Denizli, Turkey. Acquisitions of stereotypes in Turkey are included in Social Studies Curriculum at 6th and 7th grades (12-13 years old) in secondary school. For this reason, the study group was formed considering that a 14-year-old student had knowledge and experience related to stereotypes and that 12 students were volunteers. A semi-structured interview form was used to collect data. The data obtained from the interviews are organized in the form of codes, categories, and themes. Direct quotations are included to show the students' observations and experiences in detail. Based on the results of the research, the stereotypes obtained from the students' views were collected under the themes of "Stereotypes Based on Gender", "Stereotypes Based on Social Roles and Responsibilities", "Stereotypes Based on Personality Traits" and "Stereotypes Based on Socialization". When student views that support all these themes are examined, it becomes clear that stereotypes in a society strongly feed prejudices. However, it has been found that male and female students are negatively affected by strict gender roles in general, and separate definitions for men and women disturb students. According to the findings, it is seen that students approach stereotypes with a critical mindset. Furthermore, the students uncovered the stereotypes that exist in Turkish society and attempted to explain how they and society were affected by these stereotypes.

AB  - LGB+ parented families in recent years are becoming more visible, but limited information exists about how professionals interact with people in these family forms. This study used the framework of intergroup contact theory to investigate whether contact with lesbians and gay men, same-sex couples, and same-sex parents respectively increase inclusive practices towards same-sex families, and whether this association is mediated by professionals' prejudice and endorsement of same-sex families' rights. A questionnaire with scales on: (a) intergroup contact, (b) professionals' orientation towards same-sex families' inclusive practices, (c) professionals' prejudices, and (d) support of same-sex couples' rights was administered to 460 professionals (9.8% males) working in social (N = 103), education (N = 156), and healthcare (N = 201) services in Italy. Path analysis was used to test the prediction that contact increases professionals' intention to embrace inclusive practices towards same-sex families through the mediation of both prejudice and support to same-sex couples' rights to have and raise children. Results showed that contact reduced prejudices towards same-sex families and increased the endorsement of same-sex families' rights, which in turn favoured professionals' willingness to modify their practices to include these family forms. Implications for the training and development of inclusive models are discussed. Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article's Community and Social Impact Statement.

AB  - In a highly diverse world, cultural literacy is an essential tool for living together in harmony, and dialogic teaching may be a way to promote and develop it among children and adolescents. We define cultural literacy as a set of attitudes (inclusion, tolerance, and empathy) and skills (dialogic argumentation) needed to understand others in our everyday lives. This paper focuses on the effect of a professional development programme to promote dialogue and argumentation to help children and adolescents overcome pre-existing stereotypes and prejudices and foster students' participation in discussions that contrast divergent viewpoints. This was done through debates on social responsibility issues, living together, and belonging as presented in books and short films addressing the following topics: citizenship, the celebration of diversity, democracy, globalisation, human rights, cooperation, sustainable development, and climate change. After the professional development programme was implemented, we video-recorded two of the 15 student-teacher interaction sessions during the project's implementation (session #3 and session #8). We analysed the data using a validated coding scheme across three educational levels (three preschool, four primary school, and four secondary school classrooms). We observed moderate gains in secondary education and preschool, but statistically significant gains in primary education.

AB  - The field of school psychology continues to further embrace a social justice perspective to address systemic racism, privilege, prejudice, and discrimination. To accomplish this mission, school psychologists must ensure that there is a solid literature base that is inclusive and representative of students from minoritized backgrounds. A review of student sociodemographic characteristics was conducted of all articles in four of the primary journals of school psychology from 2010 to 2019 (n = 1,213 articles). Compared to national estimates of school-age sociodemographic distributions, researchers tended to include samples more representative of students identifying as White/Caucasian and underrepresentative of students from low-income backgrounds. Authors rarely included or described participants' sexual orientations and gender identities beyond the binary (female/male). We provide a discussion and recommendations for improving the inclusivity of students from minoritized backgrounds in future school psychology research.
   Impact Statement
   To provide evidence-based school psychological practices to all students, the field's literature must be representative of the student population. In reviewing the past decade of school psychology research, the literature tends to overrepresent students who are White and come from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds. There tends to be underrepresentation of sexual minority youth, youth from low SES backgrounds, and children at the elementary grade level.

AB  - The authors developed a Holding Community Program to achieve the following objectives: (a) to increase the perspective-taking capacity of adolescents; (b) to promote interpersonal and intergroup harmony; (c) to empower school students to be more (pro)active in their communities and in public life. Apart from the intervention itself, the study comprised a pre-test and a post-test and involved a total of 240 Hungarian high school students (159 female, 66.3%). The students were aged 14-18 (M-age = 15.33; SDage = 0.88). They were recruited from four high schools. Control groups (N = 122) were chosen from the same institution and graded as experimental classes (N = 118, 7 classes). Both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention (4-6 months after the intervention) were explored. Quantitative analysis of the data indicated that the two-day intervention program had significantly increased the students' perspective-taking capacity (short-term: F(1, 238) = 6.03, p < 0.05, long-term: n.s.) and efficacy beliefs (short-term: F(1, 238) = 3.83, p = 0.052, long-term: F(1, 238) = 3.38, p < 0.05). After the training, students were more willing to participate in collective actions (short-term: F(1, 238) = 7.32, p < 0.01, long-term: F(1, 238) = 3.83, p < 0.05). These results seem quite promising but the outcome was not significant regarding its effect on prejudice.

AB  - Flags are conceptual representations that can prime nationalism and allegiance to one's group. Investigating children's understanding of conflict-related ethno-national flags in divided societies sheds light on the development of national categories. We explored the development of children's awareness of, and preferences for, ethnonational flags in Northern Ireland, Kosovo, and the Republic of North Macedonia. Children displayed early categorization of, and ingroup preferences for, ethno-national flags. By middle-childhood, children's conflict-related social categories shaped systematic predictions about other's group-based preferences for flags. Children of minoritystatus groups demonstrated more accurate flag categorization and were more likely to accurately infer others' flag preferences. While most Balkan children preferred divided versus integrated ethno-national symbols, children in the Albanian majority group in Kosovo demonstrated preferences for the new supra-ethnic national flag. We discuss the implications of children's ethno-national flag categories on developing conceptualizations of nationality and the potential for shared national symbols to promote peace.

AB  - The current study sought to characterize implicit bias toward children with autism and examine whether viewing educational materials about autism would change attitudes toward children with autism. A website developed by Sesame Street containing information about autism and resources for families was distributed to parents of children with autism (n = 473) and parents of children without autism (n = 707). Pre- and post-test measures of implicit bias toward children with autism; explicit attitudes and knowledge about autism; and parenting confidence, strain, and stigma were completed before and after the website was presented. Results indicated that parents of children with autism showed less implicit bias compared with those of non-autistic children during the pre-test, but the groups did not differ at the post-test. Parents without autistic children and those with more negative explicit attitudes showed a greater reduction in implicit bias from the pre- to the post-test. In addition, for parents of children with autism, a more positive change in explicit attitudes and increased knowledge from the pre- to the post-test was associated with more empowerment at the post-test. Together, our findings suggest that the online educational resources can reduce implicit bias against children with autism and help mitigate some of the psychological issues associated with parenting children with autism.

KW  - educational inequalities
AB  - This article deploys insights from Michael Young's 1958 satireThe Rise of the Meritocracyto challenge the dominant ideology of meritocracy in contemporary British society. It draws on ethnographic research in schools over a twenty-five year period to illustrate the damage the illusion of meritocracy inflicts on children and young people, but particularly those from working class backgrounds. It argues that the consequences of the pretence of meritocracy are to be found in everyday practices of testing, hyper-competition and setting, and beyond the classroom in the designation of predominantly working class schools as 'rubbish schools for rubbish learners'. It concludes that, beyond the negative consequences for working class learners, there are wider consequences for British society, exacerbating social divisions and encouraging the growth of distrust, prejudice, envy, resentment, and contempt between different social groups.

AB  - This study aims to explore the efficacy of literature relating to Anne Frank to reduce children's attitudes of prejudice and discrimination with respect to specific dimensions, including ethnicity and race, religion and gender. A quasi-experiment was employed with pre-post control design. The sample consisted of 100 students of the upper key-stage 2 (UKS2) level, recruited from the two British schools in Karachi. These schools represented an Experimental Group (EG) and a matched Comparison Group (CG). A research instrument titled 'Muggles world of differences' (MWD) was developed and validated. It was administered on CG and EG, both before and after intervention. The intervention plan 'Reading of Young Anne's Literature' (ROYAL) was developed based on selected readings from Anne Frank related literature (AFL). Intervention was provided to EG, while CG studied similar concepts using a more standard method. Results of the pretest revealed a high level of prejudice and discrimination in both the EG and CG, with no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the overall scores, as well as in the specific content domains. However, the post-test of the two groups revealed that the students in the EG had outperformed their CG counterparts in overall MWD scores, as well as in specific content domains. The difference was found to be significant (p < 0.05) with the large effect size (r = -0.63). Results support the efficacy of teaching Anne Frank related literature in reducing attitudes of prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Although human societies provide protection from harm and enable the construction of collaborative and mutually beneficial social structures, they also pave the way for social hierarchies that deny equal treatment to certain portions of the population. Moral judgments about fairness and equality, as well as stereotypes, biases, and prejudice, emerge as early as 3 and 4 years of age. Investigating young children's responses to the unfair treatment of others reveals that, beginning at 3-4 years of age, children often act on ingroup biases and do not yet challenge exclusion or rectify inequalities. By 5-6 years of age, however, children's knowledge of groups, along with their understanding of others' mental states, enables them to begin to critically evaluate unfair practices, particularly in peer contexts. These factors play a significant role in young children's emerging ability to challenge unfair treatment of others. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - This article is the Swiss contribution to the European project Collaboration on Improving Students' Preparation for Family-School Partnerships'. It presents results from a study investigating how Swiss Schools of Teacher Education prepare primary school students for cooperation with the parents of four- to thirteen-year-old pupils. Nine Schools of Teacher Education in the German-speaking part of Switzerland were surveyed. The study conducted questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and document analysis on this topic. This article focuses on the results for primary school teacher education. The findings show that Swiss primary school teacher education programmes accord importance to family-school cooperation. All Schools of Teacher Education cover the topic of family-school cooperation either by conducting special courses on this subject or by connecting the subject with other courses. However, the content and extent of the coverage of and linkages to family-school cooperation in the courses largely depends on the individual educator. Moreover, preparing for family-school cooperation is an important issue during in-field training. The results of this study differ from those in other countries and contradict common prejudices in public perception on the issue in Switzerland.

AB  - This study assessed homophobic verbal behavior among high school students in Switzerland and tested a multifactorial explanatory model. Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. Of the 897 students, 85.4% reported having made homophobic statements in the previous 12 months. Behavior was predicted by negative attitudes (ss = 0.20), acceptance of traditional gender roles (ss = 0.06), religiosity (ss=-0.07), contact with gay people (ss = 0.10), expectations of parents (ss = -0.14) and friends (ss =-0.19), gender (ss =-0.22), and immigration background (ss = 0.09). The social cognitive variables were determined by gender, age, immigration background, school type, and discussion of homosexuality in class (GFI = 0.995, AGFI = 0.979, SRMR = 0.0169, CMIN/df = 1.199, adj. R-2 = 0.384). Findings provide leverage points for interventions.

AB  - Personality factors can be predictors of acceptability and intention to use new technologies, especially regarding education and care fields in the whole lifespan.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive factors and attitudes of curricular and specialized teachers towards socially assistive robotics and the intention to use robots in teaching activities.
   In our research, we investigated the impact of the personality factors measured with the Big Five Questionnaire, on acceptability questionnaires derived by Eurobarometer and by the model Unified Theory of the Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), administered respectively before and after showing the possible uses of the robot NAO in education and teaching.
   The study was conducted in four schools, participants were 114 teachers (52.07 +/- 8.22), aged 26 to 68 years, of the primary and middle school level.
   The results highlight the primary role of the personality factors Openness to Experience and Extraversion for promoting the acceptability and reduce the prejudicial reject regarding the use of educational and assistive robotic technologies.
   In conclusion, for using at best robotics in education, teachers need to receive appropriate training. also on the basis of their attitudes and personality traits. to learn how to plan their educational activities integrating the robotics tools.

AB  - Masculinity has been found to predict the sexual prejudice of heterosexual men against gay men. The present study investigated the role of four variables as moderators of the relationships between two masculinity constructs (endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology and gender role conflict) and sexual prejudice in men. The hypothesized moderators were: direct and indirect friendships with gay men, gender self-esteem, acknowledged same-sex attraction, and religious fundamentalism. A total of 383 men completed 8 scales plus a demographic questionnaire. Direct friendship strengthened the positive relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice, contrary to hypothesis. This finding could mean that high masculinity ideology scores reduced the likelihood that a man with many gay friends would let go of his prejudice. Direct friendship did not moderate the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice nor did indirect friendship moderate either relationship; however, both forms of friendship predicted prejudice, as hypothesized. Gender self-esteem strengthened the positive relationships between both masculinity variables and sexual prejudice as hypothesized. Same-sex attraction weakened the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice as hypothesized, but contrary to hypothesis did not moderate the relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice. Religious fundamentalism predicted prejudice, but showed no significant moderation. The results were discussed in terms of limitations and suggestions for future research and application. In conclusion, this line of investigation appears promising and should be continued and the present findings can be utilized in anti-prejudice social marketing campaigns and in counseling.

AB  - Background: Few studies have examined the issues faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-parented families in relation to their access to and satisfaction with healthcare services for their children. It is thought that LGBT individuals have experienced negative interactions with the healthcare environment.
   Aims: To systematically review the literature investigating the experience of LGBT parents seeking health care for their children.
   Methods: A search of the following databases: Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PsychInfo, Science Direct, Sociological Abstracts, Proquest, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. Using the PRISMA flow chart and processes of the United Kingdom Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, we selected and analysed relevant studies.
   Findings: Four studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified. Studies showed that while the experience of LGBT parents seeking health care was largely positive, strategies need to be implemented to improve the quality of healthcare services for LGBT families and ensure that their needs are met.
   Discussion: Although many LGBT parents have positive experiences of health care, some still experience discrimination and prejudice.
   Implications for practice: Specific educational interventions are needed to support LGBT parents seeking health care for their children.
   Conclusions: Further research is required to explore LGBT-parented families experiences of healthcare services, and this should include children's experiences.

AB  - A study is reported of a psychoanalytic intervention in a very violent and prejudiced Jamaican school with disenfranchised children 7-9 grades who had failed academic streaming examinations. Over the period of 3 years of the intervention using mentalization and power issues approaches grounded in attachment theory, children were assisted to feel connected and valued by their school. There were striking improvements in academic performance, decreased victimization, and increased helpfulness especially in boys including significant trickle down effects to grades 1-6. Overall, the school became a place teachers wanted to join and the Jamaican government recognized their success and built a new school for them in a better location.

AB  - Children being vulnerable, have special protection under the law through their parents or guardian who are responsible for them; and make decisions for them because they lack legal capacity. One of these decisions a parent/guardian makes is determining the religion of a child. Once the parent/guardian chooses the religion of the child, the child may become bound by its practices throughout childhood. While the right of parents to determine the religion of their children is recognised by domestic, regional and international laws, the way courts in Nigeria treat this recognition suggests that the right is not absolute. This paper adopts the doctrinal methodology in interrogating the extent to which Nigerian Courts permit the observation by a child of the religious practices of his/her parent in relation to submission to medical treatment in order to protect the child's right to life. This paper argues that law and morality are media of social control but have their convergence and divergence. It further argues that sanctity of human life which for many forbids suicide, requires that even adults should not be allowed to object to medical treatment which refusal may result in death which can be seen as "disguised suicide." These authors examined the Supreme Court decision in Medical Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Council v. Okonkwo and found that; Nigerian Courts recognise parent right to choose their children religion and practices however, any religious practice prejudicial to the child based on the "best interest" principle provided under the Child Right Act and its States equivalent will be jettisoned. It examines the practice in Britain and Canada and draw lessons for Nigeria. This paper recommends public enlightenment, prohibition of harmful religious beliefs such as objection to life-saving medical procedure by parents for minors as means of balancing parents/guardian right to choose their children religious beliefs and preservation of the children right to life.

AB  - Attitudes toward same-gender parenting are of timely relevance, given increasing recognition of LGBTQ+ rights around the world. Two studies examined the influence of 2 predictors of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. The first was informational influence, which was manipulated via a newspaper-style article dispelling misconceptions about gender identity of children reared by same-gender parents. The second was social influence via parasocial contact measured as prior exposure to a same-gender adoptive parents TV show. Religious fundamentalism (RF) was assessed as an individual difference moderator of informational or social influence. Outcome variables were beliefs about same-gender parenting, perceived problems with same-gender parenting, and social distance from same-gender adoptive parents. We studied these relationships in Canada (Study 1, where same-gender couples' adoption is legal) and in Italy (Study 2, where same-gender couples' adoption is not legal). RF moderated the results of informational and social influence in the Canadian context, such that those high in RF tended to be favorably influenced. In Italy, results of informational influence were typically observed among those low in RF, and social influence directly predicted favorable attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Informational and social influence can improve attitudes toward same-gender parenting, but RF and legal/cultural context are also important to consider.

AB  - Recent research suggests that young children's causal justification for minimal group membership can be induced via a cognitive framework of mutual intentionality. That is, an individual can become a group member when both the individual and group agree to membership. Here, we investigated if children ages 3-5 understand groups formed by mutual intentions and whether they apply mutual intentions to realistic groups with varying entitative and essentialized qualities. In two studies (N = 197), we asked 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children if a novel character could join an existing group based on intentionality (mutual, individual-, group-only) and group type (task, friends, family). We find that 4- and 5-year-olds robustly relied on mutual intentions to constitute group membership and 3-year-olds also demonstrated emerging usage of this cognitive framework. Moreover, children employed mutual intentionality across different group types, suggesting a general framework for children's understanding of different social groups.

AB  - Friendships between members of different ethnoracial groups can help to reduce prejudice and ease tensions across ethnoracial groups. A large body of literature has explored possible determinants for the formation of these friendships. One unexplored factor is the role of an individual's skin color in influencing their opportunities to befriend members of other ethnoracial groups. This study seeks to answer two questions: For ethnoracial minorities, how is an individual's skin color associated with the likelihood that they will engage in a cross-ethnoracial friendship? Does the role of skin color depend on the ethnoracial combination of the two groups that befriend one another? Using waves 1, 2, and 3 of the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen and a series of multinomial logit models, the results suggest that the role of skin color is a function of the relative levels of social status of the two ethnoracial groups that befriend one another. I argue that lighter-skinned members of lower status ethnoracial groups have a greater likelihood of having close friendships with members of higher status ethnoracial groups. There is also limited evidence that darker-skinned members of a higher status group, specifically Asians, have a greater likelihood of having close friends from a lower status group.

AB  - What is the public significance of this article? Contrary to the model minority myth's portrayal of Asian Americans as a monolithic group who are educationally high achieving, this article highlights the diversity within this population. To promote their academic well-being, we also identify factors that illustrate how Asian American children's and youth's educational achievement varies according to their family, school, and community contexts.
   The model minority myth portrays Asian Americans as academically successful and has been criticized for its failure to consider heterogeneity within this population. Utilizing the integrative ecological model of minorities' development, this review addresses how Asian Americanican children's and youth's educational achievement varies according to their family, school, and community contexts. We adapted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist for this review. Based on 48 reviewed articles published between 2005 and June 2020, familial facilitators for academic achievement include supportive and autonomy-granting parenting, high-quality parent-child relationship, appropriate parental expectations and involvement, and social capital. School facilitators are high-quality teaching and teacher-student relationship, and peer support and positive academic orientation. Ethnic-community-based programs and resources promote Asian American children's and youth's academic performance. By contrast, Asian American children and youth tend to underachieve in families with hostile parenting, excessive family obligations, and low-socioeconomic status (SES), and in schools with high-rate peer delinquency and racial discrimination or prejudice. Recommendations for promoting Asian American students' academic well-being are discussed.

AB  - This study investigates whether the quantity and quality of contact with migrants and perceiving that cultural diversity is accepted at school (as a dimension of the perceived school climate) are associated with perpetrating bullying toward migrant classmates. Quantity and quality of contact are also examined as moderators of the association between perceived cultural acceptance at school and bullying toward migrant students. One hundred and sixtysix adolescents (M-age = 16.26; SD = 1.53) belonging to the societal majority group answered a battery of self-report measures. Bullying migrant peers was associated with more negative quality of the contact. Bullying migrants was also associated with lower perceived acceptance of cultural diversity at school for the adolescents reporting higher levels of contact with migrants at school. The role of contact in explaining bullying toward migrant peers is also discussed in light of possible interventions.

AB  - Social distance is operationalized as the willingness of respondents of the general population to engage in direct, immediate, reciprocal social interactions with persons of another group and to achieve a degree of closeness through these interactions. The aim of this study was to examine the willingness of students with typical development to accept a certain type of social relations with peers with disabilities in inclusive education, as well as the association of gender and age differences in social distance with the type of disability. A modified Bogardus social distance scale was used for research purposes. The sample consisted of students with typical development sand their peers with disabilities (N-398), aged from 7 to 15 years of age who attend inclusive primary schools on the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The results of the study showed that students with typical development do not generally reject social contacts with their peers with disabilities, as shown by the overall lower social distance, but social distance grew in areas of emotional and physical closeness. Students expressed the highest social distance toward peers with autism, while the lowest social distance was manifested towards peers with sensory impairments. Gender and age differences were confirmed. The girls expressed lower social distance, as did the students of higher school age (from 11 to 15 years of age).

AB  - With the increase of anti-Muslim bigotry in the current political and societal climate, ethnic minority children in western nations may experience increased negative attention fueled by Islamophobia. Islamophobia is defined as the dislike of or prejudice against Islam, and individuals who are Muslims. A literature review yielded little research that examines the experience of Muslim children and their experiences with Islamophobia, particularly in the Canadian context. However, studies on the overall issue reveal Islamophobia is a phenomenon that has impacted Muslims around the world. This community-based study explored the dichotomous experiences of Muslim school-aged children who are taught theirs is a faith of peace and yet who regularly experience microaggressions and overt hostility because of their beliefs.

AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

AB  - Background: Bullying and prejudice-based harassment frequently occur in school settings and have significant consequences for the health and wellbeing of young people. Yet far fewer studies have examined the role of the school environment in peer harassment than individual factors. This multilevel study examined associations between a variety of school-level risk and protective factors and student-level reports of bullying and prejudice-based harassment during adolescence.
   Methods: Data come from 8th, 9th, and 11th graders who completed the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 122,180 students nested in 505 schools). School-level variables were created by aggregating student report data in five areas: academic orientation to school, internal assets, teacher-student relationship quality, feelings of safety at school, and receipt of disciplinary action.
   Results: Results indicated that youth attending schools with a higher proportion of students with strong internal assets had lower odds of nearly every type of bullying and prejudice-based harassment assessed when compared to youth attending schools with a lower proportion of students with strong internal assets. Additionally, the proportion of students feeling unsafe at school was a fairly consistent risk factor for most types of peer harassment.
   Conclusion: Findings support the idea that prevention programs aimed at improving school-wide internal assets and feelings of safety at school may be key prevention points. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - "The contact hypothesis" refers to the value of heterosexuals' interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians in lowering negative attitudes toward them. With the increasing number of same-sex parented families worldwide, in spite of a generalized lack of appropriate social and legal protection, the issue of attitudes toward gay and lesbian parents gains special relevance. A sample of 1690 Portuguese heterosexual individuals were asked about their interpersonal contact experiences with gay men and lesbians, their attitudes toward them and toward same-sex parenting. Results revealed that women and non-religious participants were significantly more likely to have gay and lesbian acquaintances and friends, feel more comfortable in their company, and hold less negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and gay and lesbian parenting. A path analysis model revealed that interpersonal contact experiences were not directly linked to attitudes toward same-sex families, but were mediated by homonegativity and comfort with gay men and lesbians. These findings extend previous knowledge about the value of interpersonal contact, by highlighting the roles of homonegativity and positive affect as mediators of contact experiences on attitudes toward same-sex parented families.

AB  - This research examines whether culture influences the extent to which people's attitudes tune toward others' egalitarian beliefs. Hong Kong Chinese, but not American, participants were less prejudiced, explicitly and implicitly, toward homosexuals when they interacted with a person who appeared to hold egalitarian views as opposed to neutral views (Experiment 1). In Experiments 2 and 3, cultural concepts were manipulated. Americans and Hong Kong Chinese who were primed with a collectivist mind-set showed less explicit and implicit prejudice when the experimenter was thought to endorse egalitarian views than when no views were conveyed. Such differences were not found when both cultural groups were primed with an individualist mind-set. These findings suggest that cultural value orientations can help mitigate prejudice.

AB  - The present research tested a prejudice-reduction intervention based on imagined contact. White children imagined interacting with a child from an ethnic outgroup (Asian) once a week for 3 weeks, or did not take part in this activity (control group). Compared with the control group, children who engaged in imagined contact subsequently showed more positive attitudes, greater perceived similarity, and willingness for intergroup contact. The effect of the intervention on willingness for contact was mediated by positive attitude change. Implications for imagined-contact theory and the development of prejudice-reduction techniques for schools are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study attitudes toward people with disabilities from the viewpoint of the integrated threat theory of prejudice. This theory postulates that threat may cause negative attitudes toward a group and posits that such threat may come from different sources. To test this model, a study was carried out with high school students (N = 228), which included social dominance orientation (SDO) as antecedent variable. Perceived threat for resources and intergroup anxiety were the mediating threats investigated in this process. Results showed support for the theory: Perceived threat for resources and intergroup anxiety seemed to be effective mediators. SDO also appeared as a potent antecedent predictor of attitudes toward people with physical disabilities.

AB  - Background Many parents with learning disabilities find themselves locked in a struggle with child protection authorities to retain custody of their children. This struggle is one against deeply entrenched prejudices as well as social arrangements that often deprive parents of needed resources. This in-depth case study explores the contours of such a struggle, and the 'tools' deployed by one couple to keep child protection at bay. The goal is first to give the parents a platform to tell their stories. The second is to help inform the knowledge base of parents, advocates and allied professionals. The third is to consider the impacts the developing disability rights environment is having upon these ongoing struggles. Method This is a qualitative case study based on interview and document analysis and long-term involvement with a couple with learning disabilities. The material was coded according to the principles of grounded theory. Findings Three key categories were identified. The first is 'Lessons learned', referring to the knowledge and experience that the parents collected over a lifetime. The second is 'Allies: The family', highlighting the importance of a strong family network. The third is 'Secret weapons', a phrase used by the parents to denote a collection of advocates and professional supporters they strategically surrounded themselves with when needed. Conclusion This story illustrates the parents' tactical skill and resourcefulness to retain custody of their children. We also document the addition of new tools the parents are able to make use of such as domestic disability and human rights protections that are in turn supported by international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, we also contend that families like theirs live in a state of fragility, and disruptions to their support can result in further child protection interventions.

AB  - This questionnaire-based study compared 36 Israeli lesbian mother families (n = 72 lesbian mothers) formed by donor insemination, 39 Israeli gay father families (n = 78 gay fathers) formed by gestational surrogacy, and 36 Israeli heterosexual parent families (n = 72 heterosexual parents) formed by assisted reproduction (without donated gametes), all with a target child aged 3-10 years. The families were examined for parents' assisted conception socialization self-efficacy, depression, negative and positive affect, life satisfaction, positivity, resilience, social support, and child externalizing problems. Multiple factors associated with child externalizing problems were also examined. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that parents' assisted conception socialization self-efficacy did not differ between family groups; however, lesbian mothers and gay fathers reported fewer child externalizing problems and greater social support, relative to heterosexual parents. Also, lesbian mothers-but not gay fathers-reported lower levels of depression, greater life satisfaction, and more positivity than did heterosexual parents. Finally, irrespective of family type, greater assisted conception socialization self-efficacy was associated with fewer parent-reported child externalizing problems. Findings are interpreted in light of the cultural socialization framework and Israel's familistic and pronatalist environment. Implications for health professionals, educators, and policymakers working with diverse family forms are discussed.

AB  - Using data from Turkey and Belgium, this study investigated the relationships of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation with ambivalent sexism, homophobia, and subtle racism. First, we predicted that men are more prejudiced than women. This hypothesis was confirmed in the Turkish but not in the Belgian sample. Second, Muslims were higher in authoritarianism and homophobia than people belonging to other (or no) religious groups. Third, Muslims also showed more hostile sexism toward both men and women. Fourth, negative associations of education with authoritarianism, sexism, and homophobia were expected and found. Fifth, in both countries, authoritarianism was positively related to homophobia and sexism, and social dominance orientation was positively associated with racism. Finally, groups comparing both samples, we found that Turks' authoritarianism and prejudice was higher than Belgians'. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose Tanzanian children with surgically correctable disabilities face challenges in accessing healthcare and cultural and societal stigma and prejudice. This paper provides insight into the staff perceptions from one rehabilitation center in Tanzania, The Plaster House, pertaining to disability, treatment, and change broadly for children with disabilities who receive treatments.
   Methods This was a qualitative content analysis. As part of a program evaluation, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 staff members of The Plaster House, gaining perceptions about change for children with disabilities receiving treatments. The Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Matrix was utilized to organize the data into categories and form results.
   Results Themes were identified and organized within the following categories in the CBR Matrix: health, rehabilitation, education, social roles, and empowerment. Each was associated with the child or family caregiver experience at The Plaster House.
   Conclusion Findings provided rare insight from Tanzanian staff on the valuable social, emotional, and physical impacts of specialized treatment for children with disabilities and their parents. Transformational changes are possible for children with disabilities and their families despite poverty and limited access to services.

AB  - Adolescents use some types of homophobic language (e.g., "that's so gay") as a form of banter, while other types are directly targeted as an intentional insult (e.g., calling someone a "fag, dyke, homo"). Little research has investigated adolescents' use and judgments about these types of homophobic language and whether judgments differ if they are used among friends or directed toward non-friend peers. This study investigated how relationship context and victim's (N = 477, M-age = 14.7, SD = 1.63) emotional responses related to judgments about anti-gay banter and homophobic name-calling. Adolescents evaluated homophobic name-calling as more wrong than anti-gay banter. While adolescents' evaluations of homophobic name-calling did not differ based on relationship context, adolescents did differentiate between anti-gay banter perpetrated by a friend vs. a peer. Further, emotional responses mediated these relationships in the anti-gay banter situation. These results suggest that adolescents' judgments about homophobic language are related to the relationship context and the type of homophobic language used.

AB  - Introduction: Jim Crow laws in the United States promoted racial prejudice, which may have reduced social capital. Our study tests the relationship between Jim Crow laws and social capital. Methods: We conducted 3 level multilevel hierarchical modeling to study differences in the stock of social capital for 1997, 2005, 2009 in Jim Crow states compared to states without Jim Crow laws. We examined the moderation effects of county level median income, percent Black and percent with high school education and Jim Crow laws on social capital. Results: Jim Crow laws significantly reduced stock of social capital across 1997, 2005, 2009. The model was robust to the inclusion of random county, states, time and fixed county and state level covariates for median income, percent Black and percent with high school education. The largest percent of between state variations explained for fixed variables was from the addition of Jim Crow laws with 2.86%. These results demonstrate that although Jim Crow laws were abolished in 1965, the effects of racial segregation appear to persist through lower social connectiveness, community and trust. A positive moderation effect was seen for median income and percent Black with Jim Crow laws on social capital. Discussion: Our study supports a negative association between Jim Crow laws and reduction in the stock of social capital. This may be attributed to the fracturing of trust, reciprocity and collective action produced by legal racial segregation. Findings from this study offer insight on the potential impacts of historical policies on the social structure of a community. Future research is necessary to further identify the mechanistic pathways and develop interventions to improve social capital.

AB  - Ethnic-racial socialization describes messages and practices that teach youth about their racial and/or ethnic group membership and the role of race in society. Despite a wealth of research on families, little work has considered school socialization practices. The current article uses a framework of school racial socialization to explore six socialization messages reported in a predominantly Black public charter school in an urban area. In focus group and individual interviews, 21 African American students (71% female) discussed what they learned about race and culture at school. Responses revealed a high frequency of cultural socialization and promotion of cultural competence messages, but the content was limited to certain key figures and events. The findings illustrate the complexity of youths' perceptions of socialization and the need for multicultural education in schools.

AB  - When making character judgments from faces, perceivers must integrate and prioritize a myriad of information, including perceived traits (e.g., appearance of trustworthiness, submissiveness, competence) and social category membership (e.g., Afrocentric, Eurocentric appearance). Across four studies, adults (Studies 1-3) and children (5-13 years old; Study 4) made evaluations based predominantly on face-traits. Regardless of whether face pairs were White-White, Black-Black, or White-Black, participants selected the trustworthy, submissive, or competent-appearing face as "nice." Further, although face-traits were used at all ages, face-race cues were used only by older children and adults, in line with correction for race bias. Indeed, adults' use of face-race cues decreased when motivation or ability to control race bias was reduced through time constraints or indirect responding. These findings reveal the processes underlying the prioritization of face-trait over face-race cues and provide the first developmental examination of how perceivers integrate such cues in explicit character evaluations.

AB  - How do you sell a solar powered lamp to India's un-electrified, rural poor? This contribution to Anthropology for Sale explores the work of direct selling in rural India, reflecting on the forms of prejudice, difference and exclusion that are produced as multinational companies create markets for consumer goods in places of chronic global poverty. In the highlands of Orissa, India, a US company sells solar powered lights through a network of young male sales agents. The company and its products express empathy and proximity, attachment and connection to India's indigenous and low caste communities. Yet the company's salesmen are often more concerned with maintaining forms of structural advantage and their sales practices articulate social differences based on caste, class and gender. Rather than see prejudice as a peripheral effect of expansion and growth in emerging markets this paper proposes that we see it as a constitutive feature of markets at the 'bottom of the pyramid'.

AB  - In this study we examined whether different styles of teachers' instructions (pro-social vs behavioural) affect the attitudes and beliefs of pre-adolescents towards peers with migrant backgrounds. The research was conducted in two countries: in Italy (N = 93) and in Russia (N = 134) among students in their last year of primary school (M age = 11.27). Teachers provided one in two sets of instructions, highlighting either the welcoming and openness characteristics of the group or its adherence to school-norms. After receiving this recommendation, pupils read a fictional scenario depicting a fellow student from an undisclosed foreign country, with different cultural features, and who was expected to join that class-group. Children's opinions were measured through five scales addressing the newcomer's pleasantness, positive and negative attitudes towards the respondents' (ingroup) and the newcomer's group of friends (outgroup). On an individual level, results confirm that pro-social instructions enhance positive traits towards the unknown student at a higher extent. A significant difference was also reported when comparing the two conditions on a group level: favourable characteristics were more prominent in the prosocial condition than in the behavioural one and negative traits, both in the in-group's and outgroup's projections, were reduced. We discuss the implications of these results with regard to teachers' impact in modelling social skills and the development of social processes in the school context.

AB  - The Leave campaign in the U.K., which advocated exiting the European Union, emphasized anxiety over immigration and the need to take control of the U.K.'s borders. Citizens who expressed concerns about immigration to the U.K. were more likely to vote to leave. Two correlational studies examined the previously unexplored question of whether the Brexit vote and support for the outcome of the E.U. referendum were linked to individual predictors of prejudice toward foreigners: British collective narcissism (a belief in national greatness), right wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation. The results converged to indicate that all three variables were independently related to the perceived threat of immigrants and, via this variable, to the Brexit vote and a support for the outcome of the E.U. referendum. These variables explained the variance in the perceived threat of immigrants and support for the Brexit vote over and above other previously examined predictors such as age, education, or ethnicity, as well as, national identification and national attachment.

AB  - In the present article, we analyze polymorphous prejudice against lesbians and gays according to a sample of Portuguese heterosexual individuals. We tested the differential importance of demographic-, ideological-, and psychological-level variables to predicting this phenomenon. Our results show that male, Catholic, right-wing respondents with fewer lesbian and gay (LG) friends prove the group exhibiting the highest levels of polymorphous prejudice. Furthermore, the introduction of psychological-level variables into the regression models increased the explained variance in polymorphous prejudice, above and beyond the remaining predictors. Additionally, we report different patterns of results when deploying regression analyses at the level of the sub-scales of polymorphous prejudice. We discuss our results within the light of contemporary sexual prejudice frameworks before reviewing the utility of results to interventions targeting discriminated LG individuals.

AB  - This exploratory study investigated how staff at four private boys' boarding schools in Perth, Western Australia, constructed meaning and understanding around the experience of studying away from home and family for Aboriginal students from regional and remote communities. Interviews were conducted with 16 participants recruited from the four schools. Three major themes with corresponding sub-themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Aboriginal Disadvantage and the sub-themes of Social Responsibility and Opportunity, (2) Academic and Social factors and the sub-themes of Culture Shock, Homesickness, Friendships and Peer Support, Literacy and Numeracy, Prejudice, Stereotypes, and Racism and (3) Relationships and the sub-themes of Staff-Student Relationship, Staff-Parent Relationship, and School-Community Relationship. The implications of these findings are discussed and implications for policy and practice are considered.

AB  - Ziege compares two field studies on ethnocentrism, racism and antisemitism among American workers during the Second World War: 'Antisemitism among American Labor' (1945) by the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research (ISR) in exile and Wartime Shipyard (1947) by Katherine Archibald at the University of California at Berkeley. The former was a large-scale team project headed by Friedrich Pollock, Theodor W. Adorno and Paul Massing, who had at their disposal a large number of fieldworkers as well as the support of the trade unions. Archibald worked in complete isolation. Yet, in spite of this and major differences in design and theory, the European Marxists and the American liberal came to similar conclusions: hostility towards Jews at that time had to be analysed in connection with hostility towards other groups (including women, Blacks, labourers from the American South and other ethnic and social minorities) and within the context of the war and the Holocaust. While aware of the innovations achieved in research by means of public opinion polls, both studies were pioneering in their ambition to improve on quantitative research by means of non-quantitative procedures and qualitative-participatory observation. Ziege links these studies to a third study, The Authoritarian Personality (1950), conducted by the ISR, particularly Adorno, which poses the question of how relevant the ISR's critical theory was for the innovations achieved in studies of prejudice, when Archibald's study, which eschewed social theory, arrived at similar conclusions regarding antisemitism.

AB  - Despite their negative effects on the emotional, physical, and social wellbeing of students, weight stigma and anti-fat attitudes are rarely systematically addressed in schools or within school psychology. Weight-based oppression is regarded differently than other domains of prejudice. Therefore, implicit and explicit bias continue unimpeded, even when practitioners are attentive to other areas of social injustice. Mental health providers serving schools must acknowledge the prevalence of weight stigma and fatphobia to reduce their deleterious and oppressive effects. This conceptual paper outlines the underpinnings of weight stigma, overviews the necessity of addressing it and body image in educational settings, incorporates interdisciplinary perspectives, and proposes a justice-oriented shift in the conceptualization of weight status within school psychological service delivery.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has hit humanity globally. Besides its obvious threats to our physical health and economic stability, one can only speculate about the pandemic's and its countermeasures' psychosocial impacts. Here, we took advantage of a sample of healthy male participants who had completed psychosocial measures on mental health, environmental concern, and prejudice against asylum-seekers just before and during the nationwide lockdown in Germany in spring 2020. A follow-up assessment of 140 participants during the lockdown provided a unique opportunity to track psychosocial changes in a prospective longitudinal study design. In comparison to before the lockdown (1) mental health worsened, (2) environmental concern increased, and (3) prejudice against asylum-seekers decreased. Our study demonstrates psychosocial "side effects" of the pandemic that bring both challenges and opportunities for our society with regard to the handling of psychological reactions to this pandemic and further global crises, including climate change and mass migration.

AB  - Researchers from marginalized groups often make important social scientific discoveries about prejudice, particularly when they are members of the group under investigation (e.g., women studying sexism, Black Americans studying racism). But is the scientific integrity and validity of their work perceived differently by virtue of their membership in the marginalized group? Across three survey experiments conducted in the domains of weight stigma, racism, and sexism research (total N = 1317), we find that researchers from a marginalized group whose research focuses on prejudice against their ingroup face a double-edged sword. On one hand, they are perceived as having greater psychological standing and expertise in the research area owing to their personal experience and insight into the processes they are researching. This, in turn, facilitates greater trust in, and perceived legitimacy of, their research. On the other hand, their research is simultaneously considered less trustworthy and legitimate because it is perceived as being motivated by a vested interest, in terms of having a personal agenda in the research. These findings demonstrate the competing biases that affect public perceptions of marginalized group researchers and their work in the area of prejudice.

AB  - The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the Seeds of Unity curriculum on a Pre-Kindergarten class consisting of four to five-year-old children in Brooklyn New York. The syllabus is a fusion of The Starting Small Program created by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the teaching of emotional competence theory. This study measured fourteen, four to five-year-old children before and after a ten-month exposure to the Seeds of Unity Curriculum. The Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS) was utilized to measure changes in emotional competence before and after exposure to the curriculum. The results showed a mean score on the Gresham Social Skills index that placed the girls in the 76(%) before the program and the 97% after, and the boys went from the 64% to the 89% when measured against children their age. Despite the small N, this study showed that using this curriculum, increased social emotional intelligence. The competencies incorporated into this paradigm are vital to improving relations between cultures in the ethnically diverse New York city schools and provides hope that change is possible.

AB  - Research is often guided by maps of elementary dimensions, such as core traits, foundations of morality, and principal stereotype dimensions. Yet, there is no comprehensive map of prejudice dimensions. A major limiter of developing a prejudice map is the ad hoc sampling of target groups. We used a broad and largely theory-agnostic selection of groups to derive a map of principal dimensions of expressed prejudice in contemporary American society. Across a series of exploratory and confirmatory studies, we found three principal factors: Prejudice against marginalized groups, prejudice against privileged/conservative groups, and prejudice against unconventional groups (with some inverse loadings for conservative groups). We documented distinct correlates for each factor, in terms of social identifications, perceived threats, personality, and behavioral manifestations. We discuss how the current map integrates several lines of research, and point to novel and underexplored insights about prejudice.

AB  - This study examined the relations among social dominance orientation (SDO), social contact, and attitudes toward international students. SDO was positively associated with prejudice against international students, perception of threats from international students, and exclusionism. Men had a higher level of SDO than women, but SDO had a greater effect on female exclusionism. The results show that SDO did not directly predict a general attitude toward international students. Prejudice predicted unfavorable attitudes, but threat perception and exclusionism did not, indicating that the mechanism underlying the effect of SDO on attitudes toward international students was through prejudice rather than threat perception and exclusionism. The negative effect of prejudice remained after controlling for the effect of social contact. However, social contact contributed to a favorable attitude toward international students. Both the number of international-student friends and personal relations with them had positive effects.

AB  - We examined perceptions of those without children in a pre-registered study. Women who made a conscious decision not to have children (i.e., childfree) and women without children for unknown reasons were evaluated more negatively thanmothers and those unable to have children (i.e., childless). Few differences were observed in evaluations of male targets as a function of parental status. Although we expected gender differences whereby childfree women would be evaluated more negatively than childfree men, this was not observed. Evaluations also did not vary as a function of perceiver gender. Those higher in social dominance orientation had more negative evaluations of childfree and childless women operating through ascription to traditional gender roles. The same pattern existed for male targets but was no longer supported when statistically controlling for singlism.

AB  - Accumulated disadvantage (AD) is conceptualised here as an agglomeration of unfavourable or prejudicial conditions which in adolescence may compromise the progress to further education or future life chances. There are several theories on AD, suggesting, e.g., (1) an increase of AD by age and (2) trajectories (previous disadvantage predicts later disadvantage). Social pathways theory suggests that (3) a third factor (e.g., socioeconomic position, SEP) mediates or moderates the association between early and later disadvantage, while other theories imply (4) polarisation (a strengthening association between AD and SEP by age) or (5) equalisation (a weakening of association between AD and SEP). We apply these theories to longitudinal data of 7th graders (13 years, N = 5742), followed until the end of the 9th grade. Five dimensions of disadvantage were health (poor self-rated health), social behaviour (poor prosocial behaviour), normative (conduct disorders), educational (poor academic achievement), and economic (parental unemployment). The results show that the prevalence of AD increased over the follow-up as most indicators of disadvantage elevated. AD at the 7th grade predicted later AD, as did the SEP of the students. Moderation of AD by SEP was also observed. The study corroborates with hypotheses on increase of AD, trajectory, and social pathways but no signs of polarisation or equalisation were observed.

AB  - This paper reports a study that adopted age-appropriate terminology to investigate 6-11-year-old children's attitudes towards mental illness (N = 120). The study utilized a semi-structured interview technique and card selection tasks to assess the children's attitudes to individuals diagnosed with different mental illnesses (anorexia nervosa, depression and dementia). Their attitudes were measured in terms of social distance, social functioning, emotional response and trait attributions. Findings suggested that children's responses varied according to the specific mental illness diagnosis for social functioning, emotional response and trait attributions. In addition, the children's attitudes towards the three characters showed different developmental profiles as a function of age for social functioning and trait attributions. The implications of these findings for theories of the development of prejudice, and implications for stigma reduction programs, are discussed.

AB  - Toddlers? peer conflicts offer meaningful opportunities for toddlers to learn social-emotional skills, including learning to understand another?s perspective and learning how to regulate emotions. This study explored 31 teachers? self-reports of their roles, teaching practices and the conditions that influenced their pedagogical responses to toddlers? peer conflicts, within the contexts of four early childhood education services in Aotearoa New Zealand. In a mixed-methods study design, data were gathered through focus group interviews and a web-based questionnaire, and analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Teachers saw their key teaching roles as: protecting toddlers, physically and emotionally; advocating for toddlers without prejudicial judgement; and role modelling and coaching social-emotional skills. Teachers described using an array of practices intended to empower toddlers to learn and reported that professional decisions regarding if, when and how to intervene in toddlers? peer conflicts were guided by their knowledge of, and relationships with, the toddlers involved, and by concerns for toddlers? physical and emotional safety. Findings highlight key practices and considerations for teachers who would like to promote learning for toddlers in the context of peer conflicts.

AB  - Interethnic friendships are highly beneficial for decreasing ethnic prejudice. However, this is not true when friends identifying with different ethnic groups perceive each other as of the same ethnicity. We investigate the extent to which people categorize their friends "incorrectly", that is, not matching these friends' self-identifications. We thus move beyond the established practice of conceptualizing ethnic categorization as an individual characteristic ("who is categorized into which ethnicity"), and define it on the level of pairwise relations (who categorizes whom into which ethnicity), which enables us to model the effect of friendship on ethnic categorization. Using dynamic social network models, we also disentangle this effect from the simultaneous effect of categorization on friendship, taking characteristics (e.g. self-identifications) of both the observed and the observing individual into account. On data of 12 Hungarian high-school classes with one minority group, the Roma, we find that students of the majority group tend to select and keep friends whom they observe as majority members. In contrast, students of the minority group do not prefer other minority members when choosing friends, but tend to categorize their existing friends as minority peers. We conclude that these are two different manifestations of the preference for same-ethnic friends.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the importance of negative orientations towards political parties in the political socialization process. We extend the traditional idea that children adopt a certain positive party attachment from their parents, and also take into account the possibility that the family can play an important role in the development of negative partisanship. We test the assumption that within the family, children learn both about the 'good ones' and the 'bad ones' of the political world, and analyze intergenerational similarities in positive and negative orientations towards the different political parties in the Flemish (Belgium) landscape. Results show that parental socialization can indeed work in two directions. Intergenerational similarity is not only observed in support - as could be expected from earlier research - but can also be observed, to a similar extent, for explicit negative orientations. This is particularly the case for parties at the far ends of the political spectrum such as the radical right Vlaams Belang (and to a lesser extent for the Green party), but this logic also applies for more mainstream, established parties, such as the Christian democrats.

AB  - Public attitudes toward immigrants in the UK, especially prejudice against them, form a strong theme in retrospective media postmortems emphasizing the uniqueness of Brexit, yet similarly hostile public opinion on immigrants forms a recurrent theme in populist politics in many European Union nations. Indeed, if UK residents are not uniquely hostile, then the UK's exit from the EU may be only the first symptom of proliferating conflicts over immigration that will plague EU nations in future years. A well-established symptom (or consequence) of prejudice-aversion to outgroups as a neighbors-shows that prejudice against immigrants, other races, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Gypsies are all relatively low in the UK. This is as expected from the general decline of prejudice and social distance with socioeconomic development, demonstrated here in broad perspective across many countries. Indeed, UK residents are about as prejudiced against each of these ethno-religious outgroups as are their peers in other advanced EU and English-speaking nations, and much less prejudiced than their peers in less prosperous countries. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the view that a single latent ethno-religious prejudice generates all these specific prejudices, so it is not specific experiences with any one of these groups, nor their specific attributes, that are the wellspring of this deep-seated underlying prejudice. Replication using other measures of prejudice and another cross-national dataset confirms these findings. Data are from the pooled World and European Values Surveys (over 450,000 individuals, 300 surveys, and 100 nations for this analysis) and from the well-known European Quality of Life surveys. Analysis is by descriptive, multilevel (random intercept, fixed effects), and structural equation methods.

AB  - Although recent research has demonstrated the benefits of multicultural experience for reducing personal levels of intergroup bias, the potential for an intergenerational effect has yet to be explored. Using samples of Jewish-Israeli (Study 1a) and Palestinian-Israeli (Study 1b) mother-child dyads, we found that maternal multicultural experience was indirectly related to greater social tolerance among children via lower levels of maternal need for cognitive closure which, in turn, triggered higher levels of maternal social tolerance. These results show that when it comes to multicultural experience, its impact can extend beyond the self to also affect the next generation. Implications for developmental theories of prejudice acquisition and prejudice interventions are discussed.

AB  - Background: Parenting children with learning disabilities requires a high level of knowledge and access to resources, information and services. In developing countries, however, these resources and services are not always available. Parents in Namibia, a developing country, therefore face challenges addressing children's learning and other developmental disabilities, including challenges related to preventative and supportive interventions.
   Objective: This research focuses on challenges faced by parents as they parent children with learning disabilities in Opuwo, Namibia.
   Method: In-depth interviews were conducted with eight parents regarding the challenges they face in parenting their children with learning disabilities. Thematic analysis enabled the researchers to identify, analyse and report on themes that emerged from the qualitative interview data.
   Results: Analysis of the interviews indicated that some participants had only a vague understanding of learning disabilities, as they did not have access to essential knowledge about this phenomenon. They also lacked an awareness of the availability of programmes, services and policies meant to benefit their children with learning disabilities. Participants voiced that they, their children with learning disabilities and community members have stereotypes and prejudices regarding learning disabilities. In this study, most of the children with learning disabilities were raised by single, unemployed parents who seemed to have access to less support from external sources than married couples parenting children with learning disabilities. These single parents are usually not married and because of lack of financial support from the other parent, the majority of them indicated that they struggle to meet the financial and material needs of their children.
   Conclusion: The researchers concluded that the participants in this study experience a range of challenges in parenting their children with learning disabilities. The main challenges emanate from financial instability, as well as lack of knowledge regarding services and programmes for children with learning disabilities. This lack of knowledge on the part of participants could indicate poor policy education by policy implementers at grass-roots level.

AB  - This study examined interethnic prejudice among 4,238 secondary school pupils in the Netherlands. It builds upon previous research in two ways. First, it advances our understanding of the interplay between positive and negative intergroup contact experiences by testing whether positive intergroup contact serves as a buffer for the prejudice-enhancing effect of negative intergroup contact, as well as the other way around. Secondly, by using longitudinal data, it provides a stricter test of the relationship between negative contact and prejudice among adolescents. Hybrid models with two-wave panel data showed that the transition from having no friends from an ethnic outgroup to having a share of friends from an ethnic outgroup results in lower interethnic prejudice, both for Dutch majority and minority group pupils. Furthermore, we found the transition from having no foes to having one or more foes from an ethnic outgroup to be associated with higher levels of prejudice. We did not find evidence for buffering effects of intergroup contact.

AB  - This paper explores the extent to which people of different origins, natives and migrants, come together in everyday life in Europe. Instead of looking at overall perceptions' and stances', which are context-dependent and mediated through political-ideological currents and discourses as well as broader patterns of prejudice, we focus on sustained close contacts that suggest meaningful and organic relationships. Since it is most often people of migrant background who are blamed for leading parallel lives' and not integrating', we chose to focus on them and their interethnic friendships. Moreover, we seek to understand the relevance and role of the neighbourhood context in the development of those relationships. Despite the expressive fears in public discourses about the supposed negative impact of the presence of immigrants and ethnic minorities on social cohesion, our findings indicate that close interethnic relationships are not uncommon in diverse European cities. They further highlight that the neighbourhood context plays an important role in the first years of migrants' settlement. Relationships in the neighbourhood develop in less formal social settings and are also less demanding in terms of host-country cultural skills on the part of the migrants, thus giving the opportunity to newcomers to develop close interethnic relationships with natives. Finally, the analysis supports the positive role of diversity at the neighbourhood level in the development of interethnic friendships and stresses the importance of the neighbourhood's socio-spatial characteristics and its location in the wider urban net.

AB  - This study focuses on the partner choices of immigrant adolescents who are involved in a romantic relationship. We formulate hypotheses about the effect of immigrants' preferences, parental influence and structural effects of the school and neighbourhood on the likelihood of dating a native partner versus a non-native partner. Using unique data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU) which was conducted in over 100 schools in each country among adolescents of around 14-year-old and their parents (n = 1896), we show, first, that more conservative immigrant adolescents are less likely to date a native partner. In addition, parental influence is demonstrated by gender-specific effects of religious background and by positive effects of parents' social and structural integration. Meeting opportunities with natives at school and in the neighbourhood are prominent factors in explaining the choice of dating a native partner.

AB  - Same-sex parents are increasingly a topic of public discourse. A growing number of homosexuals openly speak about their desire to have children or are already living together in different family constellations. The current study examined the decisions for or against having children and the motivations behind those decisions among nonheterosexuals living in Germany. A sample of 1,283 nonheterosexuals participated by means of an online survey. As some nonheterosexual individuals do not identify themselves with a male or female gender identity, a third category, gender different, was generated. Motives for (not) having children, perceptions of social acceptance, experiences of discrimination in relation to one's sexual orientation, and levels of internalized stigma were taken into account regarding their influence on the decision about parenthood. Most respondents (80%) reported that they did not have children. However, among this group, 43% stated that they had decided to have children later in their lives, 24% were undecided, and 11% had already decided against having children. The most important influences on the decision of whether to have children were respondents' age and their desire for emotional stabilization. Negative experiences as a result of sexual orientation and internalized stigma had no impact on the decisions regarding parenthood.

AB  - The current paper focuses on White British students in lower secondary education and investigates the effect of school ethnic diversity on their levels of trust and inclusive attitudes towards immigrants. Use is made of panel data of the Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS) to explore these relationships. Ethnic diversity is measured with the proportion of students in a grade identifying with a minority. In agreement with contact theory, the paper initially finds a positive relation between diversity and inclusive attitudes on immigrants. However, this link disappears once controls for social background, gender and prior levels of the outcome are included in the model. This indicates that students with particular pre-enrolment characteristics have self-selected in diverse schools and that inclusive attitudes have stabilized before secondary education. Diversity further appears to have a negative impact on trust, irrespective of the number of controls added to the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Protestant work ethic (PWE) is prevalent in many cultures. Abundant work in social psychology, primarily in the U.S., suggests that people use PWE to justify their own prejudice and society's differential treatment of less successful or disadvantaged persons. Recent theorizing suggests that PWE's intergroup meaning can be influenced by people's age, social status, and culture such that PWE not only has an intolerant or "justifier"-of-inequality meaning (disadvantaged persons deserve their disadvantage), but also a tolerant or equalizer meaning (effort is a social equalizer). The main goal of the present investigation was to show that PWE does not necessarily develop a justifier meaning within or across cultures. Past work shows that among the majority group, European Americans, PWE is positively related to egalitarianism among children but less so with increasing age, presumably because the justifier meaning becomes increasingly salient and group relevant (justifies their groups' high status). In Study 1, we show that among the majority group in Colombia, Mestizos, PWE is positively related to egalitarianism (and negatively related to social dominance orientation) across age groups, presumably because the justifier meaning is less salient and relevant in a culture where people tend to blame others less for their disadvantage. In Study 2, we show that among African Americans, who have historically been a disadvantaged and stigmatized group, PWE is positively related to egalitarianism across age groups, presumably because the justifier meaning is less relevant and salient to their group. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal dimensions of varied schooling agendas for poor and oppressed caste children and adults in the princely state of Travancore in nineteenth-century colonial south India. Schools became socially contested and politically charged spaces in which various subaltern castes, particularly the Dalits and Nadars, articulated a new language of social and religious self-fashioning. British Protestant missionaries played a crucial role in provoking these imaginations and yet, the joint workings of caste and racial prejudices resulted in ambivalent cultural encounters in the educational landscape. Caste was central to these contestations and negotiations in making modern child subjectivities and tended to produce new forms of inequality and reproduce existing ones. I argue that schooling campaigns for the poor resulted in the perpetuation of hierarchised, caste-inflected norms of childhood and produced multiple marginal children in local society. This paper draws upon British Protestant missionary archives to highlight the unstable and violent geographies in which children of subaltern castes navigated the sphere of modern schooling in colonial Travancore and the constitutive function of schools in the making of marginal childhoods.

AB  - Using the Andersen and Newman model, we explored the facilitators and barriers to the use of sexual and reproductive health (S&RH) services by in-school adolescents in Ghana. Thematic analysis of interviews revealed that parental support and a good peer network predispose adolescents to use S&RH services, while religious prejudice predisposes adolescents not to use S&RH services. Adolescent-friendly social clubs, S&RH corners, and well-trained health workers enable S&RH service use while parental disapproval, poor health workers' attitudes, and inconvenience of health facilities inhibit S&RH service use. Adolescents' perceptions of the severity of S&RH conditions create the need for S&RH care, while societal perception of sexual pleasure and perceived side effects of S&RH services are need-based barriers to the use of S&RH services. We recommend that adolescent-focused S&RH interventions should build the competence of health workers, promote religious and community tolerance, and strengthen family relationships that facilitate parent-child S&RH communication.

AB  - People form relationships with people from their own racial groups, a phenomenon called racial homophily, which reduces interracial contact and exacerbates inequality and prejudice. Although viewed as arising from environmental factors, we argue that racial homophily also involves individual choice and, thus, personality factors. We address three major issues. First, are interpersonal concerns (Agreeableness) and intergroup concerns (Openness) differentially relevant to cross-race friendships? Second, are current conceptions of Openness sufficient, or do we need lower-level facets more attuned to intergroup concerns? Third, can we specify the interplay between personality and contextual factors in different settings? Across four studies (total N = 1,820), Agreeableness failed to predict more cross-race friendships, in both self- and peer reports, suggesting that interpersonal kindness was not sufficient to overcome racial homophily. In contrast, Openness and Openness to Other (O2, a new social facet of Openness) consistently predicted cross-race friendship. However, the O2 facet had the stronger and only unique effect, suggesting it is the "active ingredient." High-O2 individuals had an almost equal 1:1 ratio of same-to-different-race network members, whereas low-O2 individuals had 4:1 same-race. These results held for both college students and middleaged adults, both friends and new acquaintances in the network, and both networks established before and at a diverse university. Finally, when moving to a more diverse environment, high-O2 individuals seemed to take advantage of the new environmental affordances, adding more different-race members to their networks. Overall, these studies advance understanding of person-environment transactions, showing how personality traits matter to the structure of people's social networks.

AB  - The question of 'developmental appropriateness' in education can be both empowering and inhibiting. When are students 'ready' to talk about social injustices and systemic inequalities? How might educators introduce social inequities using developmental findings about reasoning? This article presents social domain theory as a lens through which educators can approach critical consciousness education with young children. An overview of Freire's critical consciousness construct is presented, including educational interventions, methods, and approaches that support critical consciousness. An overview of social domain theory is also presented. Social domain theory is a developmental theory of sociomoral reasoning that describes three domains of social knowledge that develop independently, and get applied/coordinated/prioritized differently in context by individuals. This theory, and the research stemming from it, has shown that there are developmental transition points during which children come to view their previous logic as inadequate, and are likely to shift their understandings of moral, conventional, and personal issues. A parallel is drawn between these transition points and the process of wrestling with and overturning 'contradictions' in critical consciousness education. Contradictions are theorized as dehumanizing power dynamics that show up in students' everyday circumstances. This article provides tables outlining example contradictions for young children, key domain-related reasoning shifts for young children, and examples for how to create lesson plans that take these two factors into account. Finally, we propose a method of facilitating self-assessment of critical consciousness with young children. Self-reflection questions are provided for teachers and students.

AB  - Objectives: Suspect motives, conceptualized as beliefs that Whites' interracial motives are primarily driven by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced have been found to shape a number of intergroup outcomes for People of Color (POC). However, it is unclear what factors lead individuals to become suspicious of Whites' motives. Two correlational studies tested whether childhood racial socialization experiences relate to suspect motives. Methods: 223 Black participants (94.2% female; M-age = 42.01, SDage = 16.62) recalled childhood racial socialization experiences and completed the Suspicion of Motives Index (SOMI; Study 1). 226 Black parents (80.8% female; M-age = 37.39, SDage = 9.17) reported racial socialization strategies and goals for their children to be cognizant of Whites' potentially suspect motives (Study 2). Results: Driven by cultural socialization, racial socialization was significantly related to suspicion (Study 1). Racial socialization predicted parental desires that children recognize Whites' suspect motives and a combined measure of cultural socialization and preparation for bias was most strongly related to parental hopes (Study 2). Conclusions: These studies link racial socialization and suspicion of Whites' motives. These results suggest that among POC, racial socialization may shape beliefs about Whites' interracial motives.

AB  - Children's adherence to gender stereotypes can be detrimental, yet interventions to tackle stereotyping have achieved mixed success. Few studies have examined interventions developed collaboratively by educators and researchers, and the impact of interventions that focus on increasing perceived similarities between genders has yet to be tested. The present study evaluated an intervention among 6- to 10-year-old British children (47 boys; 37 girls) compared to a control group (61 boys; 47 girls). Led by their class teacher via weekly 30-minute lessons, over a four-month period, children learned to identify and challenge stereotypes, and explored similarities between genders and diversity within gender (e.g., not all girls like pink). Key measures of gender flexibility in relation to toy play, occupations, and perceived similarity to gender groups were utilised. After controlling for baseline scores, the intervention group felt more similar to the other gender and reported that they could do a wider range of occupations in the future. Those who showed less flexibility around toy play at baseline were more flexible after the intervention. Boys in the intervention group reported that gender stereotypes were more unfair than did the control group. Findings are discussed in relation to theories of gender stereotyping and intervention research.

AB  - Consideration of the prevalence of regional prejudice in Brazil shows how stereotypical assumptions about culture, race, and socioeconomic class inform regional biases. A comparison of discriminatory social media posts after the 2014 and 2018 presidential elections reveals similarities in most of the racist and xenophobic language in the two election cycles but an increase in references to Venezuela and Cuba and heightened animosity toward the Partido dos Trabalhadores in 2018. Racism directed by social media users againstnordestinosis part of a historical continuum of oppression fostered by regional stereotypes and failed public policies that have real-life implications for Brazil'snordestinos. A consideracao da prevalencia de preconceito regional no Brasil mostra a centralidade de premissas estereotipadas sobre cultura, raca e classe socioeconomica. Uma comparacao de publicacoes discriminatorias nas midias sociais apos as eleicoes presidenciais de 2014 e 2018 revela semelhancas na maior parte da linguagem racista e xenofobica nos dois ciclos eleitorais, mas um aumento nas referencias a Venezuela e Cuba e maior animosidade em relacao ao Partido dos Trabalhadores em 2018. Racismo dirigido por usuarios de midia social contra os nordestinos faz parte de um continuum historico de opressao promovida por estereotipos regionais e politicas publicas fracassadas que tem implicacoes na vida real para os nordestinos do Brasil.

AB  - This study examined 1) mothers' neural responses to pictures of boys and girls who confirmed or violated social expectations regarding toy preferences, and 2) whether neural sensitivity to targets that violated gendered expectations interacted with mothers' gender stereotypes. In an event-related fMRI experiment, 23 mothers of a 2-6 year-old child viewed and evaluated pictures of boys or girls with their favorite toy. Next, mothers gender stereotypes about children's toys and behavior, and internal motivation to behave without prejudice were assessed. Several neural processes were underlying parents' responses to children's behavior that violates gender-role expectations. Brain regions involved in mentalizing or storage of social knowledge, understanding goal-directed behavior, behavioral control, and conflict monitoring were activated when viewing child targets that violated gender expectations. In these brain areas, increased neural responses to targets that violated traditional gender expectations were associated with more stereotyped expectations about boys' and girls' toys and behavior.

AB  - Chronic pain is a leading cause of work absenteeism and disability compensation. Previous work demonstrates that patients with chronic illness often seek advice, such as whether or not to pursue disability benefits, from peers with similar health conditions. The current study examined the extent that social factors influence patients with chronic pain ("peers") when making disability judgments and recommendations for other patients with chronic pain. Participants (N = 71) made pain related and disability ratings for fictional vignette patients that varied in weight (normal vs obese), fault of accident, and physical work demands. Results of repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that participants rated patients with obesity, who were not at fault, and who held a physically demanding job as experiencing more severe pain symptoms and disability and were more likely to recommend they seek disability benefits. Participants who had applied for disability benefits themselves rated patients as more disabled than participants who had not applied for disability. These data suggest that patients with chronic pain are influenced by patient and contextual factors when making pain-related and disability judgments for peers. These judgments may impact patient decision making via peer support programs and online forums.
   Perspective: This study suggests that patients with chronic pain are influenced by patient weight, fault of accident, and physical work demands when making judgments about pain and disability for peers. Future studies should examine the extent such peer-to-peer recommendations influence actual disability-seeking behaviors for pain.

AB  - The predominant hypothesis regarding the ecology of body image suggests that contexts of food insecurity foster positive evaluations of and preferences for fat bodies as they symbolize wealth, social and reproductive success, strength, beauty, and fertility. Yet, there are few studies that empirically test this relationship or examine how experiences of food insecurity influence perceptions of thin bodies. In this study, we examine the ecology of body norms among a group of primary schoolchildren in a semirural community in the Central Highlands of Guatemala. Specifically, we test the hypotheses that food insecurity predicts fat-positive or thin-negative evaluations of children's body size or, conversely, that food security predicts thin-positive or fat-negative evaluations. Utilizing a characteristic attribution task to measure positive and negative evaluations of average, thin, and fat bodies, we measure the strength of preference and prejudice for each body size. While we find a strong preference for average bodies and prejudice against both thin and fat bodies overall, food insecurity predicts children having very negative evaluations of thin bodies. These results suggest a different interpretation of the ecology of body norms as, rather than fostering fat-positive evaluations, food insecurity exaggerates biases toward thin bodies.

AB  - Background: Bariatric surgery for children and adolescents is becoming widespread. However, the evidence is still scarce and of poor quality, and many of the patients are too young to consent. This poses a series of moral challenges, which have to be addressed both when considering bariatric surgery introduced as a health care service and when deciding for treatment for young individuals. A question based (Socratic) approach is applied to reveal underlying moral issues that can be relevant to an open and transparent decision making process.
   Discussion: A wide range of moral issues with bariatric surgery for children and adolescents is identified in the literature. There is a moral imperative to help obese minors avoiding serious health problems, but there is little high quality evidence on safety, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness for bariatric surgery in this group. Lack of maturity and family relations poses a series of challenges with autonomy, informed consent, assent, and assessing the best interest of children and adolescents. Social aspects of obesity, such as medicalization, prejudice, and discrimination, raise problems with justice and trust in health professionals. Conceptual issues, such as definition of obesity and treatment end-points, present moral problems. Hidden interests of patients, parents, professionals, industry, and society need to be revealed.
   Summary: Performing bariatric surgery for obese children and adolescents in order to discipline their behavior warrants reflection and caution. More evidence on outcomes is needed to be able to balance benefits and risks, to provide information for a valid consent or assent, and to advise minors and parents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The obesity epidemic in industrialized nations has important implications for education, as research demonstrates lower academic achievement among obese students. The current paper compares the test scores and school grades of obese, overweight and normal-weight students in secondary and further education, controlling for demographic variables, personality, ability and well-being confounds.
   PARTICIPANTS: This study included 383 eighth-grade students (49% female; study 1) and 1036 students from 24 community colleges and universities (64% female, study 2), both drawn from five regions across the United States.
   MEASURES: In study 1, body mass index (BMI) was calculated using self-reports and parent reports of weight and height. In study 2, BMI was calculated from self-reported weight and height only. Both samples completed age-appropriate assessments of mathematics, vocabulary and the personality trait conscientiousness. Eighth-grade students additionally completed a measure of life satisfaction, with both self-reports and parent reports of their grades from the previous semester also obtained. Higher education students additionally completed measures of positive and negative affect, and self-reported their grades and college entrance scores.
   RESULTS: Obese students receive significantly lower grades in middle school (d = 0.83), community college (d = 0.34) and university (d = 0.36), but show no statistically significant differences in intelligence or achievement test scores. Even after controlling for demographic variables, intelligence, personality and well-being, obese students obtain significantly lower grades than normal-weight students in the eighth grade (d = 0.39), community college (d = 0.42) and university (d = 0.31).
   CONCLUSION: Lower grades may reflect peer and teacher prejudice against overweight and obese students rather than lack of ability among these students. International Journal of Obesity (2013) 37, 40--46; doi: 10.1038/ijo.2012.47; published online 24 April 2012

AB  - Two studies investigated the relative social acceptability of certain prejudices within a society (Study 1) and between societies (Study 2), using (less) internal motivation to control prejudice as an indicator of social acceptability. In Study 1, White British participants reported less internal motivation to control prejudice against people with schizophrenia than against Black people. In Study 2, Jamaican participants reported less internal motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice than did either British participants or American participants. Other differences in motivation to control prejudice were smaller, absent, or at odds with this difference, indicating that differences in motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice were not solely due to cultural differences concerning motivation to control prejudice in general. Results are discussed in terms of novel findings, relevance to the literature and possible future research. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - With a growing number of multilingual children entering early childhood education, teachers are challenged to create appropriate learning opportunities for all children. Given diverse literacy skills and cultural backgrounds, early childhood educators might provide different support to children after an inappropriate child response depending on the child's language background. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify different types of teacher third-position support (i.e., support provided after not being satisfied with the child response or nonresponse) in interaction with multilingual and monolingual kindergartners. We conducted a multiple case study in which three kindergarten teachers and seven multilingual and five monolingual children were observed in the classroom during one school year. Support sequences were analyzed using content analysis. We identified six different types of teacher third-position support in educational interactions with multilingual children: allocate turn to another child, provision of hints, reduction of choice, establishing common ground, modeling, and using the home language. Teachers tended to use reduction of choice more with multilingual children, whereas provision of hints was used more with monolingual children. Overall, the presented study enabled us to obtain an in-depth view of how teachers differentially adopt types of third-position support in interaction with multilingual and monolingual kindergartners.

AB  - This case study reveals that age-related areas are the least desirable professional future options for many university students in social work degree programmes. One of the possible causes is the negative social labelling of older age, especially pronounced in respect of older women. Additionally, there is a poor and limited educational approach towards later life and growing older inside and outside the educational settings. This article focuses on the social construction of older age from gender and double theoretical perspectives. In particular, it centers on the pillars of education and profiguration. For educational and analytical purposes, these aspects are approached in the classroom setting from a critical perspective by using the in-depth reading of a book that is set in the local context, in particular, the city of Lleida (Spain). It presents the results of the content analysis and reflections written by 170 first-year university students taking a degree course in social work, and the outcomes of the subsequent classroom discussions with the author of the book. The study results show that better knowledge about the complexities of ageing and later life can lead to the reconstruction of the students' viewpoints about older age, help foster critical thinking, and defy age-related stereotypes, beliefs, and prejudices.

AB  - Although more research on attitudes towards same-sex parent families has been conducted in recent years, scant attention has been paid to its predictors in a Chinese context. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relations of two ideological beliefs (social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism) to gender essentialism and opposition to same-sex parent families among 425 Chinese individuals. We found that male, older generations, and heterosexual people showed higher levels of opposition in general. Our main result from structural equation modelling suggests that social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism make significant and independent contributions to opposition to same-sex parent families via shaping individuals' essentialist beliefs of gender. The predictions remained significant even after the potential influence of covariates (i.e. age, gender, and sexual orientation) was controlled statistically. This study has contributed to the understanding of the associations between ideological beliefs and attitudes towards same-sex parent families in an understudied cultural context.

AB  - Cultural divides and prejudice complicate the processes of integration and acculturation of migrant families living in a foreign country. Evaluating the impact of such phenomenon can be crucial for social stability and policy making. In this context, the education system has a leading role in fostering and attaining social integration, in particular when it comes to younger sections of the migrant population. In this work, we propose a method for the construction of a quantitative indicator capturing social integration of second generation students in the Italian school system according to areas defined by nationality of the students and administrative region in which they attend school. The indicator, based on survey data, is estimated by means of a 2-step methodology. In the first step, we choose an individual qualitative variable capturing social integration at the unit level, and we compute a first direct estimate of the indicator as the proportion of highly integrated students in each area. Such variable is isolated following alternatively a proxy variable approach or a latent variable model approach. In the second step, we make use of two alternative small area models to improve the estimates, dealing with missing values, low sample size and high variability in smaller domains. At the end, the 2-step methodology results in 4 alternative versions of a synthetic indicator of social integration, that can be used to rank nationalities and administrative regions.

AB  - Principles of intergroup conflict are a core issue in social psychology fields. Studies have found that social prejudice has a significant correlation with intergroup conflict, apart from the personal characteristics and the contextual factors. However, none of those studies concentrated on the triggering role of the prejudice to the social phenomena in Eastern culture. Accordingly, the dependent variable detection paradigms used in three experiments were the Emotional Stroop Task, the Lexical Decision Task (LDT), and the Story Completion Protocol (SCP), the present research took the patient- physician conflict in domestic China as the example to detect the effect of social prejudice on the attention selective bias, memory accessibility, and the explanation of attribution bias of the aggressive information processing during the triggering of patient-physician intergroup conflict. The result showed that there was social patient-physician prejudice dissociation, which means that implicit patient-physician prejudice was observed but explicit social prejudice was not. In addition, the implicit patient-physician prejudice priming had a significant effect on patients' reaction times of Emotional Stroop task and SCP, but no effect of LDT. It indicated that the implicit prejudice did not improve memory accessibility in the later stages of information processing, but rather triggered selective attention bias and hostile attribution bias in preceding stages. Such a conclusion supported the Interpretation-First Model of aggressive information processing.

AB  - The social integration of the ever-growing number of refugees in receiving societies is of major importance. Perceived discrimination has been found to predict fewer friendships with natives over time. But what short-term mechanisms explain this effect? In a sample of 115 refugees living in Germany we (i) replicated the long-term discrimination-social-integration relationship, (ii) found short-term associations between discrimination and affective, motivational, and behavioral tendencies not to befriend natives, and (iii) showed authenticity to mediate this short-term relationship: with increasing discrimination, refugees felt less like they could show their authentic selves around natives, which in turn impaired tendencies to befriend natives. Discrimination may impede the formation of interethnic friendships by instilling feelings of inauthenticity. Implications for prevention measures are discussed.

AB  - The De La Salle University (DLSU) Libraries organised the first Human Library in the Philippines in August 2014. The initial target audience were undergraduate and graduate students of the University. In 2016, the Integrated School Libraries organised Human Library sessions for grade school, junior high school, and senior high school students. The activity allowed them to engage with human books actively, facilitating an innovative learning experience. This paper describes the Human Library program of the DLSU Integrated School Libraries. The program aims to promote respectful dialogue between human books and students, foster the culture of diversity and difference, and reduce prejudice and discrimination against people with different social and cultural backgrounds. The program has been integrated with the school curriculum, thus allowing students to have the opportunity to dialogue with human books from different backgrounds, such as people with a tattoo, members of LGBTQ community, people with mental health issues, people with bipolar disorder, and people with eating disorders among others. Through this learning experience, students are expected to appreciate diversity and are more open-minded at an early age, be more accepting and kinder to others, empathetic, and respectful.

AB  - Social media is a useful tool for connecting with family, friends and others while physically distancing and self-isolating due to COVID-19. Simultaneously, it is being used for purposes of expressing antagonistic stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination against older adults. This commentary draws on social media trending topics (e.g., "OK, Boomer," "Boomer Remover") to demonstrate how generalizations regarding chronological age and COVID-19 age-related biomedical risks have: (a) exacerbated ageism on social media, and (b) further exposed ongoing tensions between so-called "Millennial" and "Baby Boomer" generations in ways that are targeted against the older generation and serve in favor of younger ones. The implications of this ageist discourse in and on society are discussed. Anti-ageism efforts by social media users and organizations are highlighted. In this state of emergency, we must bring awareness to and resist ageism that depersonalizes and dehumanizes older adults and undervalues later life during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - What factors explain majority members' anti-Muslim prejudice? This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members' negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration - our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the relationship between personality, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and anti-immigrant prejudice of Croatian youth (N = 1050). We base our hypotheses on the Dual-process motivational model of ideology and prejudice (DPM) and the meta-theoretical framework of McCrae and Costa's five-factor theory of personality (FFT), assuming that dispositions (basic tendencies) relate to ideological attitudes (characteristic adaptations) that further relate to prejudice (objective biography). The present study contributes to the existing literature by disentangling the mechanism of the personality-prejudice relation in thus far under-researched anti-immigrant prejudice domain. In addition, as one of the rare examinations of the personality-prejudice relation conducted outside the Western Europe and North America, the study offers valuable insight about the cross-cultural stability of the current findings. On the present sample, extraversion and openness to experience exerted direct effects on anti-immigrant prejudice. Indirect effects via RWA were found for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, and indirect effects via SDO were found for agreeableness, neuroticism and openness. Intriguingly, indirect effects of agreeableness on prejudice via RWA and SDO operated in opposite directions. Overall, the results support the DPM and FFT assumptions and provide fair replication of the existing empirical evidence.

AB  - Ineffective and oppressive schooling of people of color has been obstinate and widespread. Disinviting and hostile practices often engaged through written and oral discourses contribute to this condition. Thus, identifying such discourses becomes imperative to reversing these conditions and creating equitable schooling. This essay proposes the use of critical analysis of white innocence as a concept to investigate prejudicial schooling practices. Borrowing from legal studies, the author proposes analyzing the rhetoric of white innocence and its simultaneous opposite, person of color as perpetrator, as an investigative frame in the schooling context. In this work, white innocence is reviewed as a social representation that assists in making more transparent the unmarked standard of white supremacy. The essay first conceptualizes the rhetoric of white innocence. Then, a methodological framework of social cognition through discourse and its (re)production of social representations is offered and utilized to exemplify the manifestations of white innocence in a social studies context.

AB  - Cross-group friendships are often assumed to be a panacea to intergroup conflict. However, the irony of harmony hypothesis suggests that friendships can have negative consequences for collective action and social change. We complement this research with accounts of cross-group friendship, using interviews and focus groups with minority (African-Caribbean and/ or gay) and majority (White and/ or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Participants repeatedly deployed "friendship" as an idealized category such that what happened within friendship could not be constructed as discrimination. Majority participants said that anything that happened within friendship could only be a mistake/ misunderstanding that would be easy to rectify. Minority participants struggled to reconcile the category entitlements of friendship with the problematic experiences that they described, but constructing such experiences as "discrimination" presented practical, moral, and rhetorical difficulties. Harmonious cross-group friendship may therefore require that minorities become tolerant to discrimination, while simultaneously enabling majorities to warrant (ill-informed) claims.

AB  - When people are exposed to information that leads them to overestimate the actual amount of genetic difference between racial groups, it can augment their racial biases. However, there is apparently no research that explores if the reverse is possible. Does teaching adolescents scientifically accurate information about genetic variation within and between US census races reduce their racial biases? We randomized 8(th) and 9(th) grade students (n=166) into separate classrooms to learn for an entire week either about the topics of (a) human genetic variation or (b) climate variation. In a cross-over randomized trial with clustering, we demonstrate that when students learn about genetic variation within and between racial groups it significantly changes their perceptions of human genetic variation, thereby causing a significant decrease in their scores on instruments assessing cognitive forms of prejudice. We then replicate these findings in two computer-based randomized controlled trials, one with adults (n=176) and another with biology students (n=721, 9(th)-12(th) graders). These results indicate that teaching about human variation in the domain of genetics has potentially powerful effects on social cognition during adolescence. In turn, we argue that learning about the social and quantitative complexities of human genetic variation research could prepare students to become informed participants in a society where human genetics is invoked as a rationale in sociopolitical debates.

This study aimed to identify if the social support and the family functionality interfere in the self-perception of gerontoism.
   Methods: Participants were 376 elderly in good physical and mental condition. They participated in the Group Living organization in the Municipality of Curitiba, State of Parana, Brazil, in 2012. Information was collected about sociodemographic profile using a structured questionnaire. The social support, the family functionality, and the self-perception of gerontoism were defined by the Medical Outcomes Study, the Family APGAR index, and Ageism Survey, respectively. The variables were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient, One Way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD test, and the Student's t-test.
   Results: Most of the participants came from small cities from the interior (48.7%), were female (94.4%), with age ranging 60-69 yr-old (45.5%), whites (76.1%), widowers (47.1%), with children (93.9%), with low schooling (55.3%), with family income from 1-2 minimum wage (31.4%), and retirees not working (44.1%). It was not observed correlation between sociodemographic variables and self-perception of gerontoism. Statistical significance was observed between self-perception of gerontoism and social support (r= -0.26, P=0.00), and between the self-perception and family functionality (r = -0.28, P=0.00). Once the scores of self-perception of gerontoism increased, the ones from social support and family functionality, decreased.
   Conclusion: Lower self-perception of gerontoism was observed in elderly with higher social support and family functionality.

AB  - The field of behavioural genetics unambiguously demonstrates that heritable individual differences exist and are important in explaining human behaviour. Despite this, some psychological perspectives ignore this research. If we wish to comprehensively understand the impact of parenting, the environment, or any social factor, however, we must engage with genetics. In this article, I review research that reveals that genes affect not only our personalities, but the way that we understand and react to the social world. Studies further reveal that notable life events are in part explained by genetic variance. I detail how this could be the case through active, evocative, and passive genetic correlations, and go on to argue that all complex psychological traits are likely the result of multifaceted gene by environment interactions. A mistaken belief that genetic influence implies genetic essentialism, and is therefore tantamount to prejudice, is raised as possible reason why heritability is often ignored in the social sciences. The article concludes with practical suggestions for how we can embrace behavioural genetics as our methods struggle to match the divine complexity of human existence.

AB  - Social-cultural and economic-hierarchical ideological attitudes have long been used to explain variation in political partisanship. We propose two additional, stable attitudes (political cynicism and ethnic prejudice) that may help in explaining contemporary political alignments. In a Belgian (N = 509) and Dutch sample (N = 628), we showed that party support can be segmented into four broad families: left, libertarian, traditionalist, and far-right parties. Both studies revealed that social-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes were negatively related to left party support and positively to libertarian, traditionalist and far-right support. Importantly, additional variance was consistently explained by political cynicism (lower libertarian and traditionalist support), ethnic prejudice (lower left support), or both (higher far-right support). Study 2 additionally demonstrated these patterns for self-reported voting.

It is a journey that has been about looking for a meaningful and useful way of approaching empirical material collected in different research projects over more than 15 years, in an attempt to say something about how ordinary social actors talk (and possibly think) about prejudice and stereotypes. There is an immense volume of social psychological writing on this topic, and from that I discuss in detail several new(ish) discursive, critical and constructional approaches and the (im)possibility of applying them to my empirical material.

AB  - Although it is easy to assume that the psychology of parental care pertains only to parents and their children, this is not so. An emerging body of research on the parental care motivational system reveals implications for everyone. All normally developing human beings are characterized by evolved psychological mechanisms that regulate parental caregiving. These mechanisms are responsive to superficial cues and so (among nonparents as well as parents) can be triggered by the perception of young children or other childlike things. Once activated, these mechanisms precipitate protective and nurturant responses. These responses manifest in many different ways, with implications for a wide range of psychological phenomena (many of which might appear, superficially, to be unrelated to caregiving)including risk-averse attitudes, aggression, intergroup prejudice, moral judgment, impression formation, and mate preferences. This article provides an illustrative overview of empirical research documenting these implications and identifies new directions for future research on the motivational psychology of parental care.

Children believed that it was more acceptable for fathers than for peers to enforce exclusion and were more likely to use social conventional reasons to justify exclusion when the perpetrator was a father. The discussion focuses on how social domain theory needs to take children's cultural community into account.

TI  - Are Parents Really Obligated to Learn as Much as Possible about Their Children's Genomes?
T2  - HASTINGS CENTER REPORT
LA  - English
AB  - As new parents quickly learn, parenting always involves choosing your battles. Ideally, parents have the freedom to make those moral choices without the prejudice of an unreasonable or premature inflicted ought. Resolving the predictive uncertainties of genomic information is the professional responsibility of the biomedical community, just as clarifying the impact of global warming or assessing the risks of rising multidrug resistance is the responsibility of similar specialists. Until sequencing can give parents clear and meaningful information that they can use to protect their children without also burdening parents with uncertain findings about which little if anything can be done, it makes no sense to impute an obligation for them to seek it out. To do so not only increases the mental and emotional burden on parents but also distorts the scope of parental responsibility in ways that undermine parents' capacity to play their immediate role as the nurturers of a new life.

AB  - This interpretive study sought to critically examine lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) parents' experiences of community organized youth sport. Using a constant comparative method of data analysis, the authors examined perspectives of participants from Australia, Canada, and the United States. Three emergent themes best reflected the parents' experiences: (a) anticipating sexual stigma and finding accepting communities; (b) confronting assumptions of heterosexuality; and (c) educating but not flag waving. Emphasis is placed on the parents intersecting social identities and notions of privilege (e.g., socio-economic resources and the ability to live in socially progressive areas), and how it altered their experiences within the community youth sport context. The findings call attention to the responsibility of youth sport organisations to create a climate of social change through inclusive language, behaviours, and program design. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This paper reviews existing evidence on how the intercultural competence of young people can be promoted by schools. It begins by examining the concept of intercultural competence, and the values, attitudes, skills, knowledge, and understanding that together comprise this competence. The various actions that can be taken by schools to promote the intercultural competence of young people are then reviewed. These actions include: encouraging intercultural friendships; organizing periods of study abroad; arranging for students to have Internet-based intercultural contact; setting up school-community links and partnerships; encouraging and supporting students' critical reflection on their intercultural experiences and on their own cultural affiliations; using pedagogical approaches such as cooperative learning and project-based learning; using pedagogical activities that enhance the development of some of the specific components of intercultural competence (such as role plays and simulations, the analysis of texts, films, and plays, and ethnographic tasks); using a culturally inclusive curriculum; and adopting a whole school approach to valuing diversity and human rights. It is argued that, while there is evidence for the effectiveness of all these various actions, further evaluation studies using more robust methods are still required. Additional research is also required to identify the circumstances under which each form of action is most effective and the subgroups of young people who benefit the most from each action.

AB  - What factors contribute to children's tendency to view individuals as having different traits and abilities? The present research tested whether young children are influenced by adults' nonverbal behaviors when making inferences about peers. In Study 1, participants (aged 5-6 years) viewed multiple videos of interactions between a "teacher" and two "students"; all individuals were unfamiliar to participants. In each clip, the students behaved similarly, but the teacher did not: She either smiled, nodded, touched, or shook her head at one student, and she looked at the other student with a neutral expression. In Study 1, children tended to infer that students who received more positive behaviors from the teacher were smarter, nicer, and stronger. Study 2 pitted differences in the teacher's behavior against differences in the students' performance. When asked who was smarter, children selected lower-performing students who received more positive nonverbal cues from the teacher rather than higher-performing students who received less positive cues. These findings indicate that an authority figure's nonverbal behaviors can influence children's inferences about others and shed light on one mechanism guiding young children's evaluations of people in their social world.

AB  - Although a lot of research attention has already been devoted to the personality and emotional basis of right-wing attitudes and racial prejudice, the relationships between trait Emotional Intelligence (El) and the latter variables have been largely neglected. In the present study conducted in a heterogeneous sample of adults (N = 419), we aim to fill this gap in the literature. It was revealed that trait El is negatively related to Right-Wing Authoritarianism, Social Dominance Orientation, and subtle racial prejudice. These relationships can be partly explained by empathy, and more specifically the component of perspective taking. Trait El is negatively related to the ability to take the perspective of others, which in turn is associated with increased right-wing attitudes and subtle racial prejudice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This review of The Scholar Denied by Aldon D. Morris emphasizes the importance of DuBois for the start of American empirical social research. A.D. Morris correctly shows why W.E.B. DuBois was rejected, forgotten and suppressed by white sociologists for almost 100 years. Racial prejudices and scientific racism among American sociological elites prevented both Du Bois and his work from receiving the attention they rightly deserve. But my paper accentuates the role of Du Bois in the development of sociology as an empirical social science discipline. He created and published a programme of research on the African-American population. Publishing The Philadelphia Negro', he provided an excellent example of how to do such research.

AB  - The present study investigated the developmental foundation of the relation between social essentialism and attitudes. Forty-eight Jewish Israeli secular 6-year-olds were exposed to either a story emphasizing essentialism about ethnicity, or stories controlling for the salience of ethnicity or essentialism per se. After listening to a story, children's attitudes were assessed in a drawing and in an IAT task. Compared to the control conditions, children in the ethnic essentialism condition drew a Jewish and an Arab character as farther apart from each other, and the Jewish character with a more positive affect than the Arab character. Moreover, boys in the ethnic essentialism condition manifested a stronger bias in the IAT. These findings reveal an early link between essentialism and inter-group attitudes.

AB  - The social agency of museums in countering prejudices and fostering respect for differences is increasingly recognised and empirical research has begun to illuminate the impacts of exhibitions devoted to 'difficult' subjects on audiences. This paper draws on an ongoing research project conducted by two Australian universities in collaboration with the Immigration Museum Melbourne aimed at understanding the role of the Identity: Yours, Mine, Ours exhibition in countering racism and increasing the acceptance of differences among Australian high school students. The paper focuses on narrative interviews with students which offer insights into how differences are experienced and prejudices become negotiated through processes of meaning-making and embodied engagements. The empirical evidence indicates that the exhibition moves beyond the orchestration of an abstract tolerance by unsettling 'the Self' and destabilising stereotyped interpretations of 'the Other'. Identity: Yours, Mine, Ours creates a place and space of encounter in which differences are humanised, thus facilitating understandings of broader contexts through individual experiences. At the same time, the research findings suggest that the life worlds of students, their personal backgrounds and schools, are intertwined with their interpretive engagements with the exhibition and need to be considered for museum practices and further research.

AB  - A cohort of 582 Italian primary school teachers underwent a questionnaire survey to test their knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy and verify whether an intensive and focused educational program could result in improvement of knowledge and attitudes. The program consisted of a presentation of the clinical manifestations of epilepsy and the distribution of informative brochures and an educational kit on the disease and its management to be used with their students. After several months, 317 teachers were retested using the same questions. Upon retest, the number of "don't know" answers decreased significantly for almost all questions. This was not the case for negative attitudes. The same holds true for teachers believing that epilepsy is a source of learning disability and social disadvantage. These findings support the beliefs that education on epilepsy is more likely to affect ignorance than prejudice and that stronger interventions are needed to counteract stigmatizing behaviors.

AB  - Background: This study examined the effect of types of causal information about overweight on children's attitudes and intentions toward a peer presented as overweight. Methods: Participants (N = 176) were randomly assigned to read a vignette of an overweight peer in one of three conditions, which varied in the explanatory information provided for the aetiology of the peer's overweight condition: biological, environmental or no causal information, along with a vignette of an average-weight peer. Results: The provision of information that the overweight was the result of biological factors and of no causal information yielded more positive attitudes toward the overweight peer compared to those who were provided with environmental information. Information on overweight had no impact on behavioural intentions. A social desirability bias was found for each of the three experimental conditions and for the average weight condition. Conclusion: Information explaining overweight had a minimal positive effect on attitudes and no effect on intentions toward an overweight peer. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

AB  - Elementary school children (66 girls and 55 boys, aged 10-13 years) in the Western United States participated in a program designed to teach them about fairness and to decrease their engagement in gender-prejudice behaviors. The study utilized a pretest/posttest design comparing students in the treatment group to students in a control group. Children and teachers completed measures regarding the children's engagement of gender prejudice among their classmates, and students participated in focus groups after completing the program. At posttest, students in the treatment group reported experiencing less gender-prejudice by their classmates than students in the control group. Teachers also reported fewer gender-prejudice behaviors by the students in the treatment group. Qualitative analyses of the focus groups revealed that the students reported learning to challenge gender role stereotypes and endorsed a commitment to treating boys and girls fairly.

AB  - This study explored the mediating role of stereotypes and evaluations in the relationships between intergroup conflict, social contact, and behavioral intentions to engage in intergroup contact. The hypotheses, derived from realistic group conflict theory and intergroup contact theory, were tested on samples of Arab and Jewish high school students in the context of an ethno-racial intergroup conflict. As hypothesized, the less participants perceived a conflict between the groups, and the greater their past contact with out-group members, the more they were willing to engage in intergroup contact. Moreover, stereotypes and evaluations mediated these effects in the Jewish sample. The implications of these findings for the study of the mechanisms underlying prejudice are discussed.

AB  - Individuals tend to explain the characteristics of others with reference to an underlying essence, a tendency that has been termed psychological essentialism. Drawing on current conceptualizations of essentialism as a fundamental mode of social thinking, and on prior studies investigating belief in genetic determinism (BGD) as a component of essentialism, we argue that BGD cannot constitute the sole basis of individuals' essentialist reasoning. Accordingly, we propose belief in social determinism (BSD) as a complementary component of essentialism, which relies on the belief that a person's essential character is shaped by social factors (e.g., upbringing, social background). We developed a scale to measure this social component of essentialism. Results of five correlational studies indicate that (a) BGD and BSD are largely independent, (b) BGD and BSD are related to important correlates of essentialist thinking (e.g., dispositionism, perceived group homogeneity), (c) BGD and BSD are associated with indicators of fundamental epistemic and ideological motives, and (d) the endorsement of each lay theory is associated with vital social-cognitive consequences (particularly stereotyping and prejudice). Two experimental studies examined the idea that the relationship between BSD and prejudice is bidirectional in nature. Study 6 reveals that rendering social-deterministic explanations salient results in increased levels of ingroup favoritism in individuals who chronically endorse BSD. Results of Study 7 show that priming of prejudice enhances endorsement of social-deterministic explanations particularly in persons habitually endorsing prejudiced attitudes.

AB  - Gender and ethnicity are important aspects of children's everyday social relationships, yet little is known about how these social categories influence children's collaborative interactions. In the present study, 322 White (Caucasian) and South Asian boys and girls (mean age, 7.5 years) collaborated in pairs on easy and difficult versions of a model completion task. As expected, girls were less assertive than boys in conversation, yet this relation held only for all-Asian pairs (i.e., an Asian boy and girl in conversation). Also consistent with expectations, levels of conversational affiliation were lowest in cross-ethnic interaction. The influence of gender and ethnicity on conversations did not vary in light of contrasting cognitive demands of the tasks. Results are discussed in relation to work on effective peer collaboration and the potential role of contact in promoting positive ethnic and gender group attitudes.

KW  - Qualitative research
KW  - Phenomenology
AB  - Background Birth outside of marriage has been gradually increasing in Korea. However, social perception of unmarried mothers is still negative, and a number of them are not accepted by their family. Therefore, the Korean government has implemented a policy to provide financial aid and communal residence to unmarried mothers who cannot raise children with their family, or afford residence. Unmarried young mothers who rely on this government policy have low economic independence and social adaptation skills. Additionally, they have a high chance of encountering numerous challenges in raising children due to their living conditions in residential facilities and social prejudice. This study was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of the lived experience of unmarried mothers raising children in residential facilities. Methods Data were collected through in-depth interviews with nine unmarried mothers living in residential facilities with their children. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Results The findings revealed that unmarried mothers struggled with various difficulties given the limitations of living in the facility, but attempted to navigate their uncertain future with the determination to be good mothers. Three main themes and eight sub-themes emerged: (1) adaptation to the identity of "unmarried mother", (2) willingly undertaking the heavy burden of childrearing, (3) indispensable but insufficient supports from facilities. Participants had childrearing responsibilities, and tried to be good mothers for their children while struggling to adapt to their new identities. However, their self-doubt as a "good mother" and the absence of the child's father made them feel sorry for their child. Their daily experiences raising children and simultaneously preparing for their own independence were exhausting. The supports from the facilities were helpful but unsatisfactory and led to various psychosocial difficulties such as anxiety, depression, fear, guilty, and anger in unmarried mothers. Conclusions Besides information and resources for parenting and independence, active approaches are needed to improve the psychological stability of unmarried mothers raising their children in facilities, and sustain a long-term socioeconomic support system. Thoughtful services tailored to mothers and children are also needed, instead of standardized services.

AB  - In the United States, Asians appear disproportionately underrepresented in leadership roles, a puzzling phenomenon known as the "Bamboo Ceiling" (Hyun, 2005; Lu et al., 2020). We advance a social network explanation for this phenomenon: ethnic homophily. We theorize that East Asians (e.g., ethnic Chinese)-but not South Asians (e.g., ethnic Indians)-are less likely than other ethnicities to emerge as leaders in multiethnic environments partly because East Asians socialize more with ethnic ingroup members (other East Asians). Analyzing a survey of 54,620 Juris Doctor (JD) students from 124 U.S. law schools, Study 1 revealed that East Asians had the highest ethnic homophily of all ethnicities. Studies 2 and 3 examined friendship networks and leadership emergence in 11 class sections of new Master of Business Administration (MBA) students in a U.S. business school, and found that East Asians were the least likely to be nominated and elected as leaders. Social network analysis revealed that, compared to South Asians, Latinos, and Whites, East Asians exhibited higher ethnic homophily, which mediated their lower leadership emergence. These effects occurred for both East Asian internationals and East Asian Americans, and were robust after accounting for variables such as assertiveness (parallel mediator), network centrality, English proficiency, demographics, and personality. By integrating social network analysis into psychology, we identify ethnic homophily as one reason why the Bamboo Ceiling exists for East Asians but not South Asians. Moreover, by uncovering the negative link between ethnic homophily and leadership emergence, our research suggests that bonding with people from different ethnic backgrounds can facilitate individuals' leadership emergence in multiethnic environments.

AB  - People who have experienced mental health problems often encounter stigmatisation, mainly by professional mental health care providers. Therefore, involvement of experts by experience in courses taught at a higher education institution that provides training for future healthcare professionals aims at destigmatising mental illnesses. Peer trainers have a lived mental health problems experience who take on the role of trainers to present the latest mental health care trends and theories and introduce recovery elements into the educational process.
   The data on which the article is based were gathered over a period of three years from focus groups involving 2nd year students of the bachelor's degree programme of 'Clinical Social Worker'. The results obtained clearly show the destigmatising effect of this type of teaching: what has proven to be crucial in this regard was, on the one hand, the experience of former patients, and on the other hand, a counterweight to the often-one-sided information prevalent in professional literature on mental health available in the Czech Republic. The teaching reinforced the students' ability to work in a multidisciplinary team together with a peer support worker and also undermined any prejudice they may have had towards people with mental health problems.

AB  - Public campaigns debating the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) individuals to be treated as equal under the law highlight stigma and prejudice harmful to health and well-being. Previous research documenting the negative effects of political campaigns on LGBTIQ people's health and well-being has largely left unexplored the effects on their families and allies. The present study analyzed open-ended responses of the parent allies of LGBTIQ people (N = 232) to questions about the effects of the public debate during the 2017 Australian Marriage Law postal survey. Parents expressed some positive experiences of connection to other supporters of marriage equality. Parents also reported many negative emotions and experiences. The debates increased their awareness of prejudice and discrimination targeting their children and made them fearful for their own and their children's safety. Parents reported negative impacts on some interpersonal relationships with friends, family members, co-workers, and other community members. They expressed feelings of alienation and anger toward the government, media, and religious institutions for fostering anti-LGBTIQ prejudice and discrimination. Some parents reported feeling discouraged about society or humanity in general because of the public debate. Findings are discussed in relation to affiliate stigma and parental minority stress, and the need to consider in research and practice the effects of LGBTIQ stigmatization on family systems.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study is to determine the homophobia levels of parents of students who receive nursing education and the factors affecting their homophobia levels.
   Design and Methods The study was carried out as a descriptive and cross-sectional study on the 375 parents of nursing students.
   Findings There was statistically significant difference between the case when parents know that there is a homosexual individual in their immediate environment and the mean The Hudson and Ricketts Homophobia Scale (HRHS) score, as well as between the case when parents know that a friend of theirs is homosexual and the mean HRHS score (p < 0.05).
   Practice Implications It should be taken into account that parents' prejudices against homosexuals may also affect the way their children view homosexuals.

AB  - The rate of migration has increased in Turkey in recent years. The school setting is the most important area for socialization and acculturation for immigrant adolescents. It is also the place where they might be exposed to negative attitudes and behaviors from their peers. Immigrant adolescents are at risk of experiencing ethnic-based cyberbullying; however, the research on its causes was limited despite the growing numbers of immigrant adolescents. We examined (a) the predictive role of adolescents' and their peers' attitudes toward immigrant adolescents' ethnic-based cyberbullying behaviors and (b) whether the immigrant background of the cyber victim affects adolescents' reasoning about cyberbullying toward immigrants. To address the research questions, we used a mixed-method design. The sample included 139 participants ((X) over bar (age)=13.16, SD=0.94) who attended two different secondary schools in Ankara. We found that both adolescents' and their peers' negative attitudes predicted ethnic-based cyberbullying. However, a positive attitude toward immigrants was not found to be related to ethnic-based cyberbullying. Qualitative analysis results regarding ethnic discrimination were interpreted within the framework of behavioral privacy. The present study highlighted that immigrant students are more likely to be cyber victimized in the presence of a negative attitude toward immigrants at the class level.

AB  - This article highlights interracial relationships between Black U.S. occupation personnel and Austrian women. Their intimate contacts were often confronted with vehement rejection on account of a racist limitation of love and sexuality. Beyond discriminatory ascriptions, this article aims to provide nuanced insights into such Black/White relationships in the context of the postwar occupation era, the individual experiences thereof, and the social as well as institutional treatment of these encounters. The focus lies especially on the women involved, who - regarded as having gravely betrayed social values - were confronted with being categorized beyond the boundaries of respectable femininity: What motivated their 'love despite racist taboos'? How did racist prejudices determine their personal circumstances and their social status, including after the end of the occupation? What did it mean to have a mixed-race child without the prospect of being fully integrated? And what can we learn from the subsequent social reactions and discourses about Austrian postwar society, the process of national reconstruction, and the divisions drawn between the self and the other?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Self-stigma represents a process of accepting negative social prejudices with a consequent negative impact on many areas of the patient's life (self-concept, social and work functioning, relationships, cooperation in treatment, quality of life, willingness to strive for something). The study was aimed to examine the level of self-stigma and other significant variables potentially related to self-stigma (personality characteristics, childhood traumatisation, anxiety, depression, personality disorder, dissociation, parental styles, attachment).
   METHOD: The study was conducted at the Psychotherapeutic section of the Psychiatric Department in Regional Hospital Liberec from October 2015 to March 2019. A total of 96 hospitalised patients with neurotic spectrum disorders diagnosed by an experienced psychiatrist according to ICD-10 (panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder, mixed anxiety depressive disorder, somatoform disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adjustment disorders) were included into the study and filled in the test battery.
   RESULTS: The main finding is that self-stigma is related to the severity of the disorder, anxiety and depression, social anxiety, the comorbid occurrence of other anxiety disorders or personality disorders, dissociation, personality temperamental traits Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Self-Directedness. We have not established a connection between attachment in close relationships and self-stigma. The most important predictors of self-stigma are the disorder's duration, reduced Self-Directedness, a higher rate of depression and social anxiety, which together explain 58% of severity if self-stigma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-stigma is a contemporary topic in research and clinical practice. The results can be used as a basis for the development of targeted intervention strategies aimed at reducing self-stigma or for further research studies in the field of self-stigma.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the reasons for teachers to voluntarily leave school management and which emotional states these reasons may cause. This research, designed in the descriptive phenomenological method, was conducted in Duzce in the 2018-2019 academic year with the participation of 13 teachers. The data collected through semi-structured questions were subjected to content analysis. At the end of this study, the reasons for teachers who left school management conflicted with upper and lower management, excessive workload, prejudices based on social identity perception, discrimination and favoritism, teacher, student and parent factor, the influence of family (spouse) and child, not receiving support from upper management and not being valued, financial difficulties and less authority-more responsibility. The findings showed that the emotional states caused by these reasons were unhappiness and anxiety, feeling of depression, failure and inadequacy, mental fatigue and depersonalization, anxiety, dilemma, stress, feeling worthless, anxiety, hurt and reluctance/apathy. At the end of this research, suggestions were made for the solution of the problems faced by the school principals and the negative emotional situations.

AB  - The article argues that, although digital and social media provide space and means for children's cosmopolitan citizenship, the tendency to reproduce cultural and ethnic stereotypes and prejudice prevalent in mainstream media can limit their capability and willingness to act and think as such. Drawing upon qualitative participatory research conducted with more than seventy children living in the Czech Republic, the article explores how children's media practice had a tendency to reproduce cultural hegemony. The paper ultimately argues that multicultural education and media education can together support children in reflecting on and challenging cultural hegemony, while at the same time potentially contribute to their transnational participation and cooperation with the use of digital and social media.

AB  - This article examined the associations between weight status (body mass index [BMI] and perceived weight measures) and school bullying experiences (being bullied and bullying others) of children and adolescents in urban China. A national representative sample (n= 3,675) of all types of pre-college schools from seven Chinese cities was employed for the analysis. Students from all grades in high school, vocational school, middle school, and primary grades 4 to 6 were surveyed. Height, weight, perceived weight status, and experiences of being bullied and bullying others were obtained. The results demonstrated that the objective weight status (BMI) was neither associated with being bullied overall by others nor associated with bullying others, but the subjective/perceived weight status was significantly related to being bullied. Regarding the specific forms of being bullied, underweight (measured by BMI) students were less likely to be cyberbullied, whereas obese (measured by BMI) students were more likely to be cyberbullied. Students who perceived themselves as slightly fat and too fat were more likely to be verbally bullied. Overweight and obese students were more likely to bully others physically and relationally, and the students who perceived themselves as too thin were positively associated with physically bullying others. Moreover, BMI had a role in the involvement in school bullying for boys, whereas perceived weight status had a role in school bullying involvement in girls. These results indicate that school bullying prevention and intervention should consider weight status, as well as gender differences.

AB  - This commentary on Sehrbrock's "Social Thirdness: Intersubjective Conceptions of the Experience of Gender Prejudice" highlights the role of social thirdness and its breakdown across a variety of domains, clinically and cross-culturally. It expands upon Sehrbrock's concept of White Fragility, introducing the concept of mythological fragility-one that pertains to the need to maintain a person's and/or a culture's collective psychological organization and their essential ties to important others. The role of "horsing around"-the exercise of an expansive sense of play, freedom, creativity, passion, and authenticity-is essential not only in early life, but in the clinical setting, allowed, or sometimes disallowed, in the context of clinical psychoanalysis. This commentary argues, in agreement with Sehrbrock, that clinical work should provide a space in which both patient and analyst can indeed "horse around" and then see what becomes of it. This includes the adoption of an attitude of constructive uncertainty and of striving to be open to surprise, however welcome or unwelcome that surprise may be.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to compare Israeli gay men and lesbians (GL) with their heterosexual counterparts in terms of their estimated likelihood of parenthood and to further assess the association between estimated likelihood of parenthood and psychological well-being as a function of sexual orientation. Methods A total of 449 childless participants (202 self-reported as GL) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 27.86, SD = 4.49) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2017 and April 2018. They completed questionnaires assessing their estimated likelihood of parenthood, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and happiness. Results GL reported a lower estimated likelihood of parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. Also, estimated likelihood of parenthood was associated with psychological well-being indicators, and this association was moderated by sexual orientation, such that stronger associations were evident between estimated likelihood of parenthood and fewer depressive symptoms, greater life satisfaction, and happiness among heterosexual men and women in comparison to GL. Conclusions The findings are interpreted in light of GL possible awareness of discriminatory local policies concerning sexual minority rights in their quest to parenthood alongside pressure to have children that is greater for heterosexual couples than that faced by GL in the Israeli pronatal sociocultural environment. Policy makers should consider the disparities in estimated likelihood of parenthood between GL and heterosexual counterparts and their possible linkage to the discriminatory Israeli social policies regarding GL rights.

AB  - One way in which information about the unknown is socialized to children is through adult testimony. Sharing false testimony about others with children may foster inaccurate perceptions and may result in prejudicially based divisions amongst children. As part of a larger study, mothers were instructed to read and discuss an illustrated story about Arab-Muslim refugees from Syria with their 6- to 8-year-olds (n = 31). Parent-child discourse during two pages of this book was examined for how mothers used Islam as a talking point. Results indicated that only 50% of mothers and 13% of children shared accurate testimony about Islam. However, while 35% of children admitted uncertainty in their knowledge, only 3% of mothers admitted uncertainty. These results highlight the importance of parents sharing the confidence in their knowledge. If parents teach inaccurate information about other religions, it may create a greater divide between children of different religious backgrounds.

AB  - Research frequently demonstrates diverse communities exhibit lower intra-community cohesion. Recent studies suggest there is little evidence perceived ethnic threat plays a role in this relationship. This paper re-examines the roles of ethnic threat and prejudice in the diversity/cohesion relationship. First, we test threat/prejudice as conceptualised in the literature: as mediators of diversity's effect. Second, we test a reformulation of the roles of threat/prejudice: as moderators of diversity's effect. Applying multi-level models to cross-sectional and longitudinal data of White British individuals across England and Oldham (a unique English town case-study) we find neighbour-trust lower in diverse communities. However, perceived-threat/prejudice does not mediate this relationship. Instead, we find perceived-threat/prejudice moderate diversity's impact on neighbour-trust. The result is diversity only reduces neighbour-trust among individuals who already viewed out-groups as threatening. Longitudinal analysis confirms the importance of out-group attitudes in the diversity/neighbour-trust relationship. In diverse communities, residents whose out-group attitudes improve, or worsen, become more, or less, trusting of their neighbours. However, in homogeneous communities, changes in out-group attitudes are not linked to changes in neighbour-trust. We therefore argue and demonstrate that perceived-threat emerges from other societal processes (such as socio-economic precariousness) and it is when individuals who already view out-groups as threatening experience diverse neighbourhoods that local cohesion declines.

AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the social representations of pregnant and puerperal detained women regarding giving birth of prison. A qualitative approach was developed with nineteen women, housed in the prisons of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Data collection was done through group interviews, analyzed by Iramuteq software. Representations about giving birth during incarceration are marked the suffering occasioned by the fear of separation. The process of labor is manifested by the prejudice of society; the type of delivery seems to influence the conception of giving birth and being a mother. The study points out the importance of understanding the problems of maternity in prison, as well as the difficulties that are related. In addition, it's necessary to improve the attention and care of health professionals and managers in guaranteeing the rights of this population.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to research the practices related to cultural diversity experienced by the students in schools and the student views about these practices. The research has been carried out with phenomenological research design which is the one of the qualitative research methods. The data of research has been collected through semi-structured interviews. The study group was determined by criterion sampling which is the one of the purposive sampling methods, and it consists of 9 students studying at various schools in Stuttgart, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. Research data were analyzed by content analysis. Findings related to the cultural diversity practices experienced by students in schools are as follows: "Practices for recognizing different cultural features within the context various courses; cultural diversity sensitive teacher behaviors; practices enabling to choose the own native language and culture course and to learn different languages; enabling to choose and take courses related to different belief systems based on a sect/religion; school activities for recognizing different cultures; preference of textbooks and materials that reflect cultural diversity". Findings related to students' views about these practices are as follows: Trying to understand their friends by learning similarities and differences between themselves and their friends; realizing the reasons for prejudices against differences; to be able to express their differences comfortably; solving problems in conflict situations related to differences; being friends with people who have different cultural and social characteristics.

AB  - The attributional theory of stigma maintains that the rejection of the stigmatized group increases when attributions are made to controllable causes rather than to genetic factors. Our study has two objectives: one, to provide evidence for the bifactorial structure of the scale of Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS); and two, to carry out a direct replication of a previous experimental study about the effect of the etiology of the homosexual sexual orientation on attitudes toward same-sex parents. The sample was composed of 229 Spanish university students with a mean age of 26.18years (SD=9.43). This study demonstrates that the rejection of same-sex parents is greater when the homosexual sexual orientation is attributed to learning. The effect is observed in the scores on the two subscales: traditional rejection or individual opposition and modern rejection or normative opposition. The practical implications of our findings are related to homophobia intervention programs in educational settings or in the promotion of social change.

AB  - School interventions to address sexual orientation discrimination can be important tools for fostering inclusive school climate, and improving student wellbeing. In this study, we empirically evaluated a film-based intervention, Out in Schools, designed to reduce sexual orientation prejudice and foster inclusive school attitudes. Our evaluation mapped data about Out in Schools presentations onto student data from the random cluster-stratified, province-wide 2013 British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (BCAHS) as well as potential confounding variables of Gay-Straight Alliance clubs (GSAs) and inclusive school policies. Outcome measures included past year sexual orientation discrimination, bullying, suicidal ideation, and school connectedness among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual (HET) students in grades 8 through 12 (ages 13 to 18; unweighted N = 21,075, weighted/scaled N = 184,821). Analyses used complex samples logistic regression, adjusted for sample design, conducted separately by gender and orientation. We found Out in Schools presentations were associated with reduced odds of LGB students experiencing discrimination, and both LGB and HET girl students being bullied or considering suicide, and increased levels of school connectedness, even after controlling for GSAs and policies. Out in Schools appears to have an additive contribution to reducing orientation prejudice and improving LGB and heterosexual student wellbeing within schools.

AB  - Organizations are increasingly concerned with fostering successful diversity. Toward this end, diversity research has focused on trying to reduce prejudice and biased behavior. But what happens when prejudice in the workplace inevitably occurs? Research also needs to focus on whether recovery and repair of social relations after expressions of prejudice are possible. To begin investigating this question, we develop a new framework for understanding reactions to prejudice in the workplace. We hypothesized that when women and minorities choose to confront a prejudiced comment in a workplace interaction (vs. remain silent) and hold a growth (vs. fixed) mindset-the belief that others can change-they remain more positive in their subsequent outlook in the workplace. Studies 1a, 1b, and 2 used hypothetical workplace scenarios to expose participants to someone who expressed bias; Study 3 ensured real-world relevance by eliciting retrospective accounts of workplace bias from African American employees. Across studies, women and minorities who confronted the perpetrator of prejudice exhibited more positive subsequent expectations of that coworker when they held a growth mindset. It is important that these more positive expectations were associated with reports of greater workplace belonging (Study 2), ratings of improved relations with coworkers who had displayed bias (Study 3), and greater workplace satisfaction (Studies 2-3). Thus, a growth mindset contributes to successful workplace diversity by protecting women's and minorities' outlook when they opt to confront expressions of bias.

AB  - Iranians have settled in a number of areas in the United States, especially Southern California and Texas, and experience substantial prejudice as a result of perceptions of their religion and national origin. This study explored the relationship between Iranian immigrant parents' acculturation and the level of conflict they experience with their U.S.-born children. A survey was used to collect data from a sample of 100 first-generation Iranian immigrant parents living in Orange County, CA, with children aged 11-22 years. Parent-acculturation levels were expected to predict parent-child conflicts (PCCs) resulting from potential acculturation gaps between children and parents. Results demonstrated a moderate positive relationship between Iranian cultural involvement and PCC and a weak negative relationship between American cultural involvement and PCC. The effects of various demographic variables were also considered. Results show higher PCC levels among lower income families, suggesting a need for support from schools, counselors, or other institutions.

AB  - Prior work has established that children and adults distinguish moral norms (e.g., hitting is wrong) from conventional norms (e.g., wearing pajamas to school is wrong). Specifically, moral norms are generally perceived as universal across time and space, similar to objective facts. We examined preschoolers' and adults' perceptions of moral beliefs alongside facts and opinions by asking whether only one person could be right in the case of disagreements. We also compared perceptions of widely shared moral beliefs (e.g., whether it is better to pull someone's hair or share with someone) and controversial moral beliefs (e.g., whether it is better to help someone with a project or make cookies for someone). In Studies 1 and 2, preschoolers and adults were more likely to judge that only one person could be right in the case of widely shared versus controversial moral beliefs, treating the former as more objective or fact-like. Children were also more likely than adults to say that only one person could be right in a moral disagreement. Study 2 additionally revealed that adults were more likely than children to report preferring individuals who shared their controversial moral beliefs. Study 3 replicated these patterns using a different sample of widely shared beliefs (e.g., whether it is okay to mock a poor classmate) and controversial moral beliefs (e.g., whether it is okay to tell small, prosocial lies). While some aspects of moral cognition may depend on abundant social learning and cognitive development, the perception that disagreements about widely shared moral beliefs have only one right answer while disagreements about controversial moral beliefs do not emerges relatively early. We discuss implications for moral learning and social preferences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Victimisation has a negative effect on psychosocial functioning. Based on the resilience theory, and with a sample of 2975 Portuguese students, the present study aims to: i) identify patterns of adjustment in the face of peer victimisation and perceptions of discrimination; ii) explore the association between the patterns of adjustment and the characteristics of participants (the who) and of the victimisation (the when and why). Cluster analysis revealed five patterns of adjustment: Unchallenged; Externally Maladjusted; Internally Maladjusted; Resilient, and At-Risk. The results suggest that there is no complete resilience in the face of social victimisation. Group differences were found regarding: i) gender, type of course, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, parental educational level and religious beliefs; ii) the age at which peer victimisation was more frequent, and; iii) the motives underlying discrimination. Globally considered, peer victimisation is representative of the wider cultural environment and interventions should also target social prejudices.

AB  - The article analyzes the impact of a documentary on the daily lives of mothers and children with disabilities, exhibited at conferences, festivals, universities and schools in Brazil, Colombia and Japan. Produced by film and health professionals, social scientists and a women's network, the feature film "A special day" was awarded at Assim Vivemos VI International Disability Film Festival (2013-2014). The objective is to analyze the impact of the film and its diffusion among professionals and students from health and education areas. We adopted a methodology of cine debates that were recorded, transcribed and coded. The circuit toured 22 locations with one or more exhibitions for 3.370 people, of which nine presentations were analyzed. Our interpretations were guided by the notions as life account, biographical pact, imaginary and social representation. We analyzed gender issues, family and maternal care; reactions, adaptations and life after the diagnosis of disabilities; discrimination and prejudice; school and inclusion. The study showed that the communicative and expressive power of film becomes a powerful social technology to address gender, maternity and disability as an important and strategic issue for public health in the country.

AB  - This article highlights the importance of humour and laughter in analyses of ethnicity and race in everyday life, and contributes to the growing anthropological engagement with the role of the ludic in social life. Focusing on pupil interaction in an ethnically and racially diverse London school, it argues that while peer classification practices can lead to reification of ethnic and racial differences, ludic interactions have cross-cutting, counter-balancing or liquefying effects. In interactions of humour, ethnic and racial differences can become the very material from which banter and laughter are created, constituting a convivial sociality that manifests closeness at the same time as difference. Such interactions enable peers to address their racial and ethnic differences, and a wider context of prejudice and racism, lightly, making fun out of' what could potentially divide and distance them.

AB  - In the present research, we examined the hypothesis that cues of social connectedness to a member of another social group can spark interest in the group's culture, and that such interest, when freely enacted, contributes to reductions in intergroup prejudice. In two pilot studies and Experiment 1, we found that extant and desired cross-group friendships and cues of social connectedness to an out-group member predicted increased interest in the target group's culture. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated cues of social connectedness between non-Latino American participants and a Latino American (i.e., Mexican American) peer and whether participants freely worked with this peer on a Mexican cultural task. This experience reduced the participants' implicit bias against Latinos, an effect that was mediated by increased cultural engagement, and, 6 months later in an unrelated context, improved intergroup outcomes (e.g., interest in interacting with Mexican Americans; Experiment 4). The Discussion section addresses the inter- and intragroup benefits of policies that encourage people to express and share diverse cultural interests in mainstream settings.

AB  - The objective of this article is to analyse the process of institutionalisation of public elementary schooling associated with the political organisation of the constitutional monarchy and the legislation regarding citizen rights and prerogatives in Brazil, especially in the province of Minas Gerais, during the nineteenth century. During this century, two characteristics in Brazil were significant: the existence of a constitutional monarchy from 1822 to 1889 and the continuity of slavery until 1888. Paradoxically, the development of the idea of citizen rights and duties, and steps taken to provide access to elementary school, coexisted with these characteristics. Education was considered a decisive step for the effective implementation of social change. My hypothesis is that the new political structure also led to a new dynamic of interdependence between rulers and ruled as constituents of the civilising process underway. Even so, this was an extremely tense process whose results fell short of those intended by the elite governing authorities; by the end of the nineteenth century, Brazil still had an illiteracy rate of 85%. In order to understand this situation, an analysis of situations and conflicts present in the process of implementing public elementary education is essential. Important among these are poverty, ethnic and racial prejudice, political decentralisation of elementary education administration, disputes among local politicians and the definition of teachers as public servants and funding of school supplies. For this study, documents consulted included government reports, laws, official letters and correspondence among government officers, parents and teachers. The main theoretical concepts used were Norbert Elias' sociological theory for analysis of the civilising process and the dynamics of interdependence in the organisation of society, and the characteristics of postcolonial society discussed by Hilda Sabato, Marcelo Caruso and Miriam Dolhnikoff.

AB  - Considerable research has been devoted to understanding intergroup contact. In this paper I aimed to highlight theoretical processes that reduce cross-group prejudice and promote intergroup cooperation. Therefore, I focused on the role of social contact in the form of romantic relationship between individuals belonging to different (e.g., racial, ethnic, religious) social groups. In emerging work convincing evidence has been provided that cross-group friendships reduce intergroup prejudice (Levin, van Laar, & Sidanius, 2003). Accordingly, cross-group romantic relationships should also reduce intergroup prejudice. Overall, in this paper I emphasized the significance of affective ties among members of different social groups, along with the unique role that social contact plays in reducing intergroup prejudice.

AB  - In multilingual schools students have diverse identities, cultural backgrounds, perceptions, capacities and linguistic experiences. The space for teaching and learning is also mediated by stereotypes and prejudices associated with this diversity. Diversity, stereotypes and prejudices shape how teachers and learners operate in a world of complex social relationships. In this survey we explore the hidden attitudes of immigrant students and teachers in secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). The research uses the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes to analyse immigrant students' perceptions and teachers' subconscious perceptions about school involvement. The sample includes 4078 immigrant students with more than six months of residence in the host country that were attending linguistic support classes in secondary schools of Catalonia during the year 2006-2007, and also their regular classroom teachers and support teachers. The survey aims to establish if is there any statistically significant associations between the attitudes of newcomer students and teachers, and the linguistic and geographical origins of the students. We wanted to know if teacher and student perceptions agreed or differed and to characterise stereotypes and prejudices affecting positive or negative attitudes about the organisation of teaching while learning. The results show how the teachers' perceptions about newcomer students' involvement differ in many cases from the views of the students, and how lower expectations and subjective manifestations of racism are evident with some groups, especially with students of African origin.

AB  - Peer education regarding respect for LGB individuals can be understood as citizenship education with a specific content. Students who participate in an intervention to increase respect for sexual and gender minorities may also increase their general citizenship competences. Also, participation in such an intervention may strengthen students' awareness of the relationship between reflections on citizenship and attitudes toward LGB people. A peer educator intervention on sexual and gender minorities was implemented in pre-vocational secondary education by peer educators and 13 to 17years old students. We examined the impact on attitudes toward LGB peers with a one-group pretest post-test design, and also used this method to examine reflections on acting as a democratic citizen. We found one significant (positive) correlation between a positive judgment of LGB peers and reflection on acting in a socially responsible manner, which was one of the three democratic citizenship reflection scales we used. No effects were found on either attitudes toward LGB peers or reflection on acting as a democratic citizen. Peer education that is more integrated into the daily social practice of students may increase impact.

AB  - Across two studies, we investigated gender stereotype knowledge and endorsement in UK schoolchildren, and their impact on academic subject choice. In Study 1, children aged 9-11 (N = 68) and 13-15 (N = 61) completed a newly developed Gender Attribute scale assessing their knowledge and endorsement of gender stereotypes relating to academic subjects and occupations. Participants demonstrated gender stereotype knowledge and endorsement, although significantly higher knowledge than endorsement scores indicated a level of stereotype rejection. Stereotype knowledge was greater in the older age group, and older girls showed significantly higher levels of stereotype rejection than all other groups. In Study 2, children aged 13-15 (N = 165) completed the Gender Attribute scale and provided information on their school subject choices. Patterns of stereotype knowledge and endorsement followed those of Study 1. Subject choice information showed that boys selected significantly more masculine than feminine subjects, while girls chose a similar proportion of each. Further, boys' level of gender stereotype endorsement predicted their subject choices, while girls' did not. We suggest that in contemporary UK some progress is being made in relation to girls challenging stereotypes that work against them but that more work is needed to encourage boys into female-dominated disciplines.

AB  - Utilizing exogenous variation in educational attainment induced by compulsory schooling reforms in 15 European countries, this study estimates the causal effect of education on individuals' attitudes towards sexual minorities with a regression discontinuity design. Using data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study, this study finds more education reduces individuals' prejudice against sexual minorities. The findings imply minimum schooling policies can help to build a culture that is more tolerant of sexual minorities, which is beneficial to the minorities' wellbeing and social cohesion.

AB  - Few public policies have been as consequential or divisive as affirmative action. Proponents have argued for the need for equity and the redress of past and present discrimination, whereas opponents enlist claims over individual liberty and merit. Scholars have examined support to affirmative action, asking to what extent citizens' support is shaped by their political ideology, interest, prejudice, or some combination thereof. Much work to date has focused on the United States, where disentangling theoretical explanations has proved challenging. We turn our attention to an understudied but important case: Brazil. Brazil has implemented a broad form of affirmative action for admission to federal universities that include consideration of the applicant's education, income, and race. Adopting both a conventional question and a list experiment embedded in a face-to-face survey among a nationally representative sample of adult Brazilians, we find that public support for affirmative action suffers from social desirability bias, and in our subsequent regression analysis, that attitudes about affirmative action are structured especially by individuals' interests.

AB  - Introduction Sexual prejudice negatively affects the quality of life and life chances of those involved. Manual workers are consistently found to be less accepting of homosexuality in studies of sexual conformism. This can be seen as an application of Lipset's 'working class conformism'. Our core hypothesis is that this lower tolerance is rooted in working-class experiences. Counter-arguments are that that social class does not matter in contemporary society and that the relationship is spurious, with education as the true cause. Methods We test the central hypothesis with European survey data. First, we regress sexual prejudice on time trends and class with repeated cross-sections from the European Social Survey, ranging from 2002 to 2016. As an extra check, this is also applied to the European Values Study, going back to 1981. Further, we test the spuriousness argument with a matching design, testing whether stratification accounts for the lag. Results The time series shows a stable lag between working-class members and others against the general trend of decreasing sexual prejudice. The matching design provides evidence that working-class membership in itself is a factor behind differences in sexual prejudice. Conclusions Contrary to 'death of class' conjectures, working-class membership is related to sexual prejudice. This contribution shows that this gap is due to experiences of belonging to the working class and not solely to educational differences. Policy Implications Occupational experiences, especially in low-skill manual labour, have social effects in areas such as sexual prejudice. Improving the quality of work thus facilitates a more inclusive society for sexual minorities.

AB  - In the last 60 years, the proportion of white Americans expressing anti-black prejudice in face-to-face survey interviews has declined dramatically. To test whether social desirability pressures affect the expression of anti-black prejudice, we analyzed a within-subjects experiment in the 2008 American National Election Study in which white respondents first reported their endorsement of stereotypes of blacks confidentially via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) and weeks or months later orally during second interviews. Shifting to ACASI led to a small but significant increase in negative views of blacks. Unexpectedly, shifting to ACASI also led to a similarly large increase in negative views of whites. Furthermore, the ACASI reports had no more predictive validity than did the oral reports. This evidence suggests that social desirability pressures do not seriously compromise oral reports of racial stereotypes in face-to-face interviews.

AB  - In recent years Jewish pediatrician Kathe Beutler and her family, refugees from National Socialist Germany, have come to attention through her grandson Bruce Beutler's award of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. However, the complex history of this family has not been investigated in detail, despite the fact that Kathe Beutler presented the rare example of a married physician, who was able to reestablish a pediatric practice in her new home country. The following study draws from a wide variety of archival resources and personal documents, to trace the history of the Beutler family through a century of political turmoil. It contributes to the so-far limited knowledge of the life of women doctors before and after forced emigration, exploring Kathe's experience as a professional, a member of the German Jewish middle-class, a wife and a mother. The Beutler family demonstrates the societal impact on the potential fates and achievements of the members of one family unit, a potential that when realized under conditions of political, economical, and personal support, can result in the highest academic achievements, but a potential that is lost under conditions of prejudice and persecution. The story of Kathe Beutler and her family could not be more relevant than at the present, at a time of the global resurgence of nationalism, displacement, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.

AB  - The roles of authoritarianism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and prejudice in the prediction of far-right support were examined in Europe and the United States. A meta-analysis shows remarkably similar, positive, and strong associations of far-right support with these three variables in previous studies conducted in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results from two cross-sectional studies in the United States further indicated that higher levels of authoritarianism and SDO related to higher voting intentions and support for Trump, via increased prejudice. In a three-wave longitudinal study in the United Kingdom, authoritarianism and SDO predicted pro-Brexit attitudes and support for the U.K. Independence Party, again via prejudice. These results shed a new light on the widely held beliefs in "American and British exceptionalism," as Trump and Brexit adherents share the same social-psychological underpinnings as far-right supporters observed in several European countries.

AB  - Intergroup contact reduces prejudice against a variety of social outgroups and seems to be particularly effective at reducing prejudice in individuals most prone to it-those high in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). The present study examines the moderating roles of RWA and SDO in the contact-prejudice relationship, targeting dissident, dangerous, and derogated outgroups: lesbians and gay men, people with schizophrenia, and Indigenous Australians, respectively. In total, 234 participants self-reported contact and prejudice against these outgroups and completed RWA and SDO scales. Contact predicted less prejudice against lesbians and gay men and Indigenous Australians in participants high in RWA and participants high in SDO. However, contact only predicted less prejudice against people with schizophrenia in participants low in RWA or SDO. The results suggest that the ability for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice in prejudice-prone individuals may depend on the outgroup targeted, specifically the threat they pose and the level of prejudice held against them.

AB  - Not many interventions are available to improve the school climate for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth in prevocational secondary education. In four schools with different student populations, this study examined the impact of a newly designed peer-educator intervention on attitudes towards lesbian women and gay men and on the class climate for LGB youth. The possibility of disclosing a non-heterosexual orientation in school was also assessed, using a pretest, post-test one-group design. We found limited and marginal effects of the intervention. Some evidence that the intervention was better tailored to the needs of female students is discussed.

AB  - Can positive social contact between members of antagonistic groups reduce prejudice and discrimination? Despite extensive research on social contact, observational studies are difficult to interpret because prejudiced people may select out of contact with out-group members. We overcome this problem by conducting an education-based, randomized field experiment - the Urban Youth Vocational Training program (UYVT)-with 849 randomly sampled Christian and Muslim young men in riot-prone Kaduna, Nigeria. After sixteen weeks of positive intergroup social contact, we find no changes in prejudice, but heterogeneous-class subjects discriminate significantly less against out-group members than subjects in homogeneous classes. We trace this finding to increased discrimination by homogeneous-class subjects compared to non-UYVT study participants, and we highlight potentially negative consequences of in-group social contact. By focusing on skill-building instead of peace messaging, our intervention minimizes reporting bias and offers strong experimental evidence that intergroup social contact can alter behavior in constructive ways, even amid violent conflict.

AB  - With a focus on the relationship between women's and children's rights and theories of globalization, we conduct an event history analysis of more than 150 countries between 1950 and 2011 to assess the factors associated with policies banning corporal punishment in schools and homes. Our research reveals that formal condemnation of corporal punishment in schools is becoming a global norm; policies banning corporal punishment in the home, in contrast, are being adopted more slowly. We find that the percentage of women in parliament is associated with the adoption of anti-corporal punishment policies in both schools and homes, suggesting a nexus between women's and children's issues. Countries with more ethnic diversity are slower to adopt home policies, however. We propose that minority groups in these countries may be resistant to laws because of the risk of selective or prejudicial enforcement. In terms of globalization, more aid is associated with both school and home policies, and countries that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child are more likely to adopt home policies. Surprisingly, international nongovernmental organizations are not significantly associated with either type of policy adoption.

AB  - Computer-mediated intergroup contact (CMIC) is a valuable strategy to reduce negative sentiments towards members of different social groups. We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence.

AB  - Introduction: Sexual minority youth often experience increased social stress due to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and victimization. Increased stress may help explain the disproportionate use of substances like tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drug use by sexual minority youth. This study examined the effect of social stress on substance use disparities by sexual orientation among U.S. high school students.
   Methods: In 2016, data from the national 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, conducted among a nationally representative sample of 15,624 U.S. high school students, were analyzed to examine the effect of school-related (threatened/injured at school, bullied at school, bullied electronically, felt unsafe at school) and non-school-related (forced sexual intercourse, early sexual debut) social stress on substance use disparities by sexual orientation, by comparing unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and adjusted (for social stressors, age, sex, and race/ethnicity) prevalence ratios (APRs).
   Results: Unadjusted PRs reflected significantly (p < 0.05 or 95% CI did not include 1.0) greater substance use among students who identified as lesbian/gay or bisexual than students who identified as heterosexual. APRs for injection drug use decreased substantially among lesbian/gay (PR=12.02 vs APR=2.14) and bisexual (PR=2.62 vs APR=1.18) students; the APR for bisexual students became nonsignificant. In addition, APRs among both lesbian/gay and bisexual students decreased substantially and were no longer statistically significant for cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin use.
   Conclusions: School-based substance use prevention programs might appropriately include strategies to reduce social stress, including policies and practices designed to provide a safe school environment and improved access to social and mental health services.

AB  - The aim of the study is to provide evidence about the validity and reliability of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale. The scale identifies two types of rejection of same-sex parenting: individual opposition and normative opposition. Individual opposition identifies opinions involving open and more aggressive rejection toward the effects of the child-rearing and educational practices of same-sex parents. The attribution of the children's possible psychological difficulties and maladjustments is directly linked to the sexual orientation of the same-sex parents. Normative opposition identifies beliefs and opinions linked to everyday heterosexism that are present in our society and represent a subtle form of heterosexism. The scale was administrated to 326 Spanish heterosexual university students. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure. The findings showed that personal contact inversely correlates with the rejection of same-sex parents, the etiology of the homosexual orientation correlates with rejection of same-sex parents when the belief is that homosexuality is learned, and supporting the civil rights of gay people also correlates with rejection of same-sex parents. These findings can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity.

AB  - Integrated schooling is known to induce interethnic friendship relations; however, it also creates the opportunity of interethnic dating. Interethnic personal relationships or long-term exposure decreases ethnic prejudice, thus it is proposed that willingness to date between ethnic groups may also increase. The question arises, whether in the school context exposure is enough for this mechanism to emerge, or personal contact is necessary. It must also be taken into account that romantic relationships are embedded in status relations within schools. Based on a social exchange' mechanism, it is assumed that the less popular members of the majority groups are those who are more willing to form interethnic dating relations. To address the above questions empirically, the data of 1213 Hungarian 9th grade students in 43 classes were analysed. Preferences of Roma and non-Roma students were measured by dyadic attribution of physical attractiveness and nominations of willingness to date. Results of multilevel p2 models suggest that mixed groups are not sufficient, but personal contacts are necessary to decrease same-ethnicity preferences in dating. An additional tendency is salient: among majority students, those who are isolated from the friendship networks are the ones who are more willing to date members of the minority group.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated 21 contact-based education interventions in 5047 Canadian high school students and identified student characteristics associated with success.
   Methods: We used a one-group pretest/posttest design with standardized instruments to measure changes in behavioural intent. Variability across interventions was assessed using meta-analysis, and a mixed-effects logistic regression was used to identify student characteristics.
   Results: Interventions were heterogeneous (I-2 = 62.4%) but generally successful. The odds of getting an A grade was 2.57 times greater on the posttest than the pretest (95% CI = 2.18, 3.03). Males were less likely to achieve a passing score overall; however, males who self-disclosed a mental illness were more likely to pass. Three percent of students experienced a large drop in social acceptance following the intervention. These were more likely to be male [OR = 1.5 (95% CI = 1.0, 2.1)].
   Conclusion: Contact-based education is a promising practice for reducing stigma in high school students, although the field would benefit from fidelity criteria to reduce variation across interventions. Males and females react differently to antistigma programming; particularly those with self-reported mental illnesses and a small proportion may become more intolerant.

AB  - Studies of individual and group-level sources of prejudice have contributed to today's greater understanding of the emergence of prejudice and discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants. Yet, scholars have claimed that future research should investigate institutional and socio-political macro-level factors affecting individuals' attitudes towards outsiders (Ceobanu and Escandell in Ann Rev Sociol 36: 309-328, 2010). To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, this article goes across levels of analysis and theories to provide insights about group-level sources influencing attitudes towards immigrants. These sources are taken into account as both institutional and social factors involved in processes of national identity constructions. To this purpose, this work combines Blumer's perspective (Pac Sociol Rev 1: 3-7, 1958) with both the distinction Weber (Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Tubingen, Mohr, 1922) made between open and closed social relationships and some other theoretical contributions that emerged in the field. The findings of a multilevel analysis confirm that, whereby inclusive socio-political factors are involved in the processes of countries' identity constructions, individuals show more positive attitudes towards immigrants. In addition, in inclusive countries, a society's high regard for its own traditions and customs influences individual members to appreciate other cultures and show positive dispositions towards outsiders.

T2  - CLASSICAL JOURNAL

AB  - Long regarded as the locus classicus for Roman antipathy toward contemporary Greeks, Juvenal's third Satire articulates the views of the narrator's "friend" Umbricius, who wishes to escape the flood of immigrants he sees as transforming Rome into a "Greek city." This article attempts to unpack the relationship between the graecophobia ascribed to Umbricius' persona and the realities of ethnic prejudice in imperial Rome. The inconsistency of his argument is approached from various angles, highlighting the difficulty of situating this elusive and intractable text within the social realities that existed beyond its margins.

AB  - To test the effects of social influence and social distance on attitudes, we assessed judgments of gay and lesbian targets in various contexts over three studies (n=814, 51% female). We compared the impact of a derogatory message to a relatively favorable message ostensibly written by another participant. Participants were robustly moved by the feedback; social influence was a significant predictor in final evaluations of the target, as was social distance. Discrimination against gay men and lesbian women appears not to be a fixed behavior; seemingly anyone can be persuaded to discriminate or not to discriminate by mere peer suggestion.

AB  - Following the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack that happened on January 7th 2015, around 4 million people gathered all over France in a rally of national unity. Soon, however, critics argued that those who participated to the rallies publicly displayed antiracist attitudes, but were driven by implicit prejudice toward Muslims. Our study addresses the question of whether implicit prejudice measured at the city-level can predict participation rates observed in these cities. We used data from the French/Arab IAT of the Project Implicit collected from 2007 to 2014 on the French territory (n = 3365, 35 cities) and computed mean IAT scores for each city. We then tested whether the IAT scores predicted the participation rate observed in each city. In sharp contrast with the idea that Charlie Hebdo marchers were implicitly biased against Muslims, we found that cities implicitly biased against Arabs (as compared with French) participated less, and not more, to the Charlie Hebdo rallies. These results also show, for the first time, that the level of implicit prejudice measured at the city-level, sometime several years before an event (2007), can predict large scale social behaviors.

AB  - The joint impact of antiegalitarian attitudes and social-cultural attitudes on citizens' tendency to vote for extreme right-wing political parties was investigated. In the first study, we explored these attitudes in representative samples of seven Western European countries. In a follow-up study, we predicted respondents' likelihood of voting for a Dutch right-wing party on the basis of the measures of social-dominance orientation (as an indicator of antiegalitarian attitudes) and right-wing authoritarianism (as an indicator of social-cultural attitudes). Our findings demonstrated that voting for extreme right-wing parties was associated more consistently with antiegalitarian attitudes than with social-cultural attitudes. Moreover, the effect of antiegalitarian attitudes was partly mediated by migration attitudes (Study 1) and ethnic prejudice (Study 2). We discuss the finding that antiegalitarian attitudes are more strongly related to extreme right-wing voting than social-cultural attitudes.

AB  - Social disorganization theory argues that racial/ethnic heterogeneity is a key neighborhood characteristic leading to social disorganization and, consequently, higher levels of crime. Heterogeneity's effect is argued to be a result of its fragmentation of social ties along racial/ethnic lines, which creates racially homophilous social networks with few ties bridging racial/ethnic groups. Most studies of social ties in social disorganization models, however, have examined their quantity and left unaddressed the extent to which ties are within or across different racial groups. This study goes beyond previous studies by examining the effects of both racially homophilous and interracial friendship networks on informal social control. Using multilevel models and data from 66 neighborhoods with approximately 2,300 respondents, we found that heterogeneity actually increased the average percentage of residents with interracial friendship networks, but the percentage of residents with interracial networks decreased the likelihood of informal social control. In contrast, the percentage of residents with White racially homophilous networks increased the likelihood of informal social control. Examining the microcontext of individuals' networks, however, we found residents with interracial ties reported higher likelihoods of informal social control and that this effect was enhanced in neighborhoods with higher percentages of non-White racially homophilous networks.

AB  - Extensive research has linked general personality factors to social attitudes, but there has been comparatively little work on the roles played by specific approach-avoidance personality factors, especially positive-approach ones. Here we relate such factors to the two main clusters of social attitudes (Right-Wing Authoritarianism, RWA; and Social Dominance Orientation, SDO), and related cognitive constructs (Need for Cognition and Need for Closure). Results revealed: (a) positive-approach motivation is consistently related to both RWA and SDO, with little contribution from negative-avoidance motivation; and (b) negative-avoidance motivation played a part in Need for Cognition (negatively related) and Need for Closure (positively related). These data challenge previous theorizing concerning the role of fear/anxiety in social attitude formation and prejudice more generally. We conclude that, to a larger extent than previously thought, approach-related personality factors underpin the positive reinforcement of social attitudes and prejudice. Our results may help to account for the failure of programmes designed to reduce prejudice which have been based on the reduction of negative emotion and motivation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study tested the pathways between personality, social worldviews, and ideology, predicted by the Dual Process Model (DPM) of ideology and prejudice. These paths were tested using a full cross-lagged panel design administered to a New Zealand community sample in early 2008 (before the effects of the global financial crisis reached New Zealand) and again in 2009 (when the crisis was near its peak; n=247). As hypothesized, low openness to experience predicted residualized change in dangerous worldview, which in turn predicted right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Low agreeableness predicted competitive worldview, which in turn predicted social dominance orientation (SDO). RWA and SDO also exerted unexpected reciprocal effects on worldviews. This study provides the most comprehensive longitudinal test of the DPM to date, and was conducted during a period of systemic instability when the causal effects predicted by the DPM should be, and were, readily apparent.

AB  - Prejudice arises from the categorizations people make upon perceiving others. To date, however, there has been little progress toward understanding how metacognitive processes underlying categorization contribute to prejudice. In two studies, we tested whether processing fluency - the speed with which targets are categorized - explains prejudiced evaluations related to concealable (sexual orientation) and overt (race) social identities. In Study 1, targets categorized as lesbian/gay were evaluated more negatively than targets categorized as straight, and evaluative differences were explained by the fluency with which targets were processed. In Study 2, we replicated our initial findings about the mediating role of processing fluency in evaluations related to sexual orientation categorizations, but found no evidence that fluency explains evaluations related to race categorizations. These findings provide a framework for understanding the perceptual underpinnings of interpersonal prejudice. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, we describe the construct validation of a General Social Attitudes Scale (SAS_G), designed to measure the basic dimensions of social attitudes in both self-reports and peer-ratings. A large sample of Croatian university students (N = 452) used the SAS_G to describe their own social attitudes, which were also described by 452 of their acquaintances using the same instrument. All SAS_G subscales showed reasonably high internal consistency reliability estimates as well as appropriate convergent and discriminant validity based on self/peer correlations. Separate Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) of both self-reports and peer ratings yielded five replicable factors and acceptable indices of fit. However, the validation analyses against lexically based Saucier's (2008) ISMS instrument showed little convergence, indicating that these two approaches to general social attitudes scale construction can lead to the identification of different basic constructs.

AB  - We engaged over 430 Canadian children in a series of activities designed to reveal their evaluations of three ethnic groups (White, East Asian and South Asian), their identification with these groups, and their behavior towards them in a dictator game. Our experiments took place at the children's schools during their normal school day, allowing us to evaluate the salience and effects of ethnic identities on economically relevant behavior in an important natural setting. We find that children from the dominant White category have a clear sense of White ethnic identity, and tend to favor White recipients in the dictator game relative to East Asian or South Asian recipients. Minority East Asian children reveal a more complex ethnic identity; they perceive themselves to be equally similar to White and East Asian children. Unlike Whites, East Asian children do not favor recipients from their own East Asian category, nor do they favor recipients with whom they tend to identify. If anything, East Asian children show out-group favoritism. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined a full path model of stress process for predicting illicit drug use among Asian and Latino immigrants' adolescent children. Using 2-year longitudinal data (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) from a sample of adolescents with Asian or Latino immigrant parents (N = 2,353), the study explored structural relationships between 3 types of negative perceptions of school environment as acculturation-related stressors (a feeling of isolation, perceived prejudice from students, and perceived unfair treatment from teachers), family support as a social resource, and drug use as an outcome among Asian and Latino immigrants' adolescent children. Path analysis results supported the resource deterioration hypothesis of the stress process model and found a stronger direct effect of implicit isolation than explicit prejudice or unfairness perceived in school on drug use and mediating effects of family support on relationships between 2 of the stressors and drug use among these adolescents.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of knowledge about epilepsy among the students and the population in general, with consequent prejudice and discrimination toward epileptic patients. Objectives: Knowledge, behavior, attitude and myth toward epilepsy among urban school children in Bareilly district was studied. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among students of 10 randomly selected secondary schools of the urban areas in Bareilly district. A structured, pretested questionnaire was used to collect data regarding sociodemographic characteristics and assess the subjects knowledge, behavior, attitude and myth toward epilepsy. Results: Of the 798 students (533 boys and 265 girls) studied, around 98.6 had heard of epilepsy. About 63.7 correctly thought that epilepsy is a brain disorder while 81.8 believed it to be a psychiatric disorder. Other prevalent misconceptions were that epilepsy is an inherited disorder (71.55) and that the disease is transmitted by eating a nonvegetarian diet (49). Most of them thought that epilepsy can be cured (69.3) and that an epileptic patient needs lifelong treatment (77.2). On witnessing a seizure, about 51.5 of the students would take the person to the hospital. Majority (72.31) of the students thought that children with epilepsy should study in a special school. Conclusions: Although majority of the students had reasonable knowledge of epilepsy, myths and superstitions about the condition still prevail in a significant proportion of the urban school children. It may be worthwhile including awareness programs about epilepsy in school education to dispel misconceptions about epilepsy.

KW  - social exclusion
KW  - Croatia
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to get an insight into understanding the stigma of disability based on the experience and perception of people with disabilities and professionals who work with them. Methods: Qualitative research methods were used with two focus groups: one with people with disabilities (five participants) and other with professionals (seven participants). After data were collected, a qualitative content analysis was made. Results: The results indicated that participants perceived and experienced stigma of disability through intrinsic and extrinsic elements of stigmatization. The intrinsic elements refer to the feeling of being different as a result of negative attitudes, prejudices and stereotypes. The extrinsic elements derive from the relationship of the system towards people with disabilities: discrimination and labelling. Some of the major findings of this research are that the stigma of disability is shown through the inability of the people with disabilities to make their own decisions, the perception of the disability as the main feature of the person, the lack of criteria during education, perceiving disability as a precondition in choosing a partner and parental capability, parents' decision-making about their children's lives, overprotection and stigmatization in education and employment. Stigmatization leads to social exclusion and influences the quality of life. Conclusion: The stigma of disability is manifested through the impossibility of realizing basic human rights, of living life independently and of taking equal part in a local community.

AB  - The present research examined the effects of egocentric motivations on individuals' explanations for how their automatic racial prejudices came into being. The majority of participants reported experiencing biased thoughts, feelings, and gut reactions toward minorities which they found difficult to consciously control, and they attributed such biases to cultural socialization. Of particular interest, ego-threatened participants were significantly more likely to attribute their automatic racial biases to their culture and significantly less likely to attribute such biases to themselves. Results suggest that attributing one's racial biases to cultural socialization can be a defensive, motivated process aimed at diminishing personal responsibility.

AB  - Aims There is a general consensus that individuals with conspicuous strabismus are perceived more negatively with respect to physical appearance, personality and capability. Such social biases can potentially lead to social alienation and negative psychosocial development, particularly when experienced at a young age. This study aims to explore young children's perception of peers with noticeable exotropia.
   Methods 128 children, 5-6 years old, took part in this cross-sectional within-group study. The sample viewed four paired images of peers with orthotropia and exotropia, and chose the image they LIKED and the image they would SHARE their favourite toy with. All images were created using digital morphing technique.
   Results Single proportion tests showed that a significantly greater proportion of the sample chose the orthotropic images as the ones they like (z=5.74, p<0.001) and the ones they would share their favourite toy with (z=4.90, p<0.001). Phi coefficient analysis further demonstrated an association between the choice to like and the choice to share (phi(504)=0.34, p<0.001).
   Conclusions Children as young as 5 years old are found to have negative social reactions towards peers with noticeable exotropia. These findings imply that children with noticeable strabismus may be subjected to social alienation at an early age.

AB  - People often overestimate others' support for their views (false consensus effect). Recent research has shown that this is particularly marked in the relation between perceived consensus and prejudice. The current research asked whether this partly arises in an in-group stereotype of the community as prejudiced. We investigated relations between different sources of normative information (self, media, peers), estimates of community attitudes, and perceived consensus in a sample of 135 community members. Media prejudice predicted community attitudes, and this further predicted consensus. However, strongest was a direct relation between own prejudice and perceived consensus. The results indicate a desire to appear nonprejudiced, relative to others. Confronting prejudiced people with information about community norms is a promising intervention under these circumstances.

AB  - Drawing on social dominance theory and the contact hypothesis, we developed and tested a two-mediator model for explaining gender differences in early adolescents' attitudes toward gay males and lesbians. Data from more than 400 ninth graders were analyzed. As predicted, gender differences in attitudes toward gay males were partially explained by social dominance orientation (SDO) and knowing a gay male. Gender differences in attitudes toward lesbians were partially mediated by SDO, while knowing a lesbian was not a mediating variable. Beyond their mediating roles, both SDO and knowing a member of the target group each significantly added to the prediction of attitudes toward each target group. Implications for policies to reduce victimization of sexual minorities in schools are discussed.

AB  - Background: Caring for a child with cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging and stressful and even more so in a country with limited resources. Our aim was to study the impact of CF on the daily life of mothers with chil-dren who have CF in Tunisia, emphasizing the difficulties encountered.Methods: Overall, 20 participants were interviewed about their experiences of being caregivers and mothers of children with CF, including their knowledge about the condition, their attitude toward it, the impact of CF on their daily lives, the main difficulties they had faced, and their concerns and wishes about CF management.Results: The median age of the interviewees was 39 years. None of the mothers had known about CF before; 14 of them had difficulty accepting it at first, with suicidal thoughts in one case. Six hid the illness from the close family for fear of negative prejudices. Three mothers decided to stop having children despite availabil-ity of prenatal screening. CF also influenced the mothers' social activities (n = 13) and interfered with their jobs (n = 5). It was responsible for additional expenses in all cases. Chest physiotherapy represented a daily source of coping for all participants. Hospitalization related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was consid-ered stressful and constraining by 12 mothers. The mothers' main concern was the child's life expectancy (n = 7). Their main wish was to administer a curative treatment (n = 17).Conclusion: CF was found to have deeply affected the mothers' psychosocial life stressing the need for the involvement of qualified psychologists and social workers together with the medical staff.(c) 2022 French Society of Pediatrics.

AB  - Nowadays, an increasing number of children and adolescents living in Europe have an immigrant background. Because ethnicity is a recognizable characteristic that may become the driver of bullying, these youths are at high risk of victimization. School interventions based on peer-led approaches, assuming all the conditions postulated in contact theory, could be suitable to counteract bias-based bullying and victimization. This study aims to analyze whether the NoTrap! antibullying program, an evidence-based peer-led intervention, may also be effective in counteracting ethnic bullying and victimization when students with an immigrant background are involved as peer educators. There were 1,570 students who participated in the study: 24 control classes (N = 476) and 50 experimental classes (N = 1094). Within the last group we identified two conditions: 30 classes in which all peer educators were Italian (Experimental A, N = 661); 20 classes in which at least one of them had an immigrant background (Experimental B, N = 433). Results of two linear mixed models showed a significant interaction Time x Experimental condition for ethnic victimization, F(1, 1170) = 4.185; p = .015. Specifically, the NoTrap! is effective in reducing ethnic victimization when at least one student with an immigrant background is involved as a peer educator. Only in this condition, indeed, peer educators are directly involved in the phenomenon they counteract, and all four circumstances postulated in the contact theory are satisfied. No effects on ethnic bullying have been found, F(1, 1162) = .215; p = .806. This is in line with the activities proposed in the program, which is more focused on empowering victims than on acting directly on bullies.

AB  - Problem: Prejudices can impair social participation of people with epilepsy.
   Methods: From 2019 to 2020, we invited people with epilepsy and their relatives across Germany to fill in a questionnaire.
   Results: Two hundred and thirty people with epilepsy (PWE, median age: 40 years; min./max.: 19/83; 66% female) and 103 relatives (REL, median age: 42 years; min./max. 23/70; 83% female) took part in the survey. 44% PWE and 40% REL said prejudices against PWE had not declined in recent years. Of PWE, 64% reported they had experienced prejudices themselves. In an open question with multiple answers possible, 71% of the PWE described concrete prejudices against PWE, 62% of the REL did so. The reported prejudices concerned symptoms of epilepsy (37% PWE; 23% REL), academic or occupational performance (47% PWE; 38% REL), social or family life (27% PWE, 29% REL), and other topics (7% PWE, 4% REL). Of PWE, 88% said all or almost all relatives knew about their condition, 74% stated this applied to all or almost all friends, and 48% told all or almost all colleagues about their epilepsy. Of PWE, 94% would want to know if a relative had epilepsy, 87% would like to know about a friend's epilepsy, 70% about a colleague's epilepsy. Fear of stigmatization was a reason for not always communicating the condition according to 20% PWE and 63% REL. None of PWE and 16% of REL named shame as a reason.
   Conclusion: People with epilepsy still experience prejudices and fear of stigmatization hinders an open communication about the condition. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence supports Allport's (1954) contention that social contact reduces mental illness stigma and promotes symptom recognition. However, an important limitation of existing research is that it typically relies on relatively simplistic measures of contact (e.g., any contact, number of contacts). Here, we build on prior work by examining how contact with persons with mental illness within social networks shapes labeling processes and beliefs about the causes of mental illness. Using egocentric network methods and vignette data from the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1173), findings reveal that connections to valued ties (e.g., friends, family) that disconfirm commonly held stereotypes about people with mental illness contribute to improved recognition of mental illness and reduce the likelihood of endorsing stigmatizing beliefs about causes of mental illness. By using network theory and methods, this research extends current understanding of the role of contact by revealing not only whether contact matters, but how it matters and under what circumstances it may reduce prejudice and discrimination attached to mental illness in contemporary society.

AB  - Despite advances to promote acceptance and equity in many countries, prejudice remains a significant social problem. Promoting intergroup harmony requires knowledge about what works to reduce prejudice in community settings. This meta-analysis of field experiments reveals the most effective intervention types and conditions for reducing negative attitudes towards minority groups in real-world settings. Across 69 intervention arms and 24,378 participants, results reveal that prejudice reduction interventions are effective at improving attitudes towards minority groups in real-world settings (d = 0.51, 95% CI [0.33; 0.68]). The prediction interval was -0.90 to 1.92. In this case, the prediction interval was particularly wide because of the high degree of heterogeneity detected in effect size. Subgroup analyses indicate that less commonly explored approaches, such as perceived variability, may have larger effect sizes than contact-based interventions. Still, more research is needed to confirm the effects of these less-researched approaches. Additionally, results show that interventions are more effective for school and college cohorts than for adults, and that the effects of prejudice reduction interventions endure over time.

AB  - Can targeted messages from political elites impact the relationship between valuing conformity and prejudice? We answer this question in a survey experiment on a national probability sample from the Netherlands by exposing respondents to a favorable vs. unfavorable statement about East European immigrants. We find that individuals attaching relatively high importance to the value of conformity express greater agreement with the statement, independently of its content or partisanship. Further, the positive association between valuing conformity and prejudice is significantly decreased when individuals are presented with a favorable statement about East European immigrants. Thus, valuing conformity is not only associated with higher prejudice but can also reduce prejudice because it makes individuals susceptible to elite normative pressure to respond positively.

AB  - Despite significant research into the education of autistic children and young people (CYP) and an increased awareness of the employment needs and rights of autistic adults, little attention has been paid to autistic teachers. We discuss findings drawn from an online survey in the UK in which autistic teachers and other autistic education staff (n = 149) describe the lack of understanding, sensory impacts, mental health issues and the complexities associated with revealing an autism diagnosis as a result of their work. These issues can represent significant impediments to either entering or remaining in the school education profession. Positive experiences were also found and, from a social justice perspective, the possibilities of autistic school staff to constitute a role model for autistic CYP and to facilitate their educational inclusion are considered. Future directions in this under-researched area are also discussed.Points of interest There is a lack of research into autistic teachers and other autistic school staff. Autistic school staff experience many difficulties in training, recruitment, job satisfaction and career development. Participants in our survey wrote that they lack support. They also find the physical environment of schools difficult and can experience mental health issues and prejudice. Some participants feared sharing the fact that they were autistic at work, but others had positive experiences of doing so. In the right circumstances, autistic staff in schools can make an important contribution to educational inclusion, particularly of autistic pupils.

AB  - The article argues that, although digital and social media provide space and means for children's cosmopolitan citizenship, the tendency to reproduce cultural and ethnic stereotypes and prejudice prevalent in mainstream media can limit their capability and willingness to act and think as such. Drawing upon qualitative participatory research conducted with more than seventy children living in the Czech Republic, the article explores how children's media practice had a tendency to reproduce cultural hegemony. The paper ultimately argues that multicultural education and media education can together support children in reflecting on and challenging cultural hegemony, while at the same time potentially contribute to their transnational participation and cooperation with the use of digital and social media.

AB  - Given the persistence of oppression in contemporary society, social workers may expect to encounter social bias in the clinical setting. On the one hand, clients who identify as a member of a disadvantaged social group may report experiences of oppression accompanied by emotional, behavioral, and physical responses (Carter in Couns Psychol 35(1):13-105,2007; Sue in Microaggressions and marginality: manifestation, dynamics, and impact, Wiley, Hoboken,2010). On the other hand, those who are members of a historically privileged social group may present with negative affective and behavioral responses associated with prejudicial ideations towards disadvantaged social groups (Sullaway and Dunbar in Clin Psychol 3(4):296-309,1996). This paper provides evidence from my field experiences that directly confronting social bias encountered in the clinical setting promotes client wellbeing and social justice with diverse clients. In doing so, I respond to the call for front line practitioners to share their perspectives regarding the integration of social justice and social work (Maschi et al. in J Soc Work Pract 25(2):233-253,2011). I also elaborate on Howard University School of Social Work's Black Perspective as a theoretical orientation for clinical social work with diverse populations (Gourdine and Brown in Howard University School of Social Work in the 1970s: social action, advocacy, and agents of change, Black Classic Press, Baltimore,2016). Because Black perspectives are often marginalized in scholarship and practice, I hope to shed light on their critical role in addressing contemporary clinical issues (Bent-Goodley et al. in J Hum Behav Soc Environ 27(1-2):27-35,2017; Graham in Soc Work Educ 28(3):268-280,2009).

AB  - Introduction This study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations. Methods A total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations. Results LGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood. Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

AB  - Decades of social attitudes research has shown the importance of examining both implicit and explicit attitudes for a fuller understanding of attitudes. Despite evidence from the broader literature, transgender attitudes studies to date have almost exclusively utilized self-report measures to assess explicit transgender prejudice due, in large part, to the dearth of implicit transgender prejudice measures. The current study, therefore, conducted a series of three pilot studies using online samples to build a standardized procedure based on the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to assess implicit transgender prejudice (Transgender AMP) and examined its performance to establish preliminary validity and reliability evidence for scores from the procedure. Results of the repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of prime type, demonstrating a systematic difference in the ratings of transgender primes versus neutral primes and provided initial evidence of construct validity. Although the effect size was not as large as what is reported for the original AMP, the Transgender AMP still showed sensitivity as a measure of implicit transgender prejudice. Likewise, results of the mixed ANOVA showed a significant effect of contact, replicating findings from the explicit transgender prejudice literature. Transgender AMP scores were also found to be internally consistent (alpha = .87). Overall, the newly developed Transgender AMP performed as expected with preliminary evidence suggesting that it is a simple, user-friendly procedure capturing implicit transgender prejudice.

AB  - Schooling and education, in general, are perceived as a means of integrating children of new immigrants into Canadian society and preparing young immigrants for their future careers. High school education and the subjects taken prepare these young immigrants for postsecondary education and entry into the labour market. However, these newcomer students, particularly those of African origin, are discouraged by systemic structures from pursuing school curricula that may lead them to their aspired careers. This is, fora major part, the result of the role played by teachers and school career counsellors as gatekeepers. Research shows that teachers and career counsellors have preconceived negative, racist and prejudicial stereotypes about African students and their abilities for educational performance and success. Further, Canadian schools promote linguistic structures, authority patterns, and types of curricula that alienate African immigrant students. We contend that schools need to implement culturally appropriate career guidance programs that are conducted by professionals trained in cultural sensitivities. As such, this paper argues for the inclusion of teachers and counsellors who appreciate the culture and learning styles of these students, and who can serve as identity models for the students. In addition, we advance the need for inter-school-community mentorship programs that facilitate minority students' aspirations into the careers of their choice.

AB  - Erroneous perception of "disability" in typically developing children leads to the exclusion of children with intellectual disabilities in sport. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of inclusive soccer (INS) program on ameliorating adverse behavior in children with and without intellectual disabilities (ID). Participants were 40 children, with half having intellectual disabilities (n = 20). Both the experimental and comparison groups consisted of 10 children with and without ID, respectively. The experimental group participated in an INS whereas the comparison group participated in a segregated soccer program. The Withdrawn Behavior Checklist (WBC) and Social Distance Scale (SDS) were measured repeatedly for children with and without ID, respectively. A mixed-design ANOVA was conducted for data analysis. There were significant main effects on time, group, and interaction for both SDS and WBC of the experimental group, except between-group difference on WBC. The comparison group did not show any significant change. The social distance of children toward peers with ID and withdrawn behavior of children with ID have been reduced. The INS could provide benefits for the psychosocial development of children on both populations toward inclusion.

AB  - Studies eliciting the views of children on ageing are rare, particularly those that focus on imagining a future self as an old' person and how this might be linked to current attitudes to older people. To address this gap, 2,365 children participated in an online survey which included questions on ageing. Findings suggest that children who hold negative views about old people visualise poorer outcomes for themselves at age 70. Implications of the findings are discussed in the context of an ageing population and the need to develop strategies to prevent the formation of prejudices against older people from an early age.

AB  - Objectives: This article examines homophobic attitude changes among undergraduate social work students in two major universities located in Ankara, Turkey.
   Method: The research was conducted in Ankara for 10 weeks with 54 volunteer students from Ankara University and Hacettepe University. During one term, nine movies were screened, a get-acquainted meeting was held, three information booklets were distributed, and the Homosexuality Attitudes Scale (HAS) was given at the beginning and end of the term.
   Results: The mean HAS score at the pretest was 166.28 (SD = 35.33), and the mean posttest score was 146.93 (SD = 41.09). A paired samples t-test found this reduction to be statistically significant at p < .05 level, with a Cohen's d effect size of .52, r = .25.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that viewing gay-friend mainstream movies can contribute to a reduction in prejudice again homosexuals. Viewing such movies may be an important component of social work education aimed at enhancing favorable views toward diverse sexual orientations and promoting social workers' ability to effectively engage with gays and lesbians in practice.

AB  - Schools are important for the academic and socio-emotional development, as well as acculturation of immigrant-and refugee-background youth. We highlight individual differences which shape their unique experiences, while considering three levels of the school context in terms of how they may affect adaptation outcomes: (1) interindividual interactions in the classroom (such as peer relations, student-teacher relations, teacher beliefs, and teaching practices), (2) characteristics of the classroom or school (such as ethnic composition and diversity climate), and (3) relevant school-and nation-level policies (such as diversity policies and school tracking). Given the complexity of the topic, there is a need for more research taking an integrated and interdisciplinary perspective to address migration related issues in the school context. Teacher beliefs and the normative climate in schools seem particularly promising points for intervention, which may be easier to change than structural aspects of the school context. More inclusive schools are also an important step toward more peaceful interethnic relations in diverse societies.

AB  - We investigated whether and how endorsement of essentialist beliefs about gender affects heterosexuals' attitudes towards same-sex parenting. In Study 1, we showed that framing a (scientific) communication in terms of essentialist (vs. non-essentialist) views about gender fostered perception of same-sex parenting as unnatural, and this effect was mediated by a stronger support in favor of the traditional gender-role beliefs. In Study 2, the endorsement of a biological explanation of gender differences affected the perception of same-sex parenting as unnatural and this, in turn, impacted upon the perceived competence of same-sex parents and upon a more distal consequence, such as the perceived negative consequences on children raised by same-sex parents. We discuss results in terms of the role of communication in perpetrating prejudice against same-sex parenting.

AB  - Two nationwide representative studies (N5653 adolescents; N51007 adults) investigated the psychological correlates of the intention to penalize public expressions of prejudice in the form of support for hate-speech prohibition. We presented participants with preselected examples of hate speech from the Internet and other mass media and assessed their willingness to support the prohibition of public expressions of such remarks. Both studies found that social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism are positively correlated with outgroup prejudice, but they have differential effects on hate-speech prohibition. Social dominance orientation was positively related to the acceptance of hate speech, whereas right-wing authoritarianism was positively related to hate-speech prohibition. In discussing this counterintuitive finding, we suggest that right-wing authoritarians are particularly vigilant toward norm violations-and this makes them more punitive toward counternormative expressions of prejudice, such as hate speech.

AB  - Recent research questions whether children conceptualize race as stable. We examined participants' beliefs about the relative stability of race and emotion, a temporary feature. Participants were White adults and children ages 5-6 and 9-10 (Study 1) and racial minority children ages 5-6 (Study 2). Participants were presented with target children who were happy or angry and Black or White and were asked to indicate which of 2 adults (a race but not emotion match or an emotion but not race match) each child would grow up to be. White adults, White 9- to 10-year-olds, and racial minority 5- to 6-year-olds selected race matches, whereas White 5- to 6-year-olds selected race and emotion matches equally. These data suggest that beliefs about racial stability vary by age and social group.

AB  - In this paper, we consider whether teachers' explicit and implicit prejudiced attitudes underlie the ethnic achievement gap. To date, most research on teacher expectation effects has relied on explicit expectation measures that are prone to social desirability biases. In contrast, we examine the effects of teachers' (a) explicit ethnicity-based expectations for academic achievement and (b) implicit prejudiced attitudes about academic achievement on students' actual academic success over time. A total of 38 teachers completed both a traditional teacher expectation measure and a modified Implicit Association Task designed to assess ethnic stereotypes associated with academic achievement and failure. A multi-level analytic framework showed that students in classrooms of teachers with high expectations performed better in reading at the end of the year and that these effects were found across all ethnic groups. In contrast, whereas students' mathematics achievement scores were largely unrelated to teachers' explicit expectations, teachers' implicit prejudiced attitudes predicted student performance. Specifically, students benefited most academically when their teachers' implicit biases favored the ethnic group to which the student belonged. Findings are discussed in relation to differences in the salience of teachers' expectations and implicit prejudiced attitude in the classroom, and the ethnic achievement gap. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prejudice and popularity represent two major areas of research. Yet studies have not considered whether prejudiced adolescents actually can be popular. Among 572 high school students (M-age= 15.80 years), the current study tested the association between popularity (based on sociometric peer nominations) and sexual prejudice against gay and lesbian individuals, moderated by gender and perspective taking. As hypothesized, the association was significant for males but not females, and it was significant for adolescents lower on perspective taking but not those higher on perspective taking. Moreover, adolescents who were popular and expressed strong sexual prejudice were more likely to engage in homophobic behavior than prejudiced adolescents who were less popular. Popular adolescents with strong sexual prejudice beliefs may be more prone to use homophobic behavior as a way to maintain their dominant position. Similarly, prejudiced adolescents who are popular may face less pushback for their engagement in homophobic behavior. Continued attention to the connection between sexual prejudice and popularity is important because of the high status, influence, and visibility of popular adolescents.

AB  - Informed by Kohn and Schooler's (1969) occupational socialization framework, this study examined linkages between racial/ethnic minority mothers' perceptions of racial/ethnic discrimination in the workplace and adolescents' accounts of racial/ethnic socialization in the home. Data were collected from 100 mother-early adolescent dyads who participated in a longitudinal study of urban adolescents' development in the Northeastern United States, including African American, Latino, and Chinese families. Mothers and adolescents completed surveys separately. We found that when mothers reported more frequent institutional discrimination at work, adolescents reported more frequent preparation for bias messages at home, across racial/ethnic groups. Mothers' experiences of interpersonal prejudice at work were associated with more frequent cultural socialization messages among African American and Latino families. Chinese youth reported fewer cultural socialization messages when mothers perceived more frequent interpersonal prejudice at work. Findings are discussed in the context of minority groups' distinct social histories and economic status in the United States.

AB  - Social anxiety is the intense fear of negative evaluation by others, and it emerges uniquely from a social situation. Given its social origin, we asked whether an anxiety-inducing social situation could enhance the processing of faces linked to the situational threat. While past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the effect of manipulated social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer. Visual processing of faces was indexed by the N170 component of the event-related potential. Participants viewed faces of Black and White males, along with nonfaces, either in private or while being monitored by the experimenter for signs of prejudice in a 'public' condition. Results revealed a difference in the N170 response to Black and Whites faces that emerged only in the public condition and only among participants high in dispositional social anxiety. These results provide new evidence that anxiety arising from the social situation modulates the earliest stages of face processing in a way that is specific to a social threat, and they shed new light on how anxiety effects on perception may contribute to the regulation of intergroup responses.

AB  - This paper examines the dynamics of interethnic attitudes in a framework of intergenerational transmission of continuous cultural traits, where children are exposed to parental (vertical) and non-parental (oblique) socializations. Under very general conditions over oblique socialization, vertical socialization ensures convergence, while the structure of oblique socialization determines the steady state class. In particular, the presence of specific socialization schemes, namely, ethnocentrism, emulation, and reciprocity, produces different outcomes in terms of integration or attitude ranking. Further, the model is applied to the US case by examining the observed ranking of attitudes and obtaining predictions on the possible attitude patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The racial segregation of romantic networks has been documented by social scientists for generations. However, because of limitations in available data, we still have a surprisingly basic idea of the extent to which this pattern is generated by actual interpersonal prejudice as opposed to structural constraints on meeting opportunities, how severe this prejudice is, and the circumstances under which it can be reduced. I analyzed a network of messages sent and received among 126,134 users of a popular online dating site over a 2.5-mo period. As in face-to-face interaction, online exchanges are structured heavily by race. Even when controlling for regional differences in meeting opportunities, site users-especially minority site users-disproportionately message other users from the same racial background. However, this high degree of self-segregation peaks at the first stage of contact. First, users from all racial backgrounds are equally likely or more likely to cross a racial boundary when reciprocating than when initiating romantic interest. Second, users who receive a cross-race message initiate more new interracial exchanges in the future than they would have otherwise. This effect varies by gender, racial background, and site experience; is specific to the racial background of the original sender; requires that the recipient replied to the original message; and diminishes after a week. In contrast to prior research on relationship outcomes, these findings shed light on the complex interactional dynamics that -under certain circumstances-may amplify the effects of racial boundary crossing and foster greater interracial mixing.

AB  - Previous research has identified need for closure (NFC) as an important motivational-cognitive basis of authoritarianism and prejudice. However, to date, the role of NFC in the intergenerational similarity in authoritarianism and prejudice has remained unclear. In a sample of 169 parent-child dyads, we investigated the similarity between parents and children in NFC and tested whether this intergenerational similarity may account for the intergenerational similarity in authoritarianism and anti-immigrant prejudice. Our results revealed that parental levels of NFC were indeed concordant with the levels of NFC in their children. Even more importantly, parental NFC was indirectly related to child authoritarianism and prejudice in two ways. The first pathway proceeded through the direct relationships between parental and children's levels of authoritarianism and prejudice. The second pathway, however, bypassed parental levels of authoritarianism and prejudice and proceeded through the intergenerational similarity in NFC. Our findings thus indicate that a significant portion of children's levels of authoritarianism and anti-immigrant prejudice can be explained by parent-child similarity in motivated cognition. Implications for developmental theories of prejudice acquisition are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lesbian patients and their families may be exposed to discriminatory practices in the health care system. This qualitative study of 57 Midwestern lesbian parents used open- and closed-ended questions to examine the experiences the respondents had with their primary and secondary health care providers. Four themes emerged from the data: systemic barriers to health care, coming out to providers, seeking lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-friendly health care providers, and concern about mistreatment and prejudice within the health care system. Implications for service delivery, health care education, and directions in policy and research are explored.

AB  - Evaluations of individuals and social groups refer to two basic dimensions of social judgment: warmth and competence. Although previous research has explored the antecedents and consequences of these evaluations, there is a lack of understanding of the conditions under which warmth and competence information is used for social categorization in the first place. The present research developed a novel measure of individuals' tendencies to categorize persons in terms of competence versus warmth and tested whether these tendencies are predicted by chronic (Study 1, N = 301) and experimentally induced (Study 2, N = 69) social conformity and superiority goals. Social conformity goals predicted greater relative use of warmth information, while superiority goals predicted greater relative use of competence information in categorizing persons. These findings attest to the relevance of chronic as well as contextually induced goals at an early stage of social information processing related to social categorization.

AB  - Three studies demonstrated that collective identity and identity threat shape representations of the physical world. In Study 1, New York Yankees fans estimated Fenway Park, the stadium of a threatening out-group (but not Camden Yards, the stadium of a neutral out-group) to be closer than did non-Yankees fans. In Study 2, the authors manipulated identity threat among people affiliated (or not) with New York University (NYU). When Columbia University was portrayed as threatening to NYU, NYU affiliates estimated Columbia as closer than did non-affiliates, compared with when Columbia was nonthreatening. In Study 3, Americans who perceived more symbolic threats from Mexican immigration estimated Mexico City as closer. Collective identification with the in-group moderated effects of threat on distance estimations. These studies suggest that social categorization, collective identification, and identity threat work in concert to shape the representations of the physical world.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the prevalence of negative attitudes toward overweight peers among children using different explicit and implicit measures, and to analyze their relationships with some aspects of their body image. Method: A total of 120 children aged 6-11 years were interviewed using a computer program that simulated a game containing several tasks. Specifically, we have applied multiple measures of explicit attitudes toward average-weight/overweight peers, several personal body attitudes questions and a child-oriented version of the Implicit Association Test. Results: Our participants showed important prejudice and stereotypes against overweight children, both at the explicit and implicit levels. However, we found important differences in the intensity of prejudice and its developmental course as a function of the tasks and the type of measurement used to assess it. Conclusions: Children who grow up in Western societies idealize thinness from an early age and denigrate overweight, to which they associate explicitly and implicitly a series of negative traits that have nothing to do with the weight. As they grow older, they seem to reduce their levels of explicit prejudice, but not the intensity of implicit bias. More research is needed to study in depth prejudice and discrimination toward overweight children from a developmental point of view.

AB  - In recent years the percentage of Latin American immigrants in Argentina has grown all over the country. However, due to the economic crisis that the country is going through, the State offers economic support to the entire population, even to Latin American immigrants living in Argentina. Therefore, prejudiced attitudes towards these minority groups have increased. The aim of this study was to explore differences according to prejudice levels and country regions in the belief that Latin American immigrants who receive some kind of economic support do not really need it. Second, if the acceptance of granting economic support to immigrants can be explained by a theoretical model that includes conservative and self-enhancement values, right wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and prejudice towards them. Participants were 1570 non-immigrants adults (between 18 and 75 years old, M-age = 38.37; SD = 15.65), 55.1% female, grouped according to their region of residence (largest urban centers, smaller cities and border areas). Results of a path model indicate that values and ideological attitudes seem to underlie prejudice towards Latin American immigrants. Moreover, differences in the levels of prejudice according to the region where participants live, were found.

AB  - Objectives/Background Intellectual giftedness is characterized by an intellectual development superior to peers, while emotional and relational developments correspond to the age norms. Few empirical researches have investigated sleep profile of gifted children (GC) and its association with their well-being, all of which used IQ as the sole definition criteria for GC. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between giftedness and sleep on socio-emotional functioning. Participants The sample consisted of 32 GC (25 boys; mean age = 9.62, SD = 1.81) and 17 typically-developing children (TD: 13 boys; mean age = 10.23 years, SD = 1.95). Giftedness was identified using Renzulli's three-factor definition of giftedness. Methods Children's sleep and socio-emotional functioning were respectively assessed with the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist, both completed by parents. Results Being in the GC group increased by 4.67 times the risk of having sleep problems and 14.12 times the risk of having maladaptive behaviors. Two-way ANOVA tests showed that sleep problems tended to moderate the relation between giftedness and adjustment difficulties so that the combination of giftedness and sleep problems appeared to be prejudicial to socio-emotional functioning. Conclusion Giftedness could be a risk factor for sleep disorders as well as adjustment difficulties. The present results support the importance of addressing sleep in the GC assessment to improve their well-being and eventually limit the negative impacts of sleep difficulties on emotional and behavioral functioning.

AB  - Sexual prejudice refers to negative attitudes towards individuals based on their sexual orientation. Scholars have shown an interest in identifying the factors that may increase the probability of prejudice against sexual minorities. The current study investigates in particular the main and interactive effects of the participants' social dominance orientation (SDO) and gender role orientation on their attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in a Turkish sample. It examines whether the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes would be stronger among individuals with high adherence to traditional gender roles. A total of 250 heterosexual university students filled out a questionnaire consisting of items designed to measure their SDO, gender role orientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The results overall revealed that SDO, femininity (among females) and masculinity (among males) are positively related to prejudiced attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Supporting expectations, SDO and femininity interact in predicting sexual prejudice. However, masculinity does not interact with participants' SDO. The supplementary analyses also revealed that the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes was stronger among female participants with high femininity scores and among male participants with lower femininity scores. These findings indicate that a general preference for group inequality and endorsement of traditional gender role predispose individuals to be prejudiced against gay men and lesbians. Thus, the present study supplements the related literature by examining the interactive effects of SDO and gender role orientation in Turkey, a non-Western cultural context. It also provides important implications for researchers and practitioners in terms of developing strategies to reduce prejudice against sexual minorities.

AB  - Theories of stereotyping and prejudice have yet to be comprehensively applied to accents. U.S. adults (n = 124) listened to clips from Indian, Latinx, Arabic, and Toronto-accented speakers. They then completed stereotype measures based on solidarity, status, dynamism (SSD), and the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), and evaluated the speakers. Stereotypes, but not evaluations, differed between accents. Results suggest that measures of warmth and competence may be sufficient to capture differences in accent-based stereotyping. Authoritarianism predicted accent-based prejudice against non-North American accents relative to Toronto accents (as in-group allies), whereas social dominance orientation predicted more negative evaluations overall. Neither ideological belief predicted stereotypes.

AB  - Teachers are caught between the injunction of an inclusive school for all students and the logistic difficulties of such prescriptions. As a consequence, they might be tolerant toward a discriminating peer when they justify the exclusion of students with disability with benevolent arguments. Indeed, people are more likely to accept discriminatory behaviors covered by benevolent justifications rather than by hostile ones. The aim of this experimental study (N= 134) was to test if teachers' willingness to distance themselves from a colleague discriminating against students with disability depends on the justification he/she provided and if attribution to prejudice mediates this relationship. Active teachers read vignettes depicting situations of elementary school student inclusion at school. Through three versions, we manipulated the inclusion of a student with disability by a colleague in his/her classroom (inclusion, exclusion with benevolent justification, or exclusion with hostile justification). Results showed that teachers expressed less backlash and willingness to distance themselves from the colleague when he/she included, rather than excluded, the student and when the reasons for exclusion were benevolent rather than hostile. Finally, attribution to prejudice to the perpetrator mediated the effects of the justification on the distancing measures. These results replicated previous findings regarding the impact of the type of justification on the attribution to prejudice to the case of ableism and show its side effect of willingness to distance from an ingroup perpetrator.

AB  - Research has consistently linked social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) to numerous forms of prejudice, but little research has examined how these personality and ideological variables interact in their associations with various attitudinal outcomes. The present study explored the interactions of SDO and RWA in predicting a wide range of social attitudes (i.e., modern racism, modern sexism, traditional gender role beliefs) and feeling thermometers toward racial/ethnic minorities, women, and other socially stigmatized groups in a cross-sectional survey of 1244 U.S. college students (M-age = 21.54; SD = 5.17). Moderation analyses found significant independent associations of SDO, RWA, or both with all attitudinal or ideological outcome variables. We found a hypothesized synergistic interaction of SDO x RWA in predicting attitudes toward women scores, but the results did not support other hypothesized SDO x RWA interactions. Findings provide further support of the Dual Process Model and suggest that SDO and RWA may employ largely independent pathways in predicting attitudes toward marginalized groups.

AB  - There are two classes of explanations of prejudice: situational and personality. In a sample of Polish community members (n=394), we tried to understand individual differences in prejudice towards refugees (i.e., classical and modern prejudice along with social distance) by considering the role of individual differences in the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), collective narcissism (i.e., agentic and communal), social dominance, and authoritarianism. Both the Dark Triad traits and collective narcissism were associated with prejudice towards refugees among Poles, but the association for the former was fully mediated by social dominance-an effect that was stronger in men-whereas the association for the latter was partially mediated by authoritarianism-an effect that was stronger in women. We discuss our findings referring to a dual process model of prejudice.

AB  - Although research on prejudice against gender and sexual minorities has been increasing in recent years, little attention has been paid to predictors for transprejudice and its potential culture-specific correlates in particular. This cross-sectional study addressed these gaps in the literature by exploring the relative contributions of social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, filial piety, and essentialist beliefs of gender to negative attitudes toward transgender people in 371 Chinese participants. Path analyses showed that (a) consistent with previous research, authoritarianism and social dominance orientation made independent contributions to explaining variance in transprejudice; (b) filial piety, as a culture-specific variable, was a unique predictor for transprejudice beyond the effects of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; and (c) these relations appeared to be mediated by gender essentialism. Our findings suggest that people with higher levels of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation tend to have stronger essentialist beliefs of gender, which may in turn contribute to the development of transprejudice. It also highlights the importance of identifying culture-specific predictors (e.g., filial piety in a Chinese context) when we attempt to understand transprejudice.

AB  - Assessing attitudes toward same-sex parenting has important implications for both intervention and prevention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity. Few empirically validated measures of rejection of same-sex parenting have been developed. The current study examined the psychometric properties of an Italian translation of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale, a 14-item scale distributed in two subscales that measure direct and subtle rejection toward same-sex parenting, for its use in assessing heterosexual people's attitudes toward same-sex parents in Italy. The sample consisted of 344 Italian heterosexual university students (113 men) with a mean age of 20.48 years (SD= 1.60). The results showed that the scale has a good factor structure (via confirmatory factor analysis) and satisfactory reliability and acceptable criterion-related validity. Therefore, the BCASSFS can be used to measure opposition toward gay and lesbian parenting in the Italian context.

AB  - Sexual minority people face greater risk for compromised sexual health than their heterosexual peers, yet school-based sexuality education often excludes them. Little is known about whether or how sexual minority people's sexuality education experiences have varied across sociohistorical contexts of rapid social change in both sexuality education and sexual minority visibility. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 191 sexual minority people from three distinct sociohistorical generations (ages 18-25, 34-41, and 52-59, respectively) and four geographic regions of the United States. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis following a consensual qualitative protocol. Fifty-one participants (i.e., 27%) discussed school-based sexuality education experiences despite the lack of an explicit question in the interview protocol prompting them to do so. Four distinct yet overlapping themes emerged in participants' experiences of sexuality education: 1) Silence; 2) The profound influence of HIV/AIDS; 3) Stigma manifest through fear, shame, and prejudice; and, 4) Comparing school-based experiences to sexuality education outside of school. The presence of themes varied across groups defined by sociohistorical generation. The implications of sexuality education experiences for the wellbeing of sexual minority people are discussed.

AB  - The role of prejudice in second-language acquisition has received little attention but may be related to an individual's motivation to learn another language. For instance, learners who express high Social Dominance Orientation or Right-Wing Authoritarianism, constructs reflective of prejudice and worldviews that endorse hostility towards or fear of outgroup members, may be less motivated to learn a second language. Moreover, increased Social Dominance Orientation and/or Right-Wing Authoritarianism scores may be associated with reduced motivation to learn a second language due to the impact of prejudice on Integrativeness, which is the extent to which a person has an interest in learning a second language and in interacting with members who speak that second language. The current study sought to test these associations with a sample of 110 college participants learning French as a second language in a bilingual institution. Integrativeness was found to fully mediate the relations between Social Dominance Orientation, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, and Motivation to learn a second language. Results suggest the importance of examining the role of prejudice in second-language acquisition.

AB  - This study examines whether secondary schools? gender composition and levels of laddish attitudes influence the degree of ethnic prejudice among Flemish pupils. We hypothesize that in addition to pupil-level predictors of prejudice, the school?s gender composition and its laddish culture play roles in pupils? attitudes toward ethnic minorities. We use multilevel analysis with data obtained in 2014?2015 from 2250 Flemish pupils in 48 secondary schools in Flanders. Both girls? and boys? ethnic prejudice is related to their laddish attitudes. Boys? levels of ethnic prejudice are associated with the gender composition and the laddish culture of their school, while girls? ethnic prejudice is more likely to be influenced by the laddish culture of the school when the proportion of male pupils in the school increases. The findings suggest that in order to reduce ethnic prejudice it might be fruitful to focus on macro-level factors, such as tackling laddish cultures at school.

AB  - Purpose This study examined whether the age, ethnicity, sex, and weight of children influenced weight-based biases. Methods Elementary school children (N = 367; boys = 177; M-age = 9.31 years) provided their perceptions of thin, average, and heavy target children. The age and ethnicity as well as the actual height and weight of each participant was also collected. Results Children rated heavier child targets more negatively than average or thin counterparts. Participant and target ethnicity did not moderate weight biases. Boys were more likely than girls to stigmatize overweight targets regardless of the target's sex. Girls were more likely to stigmatize overweight boys. Young children and those who were thinner were less biased than older and heavier children, but still rated heavier targets negatively. Conclusion The ubiquity of a negative weight bias, even in children, underscores the need for constructing plans in which to not only deal the health concerns associated with obesity but also develop strategies for children who might be physically and/or psychologically struggling with the biases associated with being overweight.

AB  - This article reports on the relationship between the educational performance of second-generation students, the attitude of majority society towards immigrants and integration policy in the destination country. It argues that the educational underperformance of second-generation students is to some extent a product of an inequality in different students' abilities to materialise educational opportunities provided by the destination country's education system. This inequality in abilities is generated by the human diversity of the different groups: immigrants vs. non-immigrants; voluntary immigrants vs. refugees. Depending on the integration context, the human diversity may exacerbate the inequality and cause the performance gap to get wider. The article uses data from two qualitative studies with the Somali community in Finland and employs the capability approach. Due to their background as the children of refugees from Somalia and the attitude of people in mainstream society, Finnish-Somali students face more challenges in materialising educational opportunities. The Finnish context in which they find themselves puts these students in a less encouraging position for two reasons. First, prejudice and discrimination may weaken their will and confidence to learn and reduces their parents' will to cooperate with their schools. Second, their parents-due to their lack of knowledge of the school system and proficiency in the Finnish language-are also relatively less effective in the Finnish schooling system. To deal with the performance gap between immigrant and native children in schooling, public policy should focus on how the integration context is shaping diverse students' abilities (capability sets) to succeed.

AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other-oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees.

AB  - Combating prejudice against social minorities is a challenging task in current multicultural societies. Mass media can decisively shape prejudice, because it often represents the main source of information about social minorities. In 3 studies in the Czech Republic (N = 445) and Switzerland (N = 362; N = 220), we investigated how prejudice against negatively and positively perceived minorities (the Roma in Study 1, Kosovo Albanians in Study 2, Italians in Study 3) is influenced by a single exposure to a print news report, by manipulating the valence of reports about minority members (positive vs. negative vs. mixed) and linguistic forms for minorities' ethnicity (nouns vs. adjectives). Positive and negative reports shaped prejudice in the respective directions; the effect of mixed reports mostly did not differ from positive reports. Labeling ethnicity with nouns (e.g., a male Roma) resulted in more prejudice than adjectives (e.g., a Roma man), independent of report valence. Report valence influenced the affective part of prejudice (i.e., feelings toward a minority), whereas language consistently shaped the behavioral part of prejudice (i.e., preferred social distance from a minority).

AB  - Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for the past, is an ambivalent - albeit more positive than negative - emotion. Nostalgia is infused with sociality, as it refers to important figures from one's past or to momentous life events that include those figures. Dispositional nostalgia is related to prejudice reduction via increases in a form of sociality, empathy. Experimentally induced nostalgia fosters sociality, operationalised as social connectedness (sense of acceptance). Social connectedness, in turn, has downstream consequences for (1) inspiration and goal-pursuit, (2) self-continuity and wellbeing, as well as (3) inclusion of an outgroup member in the self or outgroup trust and intergroup contact intentions. At the collective level, nostalgia confers sociality benefits to the ingroup (favourable attitudes, support, loyalty, collective action, barrier to collective guilt), but is also associated with negative sides of sociality such as outgroup rejection and exclusion. Collective nostalgia's sociality is amenable to exploitation and can have controversial ramifications.

AB  - Social media use can have major impacts on one's construction of identity, sexuality, and gender. However, some social media sites exhibit problematic and prejudiced themes through their photo and video posts. This paper examines two Instagram sites specifically targeting traditionally college-aged individuals. These sites have tens of thousands of followers, post frequently, and solely focus on highlighting the college experience. Through a textual analysis of these two sites, problematic themes emerged, including objectification of female college students, submissiveness of female college students, and emphasis on a young white college experience. These themes are detailed and explored, followed by a discussion on their potential impacts on broader societal structures and ideas for education on gendered prejudices in the media.

AB  - People with experience of psychosis face stigma and discrimination, which can be a significant barrier to recovery. Internalisation of public stereotypes and prejudice into an individual's self-identity is an understandable consequence of such discrimination. However, internalised stigma represents a significant barrier to recovery, resulting in a number of harmful consequences such as depression, demoralisation and loss of self-esteem. Interventions to support people with experience of psychosis who internalise stigma have demonstrated some promising results, but a recent meta-analysis did not find an overall significant effect. The current evidence base includes very few trials of peer support for internalised stigma; however, data from several trials and a recent meta-analysis show that peer support produces benefits on a number of dimensions related to internalised stigma, including empowerment, recovery and hope. In this paper, we argue that peer support is a suitable intervention for addressing internalised stigma and warrants further research. We provide a theoretical and evidence-based rationale for this argument and outlines some of the key challenges and possible solutions for future trials of peer support as an intervention for internalised stigma.

AB  - Previous research has already firmly established the negative relationship between intelligence and racial prejudice. Yet, so far, the role of self-perceived intelligence in explaining racial prejudice remains uninvestigated. The present study therefore compared the effects of intelligence test scores and self-perceived intelligence on racial prejudice using a Belgian community sample (N = 183). Our results revealed opposite relationships: whereas individuals who scored higher (vs. lower) on an intelligence test showed lower levels of racial prejudice, individuals who perceived themselves as being more intelligent compared, to others showed higher levels of racial prejudice. Additional mediation analyses showed that the negative relationship between actual intelligence and racial prejudice was mediated by essentialist thinking whereas the positive association between self-perceived intelligence and racial prejudice was mediated by Social Dominance Orientation. The present results indicate that being more intelligent is related with less racial prejudice, but judging that one is more intelligent than others is related with more racial prejudice.

AB  - Nonhuman animals are typically excluded from the scope of social psychology. This article presents animals as social objects targets of human social responses - overviewing the similarities and differences with human targets. The focus here is on perceiving animal species as social groups. Reflecting the two fundamental dimensions of humans' social cognition -perceived warmth (benign or ill intent) and competence (high or low ability), proposed within the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002) - animal stereotypes are identified, together with associated prejudices and behavioral tendencies. In line with human intergroup threats, both realistic and symbolic threats associated with animals are reviewed. As a whole, animals appear to be social perception targets within the human sphere of influence and a valid topic for research.

AB  - Although migration and immigrant issues have been well studied in sociology, economics, and demography there is significantly less information specific to Latino immigrants within the field of social work. This is of particular concern as the population of Latino immigrants and their children continues to grow and access areas of social work practice and policy development. This research study focuses on understanding the experience of first-generation immigrants of Mexican origin living in Denver, Colorado, through the use of qualitative research methods. Seven Mexican immigrants living in Denver described their experience through an in-depth interview process. Grounded theory was the chosen method for analysis.
   Findings Four themes emerged during the data analysis process: (1) We are working people'; (2) I am not an animal' (experiencing racism, prejudice and discrimination); (3) fear; and (4) internal strength. Together these themes create a conceptual framework that is useful as a starting place to understand the lives and culture of Mexican immigrants. This conceptual framework highlights how immigrants negotiate racism, prejudice, discrimination, and fear through their strong work ethic and the belief in their ability to salir adelante' (to persevere or better oneself or one's family situation).
   Applications Results indicate that Mexican immigrants are faced with numerous challenges, particularly due to racist laws, discriminatory procedures, and acts of prejudice. However, results also suggest that Mexican immigrants and their cultural resources provide a source of hope, allowing them to persevere even as they face challenges. The findings have several implications for direct service, advocacy and social justice, and social work education.

AB  - Recent studies have documented that metacognitive processes underlying social perception contribute to interpersonal prejudice. For example, individuals categorized as lesbian/gay on the basis of their physical appearance are processed disfluently, and such disfluent processing arouses negative social evaluations. Although this pattern of results has replicated across several independent samples, evidence for the social consequences of perceptual disfluency remains limited to a handful of stigmatized groups. Here, we tested disfluency's effects among a social group that has received scant attention in research on social perception-namely, bisexual individuals. We found that (a) perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy categorizing targets as bisexual versus not bisexual based upon facial photographs, (b) gender-atypical facial features were associated with bisexual categorizations, (c) targets who were categorized as bisexual and targets who personally identified as bisexual were evaluated more negatively than those who were not categorized/identified as bisexual, and (d) disfluent processing of nonverbal cues-especially gendered cues-helped to explain anti-bisexual prejudice. Collectively, these findings contribute to the growing literature on perceptions of sexual orientation and highlight the generalizability of perceptual fluency for understanding diverse forms of prejudice that arise in the early moments of social perception.

AB  - Prejudice is generally thought to derive from learned, emotion-laden experiences. The mechanisms underlying the formation of prejudice over time, however, remain unknown. In the present research, we proposed and tested hypotheses regarding prejudice formation derived from research on memory consolidation and social perception. We hypothesized that time-dependent memory consolidation would produce better implicit memory for negative out-group information and positive in-group information, compared with negative in-group information and positive out-group information. Fifty undergraduates learned positive and negative information about racial in-group (Latino) and out-group (African American) targets. Participants returned after both a short time delay (2-6 hr after the learning session) and a long time delay (48 hr after the learning session) to complete a lexical decision task. Results demonstrated that participants responded to information consistent with an in-group bias faster after a long time delay than after a short time delay. Our findings have important implications for the study of social perception and memory consolidation.

AB  - Introduction: To analyze the knowledge, feelings and perceptions involving patients affected by leprosy, as a better understanding of these factors may be useful to decrease the stigma and prejudice associated with the condition. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 94 patients who underwent treatment for leprosy at the Health Units in the City of Cuiaba, Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil. The study questionnaire included items to collect information on socio-demographic data, knowledge about the disease, stigma, prejudice, self-esteem and quality of life of leprosy patients. Bivariate analyses were used to assess the data based on the chi-square test with a 5% significance threshold. Results: The results revealed that the study population consisted predominantly of males (55.3%) with an income between 1 and 3 times the minimum wage (67%). The survey respondents reported that the most significant difficulties related to the treatment were the side effects (44.7%) and the duration of the treatment (28.7%). A total of 72.3% of the subjects were knowledgeable about the disease, of whom 26.6% had the leprosy reaction. Stigma and prejudice were cited by 93.6% of the participants. Based on the responses, 40.4% of patients reported being depressed and sad, and 69.1% of the subjects encountered problems at work after being diagnosed. A total of 45.7% of the patients rated their quality of life between bad and very bad. Conclusions: Our results suggest that leprosy causes suffering in patients beyond pain and discomfort and greatly influences social participation.

AB  - Perceivers use gender-atypical nonverbal cues to categorize others as lesbian/gay, and the same cues help to explain the occurrence of antigay prejudice. Although these patterns replicate across recent studies, their proximal causes have received little attention. It remains unclear, for example, why the gender-atypical appearances common among sexual minority individuals arouse negative evaluations. Here, we tested whether perceptions of communicative intentbelieving that targets' visible features are deliberately enacted in order to convey aspects of their identitiesmay help to explain observed links between sexual orientation categorization, gender typicality, and prejudice. In Study 1, gender-atypical body motions were associated with the perception that targets were intentionally trying to communicate their identity, and perceptions of communicative intent predicted expressions of antigay prejudice. Study 2 replicated these effects with static facial images. Collectively, these findings highlight communicative intent as an important factor predicting antigay prejudice in the early moments of social perception.

AB  - People's concerns about being rejected temper their interest in forming interracial friendships. For Blacks, identity threat can magnify their rejection concerns and reduce friendship interest. The present research explores the role that threat and safety cues play in Blacks' concerns about being rejected by Whites. Prior to an interaction, participants learned information about their partner that was comprised of two safety cues or a safety cue accompanied by a threat cue. In Study 1, Blacks who received both a safety and a threat cue were more concerned about being rejected and were less interested in forming an interracial friendship than Blacks who received only safety cues. Whites were unaffected by these cues. In Study 2, Blacks' perceptions of their interaction partner's warmth mediated the cues' effects on rejection concerns and friendship interest. This research suggests that a single threatening cue can undermine safety cues during interracial interactions.

AB  - The tradition of research into school bullying, and the development of anti-bullying intervention programmes in Norway, has had a significant influence upon similar efforts being made in other countries. However, recent evaluations of the effectiveness of school-based anti-bullying interventions have revealed mixed and most often modest levels of success. This in turn has led to suggestions being made in Norway that rather than to continue support for a direct approach to the issue of school bullying, making improvements in the "learning environment" should be prioritized; however, it is argued here that there is, as yet, no body of direct evidence to directly confirm that position. Instead, it is contended that research into school bullying has been limited to the conceptualization of bullying as being purely a sub-set of aggression, and that anti-bullying intervention has been, consequently, focused largely on purely behaviour management solutions. From recent studies on specific forms of bullying of minority groups (lesbian, gay and bisexual young people, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities or special educational needs and members of alternative sub-cultures), it appears that prejudice is at least influential on specific patterns of bullying behaviour, but has not received sufficient attention in either the conceptualization of bullying or the design of programmes to prevent and counter it. Hence, rather than scaling down direct anti-bullying intervention efforts, it is suggested that subsequent research and programme design could be re-focused in order to give a greater consideration to prejudice as an underlying factor.

AB  - Politically conservative (versus liberal) individuals generally report more prejudice towards various low-status out-groups. Three studies examined whether prejudice suppression factorsspecifically, internal and external motivation to suppress (IMS and EMS, respectively) prejudicecan help explain the relationship between political orientation and prejudice. Study 1 showed that IMS and EMS partially mediated the relationship between political orientation and affective prejudice towards Arabs. Study 2 demonstrated that when justification [right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation] and suppression (IMS and EMS) factors are simultaneously tested as mediators, only RWA partially mediated the relationship between political orientation and prejudice towards deviant (e.g. gay men) out-groups, whereas RWA and IMS fully mediated the relationship between political orientation and prejudice towards derogated out-groups (e.g. Blacks). Intriguingly, IMS rendered social dominance orientation effects non-significant for derogated out-groups. Study 3 showed that anticipating an out-group interaction (with a Black or lesbian confederate) diminished the mediational contribution of IMS in the political orientation-prejudice relationship because of increased IMS among participants; yet the increases in IMS did not completely eliminate differences in prejudice as a function of political orientation. Ultimately, these three studies demonstrate that suppression (in addition to justification) factors do help explain the relationship between political orientation and prejudice.

AB  - Prior research has established a link between Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), empathy, and generalized measures of prejudice. Whether empathy functions as a mediator for more specific forms of prejudice has not been studied. Furthermore, alienation and its role in predicting prejudice have been given little attention in the literature. Our results found that empathy functioned as a mediator for SDO, but only for sexism, not racism. Alienation was found to act as a mediator between SDO and both racism and sexism. The relation between Right-Wing Authoritarianism and racism and sexism was not mediated by alienation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study documented significant changes in prejudice toward gay and lesbian individuals among adolescents from the ages of 12 to 18 years. Moreover, in line with developmental theories of prejudice, there was substantial variability in these patterns, partially predicted by the gender and ideological beliefs (reflected by social dominance orientation [SDO]) of individuals. Boys reported higher prejudice at age 12 than girls. SDO also accounted for initial differences in levels of prejudice. Further, although prejudice toward gay men did decrease among girls over time, it did not decrease among boys. Prejudice toward lesbians decreased at similar rates for boys and girls. These different trajectories are explained within the context of gender socialization processes during adolescence. In addition, fluctuations in adolescents' own SDO corresponded with fluctuations in their level of prejudice, over and above those tied to age-related changes. This association was even stronger among those with overall higher SDO tendencies than others. However, SDO, when treated as a stable invariant factor, did not predict different patterns of progressive age-related change in prejudice. These results extend the research on sexual prejudice by examining it within a broader and more dynamic developmental framework, in greater alignment with developmental theories of prejudice.

AB  - Contact research has traditionally focused on reducing negative attitudes or emotions towards outgroups. In the current studies we focus on reduced social distance as an outcome of intergroup contact - that is a person's desire to have increased contact with members of a group - and investigate whether outgroup evaluation in associated with these generalizing effects of contact. Drawing on data from a large sample of secondary school students in Australia gathered from majority and minority group members the findings demonstrate that having contact with an outgroup reduces social distance to the group in general. However, for majority group members, evaluation of the minority group is a strong predictor of social distance and evaluation is also improved with intergroup contact. Importantly, evaluations of the outgroup play no such role for minority group members. The findings highlight an alternate model for understanding contact effects and suggest that reduced social distance rather than improved outgroup evaluations may be more important in understanding minority responses to contact.

AB  - Objective: To explore whether adults possess implicit attitudes toward children and whether those attitudes are especially negative among respondents who are high in child physical abuse (CPA) risk.
   Methods: The present study used an implicit evaluative priming procedure. In this procedure, participants were instructed to make decisions about the evaluative implications of target words. These words were preceded by photographs of child faces or adult faces displaying positive, neutral, or negative expressions. Reaction times for the evaluative decisions were used as an index of the extent to which photos invoked negative or positive evaluative reactions.
   Results: Results from 2 studies, the first conducted on a student sample (N=90) and the second on a parent sample (N=95), demonstrated that evaluative congruence between the facial expressions displayed in photographs and the target words facilitated responses. Furthermore, the results suggested that regardless of CPA risk, child faces, relative to adult faces, facilitated responses to negative target words, suggesting an out-group bias. This implicit out-group bias was not moderated by respondents' CPA risk status.
   Conclusions: Faces of children, relative to faces of adults, appear to activate negative information structures that facilitate evaluative decisions of negative stimuli, suggesting an out-group bias. Given that out-group biases typically lead to less favorable treatment of out-group members, additional research is needed to examine the pervasiveness of negative evaluative biases towards children and the potential implications of such biases on children's lives. Further, research examining whether high CPA risk parents and low CPA risk parents differ in how they manage initial negative evaluative reactions is needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There has been considerable debate regarding whether Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) constitutes a global individual difference that predicts prejudice or is instead a product of self-categorization processes. Two studies addressed this issue by contrasting the predictive and discriminant validity of SDO and reworded SDO items assessing prescriptive attitudes toward inequality and dominance based on specific stratifications. Consistent with a global individual difference perspective, SDO predicted systematic between-person consistencies in attitudes toward inequality based on specific group-based stratifications. Moreover, SDO and specific stratification attitudes exerted reciprocal cross-lagged effects on one another over five months (Study 1, N = 252). These results indicate that SDO is partially derived from specific attitudes and experiences (a bottom-up effect), but once formed, SDO exerts a reciprocal (top-down) effect on specific attitudes and cognitions about group-based dominance across a range of stratifications. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that SDO also predicted generalized prejudice toward ethnic groups after controlling for ethnic stratification attitudes (Study 2, N = 138). Taken together; these results indicate that SDO reflects a global motivation to achieve group-based dominance that is partially determined by situational factors but not reducible to self-categorization processes associated with attitudes towards specific social groups or categories.

AB  - Studies of the development of racial awareness have used - albeit asystematically - stimuli of varying degrees of realism (dolls, drawings, photographs). Although researchers have weighed the advantages and disadvantages of using one or the other type of material with young children, there are no empirical studies that determine whether the nature of the material affects responses. We examined whether the use of drawings or photos affected children's responses when assessing diverse components of racial awareness. Ninety preschoolers from the majority group in Madrid. Spain, were divided into four groups by age and condition (drawing vs. photo). Children performed person description, social categorization, preference, and matching tasks. Type of material affected performance, although this influence varied by age and task type. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Disability, and everything it encompasses, presents major challenges to individuals, families and communities worldwide. Children with disabilities (CWD) are marginalised and excluded in most societies. Discrimination and prejudice towards CWD are compounded by poverty, lack of essential services and support and sometimes a hostile and inaccessible environment.
   Objectives: The study sought to examine the psychosocial challenges experienced by CWD in the Sekhukhune district of Limpopo province, South Africa. Based on the identified, articulated and expressed challenges, the study sought to recommend improvement of the existing Integrated National Disability Strategy (INDS) for greater responsiveness to the needs of CWD at both provincial and local levels.
   Method: The interpretivist qualitative mode of enquiry was the chosen methodology for this study. Phenomenology and descriptive research designs guided the study. Purposive sampling was employed, and data were collected from 36 participants using three triangulated methods: individual in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Thematic data analysis was used to analyse data.
   Results: The findings revealed that CWD in Sekhukhune experienced numerous challenges which affected their social functioning, development and general well-being. Aggravating factors included stigma, labelling and discrimination; disability-specific discrimination and bullying; exclusive education; sexual exploitation; lack of governmental support and poor implementation of disability-specific policies, amongst others.
   Conclusion: The provisions of the INDS to promote inclusion, integration, mainstreaming and equitable access to resources and services remained an ideal rather than a reality for CWD in Sekhukhune.

AB  - Research finds that social media platforms' peer-to-peer structures shape the public discourse and increase citizens' likelihood of exposure to unregulated, false, and prejudicial content. Here, we test whether self-reported reliance on social media as a primary news source is linked to racialised policy support, taking the case of United States Muslims, a publicly visible but understudied group about whom significant false and prejudicial content is abundant on these platforms. Drawing on three original surveys and the Nationscape dataset, we find a strong and consistent association between reliance on social media and support for a range of anti-Muslim policies. Importantly, reliance on social media is linked to policy attitudes across the partisan divide and for individuals who reported holding positive or negative feelings towards Muslims. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the political ramification of information presented on contemporary social media outlets, particularly information related to stigmatised groups.

AB  - The definition of sleep bruxism (SB) has changed over the years, and although it is no longer defined as a disorder, it is considered a risk factor that can result in prejudicial systemic and stomatognathic issues. The prevalence of SB in children is variable among studies, and its decrease during adolescence is a controversial matter among authors. We aimed to determine SB prevalence and assess its trend with age in a sample of pediatric patients who frequented the Lisbon Pediatric Dentistry Service. We conducted a retrospective observational study based on information provided by patients' parents/caregivers and without examination or polysomnography examination. Data were collected between August 2019 and December 2020 by five dentists. A total of 1900 patients were included, 50.6% and 49.4% of which were male and female, respectively. Of the total sample, 334 (17.6%, 95% confidence interval of 15.9-19.4%) had bruxism, corresponding to 18.9% and 16.2% of male and female patients, respectively (p = 0.121). SB was reported in 20.7% of patients 0-6 years old, in 19.4% of those 7-11 years old, and in 14.6% of those 12-17 years old. In conclusion, SB showed a slightly higher prevalence among male pediatric patients, but further studies are needed to rule out confounding factors.

AB  - People with concealable stigmatized identities often conceal to avoid facing prejudice and discrimination. Yet, this strategy carries risk; concealment may engender social costs. Across five studies in which participants (total n = 1992) were recruited from an online pool (Prolific) and an institutional undergraduate pool, we found that people who conceal, relative to people who disclose, were viewed as less moral and sociable (Studies 1-2B) regardless of the identity being concealed (Studies 2A-2B), and that these effects were moderated by whether or not an outgroup identity was claimed in the course of concealment (Study 2C) and the motivation for concealment (Study 3). Results suggest that concealment is strongly stigmatized, a fact which places members of already-stigmatized groups in a challenging situation wherein they must risk either the stigma of their identity or that of concealment.

AB  - Prejudices tend to come as a package deal; people who are more racist tend to also be more sexist, and so on. Documentations of such attitudinal patterns - generalised prejudice - have a rich history, but the theoretical understanding thereof has been lagging. In recent years, we have seen clear theoretical advancement in the understanding of this phenomenon. We discuss classic premises in this research along with newer research that challenges some of the most ingrained ideas about generalised prejudice. For instance, we discuss research challenging the notions that generalised prejudice is an "us" versus "them" phenomenon, as well as a product of conservative ideology. We further argue that prejudice generalisations need to be studied at different levels of abstraction. Finally, we propose integrative perspectives on generalised and target-specific prejudice, with greater emphasis on processes of generalisation, rather than static generalised prejudice factors.

AB  - Poverty-related stressors have been found to impact parenting behaviors which can result in adverse outcomes for children. The current qualitative study focused on understanding the challenges of caregivers (N = 70) living in poverty. The sample was diverse and included mothers, fathers, and grandparents raising grandchildren. Stories of caregivers were gathered to improve the understanding of families living in poverty in an effort to work towards changing how our world supports families that are vulnerable. Results indicate that families experiencing poverty and related risk factors experience challenges in the realm of child safety, education, and racism/prejudice. Families also discussed ways to improve their environment which included increased financial resources, increased access to high-quality healthcare and childcare, and positive environmental change. Note that the current study outlines the complexity of parenting in poverty and that associated challenges are intertwined. Recommendations are made to address systemic barriers at the individual and community level in an effort to better support caregivers experiencing adversity and parenting in the 21st century.

AB  - One of the most promising directions for reducing mental illness stigma lies in Allport's contact theory, which suggests that intergroup interactions reduce stigma. Here, we argue that stigmatizing attitudes are driven by the nature, magnitude, and valence of community-based ties to people with mental illness (PMI), not simply their presence. Using the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1,113), we compare network-based measures of contact to traditional survey indicators. We find that knowing someone with mental illness, or even number of people known, explains little about desire for social distance, perceptions of dangerousness, or endorsement of treatment coercion. However, having stronger relationships with more PMI, having more friends and family (but not more peripheral ties) with mental illness, and knowing people in treatment are associated with less stigma endorsement. In contrast, we find that exposure to PMI who are perceived as dangerous is associated with greater levels of stigma.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the role of primary schools in reproducing gender discrimination based on teachers' views. In the study, the discriminatory factors arising from "the everyday practices in the classroom and in the school, the curriculum, and the individual characteristics of the students" were discussed from the perspective of views regarding gender. Interviews were conducted with 13 teachers from 6 schools with different socio-economic characteristics in the central districts of Mersin in the 2017-2018 academic year in the study. The data were analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis method. As a result of the study, regardless of socio-economic characteristics, primary school education and gender relations are in a cyclical structure as mechanisms that affect each other, and teachers can convey discriminatory codes to students by being affected by their own student experiences and the traditional gender perspective of the society in which they were raised. On the other hand, it was revealed that teachers associate the source of the gender discrimination with out-of-school factors and are not aware of their responsibilities in this issue. In general, it can be said, based on the results of the study, that the processes and practices in primary school create gendered prejudices in the minds of students and gender discrimination is maintained throughout primary school education.

AB  - Ethnic discrimination is a serious problem in education. Previous quantitative research is predominately focused on the consequences of ethnic discrimination. Very little is known, however, about the characteristics of the school context that influence the initial experience of ethnic discrimination. This knowledge is essential to support schools in how to organize in a way that diminishes the likelihood of adolescents being discriminated against. This study examines the relationship between multicultural education and perceived ethnic discrimination, and the moderating role of the ethnic composition of the student population. Multicultural education is a broad concept. The focus lies on the three main actors: multicultural policy from the perspective of the principal, multicultural teaching from the perception of the teacher and students' perception of multicultural teaching. The results of a multilevel analysis on a large-scale dataset (N = 2715 students, 38 schools) collected in secondary education in Belgium show that students of ethnic Belgian descent are more likely to report ethnic discrimination by peers if the school applies a more multicultural policy or if the school has a high concentration of students with an other-than-Belgian background. Students with an other-than-Belgian background are more likely to report ethnic discrimination by teachers if the school applies a more multicultural policy. If students perceive that their teachers pay attention to multicultural education, they are less likely to report ethnic discrimination by teachers, but more by peers. The ethnic composition is not directly related to perceived ethnic discrimination, nor does it play a moderating role.

AB  - Diversity in the lines of public institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and police forces, is thought to improve provision for minority group members. Nonetheless, whether and how diversity in public institutions shapes majority citizens' prejudice toward minorities are unclear. Building on insights from the intergroup contact literature, I suggest that diversity in public institutions can facilitate positive intergroup contact between majority group members and minorities in elevated social positions. Such unique interactions, which exceed the equal status condition for effective intergroup contact, can serve to reduce prejudice and facilitate more inclusive attitudes among majority group members. To test this expectation, I focus on health care provision-a leading sector with regard to minority representation. Leveraging a natural experiment unfolding in 21 Israeli medical clinics where Jewish patients are haphazardly assigned to receive care from Jewish or Arab doctors and embedding prejudice-related questions in a routine evaluation survey, I demonstrate that brief contact with an Arab doctor reduces prejudice. Specifically, contact with an Arab doctor reduces Jewish patients' exclusionary preferences toward Arabs by one-sixth of an SD and increases Jewish patients' optimism about peace by a 10th of an SD. The modest magnitude of these effects is similar to the impact of well-powered interventions recently reviewed in a meta-analysis of prejudice reduction experiments. These findings emphasize how the demographic makeup of public institutions can reduce mass prejudice, even in a context of intractable conflict.

AB  - In order to understand the problems related to equity and diversity, we can first recognize that school physical education potentializes processes of a cultural context that has, directly and indirectly, interfered with the body and its relationships. We live in a still retrograde society, which has its foundations established in hierarchical relations of power and that women are often devalued in many sectors, especially in contexts of deep social exclusion. However, the body is the result of cultural construction and the concept of "natural" coexists within the culture. Then, it is necessary to problematize and (de)construct concepts that reinforce prejudiced/discriminatory attitudes. Our objective in this article is to interpret how high school students' relationship to knowledge allows situated interventions on gender issues by undergraduate students from one physical education teacher education program. Methodologically, we used a qualitative approach to develop interventions in one high school in the city of Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil, in two stages: (i) questionnaire to consider the students' knowledge related to gender issues; (ii) intervention to work on issues of gender and social inequality. As a result, we have identified as essential to list such issues in the school environment, because it is in the school that we live the plurality of being and establish various social relations, locating them critically. We recognize that the challenge of intervention is beyond problematizing classes, but in educating students as autonomous and emancipated individuals as they can construct their own (self) critique. In conclusion from the analysis of those interventions, it was possible to strongly observe the existing hierarchical relations. In this sense, we emphasize the importance of the teacher to address thematics that generate learning with respect to the male and female bodies in the classes, so that there is a better understanding of the differences to foster the critical and emancipatory expansion of gender equality.

AB  - Purpose
   Extant sales management literature shows that holding negative headquarters stereotypes (NHS) by salespeople is harmful to their sales performance. However, there is a lack of research on how managers can leverage organizational structures to minimize NHS in sales forces. This study aims to know how social network patterns influence the flow of NHS among salespeople and sales managers in a large B2B sales organization.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors hypothesize and test whether patterns of social networks among salespeople and sales managers determine the stereotypical attitudes of salespeople toward corporate directors and, eventually, impact their sales performance. The authors analyzed a multi-level data set from the B2B sales forces of a large US-based media company.
   Findings
   The authors found that organizational social network properties including the sales manager's team centrality, sales team's network density and sales team's external connectivity moderate the flow of NHS from sales managers and peer salespeople to a focal salesperson.
   Research limitations/implications
   First, the data was cross-sectional and did not allow the authors to examine the dynamics of social network patterns and their impact on NHS. Second, The authors only focused on advice-seeking social networks and did not examine other types of social networks such as friendship and trust networks. Third, the context was limited to one company in the media industry.
   Practical implications
   The authors provide recommendations to sales managers on how to leverage and influence social networks to minimize the development and flow of NHS in sales forces.
   Originality/value
   The findings advance existing knowledge on how NHS gets shared and transferred in sales organizations. Moreover, this study provides crucial managerial insights with regard to controlling and managing NHS in sales forces.

AB  - According to ambivalent sexism theory, prejudice toward women has two forms: hostile (i.e., antipathy toward women) and benevolent (i.e., patronizing and paternalistic attitudes toward women). We investigated whether 5- to 11-year-old children's gender attitudes exhibit this bipartite, ambivalent structure. Consistent with this possibility, latent variable modeling on a new developmentally appropriate instrument revealed that children's (n = 237) hostile and benevolent attitudes were two distinct but positively associated factors. Using this instrument, we then explored age and U.S. regional differences in ambivalent gender attitudes, as well as whether these attitudes predicted self-evaluations and preferences associated with traditional gender roles. Stronger agreement with hostile and benevolent gender attitudes was found among younger children, except for boys' benevolent attitudes, which did not vary with age. Children also reported lower agreement with benevolent gender attitudes in a more gender-egalitarian region of the United States (New York vs. Illinois). Finally, children's benevolent and hostile attitudes differentially predicted their self-evaluations (e.g., boys' benevolent vs. hostile attitudes predicted higher vs. lower self-evaluations of warmth, respectively). No evidence emerged for links between gender attitudes and traditional career or relationship expectations. These findings provide the first known evidence that children's gender attitudes are ambivalent-comprising distinct, but positively related, dimensions of subjective positivity and negativity.

AB  - BackgroundSince 2009 Time to Change has included among its strategies a social marketing campaign to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health problems. At the start of its third phase (2016-2021) the target group of the campaign was kept as people aged between mid-twenties and mid-forties but changed to middle-low income groups and the content was focused on men.MethodsParticipants (n=3700) were recruited through an online market research panel, before and after each burst of the campaign. They completed an online questionnaire evaluating knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule, MAKS); attitudes (Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness, CAMI); and desire for social distance (Intended Behaviour subscale of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS). Socio-demographic data and awareness of the campaign were also collected.ResultsFor each of the 3 bursts, significant pre-post awareness differences were found (OR=2.83, CI=1.90-4.20, p<0.001; OR=1.72, CI=1.22-2.42, p=0.002; OR=1.41, CI=1.01-1.97, p=0.043),and awareness at the end of the third burst was 33%. Demographic factors associated with awareness for one or more bursts included having children, familiarity with mental illness, male sex, being Black, Asian or other ethnic minorities and living in London or the East Midlands regions. An improvement across bursts in the "living with" subscale item of the RIBS, and in the "recover" and "advice to a friend" MAKS items were found. Familiarity with mental illness had the strongest association with all outcome measures, while the awareness of the campaign was also related with higher scores in MAKS and RIBS.ConclusionsThese interim results suggest that the campaign is reaching and having an impact on its new target audience to a similar extent as did the TTC phase 1 campaign. While over the course of TTC we have found no evidence that demographic differences in stigma have widened, and indeed those by age group and region of England have narrowed, those for socioeconomic status, ethnicity and sex have so far remained unchanged. By targeting a lower socioeconomic group and creating relatively greater awareness among men and in Black and ethnic minority groups, the campaign is showing the potential to address these persistent differences in stigma.

AB  - Muslim faith schools have been existent in the UK since the 1980s and their number has been rising ever since. These schools are established specifically to provide Muslim children with a learning environment based on Islamic values. However, fulfilling such a mission would not be an easy task in a globalised context characterised by secularism and materialism. The study reported in this paper sought to explore the leadership experiences and challenges as perceived by the head teachers of Muslim schools in the UK. The study employed a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with a sample of head teachers from four Muslim schools in London and Nottingham. The findings revealed that although the participating head teachers were proud of their role as leaders of Muslim schools, they faced significant challenges in their practice of leadership within British secular society. While some of these challenges were general in nature such as parental expectations and lack of support from Muslim community, other challenges were more practical and mission related such as negative perceptions among the wider society, issues in developing Muslim identity among students in a secular society, recruitment of qualified Muslim teachers and financial challenges.

AB  - Although social cognitive difficulties are common following stroke, the extent to which such difficulties observed in the acute phase are related to long-term socioemotional outcomes remains poorly understood. To address this question empirically, 53 stroke patients completed a measure of Theory of Mind (The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test) and a cognitive flexibility measure that has been related to social cognitive processes (a Reversal Learning Task) at hospital bedside. These participants then completed measures of socioemotional functioning at a 6-month follow-up. Baseline difficulties on the two measures were found to predict distinct types of socioemotional difficulties. The RMET uniquely predicted self-reported depression and loneliness whereas the Reversal Learning task uniquely predicted peer-reported social behavior, specifically social inappropriateness and stereotyping and prejudice. Importantly, a measure of general cognitive function did not explain variance in these outcome measures, suggesting that social cognitive difficulties are linked to poor socioemotional outcomes. By showing for the first time that social cognitive deficits observed acutely post-stroke are related to longer term functional outcomes, these findings reinforce the importance of including brief social cognitive measures as part of routine post-stroke clinical assessment.

AB  - A large body of literature shows that boys and girls experience different kinds of peer aggression. This difference is usually explained by the function of bullying depending on gender and age. In the present study, we used a mixed method called concept mapping to analyze the content structure of verbal aggression. We compared this structure between two levels of Polish schools-middle school and high school. Using experimental manipulation we tested whether the content of verbal invectives depends on the gender of the victim. Results showed six different types of verbal invectives. Middle school students listed substantially more in four out of the six categories. There were significant effects of the experimental manipulation of the victim's gender. When the male victim was primed there were significantly more sexual insults and when the female victim was primed there was substantially more ability-related verbal bullying. We interpret these results in the context of the development and norms of masculinity and femininity.

AB  - Most research on sexual prejudice has focused on Western and Christian samples. Using the framework of social identity theory, we investigated the relations among gender, contact, religiosity, and sexual prejudice in a sample of 166 heterosexual Muslim individuals (70.7% from Saudi Arabia) residing in the United States. Consistent with prior research, men reported higher levels of prejudice than women did, especially toward gay men. Higher levels of religiosity predicted higher levels of sexual prejudice for both men and women, but the association was stronger for women. Additionally, more frequent and positive contact with friends and/or family members who were lesbian or gay predicted less sexual prejudice. However, contact was more strongly associated with less sexual prejudice in women than in men. Exploratory analyses revealed that more time spent in the United Sates predicted lower levels of sexual prejudice, and participants from Saudi Arabia reported more sexual prejudice than Muslims from other countries. The current research contributes to the understanding of factors that influence sexual prejudice within Islam and sheds light on the heterogeneity of attitudes within this group of individuals. Furthermore, our findings may help inform efforts to decrease sexual prejudice and increase awareness, advocacy, and future research within Islamic cultures.

AB  - Background Atopic dermatitis affects 10-20% of the children worldwide. Unfortunately not all patients who receive treatment have optimal treatment outcomes. Objective To assess the view of parents and pharmacy staff in order to optimize pharmaceutical care for young atopic dermatitis patients. Setting Community pharmacies in the Netherlands. Method We first held an expert panel meeting to determine experts' views on treatment of atopic dermatitis and their suggestions for areas of improvement. This input was used to develop the interview guide. We conducted telephone interviews with parents of children (aged 0-12years) with atopic dermatitis and face-to-face interviews with pharmacy staff members. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded using qualitative data analysis software. Codes were used to identify themes. Main outcome measure Perspectives of parents of young atopic dermatitis patients and pharmacy staff about treatment. Results We interviewed 29 parents and 18 pharmacy staff members. Many parents mentioned fear of steroid adverse effects, with intentional nonadherence as a consequence, and difficulties with the application of topical treatment. Pharmacy employees also mentioned to encounter these issues. Some employees themselves expressed concerns towards use of steroids. Most parents were satisfied with the information they received; however, they need more practical lifestyle advices, e.g. about bathing or clothing. Both pharmacists and pharmacy technicians mentioned that technicians often lack knowledge to support patients optimally in correct medication use. Conclusion Parents' perceptions about topical corticosteroids might negatively influence treatment outcomes. Pharmacy staff has an important role to inform parents of children with eczema on the appropriate use of topical corticosteroids and emollients. Counseling should not be influenced by their own prejudices about topical corticosteroids. Close collaboration between primary care providers should ensure that parents receive uniform messages.

AB  - Despite extensive research on intergroup contact and acculturation, our understanding of how contact affects receiving society members' preferences for acculturation orientation of immigrants over time is still relatively rudimentary. This longitudinal study examined how perceived group similarity and outgroup trust mediate the effects of cross-group friendship on acculturation preferences (culture maintenance and culture adoption) of the receiving society. It was predicted that cross-group friendship would affect acculturation preferences over time, and that these relationships would be partly mediated by outgroup trust and perceived group similarity. A three-wave full longitudinal sample (N = 467 Chilean school students) was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results confirmed that cross-group friendship longitudinally predicted majority members' support for the adoption of Chilean culture (via perceived group similarity) and Peruvian culture maintenance (via outgroup trust). Conceptual and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how social structures of gender, caste, and religion, within which children in India operate, inform their engagements with media technologies/narratives. We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children's media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children's narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children's exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice.

AB  - Black and poor children are overrepresented at every stage of the child welfare system, from suspicion of abuse to substantiation. Focusing on stereotypes as a source of bias that leads to these disparities, the current study examines the content and strength of stereotypes relating race and social class to child abuse as viewed by medical professionals. Doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals (Study 1: N = 53; Study 2: N = 40) were recruited in local hospitals and online through snowball sampling. Study 1 identified stereotype content by asking participants to list words associated with the stereotype that either (a) Black or (b) poor children are more likely to be abused by their parents, and responses were organized into construct groups. Study 2 determined stereotype strength by asking participants to rate how strongly the constructs generated in Study 1 related to either the race-abuse or social class-abuse stereotype. The content of stereotypes linking child abuse to Black or poor children are confounded, with approximately half the constructs shared by both stereotypes. Of the 10 shared constructs, only "Stressed" and "Neglect" differed in strength, with both significantly more strongly related to the social class-abuse than race-abuse stereotype, all ts(36-37) <= -2.23, Ps <= .03, Cohen's ds >= .71. This research documents the existence, content, and strength of stereotypes that link race and social class to child abuse. These stereotypes have the potential to lead to medical misdiagnosis of abuse for Black and poor children.

AB  - The bullying of sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) is pervasive, with documented negative impacts on health. We explored the social ecology of bullying of SGMY, with a focus on religion as a source or context of bullying. Semistructured interviews with service providers, educators, and administrators in Toronto, Canada, who work with SGMY explored perspectives on the bullying of SGMY, focusing on religiously based bullying and strategies for intervention. Interviews (45-60 minutes) were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. The data revealed religiously based homophobic discourse that permeates religious (places of worship, faith-based schools) and secular microsystems (public schools, families) across SGMY's social ecology. The language and ideology of "sin" and "conversion" were evidenced in direct religiously based bullying of SGMY in schools, and victimization in places of worship and family microsystems, as well as serving as a rationale for bullying and nonintervention by teachers, school staff, administrators, and family members. Multisectoral and multilevel influences of religiously based sexual prejudice on the bullying of SGMY suggest that existing individual-level and microsystem-level responses in schools should be augmented with institutional, policy, and legal interventions in SGMY's more distal social ecology in order to effectively prevent religiously based homophobic bullying.

AB  - As a performance venue, online social spaces afford users a variety of ways to express themselves. Many of these expressions include social identity work, such as the articulation, affirmation, or policing of a shared identity. In this study, we examine one online space in which users engage in social identity work: a Reddit forum (r/starterpacks) that primarily generates and discusses image memes of a very specific format: the "starter pack." Users leverage these image memes to convey what we refer to in this article as prototypes of social identities. Many of these prototypical depictions are necessarily influenced by offline social groups and/or consumer culture, and are furthermore constructed around gendered, racial, or ethnic stereotypes. To understand how these image memes are used to form and perpetuate prototypes of social identities, we employed content analysis to evaluate a sample of 500 image meme artifacts created, shared, and upvoted by the subreddit's users. We discuss the process of applying visual analysis techniques to articulate themes identified in the image meme expressions, in particular: (1) the default of the White, male identity in starter pack characterizations; (2) the production of oppressive social identities through the use of visual and textual content; and (3) the dedication to a stance of "consumption" in assembling starter pack memes, both through body politics expressed therein and use of consumer goods in images. Finally, we draw on reader response theory to frame the challenges of researchers "reading" starter pack memes, despite employing systematic methods of analysis.

AB  - Research in social psychology has the potential to address real-world issues involving racial stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. Literature on confrontation suggests that addressing racism can be seen as a persuasive act that will allow for more effective interpersonal interactions. In this article, we explore the persuasive communication literature in the context of classroom education on the pervasiveness of racial bias. We examine some of the challenges instructors might face from students. Finally, we suggest strategies that might allow for a more effective classroom experience.

AB  - For over a century, genetic arguments for the existence of racial inequality have been used to oppose policies that promote social equality. And, over that same time period, American biology textbooks have repeatedly discussed genetic differences between races. This experiment tests whether racial terminology in the biology curriculum causes adolescents to develop genetic beliefs about racial difference, thereby affecting prejudice. Individual students (N=135, grades 7-9) were randomly assigned within their classrooms to learn either from: (i) four text-based lessons discussing racial differences in skeletal structure and the prevalence of genetic disease (racial condition); or (ii) an identical curriculum lacking racial terminology (nonracial condition). Over 3-months that coincided with this learning, students in the racial condition grew significantly more in their perception of the amount of genetic variation between races relative to students in the nonracial condition. Furthermore, those in the racial condition grew in their belief that races differ in intelligence for genetic reasons significantly more than those in the nonracial condition. And, compared to the nonracial condition, students in the racial condition became significantly less interested in socializing across racial lines and less supportive of policies that reduce racial inequality in education. These findings show how biology education sustains racial inequality, and conversely, how human genetic variation education could be designed to reduce genetically based racism.

AB  - Gatti, Irazuzta and Martinez address the intercultural public policies implemented in the education system of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country (Spain). Focusing on the education system allows them to reconstruct the historicity of identity-alterity production in a region in which language has been central for the establishment of ethnic frontiers. More specifically, they examine the implementation of these policies in three pre-school and primary educational institutions in a multicultural neighbourhood of the city of Bilbao. They look at Euskarathe Basque languageas a key element of the us-them distinction. The various education models regarding language and the teaching in/of Euskara or Spanish pave the way for the specialization and spatialization of the schools analysed. Integration' policies are implemented in ethnically marked schools only, based on a rhetoric of interculturality that assumes that any racial or ethnic discrimination' can be overcome through knowledge of the Other. Moreover, the assessment of public policies through interculturality figures and best practice' developed to address the so-called immigration issue' promotes a protectionist intervention on behalf of the assumed social vulnerabilities of immigrant schoolchildren and their families, which are read as problematic characteristics'. The article argues that, as a result of the approach based on the social conditions of immigrant children and their families in the Basque Country, the race issue evaporates.

AB  - Microteaching has gained considerable attention for its effectiveness in rapid and contextual training in professional development programs. However, the interpretive quality of the teaching demonstration and peer feedback may influence individuals' attribution and self-correction, leading to ineffective learning. In this study, a microteaching workshop in a professional development program for 78 elementary school science teachers was investigated. The results showed that the effectiveness of microteaching was negatively affected by participants' perception bias due to social categorization. Moreover, it was indicated that the participants' perception of the in-group and out-group, classified by the degree of the individuals' science knowledge, fostered social categorization. Participants tended to experience perception conflicts caused by their inability to see personal faults, and a typical perception bias of "seeing one's own strengths and seeing others' shortcomings" was more frequently recognized in the out-group. These results converge to highlight the importance of social categorization in perception bias relevant to microteaching.

AB  - We present experimental evidence from a bilingual city in Northern Italy on whether the affiliation to a specific language group affects behavior in a prisoner's dilemma game and leads to discrimination. Running a framed field experiment with 828 six- to eleven-year old primary school children in the city of Meran, we find that cooperation generally increases with age, but that the gap between cooperation among in-group members and cooperation towards children speaking another language is considerable and develops with age. This gap is due to both in-group favoritism and language group discrimination. While the former is persistent across all age groups and both language groups and accounts for most of the discrimination observed, the latter only emerges in later years of primary school among children belonging to the German language group.

AB  - Background: Stigma and discrimination harm the wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and contribute to migration from contexts of sexual persecution and criminalization. Yet LGBT newcomers and refugees often face marginalization and struggles meeting the social determinants of health (SDOH) following immigration to countries such as Canada. Social isolation is a key social determinant of health that may play a significant role in shaping health disparities among LGBT newcomers and refugees. Social support may moderate the effect of stressors on mental health, reduce social isolation, and build social networks. Scant research, however, has examined social support groups targeting LGBT newcomers and refugees. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore experiences of social support group participation among LGBT African and Caribbean newcomers and refugees in an urban Canadian city.
   Methods: We conducted 3 focus groups with a venue-based sample of LGBT African and Caribbean newcomers and refugees (n = 29) who attended social support groups at an ethno-specific AIDS Service Organization. Focus groups followed a semi-structured interview guide and were analyzed using narrative thematic techniques.
   Results: Participant narratives highlighted immigration stressors, social isolation, mental health issues, and challenges meeting the SDOH. Findings reveal multi-level benefits of social support group participation at intrapersonal (self-acceptance, improved mental health), interpersonal (reduced isolation, friendships), community (reciprocity, reduced stigma and discrimination), and structural (housing, employment, immigration, health care) levels.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that social support groups tailored for LGBT African and Caribbean newcomers and refugees can address social isolation, community resilience, and enhance resource access. Health care providers can provide support groups, culturally and LGBT competent health services, and resource access to promote LGBT newcomers and refugees' health and wellbeing.

AB  - Immigrant youth are at risk of experiencing harassment in school; however, we have only limited understanding of what makes youth harass their peers on ground of their ethnic origin. To address this major limitation, we examined (a) whether youth's negative attitudes toward immigrants impact their engagement in ethnic harassment over time and (b) whether youth's impulsivity, their tendencies to engage in risky behaviors, and a chaotic surrounding school environment moderate the link between their negative attitudes toward immigrants and their involvement in ethnic harassment. The sample included 583 Swedish youth ((X) over bar (age) = 13.93, SD = .71). Youth with negative attitudes toward immigrants ethnically were found to harass their immigrant peers when they had high levels of impulsivity and violent tendencies. Contrary to our expectation, youth perceptions of school atmosphere did not act as a moderator. The present study highlights the importance of identifying risk factors to reach a comprehensive understanding of ethnic harassment.

AB  - Erik Erikson's theory of human development defines generativity as the concern for the continuation of life after an individual's death. According to the theory, such a concern has a wide spectrum that ranges from the desire to procreate to the willingness to contribute for the sake of generations that have yet to come, and is thus closely related to concepts of social responsibility and agency. Although this is a well-known aspect of the theory it is only marginally measured in the common quantitative measures of generativity-e.g. the Loyola Generativity Scale. In this study we present the Social Generativity Scale (SGS), which is focused on responsibility for future generation. Correlational analysis showed that the SGS is more consistently linked to future orientation than other generativity measures (i.e. measured with consideration of future consequences), inclusiveness, and political engagement, and negatively related to social dominance orientation and prejudice. The results suggest that the SGS better captures the social responsibility dimension of the generativity concept than previous measures, and for this reason it is complementary to those scales that comprehend generativity as the concern for personal continuation after death and desire of parenting.

AB  - This paper draws on original empirical research to investigate popular understandings of prejudice in two national contexts: Poland and the United Kingdom. The paper demonstrates how common-sense meanings of prejudice are inflected by the specific histories and geographies of each place: framed in terms of distance' (Poland) and proximity' (United Kingdom), respectively. Yet, by treating these national contexts as nodes and linking them analytically the paper also exposes a connectedness in these definitions which brings into relief the common processes that produce prejudice. The paper then explores how inter-linkages between the United Kingdom and Poland within the wider context of the European Union are producing - and circulating through the emerging international currency of political correctness' - a common critique of equality legislation and a belief that popular concerns about the way national contexts are perceived to be changing as a consequence of super mobility and super diversity are being silenced. This raises a real risk that in the context of European austerity and associated levels of socioeconomic insecurity, negative attitudes and conservative values may begin to be represented as popular normative standards which transcend national contexts to justify harsher political responses towards minorities. As such, the paper concludes by making a case for prejudice reduction strategies to receive much greater priority in both national and European contexts.

AB  - This paper focuses on the ponoh/pondok Muslim schools of the south of Thailand. These schools, which are traditional institutions of religious learning and places of religious piety, have experienced conflict and contestations throughout the twentieth century. Pondok have been pulled by different modernizing forces including separatist violence. The paper concludes that the contestations and negotiations with the Thai government are about the development of the local Malay people's modern civic identity within Thailand. It suggests that the introduction of a secular curriculum has had (and still has) its benefits for empowering the Malay-speaking population by supplying them with the cultural tools to contest and civically negotiate their position, culture and heritage within the Kingdom. The paper also provides a history of these schools and their political relationship to the Thai government's policies and to separatist organizations, as well as an update of events relating to the schools during the recent period of separatist and counter-separatist activities.

AB  - Objectives: Peer support involves people in recovery from psychiatric disability offering support to others in the same situation. It is based on the belief that people who have endured and overcome a psychiatric disability can offer useful support, encouragement, and hope to their peers. Although several quantitative reviews on the effectiveness of peer support have been conducted, qualitative studies were excluded. This study aimed to synthesize findings from these studies. Method: A qualitative metasynthesis was conducted, involving examination, critical comparison, and synthesis of 27 published studies. The experiences of peer support workers, their nonpeer colleagues, and the recipients of peer support services were investigated. Results: Peer support workers experiences included nonpeer staff discrimination and prejudice, low pay and hours, and difficulty managing the transition from "patient" to peer support worker. Positive experiences included collegial relationships with nonpeer staff, and other peers; and increased wellness secondary to working. Recipients of peer support services experienced increased social networks and wellness. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The findings highlight training, supervision, pay, nonpeer staff/peer staff relationships, as important factors for statutory mental health peer support programs.

AB  - This study purposed to examine the views of school administrators and teachers concerning female teachers who serve as school administrators. A total of 10 male 12 female teachers and school administrators were interviewed for the study. The results indicate that the biggest obstacles before women serving as school administrators are the patriarchic social structures and social prejudices concerning women's roles. Women's motherhood role, the household duties expected of women, the attitudes of their spouses, and sexist views prevalent in the society, such as "administrative roles are for men" seem to be prominent obstacles for women who want to serve as administrators. Suggestions made included positive discrimination for more female administrators in schools, educational activities to encourage women to seek administrative roles, use of economic sanctions for women willing to serve as administrators, and setting up nurseries in schools.

AB  - We investigated familiarity with, knowledge of. and attitudes toward epilepsy among teachers in elementary schools in Korea, where there is profound prejudice against epilepsy. Most of the teachers thought that epilepsy is a genetic disease They agreed that children with epilepsy (CWE) should attend regular classes (although with some restriction of school activities) because their academic achievement would be comparable to that of children without epilepsy However, half of the teachers opposed having CWE in their own classes because they feared a child having a seizure during class and they felt they lacked knowledge of first-aid for seizures Those teachers who had inaccurate clinical knowledge of epilepsy also demonstrated negative attitudes toward the marriage and employment of persons with epilepsy We conclude that information about epilepsy should be included in teacher training programs so as to increase their level of knowledge of epilepsy and correct prejudices against epilepsy (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved

AB  - Purpose: Participation of people with disabilities is influenced by environmental and contextual factors. Disability awareness programmes aim to increase knowledge and acceptance of disability. This study evaluated a disability awareness programme for students aged 9-11 in Australia.
   Method: Pre-post questionnaires and focus groups evaluated the programme. The intervention took a cognitive-behavioural approach including a person with a disability co-presenting. Students (n = 147) participated in two sessions of discussions, written activities, demonstrations and disability simulation activities.
   Results: Significant improvements (p < 0.001) in knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of disability were evident immediately following the intervention. Focus group analyses further demonstrated these findings.
   Conclusions: A brief disability awareness programme for children improved knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of disability in the short-term. Further research is required to identify the potential impact of such programmes on inclusion and social participation of people with disabilities both inside and outside of the school setting.

AB  - Historical, social representations about stigma and prejudice related to unhoused people cause psychological distress, feeling of shame, and withdrawal from family and social relationships. This paper aimed to understand how unhoused people and health professionals perceive, reproduce, elaborate, and address the representations produced by their social conditions. This qualitative research employed participant observation, interviews with 24 unhoused people, and a focus group with professionals from the services providing care to the unhoused people. The study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where crack use is very prevalent. An analysis was performed using the phenomenological narrative method. Stereotyping conjures the self-image of an unworthy, unwanted person, which justifies daily discrimination and, above all, the loss of the most critical condition of all beings, namely, their human condition, besides legitimizing the lack of care and violence against them. Deepening the relationship between prejudice and discrimination in the context of vulnerable populations and health services can assist therapeutic projects that promote the reduction of psychological distress, better care, and social recognition of citizenship of the unhoused people.

AB  - Background and objectives: One important forensic activity is the assessment of aesthetic injuries where expert criteria and analysis are insufficiently outlined due to the subjective elements related to the traumatized victim. Unaesthetic morphological changes may occur due to various circumstances committed under the Penal Code, resulting in permanent unaesthetic morphological scarring. Considering that most of the existing scales for the assessment of aesthetic prejudices refer only to morphometric changes, our aim was to create a modern method for the evaluation of aesthetic damage that also considers its social and psychological consequences. Materials and Methods: In this study, we developed the Mekeres Psychosocial Internalization Scale (MPIS), which proposes a clear boundary between the presence or absence of aesthetic damage. The traumatized person is evaluated after a minimum of six months (in the case of an average scar, necessary for defining the character of the scar) to assess changes in the physiognomy or even alterations in the victim's aesthetic perception of their own body. Our study was conducted on 103 patients with scars, and the results were compared to 101 controls (subjects without scars). Results: Individuals with scars have a distorted perception (compared to controls) of the support provided by significant people [t (202) = 2.473; p = 0.01]. Hypothetically, they will most likely exhibit a nuanced socio-cognitive and psycho-emotional vulnerability that may be the source of future dysfunctions. The fidelity of the MPIS scale was estimated by employing Cronbach's alpha coefficient, resulting in a value of 0.934 (15 items). The exploratory factorial analysis with Varimax rotation mode sustains a single dominant factor, indicating a good internal consistency. The results of this study provide evidence regarding the psychosocial or psychometric worthiness of MPIS. Conclusions: MPIS can be used for research and as an instrument to assess aesthetic damage or disfigurement by forensic physicians and lawyers.

AB  - How have the white, middle-class, Eurocentric ideologies and practices of the Western psychoanalytic canon prepared us to make meaning of the complexities of our pluralistic world? Psychoanalysis has been criticized for its predominantly decontextualized and depoliticized perspectives that emphasize universal intrapsychic unconscious dynamics. In the context of a sociopolitically critical view of psychoanalytic theory and practice, I will reflect on what it means to keep conducting 'business as usual' in an era where movements like Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, as well as the health inequities that became apparent due to the Covid-19 pandemic are clear warning signs that our world is deeply troubled by injustice. I will argue that psychoanalytic theory and practice is not immune from this injustice. I will also contemplate aspects of a socially just psychoanalytic vision that may reverse decontextualizing, depoliticizing, and prejudicial trends using the principle of social thirdness, which expands traditional views of thirdness to include the patient's and therapist's embeddedness in the larger sociopolitical currents that inform and shape their engagement with each other. Reflecting on themes such as race, sexuality, gender, and sex/gentler nonconformity, both the collapse and repair of social thirdness will be described and illustrated with relevant clinical examples.

AB  - Children of immigrants are often considered to be at increased risk of mental health problems due to families' immigration-related stress and perceived discrimination and prejudice from the host country. However, many studies found them to have better developmental outcomes than children with native-born parents in the U.S. This study aims to unfold this paradoxical phenomenon using data from a population-based cohort of children born in large U.S. cities. Specifically, we investigated differences in mental health outcomes between children of immigrants and those with native-born parents, stratified by children's race-ethnicity. We also explored the mediating role of child maltreatment risk in the association of parental nativity status and race-ethnicity with children's mental health. Our findings supported the immigrant paradox, with better self-reported and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing outcomes in Hispanic and Black children of immigrants than their same race-ethnicity peers and White children of native-born. Such immigrant-native variations were partially explained by parents' physically and psychologically abusive behaviors. Hispanic and Black children with immigrant parents were less likely to be physically or psychologically abused than their peers of native-born at ages 4-5, which translated into mental health advantages of children of immigrants at age 9. Our findings shed light on future research to further clarify the mechanism underlying different parenting practices between same race-ethnicity immigrants and native-born families so that culturally responsive interventions can be developed to safeguard racial-ethnic minority children's mental health.

AB  - Adults manifest a number of attributional biases in explaining the behavior of in- versus out-group members. The present study investigated the developmental origins of such biased explanation. Children from majority and minority populations in Israel, and from majority populations in Germany (N = 165), were asked to explain the behavior of in- and out-group members. Across ages and groups, children more often referred to group membership when explaining an out-group as compared to an in-group member's behavior; and more often to individual factors when explaining an in-group as compared to an out-group member's behavior. These findings are consistent with the early emergence of fundamental differences in the conceptualizations of in- and out-group members.

AB  - Research suggests that exposure to stories about Black adults who are contributing positively to their community can reduce implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias in older children (ages 9-12). The aim of the current research was to replicate and extend this finding by investigating whether a different child-friendly manipulation exposing children to positive Black exemplars and negative White exemplars could decrease implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias in children aged 5 to 12 years, both immediately following the intervention and 1 hr later. In addition, a second aim of this research was to examine whether child-friendly positive exemplar exposure would similarly reduce adults' implicit racial bias. In a sample of White and Asian Canadians (N = 478; 182 male, 296 female), recruited from a community science center (children) and a public university in Vancouver (adults), 9- to 12-year-old children's racial bias was reduced up to 1 hr after this new intervention, while the effectiveness of the intervention on 5-to 8-year-old children's bias was less clear. Interestingly, this intervention did not reduce adult levels of bias. The results of a follow-up study (N = 96; 23 male, 72 female, 1 nonbinary) indicate that exposure to child exemplars can reduce bias in adults, but only when additional instructions are provided to internalize the presented association. Thus, the current study provides evidence that depicting counterstereotypical exemplars can reduce implicit racial bias in children for up to 1 hr after exemplar exposure, but there may be important developmental differences in the conditions required to change this bias.

AB  - Advances in molecular technologies have the potential to help remedy health inequities through earlier detection and prevention; if, however, their delivery and uptake (and therefore any benefits associated with such testing) are not more carefully considered, there is a very real risk that existing inequities in access and use will be further exacerbated. We argue this risk relates to the way that information and knowledge about the technology is both acquired and shared, or not, between health practitioners and their patients.
   A healthcare system can be viewed as a complex social network comprising individuals with different worldviews, hierarchies, professional cultures and subcultures and personal beliefs, both for those giving and receiving care. When healthcare practitioners are not perceived as knowledge equals, they would experience informational prejudices, and the result is that knowledge dissemination across and between them would be impeded. The uptake and delivery of a new technology may be inequitable as a result. Patients would also experience informational prejudice when they are viewed as not being able to understand the information that is presented to them, and information may be withheld.
   Informational prejudices driven by social relations and structures have thus far been underexplored in considering (in)equitable implementation and uptake of new molecular technologies. Every healthcare interaction represents an opportunity for experiencing informational prejudice, and with it the risk of being inappropriately informed for undertaking (or offering) such screening or testing. Making knowledge acquisition and information dissemination, and experiences of informational prejudice, explicit through sociologically framed investigations would extend our understandings of (in)equity, and offer ways to affect network relationships and structures that support equity in delivery and uptake.

AB  - Background: Migration is a potentially stressful process due to the sociocultural changes and the adaptation processes that go along with it. However, social support can mitigate the impact of stress, ease the adaptation process and contribute to migrants' overall well-being. The aim of this study was to explore to what extent social support buffers the effects of stress and ethnic prejudice on subjective well-being and physical symptoms in a Peruvian immigrant community in Spain.
   Method: One hundred and thirty seven people participated in the study, 67.2% of them women and 32.8% men, with an age range between 19 and 64 years, who responded to self-report instruments through an online survey. The statistical analysis consisted of obtaining a structural equation model (SEM) in order to estimate the direct, indirect and total effects involved in the relationships between the study variables.
   Results: Social support was shown to have a significant direct effect (beta =.174, p = .017) on the participants' degree of subjective well-being, as well as an indirect effect mediated by both stress and ethnic prejudice (beta = .170, p < .001). No significant direct relationship was found between the degree of social support and the severity of participants' physical symptoms.
   Conclusions: The level of social support contributes to subjective well-being and acts as a protective factor against the effects of high levels of stress and ethnic prejudice, thus fostering immigrants' process of adaptation to their new socio-cultural context.

AB  - Facebook's rainbow profile filter represents a popular display of activism ("pictivism") commonly used by women, yet little is known of pictivism's potential for creating social change. We tested whether women's group status (belonging to a dominant vs. marginalized group) and filter use influenced viewers' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. We conducted a series of 2 (target sexual orientation: queer or heterosexual) x 2 (filter use: filter or no filter) experiments with heterosexual (N-1= 198,N-2= 186) and LGBTQ (N-3= 290) participants. Participants rated women who used rainbow filters as more activist than women who did not engage in pictivism. Although neither target sexual orientation nor filter use influenced participants' ally behavior (donations), heterosexual people who viewed a woman using a filter reported greater closeness to LGBTQ people and greater intentions of supporting LGBTQ people when the woman was queer than heterosexual. Exposure to rainbow filters caused LGBTQ participants to express greater online and societal belonging than when filters were absent. Taken together, women's pictivism and the online visibility of queer women yielded some psychological benefits for heterosexual and LGBTQ viewers. If the goal of pictivism is to enhance marginalized groups' feelings of support, it works as intended. We thus recommend that both heterosexual and LGBTQ people who care about LGBTQ rights and seek to affirm LGBTQ individuals' sense of belonging embrace opportunities on social media, specifically through profile picture filters, to communicate their support.Additional online materials for this article are available onPWQ's website at

AB  - While there are many studies of prejudice towards disadvantaged minorities, there has been little research into stereotypes of rich people. The author commissioned the first international comparative study to investigate popular attitudes towards rich people. He analyses findings from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and France, and calculates a 'Social Envy Coefficient' for these four countries. Envy appears most pronounced in France, followed by Germany. By contrast, envy is significantly lower in the United States and Great Britain, although there are interesting variations by age. In addition, the study subjects a sample of popular international feature films and articles in German newspapers to detailed media content analysis. This analysis finds that rich individuals are predominantly portrayed as cold-hearted, profit-hungry and morally suspect.

AB  - Our analysis investigates how gender, age, and technology stereotypes relate to one another and how this relationship reinforces or questions stereotypes. Based on intersectionality, stereotyping, and sense-making literature, our study explores how older women perceive their own interest in and competence with technology and that of their peers. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with women between 65 and 75 years of age in Germany. Our findings indicate that their evaluations of others are age and gender stereotyped. When explaining their own interest in technology, they refer to their individual preferences, and for explaining their own competence of technology, they refer to social categories. Plus, assumptions of technology usage seem to be gendered. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the need for taking social categories into account when evaluating inclusiveness with new technologies.

AB  - This paper surveys 1 of the author's 3 lifetime research themes, namely the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination. We first review large-scale surveys documenting the prevalence of prejudice and discrimination suffered by minorities in Canada including Indigenous. African Canadians, Francophone minorities in English-Canada, and English-speaking communities in Quebec. There is growing evidence of the mental and physical health consequences of being victim of discrimination in Canada and elsewhere in the world. We review laboratory studies using the Minimal Group Paradigm showing that the mere categorisation of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination. In line with Social Identity Theory, the degree of ingroup identification and the need to achieve a positive social identity help account for the classic ingroup favoritism effect obtained in Minimal Group Paradigm studies. Thus, both social identity needs (Social Identity Theory) and competition for scarce resources articulated within Realistic Conflict Theory combine to account for prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup antagonisms. Interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination are discussed including intergroup contact and diversity training. As scientific consultant, the author helped develop the French Radio-Canada television documentary, La Lecon de Discrimination, which won best television educational program in the world and was successfully adapted as a prodiversity pedagogical tool in Canada and worldwide.

AB  - Islamophobic hate speech on social media is a growing concern in contemporary Western politics and society. It can inflict considerable harm on any victims who are targeted, create a sense of fear and exclusion amongst their communities, toxify public discourse and motivate other forms of extremist and hateful behavior. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for automated tools to detect and classify Islamophobic hate speech robustly and at scale, thereby enabling quantitative analyses of large textual datasets, such as those collected from social media. Previous research has mostly approached the automated detection of hate speech as a binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is often inappropriate for both theoretically informed social science and effective monitoring of social media platforms. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we build an automated software tool which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and balanced accuracy is 83%. Our tool enables future quantitative research into the drivers, spread, prevalence and effects of Islamophobic hate speech on social media.

AB  - More than any other time in modern history, today people are significantly more likely to know (or be) lesbian, gay, and transgender (LGT) people; however, prejudices directed toward these groups remain. In the current study, we explore how social contact and social distancing/desired social contact are related to LGT prejudices using Worthen?s (2012) Attitudes Toward LGT People Scales and data from four heterosexual college student samples in Oklahoma, Texas, Italy, and Spain (N?=?1,217). In doing so, we provide the first-ever study to explore Allport?s (1954) contact hypothesis as it relates to transgender prejudices in Italy and Spain and the first study to examine desired social contact/social distancing and transgender prejudice in the U.S., Italy, and Spain. Our findings demonstrate that measures of desired social contact are strongly related to cross-cultural LGT attitudes, while simple measures of contact (i.e., knowing an LGT person) are significantly less robust.

AB  - A foundational question in the social sciences concerns the interplay of underlying causes in the formation of people's political beliefs and prejudices. What role, if any, do genes, environmental influences, or personality dispositions play? Social dominance orientation (SDO), an influential index of people's general attitudes toward intergroup hierarchy, correlates robustly with political beliefs. SDO consists of the subdimensions SDO-dominance (SDO-D), which is the desire people have for some groups to be actively oppressed by others, and SDO-egalitarianism (SDO-E), a preference for intergroup inequality. Using a twin design (n = 1,987), we investigate whether the desire for intergroup dominance and inequality makes up a genetically grounded behavioral syndrome. Specifically, we investigate the heritability of SDO, in addition to whether it genetically correlates with support for political policies concerning the distribution of power and resources to different social groups. In addition to moderate heritability estimates for SDO-D and SDO-E (37% and 24%, respectively), we find that the genetic correlation between these subdimensions and political attitudes was overall high (mean genetic correlation 0.51), while the environmental correlation was very low (mean environmental correlation 0.08). This suggests that the relationship between political attitudes and SDO-D and SDO-E is grounded in common genetics, such that the desire for (versus opposition to) intergroup inequality and support for political attitudes that serve to enhance (versus attenuate) societal disparities form convergent strategies for navigating group-based dominance hierarchies.

AB  - To avoid social disapproval in studies on prejudice against women leaders, participants might provide socially desirable rather than truthful responses. Using the Crosswise Model, an indirect questioning technique that can be applied to control for socially desirable responding, we investigated the prevalence of prejudice against women leaders in a German university community sample of 1529 participants. Prevalence estimates that were based on an indirect question that guaranteed confidentiality of responses were higher than estimates that were based on a direct question. Prejudice against women leaders was thus shown to be more widespread than previously indicated by self-reports that were potentially biased by social desirability. Whereas women showed less prejudice against women leaders, their responses were actually found to be more biased by social desirability, as indicated by a significant interaction between questioning technique and participants' gender. For men, prejudice estimates increased only slightly from 36% to 45% when an indirect question was used, whereas for women, prejudice estimates almost tripled from 10% to 28%. Whereas women were particularly hesitant to provide negative judgments regarding the qualities of women leaders, prejudice against women leaders was more prevalent among men even when gender differences in social desirability were controlled. Taken together, the results highlight the importance of controlling for socially desirable responding when using self-reports to investigate the prevalence of gender prejudice.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to support the integration of scientifically grounded linguistic knowledge into language teaching in English Language Arts (ELA) classrooms through building an understanding of what teachers currently know and believe about language.
   Design/methodology/approach In total, 310 high school English teachers in the USA responded to a survey about their language beliefs. Statistical analysis of responses identified four distinct constructs within their belief systems. Sub-scales were created for each construct, and hierarchical regressions helped identify key characteristics that predicted beliefs along a continuum from traditional/hegemonic to linguistically informed/counter-hegemonic.
   Findings Key findings include the identification of four belief constructs: beliefs about how language reveals speaker characteristics, beliefs about how society perceives language use, beliefs about how language should be treated in schools and beliefs about the English teacher's role in addressing language use. In general, teachers expressed counter-hegemonic beliefs for their own role and their view of speaker characteristics. They expressed hegemonic beliefs for societal perceptions and the dominant school language narrative. Taking a linguistics class was associated with counter-hegemonic beliefs, and teaching longer was associated with more hegemonic beliefs.
   Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that the longer teachers teach within a system that promotes hegemonic language practices, the more they will align their own beliefs with those practices, despite having learned linguistic facts that contradict pervasive societal beliefs about language. The Dominant School Language Narrative currently accommodates, rather that disrupting, linguistic prejudice.
   Originality/value A current understanding of teachers' language ideologies is a key step in designing teacher professional development to help align teaching practices with established linguistic knowledge and to break down a socially constructed linguistic hierarchy based on subjective, and frequently prejudicial, beliefs.

AB  - Most people agree that discrimination is wrong, but the boundary between discrimination' and not discrimination' is often highly contested in everyday practice. We explore the social representations of discrimination' as an object of study in qualitative interviews and focus groups with both minority (self-identified as BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] and/or gay men) and majority (self-identified as White and/or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Our analysis suggests three repeated and pervasive argumentative lines in social representations of discrimination: (1) that there are two distinct kinds of discrimination (hard vs. soft), (2) that you need to understand the intention of the actor(s), and (3) that a claim of discrimination requires strong evidence. We outline the macro Functions of these resources to argue that each was non-performative: They appeared to be tools to make claims of discrimination, but in practice they were much more effective at making claims of what was not discrimination.

AB  - Intergroup prejudice is a distorted opinion held by one social group about another, without examination of facts. It is heightened during crises or threat. It finds expression in social media platforms when a group of people express anger, resentment and dissent towards another. This paper presents a system for automated detection of prejudiced messages from social media feeds. It uses a knowledge discovery framework that preprocesses data, generates theory-driven linguistic features along with other features engineered from textual content, annotates and models historical data to determine what drives detection of intergroup prejudice especially during a crisis. It is tested on tweets collected during the Boston Marathon bombing event. The system can be used to curb abuse and harassment by timely detection and reporting of intergroup prejudice.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers adjust to life in the US in order to understand their lives and help them to adapt to the new culture. Based on acculturation and mobile media theories, this study explores particularly how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers' child-rearing practices in the US are mediated by mobile media. Guided by the theoretical framework of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers. Findings reveal that while going through the acculturation process, Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers attempt to play the traditional social role of mother as defined in their home countries when utilizing mobile media in their new home. Mobile media have symbolic meanings of empowerment and can be used as tools to deal with prejudice in the host country. This study also suggests that mobile media may mediate Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers' acculturation processes when adopting different types of acculturation strategies (e.g., integration or separation). Implications for practice and future studies are further discussed.

AB  - Children are shaped by what they see and hear around them at home and at school. This can include race-related discourse that posits some members of society above others. The 12-14 year old children in two Australian Grade 8 classes were not exempt. Although previously they had very minimal interaction with Aboriginal Australians, all 47 students in these two classes had come to believe derogative stereotypes about Aboriginal people. But things began to change as they engaged in a program of learning designed in consultation with an Aboriginal educator to present a positive discourse to counter the deficit discourse about Aboriginal people prevalent in Australia. In the drivers' seat of their learning, students began to appreciate past and present cultures of Aboriginal people and their resilience and achievements amidst racial oppression. Through a lens of empathy, students not only formed more positive perspectives about Aboriginal people, but realised the need to not judge any group of people. Aspects of the design and outcomes of this study may be applied to other anti-prejudice and pro-social educational initiatives.

AB  - Autists frequently confront prejudicial stereotypes that they are asexual, hyper- or hypo sexual, child-like and dependent, and/or uninterested in sex. Further, their sexuality is posited as being problematic, in need of being 'treated' or managed in some way. These stereotypes are fed by common autistic characteristics that autists for example, do not like being touched, and that because they are 'unemotional' they are uninterested in romantic relationships. Autists are less likely than their non-autist peers to receive sex and sexuality education, or an education in sex and social relationships that addresses their needs. Using Amanda Fricker's (2007) analysis of testimonial injustice, I argue that autists are candidates for injustice in their capacity as knowers of their own sexual experiences, and because their testimonies are rarely solicited or granted credibility in sex education, research, or the medical literature. As a result, ignorance or discrediting of different ways of being and doing may conduce to testimonial injustice by means of identity power, credibility deficits on the part of the hearer and prejudicial stereotypes. I conclude that schools need urgently to provide sex and sexuality education that acknowledges autists as sexual beings and acknowledges the existence of alternative sexualities, thereby helping to instate epistemic virtue in educational settings.

AB  - Intercultural dialogue is a process central to creating a just social world. Despite this, people are often prejudiced against it. In order to better understand the nature of this antagonism, the present research investigated the role of Social Dominance Orientation as one potential source of resistance. Across three studies, the direct and mediated impact of SDO on both self-reported and behaviorally-indicated dialogic engagement was assessed. Results provide evidence that increasing levels of SDO encourage ideological beliefs and social evaluations that, in turn, prejudice participants against dialogue with an African-American woman. The significance of these results is discussed, along with suggestions for future research.

AB  - Developing a global mind-set in college students is a goal of many colleges and universities. Most often this goal is met by encouraging students to study abroad. This article explains how a service learning student engagement program at home achieves this goal by pairing Introduction to Sociology students with young immigrant children in a weekly formal mentoring relationship. Research on the program shows that students develop new perspectives about immigrant issues and that students report a reduction of their level of prejudice against immigrants coming from around the globe. Quantitative outcomes assessed on a Likert prejudice scale support service learning participants' reports of lower prejudice levels than those in a control group. This teaching method has significant implications for providing opportunities to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to engage in service learning, achieving global mind-sets at home.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the manifestations of racial and class discrimination that occur with people who experience sickle cell disease. Descriptive study with qualitative approach. The study included 33 people. The analysis corpus consisted of recording the narratives and field observations in the Research Diary. The results showed that the prejudice in health often manifests itself through institutional racism. In the socioeconomic sphere, people who experiencing the grievance often have lower income, partly due to racism itself, and also because of the limitations that illness impose. We showed that the quality of service and infrastructure of health services is directly related to color and social class of users. With this study, we more deeply understand this social phenomenon in health, allowing the development of measures to resolve this situation of violation of human rights. Thus, it is suggested to further studies focusing on the social implications of sickle cell disease, aiming to improve the quality of health services to this population.

AB  - How do schoolchildren respond when they encounter a wheelchair user in a fictional text? This article describes a doctoral project where groups of children were presented with excerpts from books by Hilary McKay and Jacqueline Wilson in which wheelchair users play a significant role. The pupils were asked to discuss issues arising from these readings. The views pupils expressed were relevant, imaginative and positive. Only on two rare occasions did the pupils respond in ways that could be categorised as prejudicial towards disabled people. The article describes the methodology adopted for the study, directly quotes from and explores the views of the pupils. The teaching of children about disability and disabled people currently in the English curriculum for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) is alleged to be inadequate; a weakness which could be addressed in the manner described, using literature for sensitive educational debate. This study is unusual in that the research subjects include a group of children who are motor impaired. The Doctor of Education who conducted the research for her thesis and authored this article is also herself a fulltime wheelchair user.

It also examined whether community motivation to control prejudice and/or explicit HIV prejudice moderates the relationship of implicit prejudice and well-being. Method: Participants were 206 people with HIV living in 42 different communities in New England who completed measures that assessed psychological distress, thriving, and physical well-being. Telephone surveys of 347 residents of these same communities (selected via random digit dialing) were used to assess community explicit HIV prejudice and motivation to control HIV prejudice. These community residents then completed an online measure of implicit prejudice toward people with HIV, the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Results: Multilevel analyses showed that higher community implicit HIV prejudice was associated with greater psychological distress among residents with HIV living in that community. The physical well-being of participants with HIV was negatively related to community implicit HIV prejudice in communities in which residents were unmotivated to control HIV prejudice or had high levels of explicit HIV prejudice. Conclusions: These findings indicate that implicit prejudice of residents of real-world communities may create an environment that may impair the well-being of stigmatized people. Implicit prejudice can therefore be considered an element of macro-level or structural stigma. The discussion considered the possible role of implicit HIV prejudice on a community's social capital as a pathway by which it compromises the well-being of residents with HIV.

AB  - Throughout human evolutionary history, cooperative contact with others has been fundamental for human survival. At the same time, social contact has been a source of threats. In this article, we focus on one particular viable threat, communicable disease, and investigate how motivations to avoid pathogens influence people's propensity to interact and cooperate with others, as measured by individual differences in generalized social trust. While extant studies on pathogen avoidance have argued that such motivations should prompt people to avoid interactions with outgroups specifically, we argue that these motivations should prompt people to avoid others more broadly. Empirically, we utilize two convenience samples and a large nationally representative sample of US citizens to demonstrate the existence of a robust and replicable effect of individual differences in pathogen disgust sensitivity on generalized social trust. We furthermore compare the effects of pathogen disgust sensitivity on generalized social trust and outgroup prejudice and explore whether generalized social trust to some extent constitutes a pathway between pathogen avoidance motivations and prejudice

AB  - Bureaucrats working for executive agencies have been as central to the victories of the LGBT rights movement as judges and legislators. This Article uncovers the history of gay and lesbian family law to establish how the administrative state shaped discourse about homosexuality and made marriage equality litigation possible. In the mid-1980s and early 1990s, states began promulgating bans on gay and lesbian foster and adoptive parenting, prohibitions that civil servants opposed because they did not serve the best interests of children. Instead of implementing the bans, bureaucrats worked to overturn them, limited their application, or defied them in their entirety, thereby nullifying the laws. The actions of bureaucrats not only helped to dispel social prejudices that portrayed gays and lesbians as harmful to children, but also publicly recast gay men and women as parents and community members, which promoted other LGBT rights. With gay and lesbian families becoming increasingly common, the need to protect the interests of children with same-sex parents became a powerful argument in favor of marriage equality. The discursive shift that agency nullification fostered was essential to the fight for marriage rights and demonstrates the power of bureaucrats to effectuate legal change. The history that this Article presents revises existing scholarship on LGBT legal history, which has focused on the ways in which bureaucrats have frustrated rights claims, and contributes to an emerging scholarship on the role of the administrative state in promoting civil rights.

AB  - This article develops an identity performance model of prejudice that highlights the creative influence of prejudice expressions on norms and situations. Definitions of prejudice can promote social change or stability when they are used to achieve social identification, explanation, and mobilization. Tacit or explicit agreement about the nature of prejudice is accomplished collaboratively by persuading others to accept (1) an abstract definition of prejudice, (2) concrete exemplars of prejudice, and (3) associated beliefs about how a target group should be treated. This article reviews three ways in which prejudice can be defined in the cut and thrust of social interaction, namely, by mobilizing hatred and violence, by accusation and denial, and by repression. The struggle for the nature of prejudice determines who can be badly treated and by whom. Studying such ordinary struggles to define what counts (and does not count) as prejudice will allow us to understand how identities are produced, norms are set into motion, and populations are mobilized as social relations are reformulated.

AB  - Recent political events in the United States have created a political climate that promotes prejudice against Middle Eastern, Iranian, and Muslim people. In this study, we were interested in investigating two questions: (1) How welcome do Iranian-American men and women from various religious backgrounds (Muslim, Jewish, or no religious affiliation) feel in their new homeland (specifically, how much social distance (affective distance) do they think their Euro-American neighbors feel toward them? and (2) to what extent does the possession of stereotypical Middle Eastern, Iranian, or Muslim traits (an accent, darker skin, wearing of religious symbols, traditional garb, etc.) spark prejudice and thus Iranian-Americans perception of social distance? Participants were recruited from two very different sources: (1) shoppers at grocery stores in Iranian-American neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and (2) a survey posted on http://Surveymonkey.com. A total of 374 Iranian-Americans, ages 18 and older, completed an in-person or online questionnaire that included the following: a request for demographic information, religious preferences, a survey of how typically Iranian-American the respondents' traits were, and the social distance scale. A surprise was that it was the Iranian-American Jews (not the Muslims), who felt most keenly that Euro-Americans kept them at a distance. Jewish women received higher scores on the social distance scale than did members of any other group. In addition, again, it was mainly Iranian-American Jews, particularly those who spoke with a Middle Eastern accent or wore stereotypically religious symbols, who felt the most social distance existing between them and "typical" Americans.

AB  - Existing theories of prejudice formation focus primarily on the contents of social cognition (stereotypes, emotions) as laying the foundation for interpersonal animus. However, recent studies have revealed that experiential cues associated with the process of social cognition may also fuel prejudice. In particular, fluencythe metacognitive ease or difficulty of processing a stimulushas emerged as an important factor contributing to prejudice. Across diverse operational definitions and at various levels of analysis, fluent processing is associated with positive social evaluations whereas disfluent processing is associated with negative social evaluations. Here, we review this burgeoning literature and highlight continued knowledge gaps to guide the next wave of research on the social consequences of fluency.

AB  - "Linguistic intergroup bias" (LIB) (Maass et al., 2000) was investigated in French elementary schools between children of the French majority group (White children of European heritage) and a French minority group (Black children from Sub-Saharan Africa). Participants (N=360; 7-11-year-old; mean age = 10.36, SD =.85) were shown photographs presenting a target character (ingroup or outgroup) engaging in a positive behavior (e.g., a helping action) or a negative behavior (e.g., an aggressive action). Demonstrations of ingroup favoritism with no outgroup derogation were expected for White children from the majority group. These hypotheses were confirmed. Unexpectedly, the same pattern of results was found for the minority group: ingroup favoritism and no outgroup derogation. Theoretical and applied implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This paper focuses on the moral dimension of everyday lives, using original empirical material about the judgments we make about others to explore and understand the contemporary nature of class prejudice. In doing so, we pay attention to the relationship between class prejudice and other forms of stigma and discrimination by exploring the complex (re)alignment of associations between different social groups (including working class people, disabled people, asylum seekers) in processes of 'othering' and exclusion. The research highlights the potential shared interest of groups who are demonised for being 'in need' to challenge the contemporary hegemony of the individualised ethic of self-interest which is producing a process of de-socialisation in which the importance of values such as care, compassion and social responsibility risk becoming casualties with inevitable consequences for social cohesion. Rather, the paper concludes by arguing for a re-socialisation of politics that recognises the structural causes of inequalities and which values and promotes understandings across, instead of moral judgements of, difference and our social obligations towards each other.

AB  - The broad goal of this study was to examine multiple potential predictors of anti-Black bias among counselors. Specifically, in an online survey of 173 trainees and professionals in mental health, this study used 3 measures related to cultural sensitivity as predictors of therapists' expectancies for bond and prognosis with African American clients compared with White clients. The Multicultural Counseling Inventory (MCI; Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, & Wise, 1994) was used to measure global multicultural competence. The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) served as a measure of automatic prejudice toward Blacks. Additionally, a new self-report measure of anti-Black clinical prejudice was created specifically for this study. The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (Paulhus, 1984) was included to control for socially desirable responding. Each predictor of cultural sensitivity uniquely explained variance in anti-Black bias in bond ratings, with the IAT accounting for more variance than the 2 self-reports. Our novel measure of clinical prejudice accounted for anti-Black bias in prognosis ratings, but the MCI and the IAT did not. Researchers studying cultural competence are encouraged to consider the roles of automatic and deliberate prejudice in determining disparities in clinical expectancies and cross-racial therapeutic alliances.

KW  - SCALE
AB  - Background: Physical activities are important for children and adolescents, especially asthmatics. A significant proportion is considered less active than their non-asthmatic peers and mother's beliefs about asthma are thought to be a determinant factor.
   The research objectives were to investigate whether mothers try to impose limitations on the physical activity (PA) of their asthmatic children/adolescents; identify associated factors; and explore if this attitude has any impact on children's PA levels.
   Methods: In this cross sectional investigation, we studied 115 asthmatics aged between 9 and 19 years and their mothers. Asthma severity, PA level and exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) were evaluated. Mothers were questioned on their beliefs about physical activity in non-asthmatic and asthmatic children, if they imposed restrictions on their children's physical activity, on EIB perception and personal levels of anxiety and depression.
   Results: Ninety six percent of the mothers answered that PA are important for children and adolescents. Despite this, 37% of them admitted imposing restrictions to their children's PA. This attitude was associated with mother's negative opinions about asthmatics doing PA, perception of children's dyspnea after running on a treadmill, mother's anxiety level and children's asthma severity. The mother's restrictive attitudes were not associated with children's lower PA levels.
   Conclusion: A high proportion of the mothers said that they restrained their asthmatic children from engaging in physical activity. This fact should be recognized by health professionals and discussed with parents and caregivers as these negative beliefs may lead to conflicts and prejudiced attitudes that could discourage children's involvement in physical activities and sports.

AB  - Objective: There is concern that diagnostic labels for psychiatric disorders may invoke damaging stigma, especially for children. This study compared parents' stigma toward children with the symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression versus the same symptoms plus a psychiatric label. Methods: Parents (N=225) rated their stereotypes, prejudice, and social distance toward vignettes of children with a developmentally typical range of behaviors, symptoms that met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD or depression, and the same symptoms plus a label of ADHD or depression. Results: Children described as having symptoms only were more stigmatized than children with typical behaviors (d=.97-2.69). Adding a diagnostic label resulted in significant but small increases in stigma (d=.12-.23). Conclusions: Parents highly stigmatized children with psychiatric problems, but adding a diagnostic label made only a small contribution to worsening the stigma. The benefits of seeking psychiatric services accessing treatment and providing validation may outweigh fears of labeling.

AB  - Prejudice is more prevalent among members of the working class than among members of the middle or upper class. It is still a matter of discussion whether education works to suppress prejudice among upper class members or, on the contrary, to enhance genuinely tolerant attitudes. We propose that (i) two indicators of social classincome and educationindependently predict prejudice toward multiple targets as follows: lower levels of income and education are associated with higher levels of prejudice. (ii) The connection between social class and prejudice is explained by the endorsement of system-legitimating ideological attitudes, namely right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). We tested these hypotheses in four studies using cross-sectional surveys in Europe (Studies 1 and 2, Ns=11330 and 2640) and longitudinal data from Germany and Chile (Studies 3 and 4, Ns=343 and 388). Results show that education and income exert independent negative effects on prejudice. The effect of education is stronger than the effect of income, which is not stable across countries. The relationships between income and prejudice and education and prejudice are mediated by RWA and SDO. We conclude that people of the working class generally endorse an ideological configuration that is well suited for legitimating the social system. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) (Frias-Navarro 2009), in terms of confirmation of internal consistency and dimensionality via confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, we set out to validate this scale using the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale Cardenas and Barrientos (The Journal of Sex Research 45(2):140-149, 2008a). Finally, we divided our sample into categories with a view to creating a typology (Egalitarian, Normative opponents, Bigots, and Individual opponents). No research to date has confirmed the hypothesized factor structure of the BCASSFS in Latin American countries. Using data from a convenience sample obtained through the application of a survey of heterosexuals at a university in northern Chile (N = 283), a model of two correlated factors was used and the fit indexes obtained. The results indicate that the BCASSFS is a valid and reliable scale for measuring beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex families in Chile. Moreover, the findings indicated that responses to BCASSFS could be explained by two factors (individual opposition and normative opposition) and that the two factors were correlated. Finally, differences between "egalitarian," "normative opponents," "bigots," and "individual opponents" in the ATLG scale were examined, statistically significant differences being found between groups in the ATL and ATG subscales.

AB  - The study sought to explore whether levels of exposure (as measured by number of years spent abroad and number of countries lived in) predicted levels of prejudice (as measured by the Quick Discrimination Index and the Social Dominance Orientation Scale) in Adult Third Culture Kids (ATCKs), as well as whether there was a significant difference in levels of prejudice between American ATCKs and non-American ATCKs.
   One hundred and ninety-six ATCKs completed a web-based survey including measures of discrimination and social dominance, as well as demographic information. Only number of countries lived in significantly predicted scores on the Affective subscale of the Quick Discrimination Index (QDI). American ATCKs reported significantly higher levels of prejudice than non-American ATCKs on the Cognitive subscale of the QDI and the Social Dominance Orientation scale (SDO). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Discrepancy in quality of health care for patients with diverse backgrounds contributes to health outcome disparities. BSN students reveal surprise regarding the presence of health care disparities. Critical social theory guided this study. The psychometric properties of the Perception of Prejudice in Health Care Scale-Modified (PPHC-M) were evaluated, and the relationship between perceived discrimination in health care delivery and cultural sensitivity awareness was explored. Design: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey of 146 Midwest BSN students was conducted using Cultural Competence Assessment (CCA), PPHC-M, and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Results: PPHC-M demonstrated reliability (alpha = .781.) Cronbach's alphas for General Perception of Prejudice (GPP) and Personal Experience of Prejudice (PEP) were .759 and .756, respectively. Construct validity was supported by contrasted groups. The PPHC was not significantly correlated with the CCA scores. Discussion/Conclusion: PPHC-M shows promise in measuring perceived prejudice in health care.

AB  - This article arises out of research conducted with out-of-school youth in the Shongweni area and explores whom they would involve when making decisions about seeking Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT). Four out-of-school youths, trained as peer researchers, interviewed 32 other out-of-school youths in the Shongweni area of KwaZulu-Natal in order to explore who they talked to about VCT, as well as who they did not. A single method of data collection, structured interviews, was used. Gossip and lack of trust among friends emerged as barriers to youth seeking VCT. As a result, friends were the least likely to be told about or involved in decisions regarding VCT. Somewhat more likely were sex partners, and most likely family members, who were seen as most trustworthy. Even though they were more trusted than friends, partners were not likely to be told VCT results. This revealed high levels of stigma and prejudice which still surrounded HIV/AIDS and VCT in this community. This translated into a lack of trust among friends and suspicions about fidelity in love relationships, which both negatively affected openness about VCT. However, families - in particular mothers - were trusted and involved in decision-making. This highlights a shift in how families are used as sites of coping in the crisis of HIV/AIDS as well as the potential for building on these relationships as a network of support.

AB  - This study identifies the stigma experienced by 12 bereaved parents 2 and 5 years after losing a child in the Sewol ferry disaster in South Korea. Using thematic analysis, we categorized the experience of stigma into two components based on Corrigan and Kosyluk's social cognitive model of stigma: public stigma and self-stigma, and each was analyzed into three types of stigma: stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. We identified four additional factors related to stigma mitigation. The potential implications for characterizing the experiences of bereaved parents, particularly those facing stigma, are discussed in light of these findings in the longitudinal perspective.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the structure of the social network of people living with HIV and AIDS. Method: Exploratory and descriptive research with a qualitative approach, developed through interviews with twenty-two people living with HIV and AIDS, from November to December 2019. For analysis, the theoretical-methodological framework of social network was used. Results: The primary networks were of medium size and low density, formed by family members, relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. The secondary networks were characterized by public, private, third sector institutions, workplaces, and by the informal network, which provided support according to the need for care. Conclusion: The family was considered the center of the primary social network structure; however, weaknesses in these social relationships were evidenced. The family relational context of the person with HIV and AIDS was influenced by the secrecy of the diagnosis due to the fear of prejudice and discrimination for being HIV-positive. There was a predilection for the services of the secondary social network that took on the role of specific care for the disease.

AB  - Social work programmes are expected to enable students to work adequately with sexual minorities. In Switzerland, however, curricular content on sexual minorities is lacking in BSW programmes. Potential sexual prejudice is not explicitly addressed. This study aimed to assess the attitudes towards lesbian women and gay men amongst students entering the BSW programme of a university in Switzerland to establish a basis for discussing curriculum development. Students entering the programme from 2015 through 2018 were surveyed using an online questionnaire. Heterosexist attitudes were captured using the 'Multidimensional Scale of Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men'. The responding 955 entering students reported positive attitudes towards lesbians and gay men and evidenced low levels of heterosexist views. However, only 4.3 per cent of the respondents consistently disagreed with all items expressing heterosexist views, whilst 43.3 per cent completely agreed with at least one item. The views expressed by male participants expressed significantly higher levels of heterosexism than did those of female participants. The findings evidence uncertainties and a lack of reflection on unquestioned but heteronormative views. This reflects a need to infuse BSW programmes with sexual minority content, to provide opportunities for critical reflection and to address heteronormative and heterosexist views.

AB  - This article focuses on a particular group in capitalist society that is disabled, demeaned and denied by capitalism itself, through processes of economic exploitation, systematic and systemic class exclusion, and discrimination/ prejudice-that is-the working class. In doing so I recognise that the working class (defined as all those who sell their/ our labour power) is segmented horizontally into 'layers,' or strata (for example, the dispossessed, unemployed, unskilled, though to the supervisory. managerial level/ stratum) and also vertically, for example, by 'race'and by gender, with particular ethnic groups, and women in general, disabled and oppressed and exploited to a greater degree than their/ our white, male sisters and brothers).
   Analysing from a Classical Marxist perspective I address the structures of the capitalist state through which this exclusion and 'subalternising'is imposed, through formal state structures such as education, media, the panoply of state force and class law, as well as through the material power of the capitalist class, expressed through, for example, wage suppression and enforced immiseration of the majority of the working class.
   In doing so I address two types of neo-Marxist analysis- 'Structuralist neo-Marxism' and 'Culturalist neo-Marxism', and the dialectical relationship between them. They differ on such matters as: the degree of 'relative autonomy' for resistant agency; the relative impact and import of cultural-ideological as against structural- material analysis; and the salience or not of social class analysis, the Capital-Labour relation, vis-a vis other forms of oppression such as 'race; and gender', and their implications for political resistance and organisation at the cultural-ideological level and at the level of power, the material power to reform and revolutionise economic and social relations of Capital.
   I propose an activist programme of resistance at two levels. Firstly, societal level, looking at Marxists such as Marx and Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky and the dialectical relationship between Reform and Revolution.
   Secondly, at the level of Education, both formal and informal (through social movements, political parties, trade unions, through public pedagogy for example). Within the formal education structures, I advance specific proposals regarding schooling and teacher education.
   This is a panoptic paper- the issues above are linked in terms of Classical Marxist analysis of capitalism, class exploitation and oppression, and the implications of such analysis for the praxis and politics of resistance.

AB  - Purpose
   In recent years, design approaches that offer sustainable solutions have been preferred widely. Although these sustainable design approaches provide solutions for physical context, they are not able to solve the problems on psychological side of this situation. These psychological problems have been observed both on adults and children. This research aims to examine the benefits of enabling children who spend their time in built environments to experience nature through Biophilic Design.
   Methodology
   140 children between the ages of 3 and 5 from two different pre-school institutions participated in the study. Participation criteria were to be volunteer, a pre-school student, and accessible. The pictures drawn by the children in reply to the question 'What is nature like?' were analysed by using content analysis and cognitive mapping method. The data obtained from the study were analysed and the results were presented as median, mean values +/- standard deviations (SD), numbers, and percentages. The compliance of the total score to normal distribution according to age and gender independent variables was examined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Non-parametric tests were used in the analysis, p<0.050 was considered statistically significant. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers of the participants.
   Findings
   According to the age groups, the scores of the older age group were found to be significantly higher than the younger age group (p=0.000). When the relationship between total score and gender was examined, no statistically significant difference was found (p=0.074).
   Research Limitations/Implications
   In the study, even though the necessary permissions were obtained to carry out planned studies with preschool students, due to the prejudices of teachers and administrators, the work that was wanted to be carried out with children was made difficult in some cases.
   Originality
   Study originality; in the context of Biophilic Design, is owed to the age range of the chosen focus group, and with the help of this study, the emphasis on what biophilic design can add to the lives of children.

AB  - In the current study we investigated the relationship between ethnic prejudice and resilience and the perception of inclusion of immigrant students among primary and middle school teachers in two different countries (Italy and Spain). Participants were 315 teachers: 75 Catalan women, 25 Catalan men, 202 Italian women, and 13 Italian men. Participants completed the Classical and Modern Racial Prejudice Scale, the Resilience Process Questionnaire, and an ad hoc questionnaire evaluating teachers' perceptions about immigrant students and their inclusive education process. The results showed two different models: The first one, referring to Italian teachers, suggested that the resilience component "return to homeostasis" helps teachers in the creation of positive perceptions and evaluations toward immigrant pupils and their inclusion process. The second model, referring to Catalan teachers, suggested that ethnic prejudice hinders the creation of positive attitudes and evaluations, but the resilience component "reintegration after loss" helps teachers in the creation of positive attitudes. Psychoeducational and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Background: Caste-based prejudice and discrimination are entrenched in all spheres of life in Nepal with pernicious consequences. Education has an important role in eradicating prejudices of all kinds. This study investigates if a Jesuit college in Nepal has been successful in removing caste-based prejudice from its students. It is important to engage in conversations regarding caste-based prejudice, analyze it and find ways to end it because caste-based prejudice and discrimination not only add distress to those who experience them but also negatively impact the education, occupation, economic and health outcomes of a society at large.
   Methods: Using a 24-itme scale this study measured the level of caste-based prejudice prevalent among the students in a Jesuit college in Nepal. The scale was administered in the form of a survey questionnaire that was sent via email to the students in their college-designated personal emails. Using the Likert scale, each item was set to measure disagreement or agreement with seven choices available to the respondents ("strongly disagree", "disagree", "somewhat disagree", "neither agree nor disagree", " somewhat agree", "agree" and "strongly agree"). These responses were then assigned numerical values from 1 to 7, with a high score of 7 corresponding to the strongest agreement to a prejudiced attitude. The total score of each respondent was computed by summing up the individual scores for each of the 24 items. Statements to measure non-prejudiced attitudes were reverse coded so that the strongest acceptance of such a statement produced the lowest numerical value in the total prejudice score. SPSS version 21 was used for statistical analysis of the data.
   Results: The overall prejudice level was found to be low (M = 58.46, SD = 12.73, N =950). There were no significant variances in the prejudice scores with respect to the gender, caste, religion, family, region and school of the respondents. Moreover, the education level of the parents made little difference as far as the variances in the mean scores of the prejudice level of the respondents were concerned.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the goal of Jesuit education in removing caste-based prejudices among the students is being met in Nepal and that caste-based prejudice and discrimination are on the decline in Nepali society at large. However, further research needs to be undertaken to confirm that the reported low score is indeed due to the impact of activities specifically geared to reduce the caste-based prejudice among its students by the college. Additional investigations are necessary to ascertain that the low level of caste- based prejudice reported does indeed translate into non- casteist behaviors.

AB  - Synthetic drug use (SDU) is on the rise in China. Utilizing a grounded three-level social-ecological theoretical model, we aim to better understand how users, medical professionals, and other community gatekeepers perceive the causes and consequences of synthetic drug use in Kunming, China. Past work typically relies on drug users confined to rehabilitation facilities. Utilizing qualitative methods, our work integrates how various community actors perceive problems around synthetic drug use. Thirty face-to-face interviews were conducted in Kunming that were audio-recorded and transcribed. We identify emergent personal, interpersonal and societal level themes shaping SDU which provided our grounded theoretical model. Regardless of their social position, informants identified curiosity, peer networks that facilitated exposure, and the communality of sharing the drug experience as reasons to try synthetic drugs. Drug users reported negative consequences of SDU including the inability to sleep, a fear that others might discover one was using, and the difficulty of quitting. Medical professionals and others in the community were more likely to identify potential harms of SDU. Still, these community members felt synthetic drugs were less problematic than traditional drugs and reported less prejudice and stigma about these new drugs. Overall, medical professionals felt ill-prepared to deal with this new epidemic.

AB  - Mounting reports in the media suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified prejudice and discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asians. Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well.

AB  - To what extent did U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward various European ancestry groups affect European immigrants' residential segregation in the early twentieth century? Surprisingly, this question has not been directly addressed, even though it is well known that, at the time, U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward different racial/ethnic groups, documented by Emory Bogardus's famous 1926 survey, were key features of a boundary separating whites into two divisions: (1) those of Southern, Central, and Eastern European ancestry, and (2) those of Northern and Western European ancestry. The present study finds that variation in natives' expressed desires for social distance from different European ancestry groups was a decisive factor in European immigrant groups' residential segregation from the native-born U.S. population, independently of the immigrant groups' formal schooling and monetary assets. The results bolster claims in the residential segregation literature that majority-group prejudice plays a central role in minority groups' spatial distance from the majority group, net of any socioeconomic inequalities.

AB  - What mitigates the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants? Addressing this question, we explored how national identification, endorsing binding moral foundations and the perception of threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants in Malta. It was hypothesized that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more prone to identify with being Maltese and more probable to endorse binding moral foundations and perceive high threat from migrants, leading to a more prejudiced attitude towards migrants living in Malta. Two hundred and twenty-two individuals participated in this quantitative study. Results from this study showed that national identification, binding moral foundations and perceived threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants. The implications of the findings for theories about how need for cognitive closure contributes to increased prejudiced attitude in native population is discussed.

AB  - This research investigated the effectiveness of a forgiveness education program on reducing anger and ethnic prejudice and improving forgiveness in Iranian adolescents. There were 224 (Persian, Azeri, and Kurdish) male and female students in 8th grade who were selected from 3 provinces: Tehran, Eastern Azerbaijan. and Kurdestan. Schools were randomly assigned to 2 groups of experimental (N = 123) and control (N = 101) students. Measures included the Enright Forgiveness Inventory, Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Ethnic Prejudice Scale, administered at pretest. posttest, and follow-up. The experimental group had forgiveness education by classroom teachers. The results indicated that the experimental group was higher in forgiveness and lower in ethnic prejudice, state anger, trait anger, and anger expression compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant in the follow-up phase. It seems that forgiveness education in schools can be an important means of reducing anger and ethnic prejudice.

AB  - Using the two-dimensional model of prejudice as a theoretical framework, we examined the geographic distribution of prejudice toward African Americans in the United States (N = 10,522). We found the East South Central, West South Central, and South Atlantic regions were associated with modern racism, principled conservatism characterized the Mountain region, aversive racism was prevalent in the East North Central region, and finally, low in prejudice was found in the Pacific, West North Central, Mid Atlantic, and New England regions. Additional analyses on political conservatism, social conservatism, and egalitarianism generally supported the distinctions between prejudice types made by the two-dimensional model. We believe mapping regional prejudice may have implications for testing theoretical differences between distinct types of prejudice as well as for implementing prejudice reduction strategies.

AB  - This study focuses on the reduction of prejudice toward foreign unaccompanied minors (UAMs) by means of audiovisual testimonial messages. Specifically, it analyzes the role of two narrative elements that can influence, in an indirect way, the intention to share the message, the feelings toward UAMs, the intention to approach UAMs, and the intention to collaborate with an NGO that provides support to immigrants. With this goal in mind, an experimental study (N = 500) was conducted using a 2 x 2 factorial design, where the factors analyzed were similarity in terms of social identity (high vs. low) and narrative voice (first-person vs. third-person). No interaction effects of similarity and narrative voice on identification or transportation were observed. However, multiple serial mediation analyses were statistically significant. A significant indirect effect of similarity on dependent variables was observed through perceived similarity (primary mediator), identification and transportation (secondary mediators), and counterarguing and reactance (tertiary mediators). Similarly, the narrative voice also had a significant indirect effect on the dependent variables that was explained by the increase in identification and transportation, and by the reduction in counterarguing and reactance. This work improves the understanding of the mechanisms that explain the impact of narratives and demonstrates that certain narrative elements can increase the effectiveness of audiovisual testimonial messages designed for the prevention of racism and xenophobia.

KW  - value of capitals
KW  - school choice
AB  - This paper illustrates the influence of a new national assignment system (NSAS) on Chilean middle-class advantage. This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission "rules" that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu's conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families' advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes.

AB  - Internal and external motivation to respond without prejudice scale (IEMS) provides a self-report tool sensitive to individual tendencies to control implicit and explicit prejudice without directly inquiring about attitudes toward an outgroup. The current study verified the scale's psychometric properties and construct validity on a Slovak sample. In line with the predictions, the principal component analysis suggested, and confirmatory factor analysis validated the presence of two uncorrelated factors of internal and external motivation. Additionally, while internal motivation was positively associated with adherence to egalitarianism and negatively with authoritarianism, external motivation did not demonstrate any of these relationships. Furthermore, only external motivation was found to be positively related to expressive self-control that parallels propositions claiming greater self-regulatory demands when egalitarian norms are followed to avoid social disapproval. Finally, both factors were positively correlated with concerns from appearing prejudiced, although internal motivation in a significantly greater degree, reflecting larger dependency on self-oriented concerns. With appropriate values of internal consistency for both factors, the IEMS scale provides a reliable self-report measure that might be used for systematic control of individual differences in the research of social cognition in intergroup context.

AB  - Drawing on 34 interviews with Chinese visitors to North Korea, this paper adopts the social contact theory to examine their attitude change through tourism. The paper first examines how Chinese tourists imagine North Korea as a tourism destination prior to their visits. Then the paper focuses on both the regulated and agentive dimensions involved in their travel, asking how individual Chinese tourist negotiates with the externally imposed restrictions to obtain more tourist-host contact. Third, it identifies both positive and negative post-trip attitude changes. In doing so, the paper creates a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of tourism conducted between China and North Korea which are perceived as "friendly" neighbors with conflicts. Apart from offering empirical and policy implications, this paper extends the use of intergroup social contact theory by focusing on a destination with restrictions on tourist-host contact.

AB  - Psoriasis patients experience negative attitudes and behaviors exhibited by people who have insufficient knowledge about psoriasis. In this study, the knowledge level of the society about psoriasis; people's attitudes toward such patients were investigated. A questionnaire that investigates the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to psoriasis according to age, gender, and education levels was applied to the participants. About a quarter of participants in the study did not have any knowledge about psoriasis, 22.9% participants who thought that they knew about psoriasis believed that psoriasis was an infectious disease, 34.2% indicated that they were afraid of shaking hands with patients who had psoriasis, 45.4% did not wish to eat any food prepared by such patients, and 13.4% did not want to work with them in the same workplace. Female participants were more concerned that psoriasis was contagious (P= .030) than male participants, and they were more concerned about shaking hands (P= .022) and eating food prepared by psoriasis patients (P= .009). Both the psoriasis is little known and the level of knowledge of the participants who think they have knowledge about psoriasis was insufficient and prejudiced attitudes and behaviors are common in patients with psoriasis.

AB  - Collective rituals serve social functions for the groups that perform them, including identifying group members and signalling group commitment. A novel social group paradigm was used in an afterschool programme (N= 60 4-11-year-olds) to test the influence of participating in a ritual task on in-group displays and out-group monitoring over repeated exposures to the group. The results demonstrate that ritual participation increases in-group displays (i.e. time spent displaying materials to in-group members) and out-group monitoring (i.e. time spent looking at out-group members) compared with a control task across three time points. This study provides evidence for the processes by which rituals may influence children's behaviours towards in- and out-group members and discusses implications for understanding the development of ritual cognition and behaviour. This article is part of the theme issue 'Ritual renaissance: new insights into the most human of behaviours'.

AB  - The March 15th terrorist attack started a national dialogue about prejudice in New Zealand. Previous research has investigated attitudes towards Muslims in comparison to ethnic minorities. However, presently, there are no nationally representative studies in New Zealand systematically comparing attitudes to Muslims with attitudes to other religious groups. Here, we present evidence from the New Zealand edition of the International Social Survey Programme module on religion, a national postal survey (N=1335) collected between September 2018 and February 2019. We assess perceived threat and negativity towards Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and Atheists. We find substantially greater perceived threat and negativity towards Muslims compared with other groups. In particular, older people, New Zealand Europeans, men, and those with more right-wing attitudes report greater threat and negativity towards Muslims. In line with previous studies, higher religious identification and higher education predict greater acceptance. Taken collectively, these results reveal that the Muslim Acceptance Gap in this country is substantial, and greater challenges for acceptance are evident among lower-educated, right-wing, older, secular, and male populations. The magnitude of this gap reveals a substantial challenge to the future of New Zealand where religious and secular people can live without evoking prejudice.

AB  - Homosexual men are constantly exposed to prejudice and violence in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between minority stress, parenting styles, and indicators of mental health problems in a sample of homosexual men. Method: quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational, and retrospective design. Participants were 101 Brazilian men who selfidentified as homosexuals, aged between 18 and 55 years. Results: concealing sexual identity was a predictor of depression and stress. Parental responsiveness was associated with a lower incidence of enacted stigma and depression. Conclusions: the mental health of homosexual men can be negatively affected by the need to conceal their sexual orientation. Parental responsiveness is a protective factor in terms of experiencing enacted stigma and depression. The results found in the study may be useful for counselors and social workers who are working with LGBT people and their families.

AB  - In five experiments, we examined the stereotypes, emotions, and behavioural intentions associated with a Spanish working-class group, known aschonis. We described a student (Experiments 1-3) or job candidate (Experiments 4-5) and presented participants with a picture showing a woman characterized either aschonior posh (an upper-class group, Experiments 2-4) or with no picture (Experiments 1, 3-5). Depending on the condition, explicit information about her high social class (Experiment 1), performance (Experiment 3), or category (Experiment 5) was provided. Participants evaluated the candidate more negatively, felt less admiration, and were less willing to interact with her or to recommend her for a job when she was categorized aschonias compared to the other categories. These effects disappeared if the student/candidate had high socioeconomic status or performed excellently in the academic domain, but they were magnified for highly (vs. weakly) materialistic individuals. Class prejudice apparently has harmful effects on disadvantaged individuals, but can be mitigated by explicit information.

AB  - This study examined preschoolers' social inclusion-the active involvement of new partners into social interactions-in different intergroup contexts. Using an interactive paradigm, 3- to 5-year-old German children played a ball-tossing game with 2 puppets in which 1 puppet initiated the game with the child and another approached the game. In Study 1 (N = 144), the initiator was from an ingroup while an outgroup puppet approached the game (ingroup/outgroup condition) or the child and the 2 puppets did not have any group membership (control condition). Social inclusion was assessed by analyzing whether and how children included the approaching puppet into the game. Results revealed that children were more inclusive with increasing age. Across age, children were less willing to include the approaching puppet in the intergroup context as compared to the control context. To further investigate whether the difference between conditions was driven by a preference for the ingroup or a derogation of the outgroup, a second study (N = 72) was conducted. Here, the initiating puppet was neutral (i.e., no group membership) and the approaching puppet was from an outgroup (neutral/outgroup condition). In this condition, social inclusion was in between the 2 conditions of Study 1. Further, the developmental trajectory found in Study 1 could be replicated in Study 2 such that children were more likely to include the approaching puppet with increasing age. These results suggest that children's willingness to include others increases over preschool age and is influenced by both ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.

AB  - Background: People identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) have been shown to experience more trauma and poorer mental health than their heterosexual counterparts, particularly in countries with discriminatory laws and policies. Northern Ireland is a post-conflict region with high rates of trauma and mental health problems, as well as significant levels of prejudice against the LGB community. To date, no studies in Northern Ireland have compared trauma exposure, social support and mental health status of LGB students to their heterosexual peers. Objective: The present study aimed to assess whether LGB status was associated with more trauma exposure and poorer mental health, and whether social support mediated these associations. Method: The sample was comprised of 1,116 university students. Eighty-nine percent (n = 993) identified as heterosexual and 11% (n = 123) identified as LGB. Path analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Results: LGB status was significantly associated with increased trauma exposure and with symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety, but not with problematic alcohol use. These associations were mediated by social support from family only. Conclusions: These results evidence vulnerabilities among Northern Irish students identifying as LGB in relation to trauma and mental health compared with their heterosexual peers. However, social support from family has the potential to mitigate risk. Educational initiatives should raise awareness of the importance of familial support for LGB youth, and those young people who lack family support should be considered an at-risk group, warranting particularly intensive targeting by relevant supports.

AB  - Objective: to understand the experience of families about school experiences of children and adolescents with visual impairment. Method: a qualitative study developed through the Symbolic Interactionism and narrative research. Data were collected through a semi-structured recorded interview, with eleven families of children/adolescents with visual impairment, totaling 40 participants. Results: two phenomena emerged: "exclusion context" and "impaired school performance". Prejudice experienced at school brings devastating consequences to the life of the visually impaired child/adolescent and his family. Isolation occurs, difficulty adapting to the support resource and deficits in school performance. Final considerations: production contributes to awakening professionals involved with the assistance of these people. Effective participation of health professionals in this area is required to develop actions with students, teachers and families, aimed at meeting the needs of learning and health promotion, inclusion, and respect for differences.

AB  - This cross-sectional research investigates the individual (i.e., sexual prejudice, contact with lesbian and gay [LG] people, and perceived seriousness of homophobic epithets) and contextual (i.e., homophobic bullying observed by school staff and perceived colleague reactions to homophobic bullying) factors as predictors of school staff intervention against vs. legitimization of homophobic bullying. Data were collected in secondary schools in the North of Italy via a paper-and-pencil survey. Participants were school staff members (N=273) from 24 Italian secondary schools. The results have indicated that the higher the sexual prejudice and the lower the contact with LG individuals, the higher the legitimization of homophobic bullying. Also, perceiving colleagues as legitimizing or intervening in cases of homophobic bullying predicted similar reactions on the part of school staff participants. The findings are discussed with respect to the current literature regarding homophobic bullying, and applied interventions for school staff training programs to tackle homophobic bullying at school are put forward.

AB  - Male nursing students may experience social prejudice, which may lead to psychological distress. However, few quantitative studies have focused on their mental health. This study aimed to explore the relationship among self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress in male nursing students, and compare differences in self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress, as well as the relationships among these variables between male nursing students who selected nursing as their first choice for a major and those who did not. A survey based on a cross-sectional design was used. Self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress of 460 male nursing students in China were measured using the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, a self-developed questionnaire, and the Kessler 10, respectively. Structural equation modeling was adopted to test the theoretical model regarding the relationships among self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress. The results indicated that 82.2% of the participants reported psychological distress. The participants who did not select nursing as their first choice for a major reported a significantly higher perceived prejudice, higher prevalence of psychological distress, and lower self-esteem. Therefore, when selecting male students, nursing schools must prioritize those who selected nursing as their first choice for a major.

AB  - This article examines a group of Chinese students? diverse participation in teacher?student interactions involving gender and sexuality topics in ESL classrooms in the UK. The findings indicate that the Chinese students have experienced transformations of the performance of gender. Some students strategically incorporate new gender performances in ESL classrooms that they find useful for social and academic gains. However, when facing new gender performances which are undesirable or stereotyped, some students display a strong sense of agency and resistance, even at a price of sacrificing opportunities of engaging in classroom discussions. The intersection of gender and sexuality in the ESL classroom interaction offers Chinese students the opportunities to explore a variety of progressive and non-progressive gender and sexual roles that men and women occupy in Britain. But some ill-prepared ESL teachers deal with issues of gender and sexuality with prejudicial heterosexist or homophobic attitudes, which may mislead students and have a negative impact on their learning and gender and sexual identity construction.

AB  - The ecological theory of social perception suggests that people's first impressions should be especially accurate for judgments relevant to their goals. Here, we tested whether people could accurately judge others' levels of antigay prejudice and whether gay men's accuracy would exceed straight men's accuracy in making these judgments. We found that people judged men's (but not women's) levels of antigay prejudice accurately from photos of their faces and that impressions of facial power supported their judgments. Gay men and straight men did not significantly differ in their sensitivity to antigay prejudice, however. People may therefore judge others' levels of prejudice accurately regardless of their personal stake in its consequences.

AB  - Public stigma surrounding HIV is related to heightened emotional distress, poor psychological functioning, and reduced subjective well-being in people living with HIV. For men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV, they may also face stigmatizing attitudes within the gay community, which create an additional burden to their health. Grounded in the psychological mediation framework, the present study examined the underlying psychological processes through which HIV stigma from the public and within the gay community influences the mental and social health of MSM living with HIV. Findings from 206 Chinese MSM living with HIV in Hong Kong indicated that negative self-concept, maladaptive coping, and peer isolation mediated the effect of HIV stigma on mental and social health. The study revealed the cognitive, regulatory, and interpersonal processes underlying HIV stigma and health. Feeling intense HIV stigma from the public and within the gay community may render MSM living with HIV more vulnerable to negative self-concept, maladaptive coping, and peer isolation, which contribute to poor mental and social health. To combat prejudice and discrimination against people living HIV, stigma reduction initiatives should be implemented not only in the public, but also in the gay community. Cognitive-behavioral interventions can also be used to restructure negative self-beliefs and build adaptive emotion regulation skills, which can improve stigma-related health outcomes among MSM living with HIV.

AB  - This article meta-analyses the available data on attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers, with the aim of estimating effect sizes for the relationships between these attitudes and prejudice-relevant correlates. Seventy studies (N-total = 13,720) were located using systematic database searches and calls for unpublished data. In the case of demographic factors, being male, religious, nationally identified, politically conservative, and less educated were associated with negative attitudes (Fisher's zs = 0.11, 0.17, 0.18, 0.21, and -0.16, respectively). For ideological factors, increases in right-wing authoritarianism and social-dominance orientations correlated with negative attitudes, while the endorsement of macro (but not micro) justice principles were associated with positive attitudes (Fisher's zs = 0.50, 0.50, 0.29, and 0.00, respectively). Perceptions of refugees as symbolic and realistic threats were the strongest correlates of negative attitudes (Fisher's zs = 0.98 and 1.11, respectively). These findings have contributed to the growing body of knowledge that endeavors to understand the antecedents of refugee-specific prejudice, and are discussed in light of the global refugee crisis.

AB  - Using Contact Theory as a lens, this article presents the results of a case-based study in Norway on language cafes and integration. The methodology includes participant observation and questionnaires for both the programmes' participants and volunteers. The results show that the programming reduces intergroup prejudice by fostering the following four processes: learning about the out-group, changing behaviour, generating affective ties, and in-group reappraisal, as well as offering a high degree of friendship potential. Thus, the programming supports the expansion of social networks across intercultural lines and, thereby, facilitates integration.

The quantitative results indicated that the participants in two service groups (i.e. for at-risk adolescents and adolescents with cerebral palsy) demonstrated a more significant promotion of social justice beliefs than their peers in non-service group. A qualitative analysis provided evidence of the mechanism underlying service-learning, as well as different service experiences affecting on students' social justice beliefs. Finally, the implications for implementing service-learning and realizing social justice goals in China were discussed.

The research was based on the application of a questionnaire and an interview to teachers teaching Roma students in schools. The results of the survey and interview highlights important issues related to the discrimination of Roma students from both students and teachers. In addition, the responding teachers offer timely attempts to prevent and manage different types of discrimination against Roma students. The main ways of manifesting inequalities in Roma students, as teachers perceive, are the prejudices related to the social status of the Roma, the financial situation, as well as their isolation in communities far from the Romanian pupils. The article presents examples of good practices on preventing and managing discrimination situations for Roma students at school level.

AB  - Intergroup contact theory suggests that developing a close relationship with outgroup members ameliorates the negative impact of prejudice that individuals perceive from outgroup members. This article specifically investigates the moderating role of cross-ethnic self-disclosure in the link between international students' perceived ethnic/racial prejudice and depression as well as loneliness. One hundred and forty-three international students in Japan were asked to rate their perceived prejudice, depression, and loneliness as well as their self-disclosure to host nationals. The results showed that self-disclosure buffers the negative effects of prejudice on depression and loneliness such that international students who were more likely to disclose themselves to host nationals were less likely to be influenced by prejudice. Theoretical and practical contributions are considered.

AB  - The peer review system is a core tenet of scientific publishing, and has been studied throughout the years. Recent discussions on judgment and evaluation biases have highlighted the importance of priming effects on those processes. We have conducted two experiments with evaluation tasks (a scientific article evaluation, with professors and PhD students as participants, and a chocolate tasting, with undergraduates) in which they were exposed to a footnote acknowledging financial support from a fictional agency. In one condition, the agency's name was associated with the African continent, while in another condition, it was associated with the European continent. There were statistically significant differences in judgments on both tests, with individuals on the European condition giving better evaluations of the article and the chocolate, even though the stimuli were subtle enough not to be remembered by 92.5 % of all participants. We also found evidence of a moderating effect of academic experience on the priming process.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth experience disproportionate rates of bullying compared to their heterosexual peers. Schools are well-positioned to address these disparities by creating supportive school climates for LGBT youth, but more research is needed to examine the variety of practices and professional development opportunities put in place to this end. The current study examines how school practices to create supportive LGBT student climate relate to student reports of bullying. Student-level data come from the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey, a state-wide survey of risk and protective factors. Ninth and eleventh grade students (N = 31,183) reported on frequency of physical and relational bullying victimization and perpetration and sexual orientation-based harassment. School administrators reported on six practices related to creating supportive LGBT school climate (N = 103 schools): having a point person for LGBT student issues, displaying sexual orientation-specific content, having a gay-straight alliance, discussing bullying based on sexual orientation, and providing professional development around LGBT inclusion and LGBT student issues. An index was created to indicate how many practices each school used (M = 2.45; SD = 1.76). Multilevel logistic regressions indicated that students attending schools with more supportive LGBT climates reported lower odds of relational bullying victimization, physical bullying perpetration, and sexual orientation-based harassment compared to students in schools with less supportive LGBT climates. Sexual orientation did not moderate these relations, indicating that LGBT-supportive practices may be protective for all students, regardless of their sexual orientation. Findings support school-wide efforts to create supportive climates for LGBQ youth as part of a larger bullying prevention strategy.

AB  - Differential treatment of students by race is well documented, and potentially driven by implicit processes relating to racial prejudice. To better understand some of the pathways by which racial prejudice may be activated, we examined preservice teachers' racialized perceptions specific to emotion. Forty preservice teachers identified the emotions expressed in 20 Black and White male and female faces in order to assess racialized emotion accuracy and anger bias; participants also judged hostility in videos of 4 Black and White boys' misbehaviors with peers in school in order to assess racialized attributions. We conducted a series of multilevel models with assessments of Black and White faces (or boys) nested within preservice teachers. Results indicated that emotions in Black faces were less accurately recognized than emotions in White faces; Black faces were more likely to be seen as angry even when they were not, compared to White faces; and boys' misbehaviors were perceived as more hostile than those of White boys. Together, these results consistently suggest that racialized emotion-related perceptions may enter the classroom with preservice teachers. Implications, as well as limitations that may be resolved in future studies, and extensions of these findings to other minority status populations are discussed.

AB  - Three studies were conducted to determine whether outgroups were dehumanized through animalization since childhood. Using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), in Study 1 we found faster reaction times in the compatible condition (ingroup names and human words, outgroup names and animal words), compared with the incompatible condition (ingroup names and animal words, outgroup names and human words). In Study 2, we used a paper-and-pencil design and found that the association between animal-related words and outgroups was more prevalent in comparison to ingroups. The participants of Study 3 selected a larger number of animal-related words to describe the outgroups than their own groups. Results revealed that the tendency to animalize is a process that begins during early childhood.

AB  - There are well-known correlations between low cognitive ability and support of prejudicial or non-egalitarian attitudes. This paper adds to existing knowledge by providing the first analyses of the associations between cognitive ability and attitudes towards LGBT issues in a non-US sample (Australia), comparing these across three measures of cognitive ability, and examining the separate, joint and interactive effects of education and cognitive ability. Findings from a high-quality, national Australian dataset (n= 11,564) indicate that individuals with low cognitive ability are less likely to support equal rights for same-sex couples. This pattern holds in the presence of confounds, is consistent across measures of ability, and is more pronounced for verbal ability. Education and cognitive ability affect attitudes through similar channels, but retain independent effects.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the ethnic classroom composition and interethnic attitudes of adolescents of the native majority and several ethnic minorities in the Netherlands, Germany, England and Sweden. It contributes to prior research by examining the underlying theoretical features of contact opportunities and levels of threat across multiple ethnic groups more accurately, using group-specific measures. Based on Intergroup Contact Theory and Ethnic Group Conflict Theory, contrasting hypotheses on how the ethnic classroom composition affects out-group and in-group attitudes of adolescents are tested with multilevel regression analyses. Across ethnic groups and countries, we consistently find a moderate to substantial relation between ethnic classroom composition and interethnic attitudes in line with Intergroup Contact Theory: a relatively larger out-group size, compared to the in-group, relates positively to out-group attitudes. At the same time, in several cases, a relatively larger in-group size relates to more positive in-group attitudes. The findings point to the significance of balanced ethnic classroom compositions for promoting favourable attitudes between multiple ethnic groups - benefitting especially those who face high levels of prejudice from others and those who are prejudiced towards others - without compromising positive in-group attitudes.

AB  - Objective. To analyze commercial sex work's social representations among Brazilian women who identify as transvestite or transsexual. Methods: A qualitative study with a descriptive and analytical approach based on the Theoretical Paradigm of Social Representation with a structural approach. The sample group was formed by 100 women who defined themselves as transvestite and transsexual in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The data was gathered from September to December 2016 via a questionnaire using the technique of free association of words, as well as semi-directed interviews. Results: Through both prototypical and content analysis, it was confirmed that the most likely elements that formed the core of the social representation were: violence, drugs, risk, work, sadness, prejudice, and danger. In the objectification/objectivation process of commercial sex work, the image shows a mix between daily activities in the streets - which they consider to be their battlefield - and their own feelings and experiences of vulnerability in other areas of society, starting with families, churches, schools and the like. Conclusions: By experiencing commercial sex work, female transvestite and transsexual individuals reveal how the elements that form the social representation are of paramount importance in the legitimation, legalization, and simplification of their identities.

AB  - There is a growing social work literature about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older people. However, research and guidance are predominantly based on the experiences of older gay men and, to a lesser extent, older lesbians. There is little to help practitioners work with older bisexual people. The Looking Both Ways study aimed to contribute to this gap in knowledge. We undertook in-depth purposely sampled qualitative interviews with 12 people aged over 50, all of whom have bisexual relationship histories and half of whom also currently identify as bisexual. There were three main findings. First, biphobia (prejudice against bisexual people) impacts on older people with bisexual histories in ways that may affect their well-being in later life. Second, concerns around receiving care are similar in some ways and different in others from the concerns of lesbians and gay men. Third, people with bisexual relationship histories may have developed strong support networks and resilience, factors that may be very beneficial in later life. Three recommendations for social work professionals were identified: 1) understand biphobia, 2) recognize the legitimacy of concerns about receiving care, and 3) ask about support networks rather than assuming family support.

AB  - This paper explores how working on a faculty-led research project influenced the views of Master of Social Work students concerning unauthorized immigrants. Five graduate assistants worked for one year with two faculty members and one doctoral student to code data from interviews with social workers at immigrant-serving organizations in South Carolina. The master's students then reflected on what they learned from participating in data analysis tasks, indicating that the experience had further sensitized them to the social justice concerns confronting unauthorized immigrants. Drawing on social contact theory, we argue that student participation in faculty-led research can provide a form of indirect social exposure to other groups, which reduce bias, and suggest that such experiences be included in how educators conceptualize the implicit curriculum in schools of social work.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that bisexual people are sometimes evaluated more negatively than heterosexual and gay/lesbian people. A common theoretical account for this discrepancy argues that bisexuality is perceived by some as introducing ambiguity into a binary model of sexuality. The present brief report tests a single key prediction of this theory, that evaluations of bisexual people have a unique relationship with Need for Closure (NFC), a dispositional preference for simple ways of structuring information. Participants (n = 3406) were heterosexual medical students from a stratified random sample of 49 U.S. medical schools. As in prior research, bisexual targets were evaluated slightly more negatively than gay/lesbian targets overall. More importantly for the present investigation, higher levels of NFC predicted negative evaluations of bisexual people after accounting for negative evaluations of gay/lesbian people, and higher levels of NFC also predicted an explicit evaluative preference for gay/lesbian people over bisexual people. These results suggest that differences in evaluations of sexual minority groups partially reflect different psychological processes, and that NFC may have a special relevance for bisexual targets even beyond its general association with prejudice. The practical value of testing this theory on new physicians is also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n=1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n=21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.

AB  - Growth is the single most important indication of the health of a child. Identification of growth disorders in all children is crucial as growth failure can be the first sign of a number of acute and chronic conditions. However, gender and racial biases have resulted in inequities in the identification, referral and treatment of children with growth disorders. In addition, short children have been impacted by a number of psychosocial issues. Heightism is prejudice or discrimination against individuals based on height, and refers to discrimination against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range. Studies have shown that short children have been affected by juvenilization, teasing, bullying, victimization, loss of independence/overprotection, and exclusion. The role of the advanced practice nurse is critical in addressing heightism and racial and gender disparities in children with growth failure/short stature.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals have begun to gain an acceptance that transgender people have yet to achieve. Previous literature has found the significant effect of Allport's contact hypothesis on reducing negative attitudes toward LGB individuals. Attention has recently turned to the implications of social contact for reduction of transphobic attitudes, with one study demonstrating efficacy. The present study examined the relationships between cisgender heterosexual college students' social contact with transgender individuals, operationalized as number of friendships, and self-reported attitudes and behavioral intentions toward transgender individuals. A sample of 342 undergraduate students at a mid-sized public university completed questions about attitudes and behaviors toward transgender individuals and their transgender friendship experiences. In multivariate analysis of variance, significant differences between participants who reported having zero versus at least one transgender friend across negative intentions, negative attitudes, positive intentions and views, and supportive public intentions toward transgender individuals were found, supporting the contact hypothesis. These findings suggest that having friendships with transgender individuals is associated with reduced prejudice and discrimination and, moreover, greater acceptance and support of transgender people. Implications for increasing acceptance of transgender individuals are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines research findings from an experiential model of interfaith education called the Building Bridges through Interfaith Dialogue in Schools Programme (BBP). The BBP has been operating continuously in Melbourne, Australia since 2004. In the research, participating students were interviewed and surveyed to assess the effect of this experiential interfaith education programme on their knowledge, attitudes, perspectives and behaviour toward those from different religious and cultural backgrounds to them. Some of the data from those interviews are included in this article. The findings identify that the programme promoted religious literacy, (including improved knowledge, understanding and appreciation for different religious and cultural traditions and their practices), dismantled prejudice from ignorance and overly generalised stereotypes of others, and promoted social inclusion and cohesion.

AB  - In the current study, I tested a gender-moderated process model to explain when members of one relatively privileged group are oriented toward collective action for the rights of a relatively disadvantaged group. My model integrated three factorsgender, collective guilt, and close cross-group friendshipsto explain collective action. I expected that among women collective guilt would not directly increase collective action, but having more close friendships with members of a disadvantaged group, an other-focused experience, would override the self-focused experience of collective guilt, and redirect guilt toward collective action. I tested the predictions in the context of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) rights. The sample of 85 undergraduates who self-identified as straight was racially diverse and ranged from 17 to 41 years old. Participants reported collective guilt, the extent of close friendships with people who are LGB, and their willingness to engage in collective action for LGB rights. Among women who are straight, but not among straight men, close cross-group friendships mediated the relation between collective guilt and collective action. I discuss the moderating role of gender, implications for research, and limitations. I suggest that winning the hearts and minds of the relatively privileged in support of social change may require that activists and policy makers understand the psychological relationships those individuals have with the members of disadvantaged groups.

AB  - Two recent experiments found evidence for what we term the social category label (SCL) effect-that the relationship between right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and prejudice against gay men and lesbians can be reduced or even eliminated when the target group is labeled "gay men and lesbians" rather than "homosexuals" (Rios, 2013). Although this appears a promising approach to reduce self-reported sexual prejudice, with both theoretical implications for the meaning of RWA itself and practical implications for question wording for assessing these attitudes, there are several reasons to further examine these findings, including (a) inconsistencies with extant evidence, (b) small sample sizes in the original 2 experiments, and (c) concerns with the RWA measures used in the 2 experiments. We tested the SCL hypothesis with a nationally representative sample (Study 1) and close and conceptual replications of Rios' (2013) 2 studies (Studies 2-5) using multiple measures of RWA and prejudice. Across 23 tests of the SCL hypothesis, we obtained 1 statistically significant and 1 marginally significant effect consistent with the hypothesis, 2 significant effects opposite the hypothesis, and 19 nonsignificant effects. A meta-analysis of evidence reported here and in Rios (2013) indicates that RWA strongly predicts antigay prejudice, with no significant variation by label. This confirms the typically robust association between RWA and antigay prejudice and confirms that the SCL effect is not robust. We discuss potential limitations of these studies, theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for our failures to replicate the original SCL studies, and future directions for examining social category label effects.

AB  - Some past work indicates that sexual minorities may experience impairments in social health, or the perceived and actual availability and quality of one's social relationships, relative to heterosexuals; however, research has been limited in many ways. Furthermore, it is important to investigate etiological factors that may be associated with these disparities, such as self-reported discrimination The current work tested whether sexual minority adults in the United States reported less positive social health (i.e., loneliness, friendship strain, familial strain, and social capital) relative to heterosexuals and whether self reported discrimination accounted for these disparities. Participants for the current study (N= 579) were recruited via Amazon' s Mechanical Turk, including 365 self-identified heterosexuals (105 women) and 214 sexual minorities (103 women). Consistent with hypotheses, sexual minorities reported impaired social health relative to heterosexuals, with divergent patterns emerging by sexual orientation subgroup (which were generally consistent across sexes). Additionally, self -reported discrimination accounted for disparities across three of four indicators of social health. These findings suggest that sexual minorities may face obstacles related to prejudice and discrimination that impair the functioning of their relationships and overall social health. Moreover, because social health is closely related to psychological and physical health, remediating disparities in social relationships may be necessary to address other health disparities based upon sexual orientation. Expanding upon these results, implications for efforts to build resilience among sexual minorities are discussed.

AB  - Strategic framing of public messages about HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may influence public support for policies and programs affecting access. This survey study examined how public attitudes toward PrEP differed based on the social group PrEP was described as benefiting ("beneficiary'') and the moderating effect of prejudice. Members of the general public (n = 154) recruited online were randomly assigned to three beneficiary conditions: general population, gay men, or Black gay men. All participants received identical PrEP background information before completing measures of PrEP attitudes (specifying beneficiary), racism, and heterosexism. Despite anticipating greater PrEP adherence among gay men and Black gay men and perceiving PrEP as especially beneficial to the latter, participants expressed lower support for policies/programs making PrEP affordable for these groups vs. the general population. This disparity in support was stronger among participants reporting greater prejudice. Inclusive framing of PrEP in public discourse may prevent prejudice from undermining implementation efforts.

AB  - This paper is based on the last public lecture given by Dr Solomon at the 7th World Workshop on Oral Health & Disease in HIV/AIDS, held in Hyderabad, India, in November 2014. It examines the social impact of HIV in India and the founding of the Y.R. Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) clinic in Chennai, India, by Dr Suniti Solomon and her colleagues. This is a story of prejudice and ignorance throughout the various social levels in India. Reports of India's first AIDS case surfaced in 1986, when female sex workers were found to be HIV positive. The first voluntary counseling and testing center, part of a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic, was set up to increase awareness about the epidemic. To address the rapid spread of HIV infection in Tamil Nadu and the existing stigma in society and hospitals, Dr Solomon established YRG CARE in 1993. She recognized that fear and panic about HIV led to widespread social prejudice against HIV-positive patients, even within hospitals. By the end of 2014, over 34 000 patients had accessed these services and 20 000 HIV+ patients had been registered, nearly 40% of whom were females. The team embarked on a statewide awareness program on HIV and sexuality, covering over two hundred schools and colleges educating them about prevention strategies and combating the social stigma attached. The grass-root work of YRG CARE in the management of HIV infections revealed a widespread prejudice, due largely to the lack of awareness about the subject. It is estimated that even in 2015, as little as 40% of HIV-infected people are formally diagnosed and have access to care. In a country as socially and culturally diverse as India, there is much more to be carried out to build on the pioneering work of Dr Solomon.

AB  - This article is about how sociological research in Germany addresses issues that first seem to be unconnected: young new Fascists and migrants. We will present research in these two areas to show how social scientists contribute to feelings about their respective objects of research. We will argue that although both have cultural disorientation of their study objects as their point of departure, they offer differing explanations for it and as a consequence construct contrasting emotions towards the new Fascists and migrants: they portray new Fascists as disoriented victims of modernization in need of sympathy, while they blame migrants for their disorientation resulting from migration and thus call for indifference or antipathy towards this group. Comparing both research fields we can show that both sets of emotions interconnect and thus form a dichotomous emotional regime. Sociological research helps to sustain lines of inclusion and exclusion from the German society.

It is based on a field study conducted within the Tokyo metropolitan area in 2012. The study shows that in spite of racial prejudice, the African migrants in Japan build and draw heavily on bridging and linking social networks to promote economic integration. They develop these cross-cultural networks and capital through intermarriage with Japanese women, friendship and business ties with African Americans, Japanese youth and Japan's business community. For some migrants, their high educational background facilitated their economic integration in Japanese society.

AB  - Increases in intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) diagnoses coupled with higher rates of inclusion in school and community settings, has created more opportunities for exposure and integration between those with IDD and the mainstream population. Previous research has found that increased contact can lead to more positive attitudes toward those with IDD. The current study further investigated this impact of contact on attitudes by examining the influence of the quality and quantity of contact on both explicit and implicit levels of prejudice, while also considering potential mediation via intergroup anxiety and implicit attitudes. Based on past research and theory, we predicted that contact (especially quality contact) would have a strong relationship with explicit and implicit positive attitudes toward individuals with IDD. In the present study, 550 people completed a survey and short task that measured their level of contact with individuals with IDD across their lifetime, their current attitudes toward these individuals, and other constructs that are thought to influence this relationship. Multiple regression analyses suggested consistent links between higher quality of contact and lower levels of prejudice toward individuals with IDD at both the explicit and implicit levels. After controlling for quality of contact, higher quantity of contact was either not significantly associated with our measures of prejudice or was, importantly, associated with higher levels of prejudice. Additional analyses support intergroup anxiety and implicit positive attitudes as significant mediators in the associations between quality of contact and the various dimensions of explicit prejudice. Thus, it would seem that it is the quality of interpersonal interactions that is most strongly related to positive attitudes toward individuals with IDD, making it crucial to take care when developing inclusion opportunities in community settings.

AB  - Empirical research has documented that contact with lesbians and gays is associated with more positive feelings toward and greater support for legal rights for them, but we know less about whether these effects extend to informal aspects of same-sex relationships, such as reactions to public displays of affection. Furthermore, many studies have assumed that contact influences levels of sexual prejudice; however, the possibility of selection effects, in which less sexually prejudiced people have contact, and more sexually prejudiced people do not, raises some doubts about this assumption. We used original data from a nationally representative sample of heterosexuals to determine whether those reporting contact with a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender friend or relative exhibited less sexual prejudice toward lesbian and gay couples than those without contact. This study examined the effect of contact on attitudes toward formal rights and a relatively unexplored dimension, informal privileges. We estimated the effect of having contact using traditional (ordinary least squares regression) methods before accounting for selection effects using propensity score matching. After accounting for selection effects, we found no significant differences between the attitudes of those who had contact and those who did not, for either formal or informal measures. Thus, selection effects appeared to play a pivotal role in confounding the link between contact and sexual prejudice, and future studies should exercise caution in interpreting results that do not account for such selection effects.

AB  - Can social resilience be trained? We report results of a double-dissociative randomized controlled study in which 48 Army platoons were randomly assigned to social resilience training (intervention condition) or cultural awareness training (active control group). The same surveys were administered to all platoons at baseline and after the completion of training to determine the short-term training effects, generalization effects beyond training, and possible adverse effects. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that social resilience, compared with cultural awareness, training produced small but significant improvements in social cognition (e.g., increased empathy, perspective taking, & military hardiness) and decreased loneliness, but no evidence was found for social resilience training to generalize beyond these training foci nor to have adverse effects. Moreover, as predicted, cultural awareness, compared with social resilience, training produced increases in knowledge about and decreases in prejudice toward Afghans. Additional research is warranted to determine the long-term durability, safety, and generalizability of social resilience training.

AB  - Health professionals must be aware of the impact on parents of the birth of children with ambiguous genitalia. This study aimed to analyze the experiences and perceptions of such parents. Parents of 30 children who were evaluated in a reference center for disorders of sex development (DSD) were interviewed. The questionnaire covered the prenatal period, the moment they were told about the disorder, initial management by health professionals, and problems they experienced. Only two cases were detected during pregnancy. The news was usually given to the mother alone by pediatricians. Most parents kept it secret and avoided exposing the baby to the prejudice of others. Parents of children who were referred without sex assignment usually held a personal belief of their child's sex. Previous assignment was based on clinical examination and/or karyotype. Spreading knowledge about DSD could increase awareness of this issue, thus reducing parents' shock and societal stigma. Training of neonatal care teams is required to avoid assignment before evaluation.

AB  - Any random sampling of a Facebook timeline or Twitter feed, to take the obvious examples, provides a prepackaged view of global politics. It is restrictive because we choose it to reflect our own pet subjects, groups, likes, and world interests. The lens is prejudiced to reflect our race, class, gender, sexuality, ideology, and affective positionality. We enter a social media world as many as 10 or 50 times a day that has ourselves as the center of the universe. This communication world is similar to an infant's world: Someone else decides what we can see, what we can consume, what is that extra treat we can earn, if we are good: in social media terms, if we pay for it by reputational capital, or simply, if we spend enough money.

AB  - Although there is a pervasive anti-failure bias in society, we investigate why some entrepreneurs who fail are evaluated more harshly than others. Building on attribution theory and the literatures on prejudice, pro-social intentions, and perspective taking, we offer an evaluation model of entrepreneurial failure and test this model on 6,784 assessments made by 212 observers. We find that variance in the harshness of failure evaluations depends on both the attributes of the entrepreneur and the attributes of the observer, and the interaction between the two. Specifically, entrepreneurs who are homosexual are evaluated more harshly by some observers and entrepreneurs who use environmentally friendly technology are evaluated less harshly. Moreover, observers high in perspective taking are more lenient' in their failure evaluations of those who use environmentally friendly technology than those low in perspective taking.

AB  - In recent decades an important social movement related to Complementary and Alternative Medicine has been identified worldwide. In Brazil, although homeopathy was recognized as a specialist medical area in 1980, few medical schools offer courses related to it. In a previous study, 176 resident doctors at the University of Campinas Medical School were interviewed and 86 (49%) rejected homeopathy as a subject in the core medical curriculum. Thus, this qualitative study was conducted to understand their reasons for refusing. 20 residents from 15 different specialist areas were interviewed. Very few of them admitted to a lack of knowledge for making a judgment about homeopathy; none of them made a conscientious objection to it; and the majority demonstrated prejudice, affirming that there is not enough scientific evidence to support homeopathy, defending their position based on personal opinion, limited clinical practice and on information circulated in the mass media. Finally, resident doctors' prejudices against homeopathy can be extended to practices other than allopathic medicine.

KW  - diversity and human dignity (the Three Ds)
KW  - teaching for social justice
AB  - Drawing on a Participatory Action Research (PAR) study that was undertaken in two Australian preschool settings this article examines strategies that support the pedagogy of teaching for social justice and outlines how these strategies raised critical consciousness of both preschoolers (aged three to five years) and early childhood educators to respect and value Difference, Diversity and Human Dignity (the Three Ds). While social justice and anti-bias curricula are of definite concern in educational circles, the conversation needs to continue because young children in the twenty-first century still have the propensity to develop very negative views regarding the Three Ds. Research has demonstrated that by the time children reach preschool age they are already proficient in the ways they appropriate and manipulate racist discourses and have developed negative attitudes and prejudices towards particular groups. The findings of the Australian study have implications for early childhood education (ECE), both nationally and internationally, to support teaching for social justice with the judicious use of children's literature, that promotes young children's understanding of and sensitivities to the Three Ds.

AB  - Significant disparities remain between racial and ethnic minorities' and Whites' experiences of American workplaces. Traditional prejudice and discrimination approaches explain these gaps in hiring, promotion, satisfaction, and well-being by pointing to the prejudice of people within organizations such as peers, managers, and executives. Grounded in social identity threat theory, this theoretical review instead argues that particular situational cues-often communicated by well-meaning, largely unprejudiced employees and managers-signal to stigmatized groups whether their identity is threatened and devalued or respected and affirmed. First, we provide an overview of how identity threat shapes the psychological processes of racial and ethnic minorities by heightening vigilance to certain situational cues in the workplace. Next, we outline several of these cues and their role in creating and sustaining perceptions of identity threat (or safety). Finally, we provide empirically grounded suggestions that organizations may use to increase identity safety among their employees of color. Taken together, the research demonstrates how situational cues contribute to disparate psychological experiences for racial and ethnic minorities at work, and suggests that by altering threatening cues, organizations may create more equitable, respectful, and inclusive environments where all people may thrive.

AB  - Most countries are signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). In 1999, the Government of Wales was devolved from the UK, and in 2011 the "Children and Young Persons Rights Measure" put the UNCRC as the basis of all its work. Any programme introduced in schools should therefore promote the UNCRC. To address this, we implemented the Philosophy for Children (P4C) in Schools Project in 64 schools and monitored teacher and pupil responses. This paper reports on a meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative data that suggests that the models of childhood held by teachers impacts on how they respond to the UNCRC. Teachers who held models of children as "innocent", "evil", "blank slates" or "developing" found it hard to embrace the UNCRC. Teachers who were authoritarian, punitive and epistemologically directive also questioned the UNCRC. In contrast, teachers who practised rational authority and restorative approaches to wrongdoing and held a social competency model of the child embraced P4C, a democratic, community of inquiry approach to learning that puts pupil voice centre stage. We argue that P4C can provide a practical pedagogic tool to support the implementation of the UNCRC and has the potential to address barriers that arise from widely held deficit models of childhood.

AB  - Poorer outcomes for youth labeled with learning disabilities (LDs) are often attributed to the student's own deficiencies or cumulative disadvantage; but the more troubling possibility is that special education placement limits rather than expands these students' opportunities. Labeling theory partially attributes the poorer outcomes of labeled persons to stigma related to labels. This study uses data on approximately 11,740 adolescents and their schools from the Education Longitudinal Survey of 2002 to determine if stigma influences teachers' and parents' educational expectations for students labeled with LDs and labeled adolescents' expectations for themselves. Supporting the predictions of labeling theory, teachers and parents are more likely to perceive disabilities in, and hold lower educational expectations for labeled adolescents than for similarly achieving and behaving adolescents not labeled with disabilities. The negative effect of being labeled with LDs on adolescents' educational expectations is partially mechanized through parents' and particularly teachers' lower expectations.

AB  - This study illustrates the reaction toward the cultural and religious pluralism of two adolescent populations, from two different European countries. The goal in this study is to relate prejudices regarding immigration to the socio-cultural features that in a given context shape the issues surrounding this subject. The hypotheses proposed indicate that the socio-cultural factors represent interesting examples of variation of the stereotypes and attitudes toward the phenomenon of immigration. A survey has been conducted in Italy and France on 1277 high school students (mean age 17.2) to examine two different contexts concerning the issues that are raised by immigration phenomena. Consideration of the contextual factors will enable us to understand why young Italians express prejudices focused on economical and social issues, whereas young French people have a prejudice driven by identity issues. In order to explain such a typology of prejudice we have turned to the social and cultural characteristics that the question of immigration takes on in these two countries. Let us remember that for a more in-depth explanation of the factors that shape intergroup hostility, variables at the individual level need to be put alongside those at the contextual level. This way of working will lead to a better understanding of the social genesis of prejudices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indonesia is not a comfortable place for women for unmarried, educated career women. Most of such women often experience pressures, inequalities and discriminations. This study seeks to explore overt and covert discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudices in their work, family, and neighborhood life. Respondents. consisted of 34 friends, and their acquaintances, living in Pekanbaru, Jakarta, Solo, Yogyakarta, Bali, and Columbus with the following characteristics: single, age 28 or older, having received at least a bachelor's degree, and employed. The participants were recruited with purposive sampling by inviting those who met the above criteria To get detailed verbal prejudices and discrimination, the author conducted a survey by means of a questionnaire and various forms of communication with several target respondents. Detailed data were achieved by in-depth informal interviews with respondents to evoke their memories and; past conversations; with their parents; and families. The questionnaires and interviews showed that the participants, parents, and family were anxious about the unmarried status of educated women in Indonesia resulting in intolerance towards them. The participants' responses were based upon a five-point scale. The results showed that Indonesian society continues to discriminate against educated, unmarried career women unconsciously and consciously.

AB  - Lesbians and gay men have historically been derided, harassed, silenced and made invisible in Australia. This prejudice and discrimination has been reinforced structurally through social, cultural and political institutions. Although sexual orientation is now included in state and territory anti-discrimination legislation, and recent federal legislative change supports greater parity with the rights of heterosexuals, there is still discrimination towards lesbians and gay men. This paper examines some of the ways that lesbians' and gay male subjectivities are discursively constructed in modern-day Australia. It then reviews the ongoing negative and complex effects of such discourses on same-sex-attracted individuals in schools, schooling cultures and teacher pedagogies. This provides the background for a review of New South Wales Government education policy on 'homosexuality' and argues that this policy ultimately reinforces unhelpful discourses about sexual diversity, and fails to reflect the complexities and fluidities of sexual identities. Although policy implementation in schools in itself can be complex, strong and visible support 'from the top' in the form of relevant policy is critical to foster widespread action, understanding and cultural change in schools.

AB  - This article uses data drawn from nine months of fieldwork and student, teacher, and administrator interviews at a southern high school to analyze school racial conflict and the construction of racism. We find that institutional inequalities that stratify students by race and class are routinely ignored by school actors who, we argue, use the presence of so-called redneck students to plausibly deny racism while furthering the standard definition of racism as blatant prejudice and an individual trait. The historical prominence of rednecks as a southern cultural identity augments these claims, leading to an implicit division of school actors into friendly/nonracist and unfriendly/racist and allowing school actors to set boundaries on the meaning of racism. Yet these rhetorical practices and the institutional structures they mask contributed to racial tensions, culminating in a race riot during our time at the school.

AB  - The Statement: Among the characteristics of efficient counsellors are psychological determination, emphatic understanding, having no prejudices, enthusiasm to listen to and understand others, and having no anti-social or hostile feelings (Ultanir, 2001). It is repeatedly argued that education opportunities and services directly influence life satisfaction; the satisfaction in academic life increases life satisfaction, and social policies to be developed in every country should aim to increase life satisfaction (Chow, 2005; Diener, and Seligman 2004). Gender, age, professional status, education, professional expectations of the school counsellors and the institution they work have an impact on their life satisfaction. No research has been found related to the effect of personal and socio-demographic factors on life satisfaction.
   Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the counsellors' gender, age, marital status, education, the school they work, work experience, satisfaction with working conditions, and positive perception of their knowledge and skills on their life satisfaction.
   Methods: This study is a literature review which uses a qualitative research technique. The population of the research consisted of 141 psychological counsellors, 112 of whom were females and 29 of whom were males, working at the state primary and high schools in the province of Izmir.
   Findings and Results: In the findings obtained from the research, with regard to life satisfaction of the school psychological counselors, following conclusions were reached: Life satisfaction levels of those who were satisfied with their working conditions were higher than those who did not; life satisfaction levels of those who found the knowledge and skills satisfactory which they acquired at the schools which they graduated from were higher than those who did not. In compliance with the results of Multilevel Regression Analysis, Satisfaction with the working conditions, Perception of the knowledge and Skills acquired at school satisfactory and Marital Status are found out to be the important predictors of life satisfaction.
   Conclusion and Recommendations: The results of the study indicate that the most significant variable that contributes to the prediction of life satisfaction is whether the participants find the knowledge and skills they gain during their education satisfactory or not. The life satisfaction levels of those who find the knowledge and skills gained at their schools satisfactory are higher than those who do not.

AB  - Some of the leading 20th-century philosophical inheritors of Enlightenment thought turned to psychoanalysis as a crucial part of their analysis of the social and individual dynamics of domination and submission. In explaining the ways in which individual pathologies intersect with authoritarian political ideologies and social hatreds, the "Frankfurt School" theorists developed a psychoanalytically informed social theory. They understood that strivings for freedom could not be accomplished only by political revolution. They also had to be accompanied by a transformed internal psychic life that could embrace freedom as essential to psychic and social health. These thinkers held that psychoanalysis was necessary to actualize freedom based on critical subjective agency as concrete realities of daily life. Otherwise, social theory remains detached from individual human experience. This article argues for the relevance and necessity of psychoanalysis for social change. It includes a clinical vignette that illustrates the ways in which individual pathologies intersect with, sustain, and reproduce social intolerance and prejudice.

AB  - Nursing is grounded in communication with others, yet rarely are the words critiqued. Despite an ethical call to honor diversity, promote empowerment, and to do no harm, some of the language used in health care reflects historical prejudices, reductionism, and/or the overarching authority of medical or moral models. This article exposes some of the "harsh words" nurses sometimes unconsciously use, and it suggests alternatives. Influenced by an ethic of social justice and the ethic of relationship with others, an attempt will be made to explore nursing language with women and children. Implications for nursing philosophy and practice will be discussed.

AB  - Aim. This article is a report on a descriptive qualitative case study of the dietary change experiences of overweight children and their families. Background. Obese children are at risk of experiencing a complicated childhood and becoming obese adults with associated ill health and premature death. The prevalence of obesity among children appears to be rising rapidly. In Europe, prevalence rates for overweight children are 1040%, and generally this prevalence has tripled during the past 30 years. Method. The study was conducted as a qualitative longitudinal case study on the basis of 23 annual interviews with four overweight Danish children, six parents and four siblings from April 2006 to September 2008. Altogether 61 interviews were conducted. In the data analysis process, a thematic, phenomenological approach was used. Findings. The following themes were identified: the reactions and attitudes of children with the sub-themes taking ownership of dietary changes and vulnerability reactions; and the reactions and attitudes of parents with the sub-themes personal acceptance and support, indulgence and protection, setting limits and barriers to successful dietary change. The children were under pressure, showed signs of stigmatization and marginalization, and developed self-protecting strategies. The parents tried to cope to the best of their ability, needed help, but felt rejected by professional key persons and authorities. Conclusions. On the basis of the study, it was hypothesised that a prejudice-free, individually accepting and supporting intervention must be provided for each family over time to ensure successful weight loss.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the impact of Fat Pig on the attitudes of high school students towards fat women and investigate the perspective of dietitians as health professionals on the messages in Fat Pig.
   Design: Performance analysis, pre-post analysis of students' responses to self-administrated pre-constructed questionnaires, students' focus groups and personal interviews with dietitians.
   Setting: Tenth grade (15-16 year-old) high school students in Israel who saw Fat Pig as part of their high school's educational-cultural curriculum, and dietitians from four different healthcare organizations in Israel that came to see the play as a group.
   Method: Performance analysis, quantitative analysis of students' responses using SPSS, and qualitative analysis of students' focus groups and personal interviews with dietitians.
   Results: Students' responses indicate that the play's impact is completely opposite to the playwright and the educator's original intention to challenge stereotypes and prejudice towards fat women in society. Moreover, the play reinforces the student's social and cultural norms that glorify the 'thinness ideal'. In addition, according to the dietitians, the play cannot serve them as an additional treatment tool.
   Conclusion: Creating or using drama in education not according to theoretical approaches, such as the entertainment-education (EE) approach, may lead to paradoxical outcomes, completely contradict educational intentions, and even reinforce undesired attitudes and behaviours.

AB  - Earlier research has indicated a negative relationship between ethnic diversity and trust. Whereas previous analyses have been carried out at the country, city or neighbourhood level, this paper adds to the literature by analyzing the impact of ethnic diversity on generalized trust in others and out-group trust in the primary school context. The question of the impact of ethnic diversity in school on the trust of schoolchildren is addressed by drawing on a unique survey of children with immigrant and native Danish backgrounds, respectively, in the last three grades of primary school in Denmark. The survey design holds several qualities strengthening the potential for drawing inference about the impact of ethnic diversity in school on trust. The results of the analysis do not confirm the negative relationship between ethnic diversity and trust found in earlier research. In the primary school setting, ethnic diversity does not affect generalized trust and even has a positive impact on out-group trust of native Danish pupils (i.e., their trust in immigrants).

AB  - Given the importance of material goods consumption to young people and the perception that to be 'cool' is fundamental to identity construction, this study investigates consumption in relation to social, economic and cultural inequalities. Qualitative individual interviews took place in November 2005, in Rio de Janeiro, with 14 high school students, age range 16-18, from public and private schools, and diverse backgrounds. In the context of global changes, Brazil is pushed towards a more advanced economic development, though basic needs of most of its population are not met. Serious contrasts continually reinforce and reproduce social and economic inequalities, through prejudice and segregation based on race, gender, residence and origin. Poor youngsters face the challenges of living in a globalised but unequal society, such as inadequate education, transition from school to labour markets, unemployment and less social participation. The data suggested that consumption is important to provide the feeling of being 'cool', 'fitting in' and experiencing inclusion though inequalities are an obstacle to consumption. In divided societies, to consume or dream of consuming create illusions of belonging to different classes, and escaping from poverty; however, respondents argued that education is the most important factor for improving social and economic conditions.

AB  - Four cross-sectional studies are presented that investigated the automatic activation of prejudice in children and adolescents (aged 9 years to 15 years). Therefore, 4 different versions of the affective priming task were used, with pictures of ingroup and outgroup members being presented as prejudice-related prime stimuli. In all 4 studies, a pattern occurred that suggests a linear developmental increase of automatic prejudice with significant effects of outgroup negativity appearing only around the ages of 12 to 13 years. Results of younger children, on the contrary, did not indicate any effect of automatic prejudice activation. In contrast, prejudice effects in an Implicit Association Test (IAT) showed high levels of prejudice independent of age (Study 3). Results of Study 4 suggest that these age differences are due to age-related differences in spontaneous categorization processes. Introducing a forced-categorization into the affective priming procedure produced a pattern of results equivalent to that obtained with the IAT. These results suggest that although children are assumed to acquire prejudice at much younger ages. automatization of such attitudes might be related to developmental processes in early adolescence. We discuss possible theoretical implications of these results for it developmental theory of prejudice representation and automatization during childhood and adolescence.

AB  - Religious belongings help migrants, especially irregular ones, to confront the precariousness of their lives. France represents a peculiar case because it is a secular country where undocumented migrants have access to free medical care and their children to compulsory education. The present paper explores Filipino migrants' religious space in France by examining irregular migrant Filipinas' church involvement and shows the contrasting attitudes of these women towards religion: some find in the Church a social institution supporting their social and economic incorporation in France, whereas others stay away from religious gatherings to avoid prejudice and gossip. These attitudes point to the key roles of religion in the structuring of migrant populations, as well as of the Church as a centre of collective identity, a source of empowerment and an instrument of social control.

AB  - In recent years there has been an increase in Black African immigrants to Australia; however, there is no social psychological research that directly examines community attitudes towards this group. Here, the findings of a community survey in Western Australia are reported using data collected from 184 Australian participants. We were particularly interested in prejudiced attitudes and the function of attitudes towards Black African immigrants. On prejudice, a reliable and valid instrument measuring attitudes towards Black African immigrants was constructed. On functions, the most frequently reported function of attitude was 'value-expressive' ('My attitudes give expression to my values'), followed by experiential-schematic ('Helps me to make sense of the world') and indirect experiential-schematic ('Media, friends and family help me to make sense of the world'). While there was no significant difference between immigrant-accepting versus immigrant-rejecting participants on the value expressive or the experiential schematic functions, rejecting participants scored higher on the indirect experiential schematic function, highlighting the salience of second-hand information. The participants' most important reason for potentially changing their own attitudes towards Black African immigrants, however, were direct experience (experiential-schematic), followed by values (value expressive) and indirect experience (indirect experiential-schematic), two functions that were equally important. Qualitative open-ended interviews about attitudes converged with these themes, and added 'integration' by assimilating Australian culture, and not being involved in criminal activities (which highlights again a role for the media). We discuss these findings and derive a clear direction for anti-prejudice strategies at community and government levels.

AB  - Although recent global developments suggest progress toward LGBT+ equality, institutional structures perpetuating differential treatment based on sexual orientation and gender identity persist. The present research employed a mixed-method campus climate study of LGBT+ and cis-heterosexual students sampled from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines and the UK. Phase 1 reports a large-scale survey assessing relationships among students' social attitudes toward LGBT+, campus climate perceptions and experiences of harassment, well-being, academic persistence, and social identity belonging within the university (LGBT+ = 877; cis-heterosexual = 2107). Phase 2 reports focus groups and interviews with 35 LGBT+ students, further exploring their campus climate experiences. Triangulated results highlight the role of social identity belonging in creating positive LGBT+ campus climates. Fostering belonging, through visible institutional support for intersectional LGBT+ student organisations and endorsement of LGBT+ inclusive policies and programmes, is recommended for creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBT+ students.

AB  - Research suggests that individuals are racially biased when judging the emotions of others (Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002) and particularly regarding attributions about the emotion of anger (Halberstadt. Castro, Chu, Lozada, & Sims, 2018; Hugenberg & Bodenhausen. 2003). Systematic, balanced designs are rare, and are comprised of adults viewing adults. The present study expands the questions of racialized emotion recognition accuracy and anger bias to the world of children. Findings that adults demonstrate either less emotion accuracy and/or greater anger bias for Black versus White children could potentially explain some of the large racialized disciplinary discrepancies in schools. To test whether racialized emotion recognition accuracy and anger bias toward children exists, we asked 178 prospective teachers to complete an emotion recognition task comprised of 72 children's facial expressions depicting six emotions and divided equally by race (Black. White) and gender (female, male). We also assessed implicit bias via the child race Implicit Association Test and explicit bias via questionnaire. Multilevel modeling revealed nuanced racialized emotion recognition accuracy with a race by gender interaction, but clear racialized anger bias toward both Black boys and girls. Both Black boys and Black girls were falsely seen as angry more often than White boys and White girls. Higher levels of either implicit or explicit bias did not increase odds of Black children being victim to anger bias, but instead decreased odds that White children would be misperceived as angry. Implications for addressing preexisting biases in teacher preparation programs and by children and parents are discussed.

AB  - Background: Prejudices against minorities can be understood as habitually negative evaluations that are kept in spite of evidence to the contrary. Therefore, individuals with strong prejudices might be dominated by habitual or "automatic" reactions at the expense of more controlled reactions. Computational theories suggest individual differences in the balance between habitual/model-free and deliberative/model-based decision-making.Methods: 127 subjects performed the two Step task and completed the blatant and subtle prejudice scale.Results: By using analyses of choices and reaction times in combination with computational modeling, subjects with stronger blatant prejudices showed a shift away from model-based control. There was no association between these decision-making processes and subtle prejudices.Conclusion: These results support the idea that blatant prejudices toward minorities are related to a relative dominance of habitual decision-making. This finding has important implications for developing interventions that target to change prejudices across societies.

AB  - Police integrity is a crucial steppingstone in police administrators' long-term goals of obtaining legitimacy and yielding citizens' evaluations of the police as a legitimate institution. This paper investigates the relationship between work-related experiences and police integrity, as well as the degree to which this relationship is mediated by well-known socio-political attitudes such as authoritarianism, ethnic prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Using structural equation modelling of the responses provided by 1,255 members of the Belgium police, the work-related characteristics, socio-political attitudes, and organisational dimensions of police integrity are related to three outcomes of police integrity. Results show that police officers in the field and those who had more frequent contacts with victims and perpetrators of crimes evaluate misconduct to be less serious, are less willing to say that they would report the behaviour, and advocate less severe disciplinary sanctions. Generalised socio-political attitudes related to prejudice mediate work-related experiences and perceptions of peer police integrity and are in turn negatively related to police integrity outcomes. These findings illustrate that police officers do not operate in a social vacuum as these general socio-political attitudes are non-occupation specific. This suggests that police integrity training programmes not only need to target work-related characteristics, such as an open culture to discuss problems, but also need to target general socio-political attitudes to foster police integrity.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore individual and situational predictors of homeless stigmatization. The aim was to test if individual differences in Belief in a Just World (BJW) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) moderate the effect of quantity and quality of contact on stigmatization of the homeless. One hundred and eighty-seven participants completed measures of BJW, SDO, quality, and quantity of contact, as well as a measure of homeless stigmatization. Results showed that BJW and SDO correlated positively with stigmatization, while both quantity and quality of contact were negatively correlated with stigmatization. SDO was found to moderate the relationship between quantity of contact and stigmatization; more contact with the homeless was related to lower stigmatization for participants with low and moderate SDO scores but not those with high SDO. BJW did not moderate the relationship between contact and stigmatization. Implications regarding the interaction between SDO and contact are discussed.

AB  - Mini-Med Schools (MiMS) are an opportunity for health sciences and social work undergraduates to discuss health-related topics with Innu and Atikamekw youth in Canada. More than 500 undergraduates and 1,000 students have taken part in the project since its beginning in 2011. This study aims to assess the impact of both 1) MiMS's predeparture training and 2) the MiMS themselves on undergraduates' prejudices toward Indigenous peoples. Satisfaction of the undergraduates taking part in the activity was also assessed. Seventy-eight undergraduates were recruited and completed the Old-fashioned and Modern Prejudiced Attitudes Toward Aboriginals Scales (O-PATAS and M-PATAS) at baseline, after the pre-departure training, and after the MiMS. They also completed satisfaction surveys. This study shows a reduction of prejudices after participating to a MiMS, but no effect of a pre-departure training. The activities were overall appreciated by undergraduates and most of them would like to take part again in the MiMS.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of participants' gender, and target figures' gender on the preferences for individuals with overweight and average-weight. The study also assessed whether evaluations of the groups are affected by the group composition (the number of children with overweight). The study was conducted on the sample of 102 children (43 girls and 59 boys). The age of the participants ranged from 7 to 11 years. Twenty pairs of female and male child images with average-weight and overweight were drawn for this study. The individual images were combined into five groups of children with average-weight and overweight. The results showed that target with average-weight and male targets were preferred more than target with overweight and female targets and that participants evaluated same-sex targets more positively. The same trend was obtained for group images. The results also showed that the increase in the number of children with overweight in groups was connected with more negative evaluations of these groups.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between social media use, disease risk perception, social and political trust, and out-group stereotyping and prejudice during a social upheaval. Analyses of primary data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore found that disease risk perception is positively related to stereotyping and prejudice against Chinese immigrants. Individuals who used social media for news were more likely to stereotype and express prejudice. However, those who engaged in frequent heterogenous discussions, and had more extensive social networks, were less likely to stereotype and express prejudice. Higher social and political trust was also associated with lower stereotyping and prejudice. Finally, moderation effects of network characteristics on the relationship between risk perception, social trust, and prejudice were observed.

AB  - Across three studies, we examined non-Black children's spontaneous associations with targets who differed by both race and emotional expression. Children aged 5 to 10 years (N = 419; 215 girls; 58% White; 65% of household incomes.$75,000/year) completed Implicit Association Tests (IAT; Greenwald et al., 2003) containing smiling Black and neutral White target faces. In all three studies, when children categorized these faces by emotional expression, they showed relatively more positive associations with smiling Black targets over neutral White targets, as compared with when they categorized these faces by race. This was the case when children were shown how to categorize these faces (Studies 1 and 2) and when they spontaneously categorized by race or emotional expression on an Ambiguous-Categorization IAT that allowed for categorization by race and/or emotion (Studies 2 and 3). In Study 3, after watching an adult explain that she was categorizing racially diverse faces by emotional expression in a seemingly unrelated card-sorting task, children were also relatively faster to pair smiling Black faces with pleasant images and neutral White faces with unpleasant images on this Ambiguous-Categorization IAT compared with children in a control condition. Older children were more likely to spontaneously categorize primarily by race (Studies 2 and 3) but were also more likely to categorize by emotion following the intervention (Study 3) compared with younger children. Together, these studies provide insight into children's social categorization processes and spontaneous associations with targets who differ systematically across multiple perceptually salient categories.

AB  - In psychology, prejudice has typically been studied by social psychology (e.g., intergroup processes), but the last 20 years have seen a renewed and growing interest for research on personality traits and prejudice. The present meta-analysis integrates findings between personality traits (Big Five), ideological attitudes (SDO; social dominance orientation and RWA; right-wing authoritarianism-), and cultural attitudes (cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation). Our theoretical framework was the Dual Process Model (DPM; (Duckitt, 2001), which posits that low agreeableness and low openness predict more cultural prejudice through the mediating effects of SDO and RWA. We also developed an extended DPM-2 by adding cultural appreciation as a second outcome. The systematic search for published and unpublished studies identified 300 independent samples. Overall, the main meta-analytical results support both the initial DPM and the extended DPM-2. In the DPM, low agreeableness was linked to cultural prejudice through SDO, whereas low openness was related to cultural prejudice through RWA. In the extended DPM-2, in addition to the same mediated links already present in the DPM, agreeableness was linked to cultural appreciation through low SDO, whereas openness was related (though weakly) to cultural appreciation through low RWA. In addition, the antecedents of cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation are mostly the same; they do not necessarily have the same effect sizes. Importantly, the findings support that cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation are partially distinct and negatively interrelated attitudinal constructs. Results are discussed in terms of appreciation and prejudice toward ethnocultural outgroups being two complementary concepts for research.
   Public Significance Statement Overall, this meta-analysis suggests that appreciation for ethnocultural outgroups and prejudice against ethnocultural outgroups is partially distinct and negatively related concepts that may be both influenced in part by personality and ideologies. Our results also suggest that, to better benefit society, a more complete research program on improving cultural attitudes should probably be twofold: Focusing on how to reduce cultural prejudice while also focusing on how to increase cultural appreciation.

AB  - Positive distinctiveness threat is central for understanding ingroup bias, but its role in gender differences in the expression of sexual prejudice is not yet satisfactorily elucidated. We analyzed this issue by proposing that sexual prejudice is a defensive reaction to ensure intergroup distinctiveness, so that heterosexual men are more prejudiced against homosexuals than heterosexual women because they strive more for positive distinctiveness. In Study 1 (N = 232), we found that men exhibited more prejudice against gay men than lesbians, while women did not significantly differentiate their prejudice against these target groups. In Study 2, we manipulated the target group of prejudice (gay men vs. lesbians) in a sample of heterosexual men (N = 79) and confirmed that they differentiated more between heterosexual men and gay men than between heterosexual women and lesbians. In Study 3 (N = 177), we manipulated the threat to the distinctiveness between the ingroup (i.e., heterosexual men and heterosexual women) and the outgroup (i.e., gay men and lesbians) and demonstrated that the perceived distinctiveness mediates the relationship between gender and sexual prejudice in men but not in women. Finally, in Study 4 (N = 75), we manipulated the distinctiveness threat for men and women and measured sexual prejudice by using an implicit measure. The results showed more implicit prejudice in men than in women when intergroup distinctiveness was threatened (vs. affirmed). Our results have important implications for understanding sexual prejudice by shedding light on the role played by the distinctiveness threat of gender differences in expressing homophobia.

AB  - This mixed-methods study examined the experiences of belonging/otherness among Arab teachers in Israel. A group of boundary-crossing teachers: Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ; N = 57) was compared with Arab teachers teaching in their own community (AA; N = 103). We found that the AJ group had a multicultural orientation, unlike the AA group, who were community-orientated. These orientations are reflected in different otherness sources, different motivations for selecting a workplace, and differences in identity ratings. While professional and social sources promoted teachers? sense of belonging in the two groups, the source of AJs? sense of otherness was the national divide as opposed to community-oriented aspects in AAs. Selfefficacy ratings were high in both groups with a significant advantage for AJs, an unanticipated finding given that most of them were women, had attended teacher training colleges rather than universities, and were rarely homeroom teachers. Arab teachers? involvement in Jewish schools was partial with a low proportion of classroom educators or teachers in managerial roles. AJs tend to leave their national identity outside the school, and are not involved in political discourse or in the staffroom power relations. The phenomenon of integrating AJs is relatively new, and within a segregated education system that limits the opportunities for Jews and Arabs to meet, it can provide a viable, albeit limited, tool to inhibit prejudice and antagonism between Jews and Arabs.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative pilot study was to investigate the role of race (and racism) and sense of belonging for Black men in medical school. A single research question guided this exploratory project: How do Black men in medical school describe their experiences? Analyzing interview data from 8 Black male medical school students revealed frequent encounters with racial discrimination and prejudice. Results show that race adversely affected their academic and social experiences and diminished their sense of belonging in medical school. Consequently, they faced difficulty connecting with White peers and faculty, racist stereotypes, and racial microaggressions that stigmatized them as "out of place," unqualified, or unusual. Implications for policy, practice, and minority medical student success are highlighted.

TI  - Has Social Media Destroyed a Federal Rule? The False Promise of Transfer to Cure Prejudice in the Social Media Era
T2  - TEXAS LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21(a), criminal defendants can move to have their case transferred out of the local district if local prejudice is so high that impartial jurors cannot be found. Scholars and some courts have been quite fond of transfer for prejudice under Rule 21(a), especially in cases of extreme local prejudice. Courts have continued to grant transfer motions in these cases. And scholars have largely defended these grants of transfer, arguing that transfer is the best way to guarantee a fair trial when local prejudice is high.
   This Note challenges this traditional thinking and advocates for a counterintuitive way to guarantee the defendant a fair trial: Eliminate transfer for prejudice under Rule 21(a) altogether. To make this argument, this Note first argues that the Rule's main benefit to defendants, as identified by courts and scholars, is that it allows defendants to move a trial to a less-prejudiced jury pool when local prejudice is high. But this benefit has been stripped away by social media. Social media has made it so transferable cases under the current doctrine will always have national coverage, thus making any transfer pointless at eliminating prejudice because all districts will be equally prejudiced. At the same time, social media has exacerbated some of the harms of the Rule by making a prejudicial transfer-a transfer that harms the defendant-likely. This harm, along with other harms outlined in this Note, shows how leaving the Rule in place actually threatens a defendant's right to a fair trial, and therefore, elimination of the Rule will better protect a defendant's right to a fair trial.

AB  - This study builds from the implicit theory of creative individuals to an understanding of the social perceptions of creative individuals. Stereotypes and prejudice about creative students were examined utilizing the self-developed stereotype and prejudice scales among German adolescents. The results indicate that German adolescents hold positive images of creative students, seeing them as competent, warm and popular. Their primary perception of a creative student was admiration, which could be predicted by their stereotypes. In addition, the gender and age effects on adolescents' social perception were examined. The results show that boys and girls tend to expect the creative student to be the same gender as themselves; and the ratings of stereotype and prejudice in the pre-teens group were significantly higher than in the teens group. These findings provide a refined image of creative individuals from a social perception perspective and partially explain the observed variations due to gender and age factors.

AB  - Anti-Semitism represents one of the most penetrating forms of prejudice, yet social research has failed to address the causal underpinnings of the phenomenon. To this end, we empirically test the notion that anti-Semitism builds on the legacy of the Holocaust. Standing as the benchmark for collective suffering, the Holocaust creates competition over recognition of the status of the victim. Upward comparisons between victimized ingroups with other victimized outgroups trigger social prejudice. Victimhood, thus, creates an antagonistic view of the Jews that, in turn, fuels anti-Semitic prejudice. We test this theory using data from Greece-the European nation with the highest proportion of anti-Semites-leveraging two survey experiments and a natural experiment. Our results confirm our theoretical expectations, showing that perceived victimhood fuels anti-Semitism. The findings of our research carry important implications for dealing with anti-Semitism and for combating various forms of outgroup prejudice.

AB  - Understanding the root causes of child mistreatment and abuse should be a key concern of child and adolescent psychiatrists. However, the issue is often framed in such a way that we fail to ask how and why child abuse happens. One framework for the psychosocial motivations behind child abuse is the concept of childism, or prejudice against children. A series such asThe Twilight Zonecan offer a means of exploring unhealthy adult-child dynamics and applying the concept of childism to better understand them.

AB  - This paper explores how immersion and engagement with different cultures in the home environment impacts Korean children's intercultural learning. More specific attention is given to the experience of nine Korean children whose families have voluntarily served as homestay host families and hosted foreign guests for more than seven years. This qualitative inquiry is drawn from data including participant observations, semi-structured interviews with children and their parents, and the collection of artefacts and documents. Four themes were identified regarding the impact of homestay hosting experiences on the focal children: (1) experiencing intercultural encounters in the home environment; (2) building close, long-lasting intercultural relationships; (3) recognising preconceived prejudices and undoing cultural stereotypes; and (4) challenging a singular and oversimplified representation of cultures. Given the modern, global context in which children engage in frequent contacts with individuals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, the findings demonstrate the necessity of fostering intercultural learning among school-aged children and suggest homestay programmes are a potential means for developing students' intercultural learning in a local context.

AB  - Although stereotypes and prejudice are commonly regarded as conceptually distinct but related constructs, previous research remains silent on the processes underlying their relation. Applying the balance-congruity principle to the concepts (a) group, (b) valence, and (c) attribute, we argue that the valence of attributes contained in a group-stereotype shapes evaluations of the group, while prejudice toward a group influences which attributes are stereotypically associated with the group. Using fictitious (Experiments 1 and 3) and real (Experiments 2 and 4) groups, the current studies demonstrate that (a) experimentally induced changes in the valence of semantic attributes associated with a group (stereotypes) influence implicit prejudice toward that group (Experiments 1 and 2), and (b) experimentally induced changes in the valence of a group (prejudice) influence implicit stereotyping of that group (Experiments 3 and 4). These findings demonstrate a bidirectional causal relation between prejudice and stereotypes.

AB  - Learning one is similar to a stigmatized group can threaten one's identity and prompt disassociation from the group. What are the consequences of learning of a similarity to a stigmatized group when that similarity implies possible recategorization into the group? We investigated how learning of an immutable, recategorization implying similarity with an outgroup affects implicitly and explicitly assessed prejudice. In Study 1, White participants who believed they had above average genetic overlap with African Americans showed decreased prejudice on implicit but not explicit measures. In Study 2, straight/heterosexual participants who were led to believe they exhibited some same-sex attraction showed reduced implicitly assessed prejudice, but only if they believed sexual orientation was biologically determined. Thus, learning of an identity-implying similarity with an outgroup can reduce implicit prejudice if that group membership is believed to be immutable. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Exploitative familiarity ('mate crime') is a recently-identified phenomenon. Available evidence suggests that exploitative familiarity has a significant impact on the lives of some disabled people, not only in terms of the breadth of offences committed using this form of insidious exploitation but also because of the potential grave consequences. Often, isolated disabled people are victimised in their homes by locals who may use the effects of victims' impairments to manipulate and betray purported friendships. Exploitation can continue unchecked, particularly where there is lack of institutional involvement. Based on a case study of police records and drawing upon the fields of hate crime and disability studies, this article provides an explanation of how and why exploitative familiarity occurs. The evidence appears to suggest that oppression and stigmatisation of disabled people lead to relational disadvantages such as poverty and isolation. However, it is the 'individual vulnerability' of victims which directly influences targeting.

TI  - Beyond the Classroom: The Impact of a University-Based Civic Hackathon Addressing Homelessness
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - Stigma and prejudice are barriers to developing policies addressing homelessness. Awareness development, using civic hackathons, may be beneficial in reducing stigma and promoting policy while offering unique training to social work students. The current study explores the feasibility of hosting a university-based homelessness hackathon; associated changes in self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and investment in addressing homelessness; and development of innovative solutions. Participants (N=32) attended a 7-hour event, involving expert panels, rapid iteration, and solution pitches. Pre- and postevent surveys demonstrate changes in knowledge and attitudes related to homelessness as well as civic responsibility. The event was less successful in generating deployable solutions. Findings suggest the benefit of university-based hackathons to train social work students and offer considerations for implementing hackathons in educational settings.

AB  - Social judgment is shaped by multiple biases operating simultaneously, but most bias-reduction interventions target only a single social category. In seven preregistered studies (total N > 7,000), we investigated whether asking participants to avoid one social bias affected that and other social biases. Participants selected honor society applicants based on academic credentials. Applicants also differed on social categories irrelevant for selection: attractiveness and ingroup status. Participants asked to avoid potential bias in one social category showed small but reliable reductions in bias for that category (r = .095), but showed near-zero bias reduction on the unmentioned social category (r = .006). Asking participants to avoid many possible social biases or alerting them to bias without specifically identifying a category did not consistently reduce bias. The effectiveness of interventions for reducing social biases may be highly specific, perhaps even contingent on explicitly and narrowly identifying the potential source of bias.

AB  - Across the United States, acquittals of White police officers who have killed Black men have spurred clashes between those who see such situations as manifestations of racism and those who see them as race-irrelevant acts of officer self-defense. In this research, we explore the relationship between participants' racial prejudice and construal of an event that leads to the death of a Black man. In Study 1, we found that participants' racial prejudice predicts lower perceived guilt for a White officer who killed a Black man. In Study 2, we found evidence that the relationship between racial prejudice and guilt judgments is driven by increased perceptions that the officer was in danger and decreased perceived relevance of officer prejudice. Finally, Study 3 demonstrated that these patterns hold when the victim is Black, but not White. We conclude that racial prejudice shapes perceptions of legal responsibility for lethal interactions with Black men.

AB  - In this article we considered the relevance of specific claims that 'multi-faith' approaches to Religious Education (RE) play a role in promoting good community relations. In doing so, we adopted a social-psychological perspective where engaging in positive and meaningful interactions with diverse others reduces prejudice. Survey responses from 92 RE teachers across the UK were examined to determine the extent to which strategies for promoting positive community relations were embedded within classroom practice. We next examined whether teachers intuitively used social psychological theory - namely the contact hypothesis - to promote positive communities in their classrooms. Results demonstrated that the majority of surveyed RE practitioners perceived community relations to be a core aim of RE and that contact theory was applicable to their practice. Teachers reported examples of how they embed both contact theory and RE in their classrooms but not all of these aligned with social psychological theory. Findings suggest that successful practice in RE may be further developed by integrating theoretical principles of the contact hypothesis. Implications and future directions will be discussed.

AB  - Tolerance for diversity in America is often indexed by direct measures, such as self-reported "willingness to vote" polls. However, pressures to be or appear unprejudiced may bias such estimates, yielding misleading and overly optimistic inferences about tolerance in America. The current research investigated the degree to which direct and indirect measures of political candidate preferences converge and diverge across six target groups varying in acceptability of stigmatization (atheists, African Americans, Catholics, gay men and lesbians, Muslims, and women) and across relevant participant demographics. Overall, participants (N = 3,000, nationally representative) reported less willingness to vote for target groups when measured indirectly, relative to directly. Additionally, the divergence between the direct and indirect measures was especially evident for social groups for which overt stigmatization is normatively inappropriate. This research provides a vital benchmark that quantifies the gulf between the direct and indirect measures of tolerance for various oft-stigmatized groups in America.

AB  - Most research on emotion recognition focuses on facial expressions. However, people communicate emotional information through bodily cues as well. Prior research on facial expressions has demonstrated that emotion recognition is modulated by top-down processes. Here, we tested whether this top-down modulation generalizes to the recognition of emotions from body postures. We report three studies demonstrating that stereotypes and prejudice about men and women may affect how fast people classify various emotional body postures. Our results suggest that gender cues activate gender associations, which affect the recognition of emotions from body postures in a top-down fashion.

AB  - In recent years, research has demonstrated that the basic features of prejudice and discrimination emerge early in children's development. These discoveries call into question the role of social learning in intergroup bias. Specifically, through what means do we learn to distinguish "us" from "them?" Here, we explore this question, focusing on three key issues: how children respond to biased information they receive from others, how children selectively seek out certain types of biased information, and how children communicate biased information to others. We close by discussing the implications of this research for interventions to reduce stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAdolescence is a critical phase of development and experimentation with delinquent behaviors. There is a growing body of literature exploring individual and structural impacts of discrimination on health outcomes and delinquent behaviors. However, there is limited research assessing how school diversity and discrimination impact students' delinquent behaviors. In response, the purpose of this study was to assess if individual- and school-level indicators of discrimination and diversity were associated with student delinquent behaviors among African American and White students.
   METHODSWe analyzed Wave I (1994-1995) data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our analysis was limited to 8947 African American and White students (73% White, 48% male, and 88% parent high school education). We used multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial regression to test the association of individual- and school characteristics and discrimination with the number of self-reported delinquent behaviors.
   RESULTSRace, sex, perceived peer inclusion, and teacher discrimination were predictors of students' delinquent behaviors. The average school perceived peer inclusion and percentage of African Americans in teaching roles were associated with delinquent behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONSFindings from this study highlight the potential for intervention at the interpersonal and school levels to reduce delinquency among African American and White students.

AB  - This study aims to demonstrate and change negative perceptions of descendants of members of the Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia/PKI), a stigmatized social group in Indonesia. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were given positive descriptions of an adult (Study 1) and a child (Study 2), and were asked to evaluate them twice, before and after reading information about the target's family background. In Study 1, targets were described either as descendants of PKI members, members of another Indonesian party or criminals. In Study 2, the target was presented as a descendant of PKI members, of members of another Indonesian party or without information on family background (control condition). The studies showed that whenever people were 'revealed' to be descendants of PKI members, the respondents' judgments became more negative, and their assumptions about commonly shared views of these people became more negative as well. In Studies 3 and 4, participants were again given descriptions of an adult (Study 3) and a child (Study 4), which were both described as descendants of PKI members. Half of the participants were reminded afterwards with a written statement that every human is by nature good and unique (the experimental condition), while the other half did not get any additional information (control group) By making salient a shared and positively valued human 'essence', it was possible to alleviate the stigma that still is attached to PKI-affiliations in Indonesian society. We end the study with a discussion of our findings' political and societal implications.

LA  - English
AB  - Since the mid-1990s, interreligious education has become an integral component of the religious education debate. Regardless of the affective level that interreligious education seeks to provide, the desired changes in attitude and prejudice require one to take into account a diversity of research on attitude and prejudice. Accordingly, the goal of the present article is to encourage the adoption of psychological theories of prejudice with a view to the prospects they offer to interreligious education. However, because the field of psychological prejudice research is complex, we will only be discussing those theories that, firstly, reflect the present state of prejudice psychology and, secondly, are of particular relevance to interreligious education; these are cognitive theories ( accentuation theory, illusory correlation theory, attribution theory), the social identity theory, and social learning theory. Emanating from this review, the article will go on to reflect different strategies of attitude change for interreligious learning.

AB  - Despite prejudice-based harassment's associations with serious physical and mental health risks, research examining multiple forms of harassment among children/adolescents is lacking. This study documents the prevalence of prejudice-based harassment (i.e., harassment on the basis of gender, race/ethnicity, weight or physical appearance, sexual orientation, and disability status) among a large, statewide, school-based Midwestern U.S. sample of 162,034 adolescents. Weight-/appearance-based harassment was most prevalent among both girls (25.3%) and boys (19.8%). Adolescents from certain vulnerable groups experienced higher rates of multiple types of harassment, even when controlling for other sociodemographic characteristics. Prejudice-based harassment experiences are prevalent among adolescent girls and boys. Differential rates of each type of harassment are reported across groups within the corresponding sociodemographic status (e.g., white female adolescents report a significantly lower rate of race-based harassment (4.8%), as compared to Native American (18.6%), mixed/other race (18.9%), Hispanic/Latina (21.5%), Asian/Pacific Islander (24.2%), or Black/African American (24.8%) female adolescents); but a pattern of cross-harassment also is evident, such that differences in prevalence of each harassment type emerge across a variety of statuses (e.g., disability-based harassment was statistically significantly higher among discordant heterosexual (12.7%), gay (13.0%), bisexual (15.3%), and unsure (15.3%) male adolescents than among heterosexual male (7.2%) adolescents).

AB  - Research suggests that threatening men's masculinity can lead to negative attitudes and aggressive behaviors. The current research expands on these findings by examining the effects of masculinity threats on attitudes about social inequality regarding women and gay men. Across studies, we predicted that men whose masculinity was threatened (compared to non-threatening controls) would be more accepting of social inequities that disadvantage women and gay men. Three hundred forty-four male students at a large northeastern U.S. university were randomly assigned to either (a) take a test about gender knowledge (Study 1 and 2) or (b) proofread either a gender knowledge test or university knowledge test (Study 2). Feedback on the test was altered to either threaten or assure masculinity. Following the test or proofreading task, men indicated their discomfort, anger (Study 2 only), and acceptance of discrimination and group-based inequality in society. In both studies identification with gender was measured as a potential moderator. The results of Study 1 (N = 160) showed that the masculinity manipulation only affected denial of discrimination against gay men, but this effect seemed to be related to the salience of gender rather than threatened masculinity. Study 2 (N = 184) added a gender salience comparison for clarification and replicated the results of Study 1, indicating that masculinity threats and assurances have effects independent of gender salience. In Study 1, men who were threatened and highly identified with their gender accepted more group-based inequality. The practical and social implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Recent research shows that extended contact via story reading is a powerful strategy to improve out-group attitudes. We conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees). Results from one experimental intervention with elementary school children and from two cross-sectional studies with high school and university students (in Italy and United Kingdom) supported our main hypothesis. Identification with the main character (i.e., Harry Potter) and disidentification from the negative character (i.e., Voldemort) moderated the effect. Perspective taking emerged as the process allowing attitude improvement. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in the context of extended intergroup contact and social cognitive theory.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to examine whether reported food habits (vegan, vegetarian, or carnivore diet) are associated with right-wing authoritarianism, prejudices against minorities and acceptance of social dominance.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,381 individuals completed validated questionnaires on dietary habits and attitudes. Associations were analysed using analyses of covariance on attitudes, adjusted for age with gender and diet as factors.
   Findings - Of the respondents, 35 per cent reported eating mixed food (including meat and fish), 31 per cent vegetarian food (excluding meat and fish) and 34 per cent vegan food (excluding animal products entirely). Authoritarianism was more frequent in carnivores compared to vegetarians and vegans; this difference was more distinctive in men (mean 2.4 vs 1.9 vs 1.7) than in women (2.2 vs 1.9 vs 1.8). Women with a mixed diet were more inclined to social dominance than vegetarians and vegans (1.8 vs 1.6 vs 1.6). Men with a mixed diet had a stronger tendency to dominance (2.0 vs 1.7 vs 1.5) and prejudices (2.5 vs 2.3 vs 2.1); this difference was less distinct among women (2.2 vs 2.1 vs 2.1).
   Originality/value - This research is of academic value and of value to policy makers and practitioners in the food supply chain. The results show that individuals with vegetarian or vegan diets less frequently report having prejudices against minorities, supporting social dominance and accepting authoritarian structures than individuals with a mixed diet.

AB  - White pre-service and practising teachers in America have been viewed too narrowly in multicultural education research and practice. Multicultural research and multicultural curricula position whites as colour-blind and generally ignorant of any conflicting differences between whites and non-whites. However, this perspective ignores those whites who may have preconceived notions of the differences between themselves and non-whites. This autoethnography describes my own ingrained notions as a white youth in rural America. I explore how unchallenged bigoted ideas can remain hidden, only to re-emerge during the daily interactions of school. My story demonstrates the pervasive nature of white culture when learned at a young age. I provide a discussion of how teacher educators and trainers can approach multicultural education programmes. My multicultural training had only presented me with information about white racial dominance, while my bigoted ideas remained hidden in my consciousness. I needed to have these ideas unearthed and challenged. Whites need to be viewed as a diverse group with diverse needs, including dealing with racial prejudice. Failing to address pre-existing bigoted conceptualisations about diversity could hinder the development of a social justice mentality, which can hinder a teacher's effectiveness when working in a multicultural classroom.

AB  - How do preschool-age children evaluate people with disabilities, and does social contact make children more positive toward those who are different from them? To answer these questions, typically developing (TD) 3- to 5-year-old children completed tasks designed to measure their social preferences for, and judgments about the actions of, unfamiliar individuals with and without disabilities. Participants preferred pictures of TD children over children in wheelchairs, but did not prefer children who were described with disabilities over those who were described with mildly negative facts. In a third task, participants evaluated actions that violated norms more negatively than those that did not, regardless of whether the actors had a disability. Children's participation in inclusion programs did not appear to affect their responses. We consider possible explanations for children's responses-including the absence of social contact effects-in the discussion.

KW  - LAW
AB  - Punitive school discipline procedures have increasingly taken hold in America's schools. While they are detrimental to the wellbeing and to the academic success of all students, they have proven to disproportionately punish minority students, especially African American youth. Such policies feed into wider social issues that, once more, disproportionately affect minority communities: the school-to-prison pipeline, high school dropout rates, the push-out phenomenon, and the criminalization of schools.
   Before such pervasive racial inequality can be addressed effectively, the social and the psychological mechanisms that create racial inequality in the first place must be examined. This Comment offers insights from the field of Critical Race Theory on the root causes for racial inequality in American society more broadly, and in the context of school discipline more specifically. It argues that racial stigmatization, stereotyping, and implicit biases that are based on a long history of racial prejudice in the United States continue to infuse seemingly objective standards of what is considered appropriate behavior, as well as the practices such as punitive school discipline that are used to enforce such standards.
   Because a comprehensive remedy to these systemic issues cannot be expected to come from efforts in the courts, advocates will have to rely on alternative strategies to soften and to reverse the negative impact that punitive school discipline imposes on students, especially minority students. This Comment proposes disciplinary practices based on the concept of Restorative Justice as a promising alternative to current disciplinary policies. It argues that Restorative Justice based disciplinary policies are consistent with core principles of Critical Race Theory and are more conducive to creating a nurturing, safe, and inclusive school environment that not only keeps children in school but also helps to undermine the sources of racial conflict and of racial inequality that have plagued this nation for too long.

T2  - ISIS
LA  - English
KW  - POLITICS
AB  - This essay examines Max Weinreich's efforts to turn culture and personality studies into social and psychological weapons that could be used to combat the effects of prejudice. It focuses on language choice, audience, and purpose in the production of such knowledge by and for a Yiddish-speaking Eastern European population. During the 1930s, Weinreich led the Yiddish Scientific Institute, a research organization headquartered in Poland but affiliated with neither a state nor a university. He was profoundly influenced by a year spent at Yale and a trip through the American South visiting segregated African-American universities. In his 1935 study Der veg tsu undzer yugnt [The Way to Our Youth], Weinreich blended European, Soviet, American, and African-American research traditions to examine the effects of prejudice on child and adolescent development; he also considered the ways members of despised minorities could use such science. In 1940 he fled to New York and in 1946 published Hitler's Professors, the first book analyzing the uses of the human sciences to advance Nazi state-sponsored antisemitism. In examining Weinreich's Yiddish and English writings, this essay explores the broader relationship of social science not only to state power but also to statelessness and powerlessness.

AB  - Forum Theatre (FT), a participatory improvised theatre form, raises consciousness, enables debate and critical reflection, and encourages a democratic form of knowledge production that engages the audience in their own learning and unlearning. I used FT as a platform to understand how 15- to 18-year-old learners, in a co-educational school in the Free State, experience and respond to heterosexism and heteronormativity. In this article, I explore whether FT sessions, based on the sociodramatic theories of Boal, are a sufficient enough construct to challenge heterosexism. Data collected for this article included videotapes of the performances, discussions, and field notes. The FT scenes and subsequent discussions suggest that young people bemoan heterosexism and heteronormativity in their school and demonstrate a commitment to challenge extreme examples of prejudice and behaviour by their teachers and peers, yet ignore or shy away from everyday examples of heterosexist exclusions and privilege. I argue that a participatory process, such as FT, can be a useful construct to challenge heterosexism, but it is not in itself liberatory, as the issues of socialisation, privilege, and context cannot be bypassed simply through 'participation'.

AB  - We tested the internal reliability and predictive validity of a new 4-item Short Social Dominance Orientation (SSDO) scale among adults in 20 countries, using 15 languages (N = 2,130). Low scores indicate preferring group inclusion and equality to dominance. As expected, cross-nationally, the lower people were on SSDO, the more they endorsed more women in leadership positions, protecting minorities, and aid to the poor. Multilevel moderation models showed that each effect was stronger in nations where a relevant kind of group power differentiation was more salient. Distributions of SSDO were positively skewed, despite use of an extended response scale; results show rejecting group hierarchy is normative. The short scale is effective. Challenges regarding translations, use of short scales, and intersections between individual and collective levels in social dominance theory are discussed.

The authors gathered data from 269 heterosexual adults living in Texas. Results indicate that the effects of religious fundamentalism on sexual prejudice were reduced when contact was high. However, the positive association between modern sexism and sexual prejudice was not moderated by contact. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - We conducted a national survey of 786 victim/witness assistants (VWAs) to provide descriptive and attitudinal information about support person use in U. S. legal proceedings involving children. VWAs (N = 414) from 46 states returned completed surveys (response rate = 53%). Prosecutor-based VWAs or parents/guardians most frequently served as support persons. One support person was almost always or often used with child victims and/or witnesses of all ages. Support persons were extremely common in cases involving child sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, and adult domestic violence. Overall, support persons provided more informational than emotional support. The most common informational support was to provide referrals to community resources, conduct courtroom visit/orientation, and disseminate relevant procedural information. The most common emotional support was to accompany the child to trial. Support persons rarely or never questioned children directly during investigative interviews or in court. Respondents believed support persons decrease children's stress and increase accuracy and credibility; however, this effect varied as a function of who provided support, child age, case type, and type of emotional or informational support. Respondents believed that support person presence at trial probably does not prejudice jurors against defendants. These survey data provide a benchmark for legal professionals and a foundation for future social scientific research examining the effects of support person use on children.

AB  - According to current estimates, 68% of the population in United States is considered either overweight or obese. Despite its relative frequency, prejudice and discrimination against overweight and obese Americans is a common occurrence. This study seeks to build on previous findings that overweight individuals are more likely than their skinnier peers to rely on themselves, rather than family, to fund their education. We examined whether this trend continued in car-buying practices. Results suggest that overweight and obese individuals differentially rely on their own sources of income to finance a car, even after controlling for socioeconomic differences. Possible explanations and implications are discussed.

AB  - In exploring the "status boundary enforcement hypothesis," Thomsen, Green and Sidanius (2008) theorized and confirmed that Social Dominance Orientation would be more strongly correlated with a general willingness to aggress against immigrants when respondents are primed with an immigrant who is eager to assimilate into the dominant culture than when they are primed with an immigrant who prefers cultural isolation (separation). However, because assimilation differs from separation on both the home culture component and the host culture component, the actual source of this effect remains unclear. By using an assimilation versus integration contrast that differ only on the home culture component, the present study confirmed and extended Thomsen et al.'s findings. We were able to conclude that this counter intuitive effect, at odds with most research in this area, is primarily driven by people with high SDO having more negative reactions to immigrants' willing to abandon their original cultures rather than to immigrants wanting to maintain contact with the host culture. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores emerging patterns of communication within a multicultural school environment. South Africa consists various and different identities all sharing overlapping living spaces. Diverse cultural identities exist in public spaces, and family units are in many cases so hybrid that very few adolescents can define themselves as originating from one single background. However, social memory within the home environment often dictates a stereotypical prejudice reflecting from the older generations down to their children. A research intervention with video production as the main focal activity is discussed, where learners were encouraged to cross identity borders and move into a Hybrid Border Space with the explicit objective of ensuring that all four participants negotiated out of the perspective of their own cultural identity and background. How each participant saw and experienced her identity, and to what extent such an individual expression formed in a group situation, shed some light on the dynamics of meaning-making in such a particular mix of respondents. Extrapolations from lessons learnt in this specific situation serve as beacons for similar initiatives in a variety of South African youth situations.

AB  - LGBTQIA+ people are often subjected to prejudice, discrimination, and violence in many societies. This sets a barrier for LGBTQIA+ people access to social services. This study was conducted to investigate LGBTQIA+ people access to social services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study findings using convenience sampling and exploration design with participants who identify themselves as LGBTQIA+ (N = 856) show that vast majority of LGBTQIA+ people living in Turkey faced serious problems with accessing social services like housing, social assistance, psycho-social support, and post-violence support mechanisms. Future studies which will investigate experiences of LGBTQIA+ people access to social services will help to make the needs and the problems of the LGBTQIA+ community visible and once awareness is made efforts can be made that contribute to the solution.

AB  - Disparities between the educational outcomes of students of color and their White peers have persisted across decades. Multicultural consultee-centered consultation has the potential to mitigate negative outcomes for students of color by improving the knowledge and skills of teachers. However, more empirical research is needed to understand the role of diversity within the consultative relationship and problem-solving process. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of racial diversity between students and teachers during school-based consultation on the perceptions school psychologists have of collaboration, teacher expectations of students, and student-teacher relationships, as school psychologists commonly serve as school-based consultants. The study employed an experimental design, in which 83 practicing school psychologists were randomly assigned to watch videos of a teacher describing a student referral problem in a racial match or racial mismatch condition. Results suggested school psychologists' perceptions of the collaborative relationship were more positive when students and teachers were Black compared to when they were White. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. Impact Statement This is the only known experimental study conducted in over 20 years to examine the impact of student and teacher racial differences within school-based consultation. Results suggested that school psychologists perceived the collaborative relationship with a teacher to be more positive when both the student and teacher were Black compared to when the student and teacher were White. Given the predominantly White sample, these findings highlight the importance of culturally responsive strategies even when members of the consultation triad are racially matched.

AB  - Gay-fatherhood raises questions about hegemonic gender norms and traditional family systems in different contexts and countries. This study explores gay fathers' desires, motivations, and experiences of having a child. Participants' challenges and concerns regarding having and raising children also were explored. Data were obtained through in-person interviews of 11 self-identified gay fathers. The data were then analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) analysis. The analytical results identified three themes that shed light on participants' desires and experiences of parenthood. These were: (1) innate motives to parent and gender role strains, (2) enacted stigma (i.e., acts of rejection due to sexual orientation and traditional gender roles), and (3) children's social rejection due to their parents' sexuality. The findings of this study stress the influence of contextual factors (stigma) and intrapersonal factors (internalized anti-gay prejudice) in participants' health and well-being. This study potentially tries to expand cultural awareness of research in this field.

AB  - Ageism refers to the stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination towards others or oneself due to age, and it is the most prevalent type of social disadvantage, even more so than those due to gender and race, with negative effects worldwide. Ageism is an evidently real social problem that needs to be addressed and fought. Our study has two main objectives: firstly, to study to what extent programmes, projects or actions have been developed to combat ageism around the world; and secondly, to what extent they have been evaluated via the positive outcomes registered by the participants. Two different information sources were used: (a) a literature review of ageism programmes or interventions; and (b) an online questionnaire sent to international and national institutions surveying their policies or programmes against ageism. Our results show a relatively high number of actions combating ageism but a lack of a systematic evaluation of the outcomes of those actions. In conclusion, first, it is necessary to develop programmes and actions combating ageism, and the evaluation of these programmes is urgently needed in order to identify strategies that truly and effectively tackle ageism. There is a need to urge institutions to perform external evaluations of their anti-ageism social policies and to encourage scientists to conduct randomized and controlled studies.

AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues.

AB  - Existing research into nativist populist (NP) rhetoric has shown that elite outgroups can be used by politicians to further anti-immigration agendas. The social identity functions of elite outgroups outside of cultivating anti-immigrant prejudice, however, remain poorly understood. In addition, whether populist news media can be considered social identity entrepreneurs in their own right remains an underexplored topic. This study examines the rhetorical use of elite outgroups in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia from a social identity perspective, focusing on political leaders and newspapers op-eds. Our findings demonstrate shared strategies across the countries and source types: (1) NPs depict elites as working through collusion to undermine trust in information production within society and vie for control of the ingroup informational influence; (2) NPs present themselves as nonelite and more ingroup prototypical on dimensions relevant to the elite collusion (being under attack and equally susceptible); (3) NPs contest ingroup norms through constructions of an anti-immigrant consensus which is suppressed by elites. We conclude that social identity researchers should pay more attention to the rhetorical functions of elite outgroups in addition to cultivating anti-immigrant prejudice, and that the media-as-identity-entrepreneur is an important aspect of constructing shared social realities, and mobilizing support, within populism.

AB  - Hate speech expresses prejudice and discrimination based on actual or perceived innate characteristics such as gender, race, religion, ethnicity, colour, national origin, disability or sexual orientation. Research has proven that the amount of hateful messages increases inevitably on online social media. Although hate propagators constitute a tiny minority-with less than 1% participants-they create an unproportionally high amount of hate motivated content. Thus, if not countered properly, hate speech can propagate through the whole society. In this paper we apply agent-based modelling to reproduce how the hate speech phenomenon spreads within social networks. We reuse insights from the research literature to construct and validate a baseline model for the propagation of hate speech. From this, three countermeasures are modelled and simulated to investigate their effectiveness in containing the spread of hatred: Education, deferring hateful content, and cyber activism. Our simulations suggest that: (1) Education consititutes a very successful countermeasure, but it is long term and still cannot eliminate hatred completely; (2) Deferring hateful content has a similar-although lower-positive effect than education, and it has the advantage of being a short-term countermeasure; (3) In our simulations, extreme cyber activism against hatred shows the poorest performance as a countermeasure, since it seems to increase the likelihood of resulting in highly polarised societies.

AB  - This questionnaire-based observational study was conducted in July 2020 with the aim of understanding the ethical and social issues faced by health care providers (HCPs) registered with the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine in intensive care units (ICUs) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. There were 200 questionnaire respondents, and we analyzed the responses of 189 members who had been involved in COVID-19 treatment in ICUs. The ethical and social issues that HCPs recognized during the pandemic were difficulties in the decision-making process with patients' families, limitations of life-sustaining treatment, lack of palliative care, and inadequate mental support for patients' families and HCPs. Regarding decision-making on issues of clinical ethics during the pandemic, more than half of the respondents thought they had failed to provide sufficient palliative care to patients and responded that they experienced moral distress. The free-text responses on moral distress revealed issues such as unusual treatment and care, restricted visits, challenging situations for HCPs, and psychological burden. Additionally, 38.1% of respondents experienced episodes of social prejudice or discrimination and 4.7% experienced a shortage of medical resources. Our study result shows that the moral distress of HCPs was caused by difficulties in patient-centered decision-making and insufficient medical care to patients and their families. These were caused mainly by a lack of communication due to the stronger implementation of infection control measures. We believe that it is important to address ethical and social issues during a pandemic in order to provide appropriate medical care and prevent burnout among HCPs.

AB  - This article examines the experiences of Norwegian high school girls with Muslim backgrounds in learning about Islam in religious education (RE). The empirical material consists of observations from a high school class in Norway and interviews with girls in the class. The findings support previous reports that Islam as a topic may be challenging for students with Muslim backgrounds. They also suggest that the RE classroom is a space where religious boundaries can go from blurred to bright as a result of students' reactions to educational content and its foci on Islam. As many teachers find the topic of Islam potentially controversial and thus challenging to teach, this article offers insights that may help teachers to understand and deal with students' reactions in the classroom context.

AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question "Who am I?," was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom.

AB  - Growing polarization in European societies has changed not only political landscapes but also public debates about the past, which has, in turn, had an impact on the way history is taught and talked about in schools. This article explores how these trends are experienced by history educators across Europe and asks which issues history educators perceive to be controversial and sensitive and how they approach the prejudices they frequently encounter when addressing controversial and sensitive issues. Based on focus group discussions with 33 participants from 25 European countries, the article identifies three different forms of prejudice and describes how the focus group participants tried to undermine nationalism, counter xenophobia and fight anti-Semitism. Interpreted from a practice theory perspective, the examples shared by the focus group participants indicate that teaching strategies from the disciplinary approach "toolbox" can help to undermine nationalist stereotypical thinking if they are fine-tuned to the interests and emotions of the learning group and that history teaching routines shaped by the disciplinary approach need to be interrupted on occasion in order to reflect on and deconstruct xenophobic or anti-Semitic prejudice. Overall, the article argues that history teachers need to be aware of the affective dimension of historical learning, including underlying or open prejudices held by students, in order to support the teaching of democratic education goals such as respect and openness to cultural otherness.

AB  - The current context of growing religious and cultural diversity requires, from societies, an adequate management of the expression of religious diversity in different social spheres, including the workplace. Muslim women who wear the hijab are one of the social groups that most frequently suffer prejudice and discrimination in work settings due to the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination, including gender, ethnic origin, religion and the use of a visible religious symbol. With the aim of exploring the experiences of Muslim women with hijab and identifying barriers and opportunities in their access to employment in Catalonia (Spain), a qualitative study with a communicative orientation was conducted, involving twelve communicative daily-life stories with Muslim women who wear the hijab and eleven in-depth interviews with a communicative orientation with other relevant actors in the fields of training and employment (employers, managers of internship programs, political representatives, etc.). The findings revealed some pending challenges and effective pathways to improve the employment and social inclusion of Muslim women wearing the hijab. The implications of the study point to the need to incorporate respect for diversity as a necessary value to move towards more inclusive societies.

AB  - What role does intergroup contact play in promoting support for social change toward greater social equality? Drawing on the needs-based model of reconciliation, we theorized that when inequality between groups is perceived as illegitimate, disadvantaged group members will experience a need for empowerment and advantaged group members a need for acceptance. When intergroup contact satisfies each group's needs, it should result in more mutual support for social change. Using four sets of survey data collected through the Zurich Intergroup Project in 23 countries, we tested several preregistered predictions, derived from the above reasoning, across a large variety of operationalizations. Two studies of disadvantaged groups (Ns = 689 ethnic minority members in Study 1 and 3,382 sexual/gender minorities in Study 2) support the hypothesis that, after accounting for the effects of intergroup contact and perceived illegitimacy, satisfying the need for empowerment (but not acceptance) during contact is positively related to support for social change. Two studies with advantaged groups (Ns = 2,937 ethnic majority members in Study 3 and 4,203 cis-heterosexual individuals in Study 4) showed that, after accounting for illegitimacy and intergroup contact, satisfying the need for acceptance (but also empowerment) is positively related to support for social change. Overall, findings suggest that intergroup contact is compatible with efforts to promote social change when group-specific needs are met. Thus, to encourage support for social change among both disadvantaged and advantaged group members, it is essential that, besides promoting mutual acceptance, intergroup contact interventions also give voice to and empower members of disadvantaged groups.

AB  - Social workers often address the emotional needs of family caregivers, which are particularly salient during the decision-making process regarding the choice of a living environment for a relative with dementia. In most home care settings, an assessment of caregivers' needs is not part of routine practices. This study aims to describe the intervention strategies adopted by social workers in relation to caregivers' emotions during their decision-making process. A qualitative research design was adopted. Seven social workers were recruited from three health and community service facilities in Montreal, Canada. One group and three individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data was analyzed using Miles, Huberman and Saldatia's method (2013). Seven intervention strategies were identified: investigating emotions, acknowledging emotions, encouraging caregivers to carry on their role, focusing on the rational aspects of the decision, mitigating prejudices against nursing homes, mediating family dynamics and acting upon families' needs. Some of these strategies are aimed at social workers meeting the demands of their jobs whilst others are centered around soothing caregiver emotions. These results can inform support services and future interventions by grounding them in the realities of service providers.

AB  - Social psychology suggests that racism, as captured by explicit prejudice and racial discrimination, is perceived negatively in the United States. However, considering the hierarchy-enhancing nature of racism, it may be that negative perceptions of racism are attenuated among perceivers high in anti-egalitarian sentiment. The reported studies support this, suggesting that racist candidates were tolerated more and had relatively greater hireability ratings as a function of perceivers' social dominance orientation (SDO; Studies 1-4). Candidate race did not impact these evaluations-only the hierarchy relevance of their actions did (i.e., whether the candidate's behavior was hierarchy enhancing or had no clear implication for the hierarchy; Study 2). Furthermore, anti-racist candidates (e.g., those displaying hierarchy-attenuating behavior) were tolerated less and had lower hireability ratings as a function of perceivers' SDO (Study 3). Finally, the perceived intentionality of the candidate's actions affected tolerance toward them as a function of SDO. This suggests hierarchy relevance impacts evaluative outcomes.

AB  - Drawing on studies showing that arguments about the nature of intergroup prejudice allow members of privileged groups to 'perform' a positive social identity, the present study explores how arguments about the nature of prejudice are produced by targets of prejudice in order to consolidate or challenge their own social identity. We conducted interviews with Bulgarian Roma and, based on a discursive psychology approach, analysed the way participants contested being assigned to a Roma-exclusive identity category, which they treated as produced by prejudiced beliefs of the non-Roma high-status majority population. Positive intergroup contact was used to demonstrate the absence of prejudice and counter Roma identity threat. Auto-stereotyping and disidentification, in turn, revealed how one's own situation is distinguished from the group. We discuss how identity performances founded on prejudice constructions work to maintain or challenge intergroup boundaries. We conclude that studies revealing prejudice constructions of minority groups can explain the sedative effect of positive intergroup contact on ethnic activism and help to reflect on integration strategies that would be compatible with social change in favour of disadvantaged minority groups.

AB  - Research suggests that people attribute more negative traits to individuals with obesity than to non-obese individuals, and that females with obesity are seen more negatively than males. The theory also suggests that stereotypes are cognitive predecessors of prejudices. The aims of this research were to examine the latent structure underlying anti-fat stereotypical traits, differences in perceiving individuals with obesity and non-obese individuals, male and female individuals with obesity, as well as the role of anti-fat stereotypes in anti-fat prejudices. The sample consisted of 106 respondents (Male = 16; Female = 86; Mean age = 19.98), who graded stimuli photographs of male and female individuals (with obesity and average-weight) on series of anti-fat stereotypical traits on two occasions, and filled in Anti-fat prejudices questionnaire. The data were analyzed through EFA and CFA, ANOVA, and structural equation modeling (moderation). Four factors behind stereotypical traits were extracted: Positive social image, Perceived lack of self-care, Perceived persistence, and Antipathy. It has been shown that respondents gave stimuli photographs of individuals with obesity lower scores on Positive social image and Perceived persistence, and higher scores on Perceived lack of self-care and Antipathy. The same results were obtained for females within the subsample of individuals with obesity. Furthermore, it has been shown that certain anti-fat stereotypes (Positive social image, Perceived lack of self-care, and Perceived persistence) predict anti-fat prejudices, and that gender was a significant moderator of the effect of Perceived lack of self-care on anti-fat prejudices. We can conclude that individuals with obesity are indeed seen in a more negative light than non-obese individuals, and that this is more pronounced for females with obesity, which is in accordance with previous studies. Moreover, the results suggest the possible role of anti-fat stereotypes as cognitive predecessors of anti-fat prejudices, and that gender of individuals with obesity has an effect on this relationship.

AB  - Prejudices can lead to discrimination, social exclusion, and violence particularly among young male adults. Previous findings suggest that the degree of holding prejudices is linked to low levels of empathy, while low levels of empathy have been associated with alexithymia, the inability to experience one?s own feelings. We tested the hypothesis that the impact of a lack of empathy on reporting blatant and subtle prejudices is moderated by the inability to identify one?s own feelings. In a sample of n = 136 young male adults aged 21 years (mean = 21.5 years; sd = 0.3), we conducted correlation and moderator analyses to determine possible relationships between prejudices, empathy, and alexithymia as assessed by self-report questionnaires. Prejudices were assessed by the Blatant and Subtle Prejudice Scale (BSPS), empathy was assessed by the German modified version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and alexithymia by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Self-reported empathy levels were correlated with the strength of subtle and blatant prejudices. The moderation analyses revealed that the negative association between empathy and subtle prejudice increased with decreasing alexithymia. The negative association between empathy and blatant prejudice, on the other hand, was significant only for participants with low levels of alexithymia. These results suggest that empathy can limit the expression of blatant and to some degree also subtle prejudice when subjects are capable to identify their own feelings in a group of young males.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the obesity related prejudices and negative attitudes of university students who study in health and non-health fields. Subjective and Methods: This is a descriptive study conducted to determine the obesity prejudice levels of students studying in health and social fields. A total of 732 students (577 females, 155 males) of different faculties of a university participated in the study voluntarily. The Prejudice was measured with Obesity Prejudice Scale (OPS). Analysis of Variance and Covariance were used to investigate relationships between of OPS scores and factors. Results: A total of 732 students, 577 (78.8%) females and 155 (21.2%) males, participated in this study, which was conducted to determine obesity prejudices of university students. According to their mean OPS scores, 18.4% of the students were found to be unprejudiced, 55.1% prone to be prejudiced, and 26.5% prejudiced. The intragroup comparisons of mean OPS scores of health and social field students indicated that the differences between the prejudiced and the unprejudiced were statistically highly significant (p<0.0001). Conclusions: In order to prevent the development of internalized obesity prejudices emerging as a result of prejudices against obese individuals in the society and their stigmatization, this problem must be solved at an early age, especially during university education. It is necessary that state policies should be established to monitor the attitudes of individuals towards obesity, people should be educated and supervised on this subject, and that further research representing the society on this topic should be conducted.

AB  - When schools present texts through their explicit curricula, they infuse those stories with a certain perceived value (Eisner, 2002). When those accounts all ring with the same voice, they promote the merit of those people represented over those excluded (Haslem, 1998). In this study, we explored how White high school students responded to independently reading and discussing interracial literary fiction in an online forum. Drawing on narrative empathy and imagined intergroup contact theory, the study employed a theoretical framework based on critical reflection and reader response theory. The participants in this study were randomly assigned to White-normative male canon or interracial literary fiction groups, from which they selected texts and subgroups. Over the course of three weeks, the students independently read their books before engaging in an online discussion with their subgroups. In a qualitative analysis, we analyzed those discussions to explore how students responded to their texts. This study suggests that White high school seniors who read interracial literary fiction can achieve the same goals as their counterparts who read a White-normative canon; however, they also may explore issues of discrimination and prejudice-even independent of direct teacher intervention.

AB  - Structured interviews with 227 social workers in Turkey categorized ethical problems in the work place. An inductive content analysis categorized nine themes (dual relationships, threats by clients, worker bias leading to prejudice, child custody issues, fraudulent use of state funds, procedural tensions, coercion by authorities, confidentiality, and taking people into state care) that required problem-solving strategies on the part of the social workers. The results indicated that when confronted with ethical situations the path for deliberation was not always clear, many decisions were made in consultation, whereas others were made independently. Future recommendations include advocating for education and training that utilizes ethical decision-making principles when problem-solving, as well as, stressing the importance of clear guidelines for seeking and utilizing supportive consultation.

KW  - welfare reform
AB  - This commentary discusses the implications of the changes made to the social security system by the UK government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government did not veer from its programme of welfare reform. However, emergency legislation made significant concessions including: an increase in the value of the UK's main means-tested benefit Universal Credit, more favourable eligibility rules for the self-employed, a reduced conditionality regime, and an increase in the level of housing support.
   This paper argues that although the UK government's COVID-19 social security response was necessary, it did not go far enough. A temporary lifting of some prejudicial elements of the social security system was welcome but this still leaves an overly complex system characterised by unacceptable delays in payment, inadequate support for many vulnerable groups, and inconsistent experiences for recipients of different benefits.

AB  - Sexual prejudice is a negative attitude toward an individual due to their belonging to a group defined by sexual minority behaviors, attractions, or orientations. As no studies assessing sexual prejudice levels among self-identified politicians have been conducted in Portugal, this study was carried out to address this gap in the literature. In addition, we sought to compare differences in levels of sexual prejudice by gender, religiosity, and political orientation. The sample consisted of 302 self-identified active politicians in Portugal, of whom 157 were men (52%) and 145 were women (48%), with an average age of 45.98 years. Study measurement instruments included a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Sexual Prejudice Scale in the Portuguese Political Context. Participants responded to this study's outreach online, and they received emails that referred them directly to the online survey. The principal results show that, despite moderate overall levels of sexual prejudice among the sample, men and participants with right-wing general, social, and fiscal political views demonstrated significantly higher sexual prejudice scores. Negative levels of political engagement and negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men were significant predictors of sexual prejudice. It is very important to raise awareness of this phenomenon among both politicians and the general public, so that it can be addressed accordingly.

AB  - Background: The study of adolescents' behaviours and attitudes is crucial to define interventions for the containment of deviance and social discomfort. New ways of social interaction are crystallising violent behaviours which are moving more than ever on a virtual sphere. Bullying and cyberbullying share a common behavioural matrix that has been outlined through specific environmental and individual characteristics. Methods: A survey carried out in Italy in 2019 on a statistical sample of 3273 students highlighted the influence of several social and individual variables on deviant phenomena. Risk and protective factors in relation to the probability of involvement in bullying and cyberbullying have been shown through a bivariate analysis and a binary logistic regression model. Results: The study shows that presence of stereotypes and social prejudices, tolerance to violence and high levels of self-esteem have resulted as the main risk factors. On the other hand, low levels of tolerance related to the consumption of alcohol and drugs, high levels of trust towards family and friends and being female have been identified as protective factors. Conclusions: This research confirms the validity of several theories on bullying and cyberbullying phenomena. Furthermore, it identifies specific risk and protective factors and their influence on deviant behaviours, with a focus on environmental characteristics which appear as the key field of work to enhance adolescents' well-being.

AB  - Antisemitism, one of the oldest forms of prejudice and oppression is surging throughout the world. It ranges from verbal abuse to the destruction of property to murder. In the last two years, attacks against Jews in the United States were the overwhelming target of religion-based hate crimes. Stereotypes and myths continue to fuel prejudice and antisemitism in society. Factors such as anti-Israel sentiments, remarks by persons in power, the use of social media, white nationalism, and even the Covid 19 pandemic have contributed to its escalation.
   As a result of the increasing violence, the U.S. legislature held a hearing on confronting antisemitic terrorism with one outcome being that social workers and community advocates were needed to join law enforcement in the effort to heal and work for justice. Social work with its mandate to promote social justice and human rights and challenge oppression cannot ignore antisemitism and its impact on individuals and societies. However, the subject is basically ignored in the curriculum. This paper offers a brief history of antisemitism and presents guidelines and models for integrating it into social work programs.

AB  - Based on the Dual Process Model (DPM), this study investigates the relationship among the perception of in-group threats, conservative ideologies (social dominance orientation, SDO, and right-wing authoritarianism, RWA), prejudice, and prosocial behavioural intentions (PBI) towards asylum seekers. A sample of 200 people living in Italy answered an anonymous questionnaire administered using a cross-sectional design. The results partially supported the DPM's expectations while also showing, however, some unexpected effects with respect to behavioural intentions to help asylum seekers. As predicted by the DPM, the perception of in-group threats, whether realistic or symbolic, directly and indirectly (via SDO and RWA) affected prejudice against asylum seekers. SDO and RWA did not have a direct effect on behavioural intentions but their effects were totally mediated by prejudice. This is a novel finding and suggests that conservative ideologies can positively affect people's behaviour but only through a decreased attitudinal disposition towards asylum seekers. The theoretical and practical implications derived from the data are discussed.

AB  - Theorizing from humanistic and motivational literatures suggests attitude change may occur because high quality listening facilitates the insight needed to explore and integrate potentially threatening information relevant to the self. By extension, self-insight may enable attitude change as a result of conversations about prejudice. We tested whether high quality listening would predict attitudes related to speakers' prejudices and whether self-insight would mediate this effect. Study 1 (preregistered) examined scripted conversations characterized by high, regular, and poor listening quality. In Study 2, we manipulated high versus regular listening quality in the laboratory as speakers talked about their prejudiced attitudes. Finally, Study 3 (preregistered) used a more robust measure of prejudiced attitudes to test whether perceived social acceptance could be an alternative explanation to Study 2 findings. Across these studies, the exploratory (pilot study and Study 2) and confirmatory (Studies 1 & 3) findings were in line with expectations that high, versus regular and poor, quality listening facilitated lower prejudiced attitudes because it increased self-insight. A meta-analysis of the studies (N = 952) showed that the average effect sizes for high quality listening (vs. comparison conditions) on selfinsight, openness to change and prejudiced attitudes were, ds = 1.19, 0.46, 0.32 95%CIs [0.73, 1.51], [0.29, 0.63] [0.12, 0.53], respectively. These results suggest that when having conversations about prejudice, highquality listening modestly shapes prejudice following conversations about it, and underscore the importance of self-insight and openness to change in this process.

AB  - Friendship may be significantly associated with adolescents' psychological well-being. Among various kinds of friendships, this study investigated two types of intergroup friendships among Chinese adolescents, specifically cross-hukou-location and cross-gender friendship. Fixed-effects modeling with a two-wave national dataset-the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS)-was performed to evaluate the relationship between within-individual changes in cross-hukou-location friendship, cross-gender friendship, and mental health status (N = 5,297, boys: 50.18%, average age: 12.92 atwave 1). The relationship pattern among different genders was also explored. The results showed that cross-hukou-location friendship is positively associated with male adolescents' mental health status. The cross-gender relationship is negatively related to mental health in the overall sample and female subsample. The findings not only emphasized the vital role of intergroup contact but also shed light on understanding the role of gender in intergroup friendship-making and the relationship with psychological well-being.

AB  - Educators and social workers are essential to promote the social and digital inclusion of people with intellectual disability. Their perceptions about Internet use by people with intellectual disability may lead to prejudices that can hinder the opportunity of this group to get equal and meaningful access to the virtual arena. To identify potential prejudices among future professionals and to determine their initial training needs, a cross-sectional survey study was conducted. The aim was to examine and compare 433 education and social work students' perceptions about Internet use by people with and without intellectual disability, in terms of online benefits, risks and safety. Results showed that students perceived the Internet to be more beneficial, but also riskier and less safe, for people with intellectual disability than for the general population. Differences were observed with regard to gender, university degree and frequency of contact with people with intellectual disability and a positive relationship was found between students' Internet use and their perceived online benefits, risks and safety. These findings highlight the need for initial training programs that overcome future professionals' prejudices towards people with intellectual disability and their capability to use the Internet safely.

AB  - It has been suggested that physical education (PE) teachers hold strong anti-fat attitudes and that these can have an impact on the health of their students. In this study, we compare the attitudes and stereotypes towards obesity of PE teachers with those of their colleagues who teach mathematics. In addition, we evaluated the association between the teachers' anti-fat biases and the level of physical activity (PA) of their students. The sample consisted of 81 PE teachers and 75 mathematics teachers. The adolescent sample consisted of 1792 secondary school students. The assessment of attitudes and stereotypes was conducted with the Implicit Association Test and the Anti-Fat Attitudes questionnaire. The PA level of the adolescents was determined by a self-administered instrument. PE and mathematics teachers showed similar biases, except for the automatic obesity-laziness association, which was stronger for PE teachers than for mathematics teachers. These distinctive implicit stereotypes of PE teachers were also significant predictors of the lack of PA in adolescents. We recommend the use of interventions aimed at reducing non-traditional forms of prejudice in teachers.

AB  - The present set of studies investigated the role of being religious in the prediction of various forms of prejudice. Following the threat-constraint model, we predicted that contexts characterized by high threat attenuate-or constrain-the relationship between individual differences in being religious on the one hand and antigay prejudice and sexism on the other. A worldwide investigation of these regional constraints was conducted in the Americas Barometer (125,984 individuals nested in 20 countries; Study 1), the World Values Survey (69,798 individuals nested in 45 countries; Study 2), and the European Social Survey (44,386 individuals nested in 274 Nomenclature des Unites Territoriales Statistiques regions; Study 3). Results identify a key moderating role of Hofstede's cultural dimensions, revealing strong associations between religion and prejudice in regions low in power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and collectivism, whereas the religion-prejudice association is constrained (i.e., weaker and often absent) in regions high on those cultural dimensions.

AB  - Selfish behaviors widely occur in adolescence and can be detrimental to adolescents' moral development and social well-being. However, little is known about the antecedents of selfish behaviors among adolescents in collectivist samples (e.g., East Asia). As social dominance orientation (SDO) is negatively related to morality and concerns about others, we aim to understand whether and how individual differences in SDO predict people's intention to engage in selfish behaviors among Chinese adolescents. We hypothesize that people high in SDO would display higher level of psychological entitlement and, in turn, be more likely to engage in selfish behaviors. To examine this hypothesis, we measured SDO, psychological entitlement, and selfish behavioral intentions using hypothetical scenarios among 254 middle school students aged 12-18 years in China. The results demonstrated that, compared to middle school students low in SDO, those high in SDO reported stronger selfish behavioral intentions, and this effect was partially mediated by psychological entitlement. Directions for future research and implications for interventions to curb selfish behaviors among adolescents are discussed.

AB  - When international conflicts arise, there are numerous ways of resolving them-1 of which is war. The study of attitudes toward war as a method of conflict resolution can therefore reveal interesting and valuable information. Previous research has shown a strong positive relationship between right-wing authoritarianism and attitudes toward war. However, the relationship between social dominance orientation, which predicts social and political attitudes, and attitudes toward military campaigns varies from 1 research study to another. In this study, we used a modified method of measuring social dominance orientation, taking into account the specifics of international relations. Using the cognitive-motivational dual-process model of prejudices, we hypothesized that dangerous and competitive world beliefs are linked to right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation in international relations, which, in turn, are related to attitudes toward war as a method of international conflict resolution. We measured social worldviews, ideological orientations, and attitudes toward war among Russian adults (N = 897). Structural equation modeling confirmed the hypotheses but also revealed that social worldviews are linked to attitudes toward war not only through ideological orientations but also directly. In addition, it showed that the link between social worldviews, ideological orientations, and attitudes toward war is moderated by the gender and age of the study's participants. The implications of the results for conceptions of the cognitive-motivational dual-process model of prejudices are discussed.

AB  - Jamaica has been called one of the world's most anti-gay countries. However, little empirical research has investigated methods of reducing this prejudice. Intergroup contact-(positive) interaction with someone from a different social group-is one of the most widely tested and strongly favored methods of reducing prejudice. However, the role of contact in this specific context is not clear, particularly the relative importance of contact compared to other variables that predict (less) prejudice. This current cross-sectional research investigated that question using a large, representative sample of Jamaican participants (N = 942). As in prior research, contact predicted less anti-gay prejudice, and the (negative) relationship between contact and anti-gay behaviors was mediated by intergroup anxiety and attitudes, even when other important predictors were taken into account. However, contact was a less important predictor than gender, education, or religiosity. Implications for intergroup contact and prejudice-reduction strategies in Jamaica are discussed.

AB  - We performed a multilevel, multinational analysis of the 2014 European Social Survey dataset (N = 33,597, nested in 19 countries) to study how individual conservative values and cultural embeddedness moderate the link between contact with immigrants and the attitudes toward them. A combination of frequency and positivity of contact with immigrants showed a negative association with ethnic prejudice while, conversely, participants' conservative basic values were directly and positively associated with prejudice. National cultural embeddedness was not associated with the dependent variable. Neither individual conservative values nor cultural embeddedness moderated the association between contact and prejudice. Strengths, limitations, implications and future directions of this study are discussed.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the efficacy of two cartoons which depict autistic characters in improving attitudes towards autistic peers in two separate studies. Forty-six children participated in study 1 (4-7 years), and 47 children participated in study 2 (8-11 years). Both the conative (behavioural) component of attitudes and knowledge about autism were measured before and after the cartoon interventions. Knowledge of autism increased after watching the cartoons in both studies but attitudes to autism only improved in study 1. Knowledge was shown to correlate with change in some but not all attitude measures. The findings suggest that cartoons can improve attitudes to autism, but this may depend on how information is presented.

AB  - This paper focuses on how to use critical reflection in social work education in order to encourage students to critically reflect on their standards regarding assessment, opinions and values about aging. Material, both oral and written, from needs assessments of older persons conducted by 106 social work students was analyzed. The result shows that the students initially interpreted needs based on prejudice and assumptions about aging. However, when using Schon ' s three steps of reflection in the exercise, together with knowledge of critical social work theories, students became more concerned and reflected more critically on their assessments. This study shows the possibilities of working with pedagogical exercises in order to increase the awareness and critical knowledge of social work students in order to attempt to reduce discrimination. Educating students in critical social work enables them to learn how to comment on and transform the profession of social work and our unjust society, while questioning their own as well as society's prejudice regarding the needs of elderly persons.

AB  - Recent advances in social psychological research have shown that national integration policies influence how immigrants are perceived and treated by the mainstream population. However, the processes by which these policies come to have an impact on prejudice and well-being of the general population are largely unknown. Moreover, past research has often relied on unrepresentative samples limiting generalizability. The present research proposes that when the national integration policies of a given society are perceived as clearly defined and coherent, they have a direct impact on the perceived cultural norm related to those national integration policies. In turn, the perceived cultural norm affects personal attitudes toward cultural norms (i.e., the degree to which individuals support a given policy), which influence the level of anti-immigrant prejudice as well as psychological well-being. Findings from two correlational studies with representative samples of the mainstream population conducted in France on the policy of secularism (N = 940) and in Quebec on the policy of interculturalism (N = 912) supported the proposed theoretical model.

AB  - The state of affairs of some studies concerning Romani groups' conversions throughout the world to the global evangelical movement, and the subtext that prevails in such studies, could reveal a persistence of "enlightened prejudice" towards the nature of religions, namely, a kind of suspicion and authoritarianism that continues to tacitly fuel hostility against emerging religious phenomena, and the tendency of analysts to share, consciously or unconsciously, the language of the State, producing a negative vision of the Romani world. The creativity and autonomy exhibited by Romani Evangelism, which stays away from external financing and, generally speaking, policies of minority promotion, contribute to a vast trans-regional network of congregations, that aim towards an unprecedented global pan-Romanism with a strong social base. This is a response to a historic diaspora, and, in turn, a new form of the secular Romani diaspora.

AB  - Culturally diverse schools may constitute natural arenas for training crucial intercultural skills. We hypothesized that a classroom cultural diversity climate fostering contact and cooperation and multiculturalism, but not a climate fostering color-evasion, would be positively related to adolescents' intercultural competence. Adolescents in North Rhine-Westphalia (N = 631, M-age = 13.69 years, 49% of immigrant background) and Berlin (N = 1,335, M-age = 14.69 years, 52% of immigrant background) in Germany reported their perceptions of the classroom cultural diversity climate and completed quantitative and qualitative measures assessing their intercultural competence. Multilevel structural equation models indicate that contact and cooperation, multiculturalism, and, surprisingly, also color-evasion (as in emphasizing a common humanity), were positively related to the intercultural competence of immigrant and non-immigrant background students. We conclude that all three aspects of the classroom climate are uniquely related to aspects of adolescents' intercultural competence and that none of them may be sufficient on their own.

AB  - Previous research revealed that cognitive abilities are negatively related to right-wing and prejudiced attitudes. No study has, however, investigated if emotional abilities also show such a relationship, although this can be expected based on both classic and recent literature. The aim of the present study was 2-fold: (a) to investigate the relationship between emotional abilities and right-wing and prejudiced attitudes, and (b) to pit the effects of emotional and cognitive abilities on these attitudes against each other. Results from 2 adult samples (n = 409 and 574) in which abilities scores were collected in individual testing sessions, revealed that emotional abilities are significantly and negatively related to social-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, as well as to blatant ethnic prejudice. These relationships were as strong as those found for cognitive abilities. For economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, emotional abilities were even the only significant correlate. It is therefore concluded that the study of emotional abilities has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of right-wing and prejudiced attitudes.

AB  - This paper introduces the topic of the internal coordination of regional and local social security schemes in Spain. In the field of social security, the constitutional framework imposes different solutions in terms of the division of competences between State and Autonomous Communities, depending on the branch of (public) social protection. In the provision of long-term social care, for instance, both the State and the Autonomous Communities participate. Healthcare services are mainly provided by the Autonomous Communities without prejudice to certain aspects of the role played by the State. Social assistance through cash benefits or social services are exclusively provided by the Autonomous Communities, with the deep participation of local entities, especially in the case of social services. The paper outlines the extent of devolution and decentralisation, and the adjudication of competence and financial arrangements. The final section addresses some specific questions in healthcare, long-term social care and social assistance.

AB  - The literature on health inequalities often uses measures of socio-economic position pragmatically to rank the population to describe inequalities in health rather than to understand social and economic relationships between groups. Theoretical considerations about the meaning of different measures, the social processes they describe, and how these might link to health are often limited. This paper builds upon Wright's synthesis of social class theories to propose a new integrated model for understanding social class as applied to health. This model incorporates several social class mechanisms: social background and early years' circumstances; Bourdieu's habitus and distinction; social closure and opportunity hoarding; Marxist conflict over production (domination and exploitation); and Weberian conflict over distribution. The importance of discrimination and prejudice in determining the opportunities for groups is also explicitly recognised, as is the relationship with health behaviours. In linking the different social class processes we have created an integrated theory of how and why social class causes inequalities in health. Further work is required to test this approach, to promote greater understanding of researchers of the social processes underlying different measures, and to understand how better and more comprehensive data on the range of social class processes these might be collected in the future.

AB  - Why are certain individuals persistent in opposing immigration? The behavioral immune system framework implies that a psychological mechanism, which adapted to detect and avoid pathogen threats, is also reflected in contemporary social attitudes. Moreover, prejudice towards outgroups might be partially driven by implicit pathogen concerns related to the perceived dissimilarity with these groups' hygiene and food preparation practices. Disgust, a universal core emotion supposedly evolved to avoid pathogen threats, as well as olfaction, both play a pivotal role in evoking disgust. In an online study (N = 800), we investigated whether individual differences in body odor disgust sensitivity (BODS) correlate with negative attitudes towards a fictive refugee group. The data analysis plan and hypotheses were preregistered. Results show that body odor disgust sensitivity is associated with xenophobia: BODS was positively associated with negative attitudes towards the fictive group. This relationship was partially mediated by perceived dissimilarities of the group in terms of hygiene and food preparation. Our finding suggests prejudice might be rooted in sensory mechanisms.

AB  - Extensive research explores how increasing ethnic out-group populations in society affects inter-group attitudes. Drawing on the threat and contact hypotheses, this study develops and tests a framework examining the role of segregation in the out-group size/prejudice relationship. We suggest that whether increasing minority share in a community generates processes of contact and/or perceived threat will depend on how segregated groups are from one another. This, in turn, will determine when high minority share communities have positive, negative, or null effects on inter-group attitudes. Using data from white British individuals in England, we observe that community segregation moderates the effect of community percent non-white British on prejudice, as well as mechanisms of positive inter-group contact and perceived threat. Residents of more homogeneous communities report relatively warm inter-group attitudes, regardless of how segregated they are. Residents living among high proportions of out-group where the groups are integrated report an improvement in out-group attitudes. It is only residents living among large out-group populations where groups are more segregated from one anotheruat the nexus of high minority share and high segregationuwho report colder out-group attitudes. This higher prejudice is driven by both lower positive contact and higher perceived threat in these communities. Using two waves of cohort panel data, longitudinal analysis provides more robust evidence in support of the diversity-segregation nexus framework: communities becoming more ethnically mixed and segregated see prejudice increase, while those becoming more mixed and integrated see stable, or somewhat improving, relations. Collectively, this paper shows that mechanisms of positive contact and threat appear conditional on both the size of out-groups in an area and how segregated groups are from one another, generating key differences in when and how increasing ethnic out-group size affects inter-group relations.

AB  - Drawing from the literature on sexual stigma, the principal aim of this study was to investigate predictors of heterosexual's internalization of negative attitudes regarding lesbian and gay parenting and the mediating role of beliefs in the controllability of homosexuality. A Portuguese sample of 1,430 heterosexual women and 502 heterosexual men responded to an online questionnaire about attitudes toward lesbian and gay parenting. Structural equation modeling was used to explore attitudinal predictors and mediation analysis. Mediation analyses revealed that sexual prejudice toward same-gender-parented families was predicted by gender, age, education, and religiosity, in that heterosexual men, those who were older, had less education, and were more religious held significantly more negative beliefs about lesbian and gay parenting, as well as lower perception of benefits associated with lesbian and gay parenting. Further, etiological beliefs mediated the effects of gender, age, and religiosity on sexual attitudes, highlighting the importance of the perception of controllability of homosexuality in justifying sexual prejudice.

AB  - Despite the rapid increase in lesbian and gay (LG) people who desire and decide to become parents, LG childless individuals may encounter serious obstacles in the parenthood process, such as minority stress. Notwithstanding, the psychological processes by which prejudice events might affect the desire to become parents are still understudied. As an extension of the minority stress theory, the psychological mediation framework sheds light on these psychological processes, as it encompasses a more clinical view of stress. Within this framework, the current study aimed at assessing the role of prejudice events in affecting parenting desire in 290 childless Italian LG individuals (120 lesbians and 170 gay men), as well as the role of internalized heterosexism and sexual orientation concealment in mediating the relationship between prejudice events and parenting desire. The results suggest that only in lesbians prejudice events were negatively associated with parenting desire, and that sexual orientation concealment and internalized heterosexism were also negatively associated with parenting desire. Furthermore, sexual orientation concealment, and not internalized heterosexism, mediated the relationship between prejudice events and parenting desire in lesbians, but not gay men. The findings have important implications for clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: Seventy gay fathers through surrogacy, 125 lesbian mothers through donor insemination, and 195 heterosexual parents through spontaneous conception, all with children aged 3 to 11 years and living in Italy, were compared on children's psychological adjustment and prosocial behavior, as well as parental self-efficacy, dyadic adjustment, family cohesion, and flexibility. Associations among family structures, family processes, and child health outcomes were also tested. Methods: Participants were matched for child characteristics. Self-report questionnaires were administered through an online survey to the parent who identified as most involved with the child on a day-to-day basis. Multivariate analyses of variance and multiple linear regressions were conducted. Results: Children of gay fathers and lesbian mothers were reported as showing fewer psychological problems than children of heterosexual parents. Irrespective of the family type, girls were reported as more prosocial than boys. With respect to parental dimensions, gay fathers described themselves as more competent and satisfied with their couple relationship than did heterosexual parents; they also reported higher levels of family cohesion and flexibility than did lesbian mothers and heterosexual parents. The effect of the family type was not predictive of child health outcomes once family process variables were taken into account. Conclusion: Findings suggested that children with same-sex parents fare well both in terms of psychological adjustment and prosocial behavior. The present study warns policy makers against making assumptions on the basis of sexual orientation about people who are more suited than others to be parents or about people who should or should not be denied access to fertility treatments.

AB  - The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) in Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage throughout all US states and territories. Before that decision, after, and 1 year later, this successive-independent samples study identified clusters of individuals across the US based on worldview ideologies and used those clusters to examine effects of the SCOTUS decision on support for gay rights and sexual prejudice. Participants were 407 adults from 49 US states and territories. A cluster analysis identified three worldview groups: conservatives (23.6%), moderates (30.2%), and progressives (46.2%). Although no overall changes emerged over time in support for gay rights or sexual prejudice, the conservative group showed a marked polarization after the SCOTUS decision, becoming less supportive of gay rights and more prejudiced. Worldviews explained 68.3% of the variance in same-sex marriage support, 67.5% in gay rights support, and 68.8% in sexual prejudice, effects approaching nearly three times a large-sized effect in the social sciences. These findings add nuance to our understanding of the attitudinal impact of court decisions or legislation around progressive issues like same-sex marriage and gay rights, as well as the potential barriers to cultural progress on these issues.

AB  - Many philosophers argue that religious schools are guilty of indoctrinatory harm. I think they are right to be worried about that. But in this article, I will postulate that there are other harms for many individuals that are more severe outside the religious school. Accordingly the full scope of harm should be taken into account when evaluating the harm that some religious schools may do. Once we do that, I suggest, justice may require that we choose the lesser harm. To simplify matters, I focus my attention on the stigmatic harm done to Muslims, and the role that Islamic schools might be expected to play in mitigating that harm. If the full weight of stigmatic harm is factored into the ethical analysis concerning Islamic schools, then I suggest that there are sufficiently weighty pro tanto reasons for Muslim parents to prefer an Islamic school over the alternatives, notwithstanding the potential indoctrinatory harm.

AB  - HIV-induced stigma and discrimination remain a prevalent global challenge especially in low-income countries which may compromise the emotional and social well-being of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Despite the efforts so far, the incidence of HIV-related stigma remains high in Ghana. Drawing on the Goffman's theory of social stigma and interpretivist research paradigm, the paper explores the lived experiences of 123 PLHIV in HIV-endemic cities in Ghana. Findings suggest that PLHIV largely suffer from three levels of stigma-internal, received and associated-with complex discriminatory dimensions. PLHIV are stigmatised and discriminated against at home, in the community and in institutional settings. This is manifested through familial neglect, social exclusion and poor access to jobs and health services. These prejudices presaged suicidal ideations, nondisclosure of HIV serostatus, poor adherence to treatment interventions and further spread of the epidemic. Progressive social and health policy framework and programmes on eradicating HIV are pressing. These should conspicuously include HIV-related stigma and discrimination through behavioural change and culturally acceptable public education about the myths and realities surrounding HIV in order to mitigate the associated debilitating outcomes.

AB  - Spain, along with the region of Catalonia in particular, has seen a significant increase in mixed unions between immigrants and natives, which, in turn, has given rise to a growing number of young people with mixed origins. Yet little is known about how these mixed families and individuals negotiate cultural differences and view their mixed cultural capital.' Drawing on 29 in-depth interviews with youth of diverse mixed cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds residing in Catalonia and 58 in-depth interviews with immigrants in mixed unions, this paper focuses on the role of language as a form of cultural capital. Do mixed families use a number of languages in their everyday lives? Which languages are transmitted, preferred, and used, and why? We find that mixed families are generally multilingual, as the knowledge of different languages is thought to contribute to communication with relatives, social integration, and social mobility. However, children and youth of mixed descent who belong to minoritized ethnic or racial groups may resist learning or actively using the language of their immigrant parent to avoid stigmatization and socially imposed categories of foreignness.' Therefore, stigmatization and prejudice may be limiting linguistic cultural capital - a key benefit of mixedness - in Catalonia.

AB  - We used Latina/Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) to re-analyze survey and interview data from earlier research in which we found that Latina/o students reported less positive experiences than other students in this high school. We found racial injustice in class enrollments, in students' experiences with stereotypes and prejudice, in student-teacher relationships, and in school policies and norms. LatCrit principles illustrate interconnections among racism, interest convergence, and colorblindness that create racial injustice for Latinas/os. We argue that counterstorytelling could emerge to resist that injustice and that educators must understand how racism functions in their schools and interrogate relevant policies and norms.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationship between creativity and equitable thinking and the individual differences in personality, demographic, and experiential factors that influence both concepts as they affect each other. Given the nationwide push to increase equity in public schools, interventions beyond teaching about equity are becoming progressively more vital to school improvement. The work suggests that schools may be able to increase equitable thinking and, accordingly, community equity by employing creative thinking strategies in classrooms.

AB  - Housing markets are unlikely to be impervious to the preferences and prejudices associated with urban segregation. For example, two neighbourhoods with very different religious attributes are unlikely to be perceived as close substitutes by homebuyers that have a strong preference for neighbours of a particular religion. This paper offers a new framework for the conception and measurement of social integration, defined in terms of perceived homophily. Homophily is the tendency for links to form between similar nodes in a network and we can think of perceived homophily as the tendency for any pair of neighbourhoods to be considered by the housing market to be close substitutes. Textbook economic theory suggests that we should expect the degree of perceived substitutability to affect cross-price elasticities. These can be measured empirically to reveal discontinuities in the network of perceived substitutability of different housing locations. Applying homophily coefficients to substitutability measures allows us to estimate perceived religious homophily between neighbourhoods. The approach can be applied to any city or region that has geocoded house transactions and socio-demographic data. We illustrate the method using data on Glasgow and find strong evidence of religious homophily. This suggests an underlying lack of social integration/cohesion and implies that the Glaswegian housing market is by no means blind to religion.

AB  - Antifat attitudes refer to the prejudicial assumption of personality characteristics based on a visual assessment of a person with obesity. Allophilia may be defined as the positive attitudes toward different out-groups, including people with obesity. In this study, conducted with 448 participants, it is analyzed whether allophilia, germ aversion, physical disgust, social dominance orientation, perceived controllability of weight, and fear of gaining weight play a central role in explaining the individual differences that exist in social distance toward individuals with obesity. Results showed a negative correlation between the different subscales of allophilia (affection, comfort, kinship, engagement, and enthusiasm) and social distance. Furthermore, a positive relationship between social distance and germ aversion, social dominance orientation, perceived controllability of weight, and fear of gaining weight was found. Moreover, the regression analyses conducted showed that comfort was the best negative predictor of social distance toward individuals with obesity. Finally, the results are discussed in the frame of antifat attitudes literature, suggesting new ways to reduce this pervasive stigma.

AB  - This paper discusses contradictory imperatives in contemporary Australian pedagogy - the notions of controversy' and diversity' as they relate the subjects of genders and sexualities. It is a common view that both gender and sexuality are important organising features of identity, society and politics. Consistent effort is made in the Australian educational context to combat discrimination, prejudice against sexually, and gender diverse' people. However, the state's commitment to diversity policies must be balanced with a secondary focus on appeasing those who are hostile to non-heteronormative expression, or who view such expression as inherently political' in nature and therefore inappropriate for the school setting. Australia has arguably demonstrated this dilemma recently in two notable controversies: an intervention in planned school screenings of Gayby Baby, a documentary exploring the experience of children in same-sex families, and media furore over the trans-positive All of Us teaching kit. Using these case studies, this paper explores the competing imperatives of controversy and diversity, commenting on the tendency for the lives and experiences of LGBTIQ people becoming consequently politicised. To do so, is arguably detrimental to the meaningful participation of LGBTIQ people as social citizens.

AB  - The current study explored how individual differences in endorsement of aggressive behaviors and thoughts relate to individual levels of tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants and established prejudice correlates such as social dominance orientation (SDO) and ethnic out-groups ratings among adolescents. Participants (N = 141; Age M = 16.08, 68% girls) completed the Readiness for Interpersonal Aggression Inventory, the Tolerance and Prejudice Questionnaire, and measures of SDO and ethnic out-groups ratings. Results indicated that higher individual endorsement of aggression was related to higher prejudice and SDO and lower tolerance and ethnic out-groups ratings. Patterns of endorsement of aggression related to habitual and socially determined aggressive acts or stable needs to hurt others as a source of satisfaction were significantly correlated with prejudice. Conversely, the relationship between prejudice and endorsement of impulsive actions lacking of emotional control resulted was less marked. The results highlight how in the cognitive spectrum of prejudice, individual levels of endorsement of aggression may play a significant triggering role during adolescence. These findings may have implications for future studies and interventions aimed at reducing prejudice already in young ages.

AB  - Background: Dogmatism and prejudice are strongly related. We hypothesized that bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE) might explain a portion of this relationship unique from that explained by constructs including Political Orientation. BADE (measured by the BADE task) comprises two facets, Evidence Integration Impairment and Positive Response Bias. Only Evidence Integration Impairment was expected to partially explain the prejudice-dogmatism relationship because in prior research it alone was associated with group differences in inflexible beliefs.
   Method: 254 MTurk participants completed measures of dogmatism, racial prejudice, BADE (Evidence Integration Impairment and Positive Response Bias), and Political Orientation. The hypothesized mediation effect was examined using a bootstrapping procedure.
   Results: Dogmatism predicted racial prejudice [b = 024, t(249) = 4.92, p < .001]; this relationship weakened in the presence of the above measures [b = 0.05, t(246) = 0.91, p = .363]. The 95% confidence interval for the size of the indirect effect of dogmatism on racial prejudice via Evidence Integration Impairment did not include zero [0.151, 0331], confirming the hypothesized mediation effect.
   Conclusions: Evidence Integration Impairment accounts for a unique portion of the relationship between dogmatism and racial prejudice, suggesting that belief revision failures in ambiguous social situations may support prejudice in dogmatic individuals.

AB  - Australia is a multicultural society. However, its history of British colonisation has contributed to enduring overt and covert discrimination, racism and black/white racial divisions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the recipients of ongoing racial discrimination, they are the most disadvantage groups in Australia and they are significantly overrepresented as social work clients. An anti-racist stance is core to social work practice, and some literature has suggested that cultivating empathy can help reduce racism and provoke activism for social justice. In 2014, a classroom-based inquiry exploring barriers to activism extended previous student-centred research exploring empathy and racism. The findings suggest that some students hesitant to commit to action for social justice for reasons including a lack of confidence, and a lack of time and information. Facilitating social work students' confidence, increased understanding of everyday acts of activism and skill development including critical empathy may bolster their confidence and their action for social justice.

AB  - Our understanding of sexual prejudice, or prejudice against gay men, lesbian women, bisexual people, and other sexual minorities, has improved substantially over the last few decades. Less is known about the factors that predict trans prejudice, or prejudice against trans people. Using the framework of social identity theory, we examined the relationship between gender self-esteem, sexual prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women, and trans prejudice in a sample of 391 self-identified cisgender heterosexual students from a Midwestern university in the United States. Compared to women, men reported more sexual prejudice, trans prejudice, more prejudice toward gay men than lesbian women, and more violence toward, teasing of, and discomfort around trans women than trans men. Whereas both men and women reported more teasing of trans women than of trans men, men reported more discomfort around trans women and women reported more discomfort around trans men. Gender self-esteem significantly predicted sexual prejudice and trans prejudice in men but not women. Consistent with other research, our results indicate that men's sexual prejudice and trans prejudice may be motivated by similar factors, whereas the predictors of women's prejudice may be more specific to the type of prejudice.

AB  - In this article, we examine moral identity construction among nonreligious people. Based on 30 indepth interviews with nonreligious Americans unaffiliated with secular movement organizations, we analyze some ways nonreligious people may utilize their experiences with religion in society to define nonreligion as a sign of value, worth, and character. Specifically, we demonstrate how our respondents drew upon their childhood and current experience with religious others to construct nonreligous moral identities by (1) defining religion as concerned with conformity and obedience rather than morality, (2) highlighting prejudicial assumptions religious people promote about nonreligious people, and (3) characterizing interactions with religious people as a mechanism that led them to seek meaning in their lives from other sources. In conclusion, we draw out implications for understanding (1) the social construction of nonreligious moral identities and (2) some ways current religious norms may serve as a pathway to nonreligion.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate how gender and sexual diversity prejudice (GenSex) expresses itself in a university, how prejudice varies in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, the effects of religious status, and how exposure to GenSex education affects levels of prejudice. Eight thousand one hundred eighty-four undergraduate students from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in southern Brazil, completed the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. Data reflect a concentration of 'extreme' and 'high' prejudice in students enrolled in Engineering, Agricultural Sciences, and the Exact and Geological Sciences. 'Moderate' and 'low' prejudice was over-represented in these disciplines as well as in Health, Applied Social Science, and Biological Sciences student samples. Conversely, those who have 'very low' or 'minimal' prejudice tended to cluster in Humanities and Linguistics and Arts. Most students were unaware of ongoing discrimination, reporting to have neither seen nor heard of discrimination towards LGBT students at the university. Time spent at the university had a negligible effect in prejudice mean reduction. Although a large effect was found for previous GenSex training, overall there was substantial variation across disciplines. We recommend raising student awareness of prejudice on campus, in addition to better GenSex education policy for all students, regardless of discipline.

AB  - Discrimination towards various minority groups can now be found to have subtler manifestations. These forms can be described as microaggressions-the brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group (Sue et al. in Am Psychol 62(4): 271-286, 2007). In order to delineate the process involved in the tendency to act in response to perceived discrimination, researchers have distinguished two distinct routes: an emotional route which explores the role of anger in response to injustice in triggering action and an efficacy route where the conviction that problems can be solved collectively motivates group members to act against discrimination (Van Zomeren et al. in J Personal Soc Psychol 87(5): 649-664, 2004). The present research adopts and extends this model to explore how Northeasterners in Delhi respond to microaggression experiences and further what implication this has for their social well-being. Not just in Delhi, but all over the country Northeasterners face prejudice due to their looks and different lifestyle. However, the concerns of this group have not been the focus of much academic research. Two hundred and fourteen (109 females; 105 males) Northeasterners residing in Delhi for a minimum of 1 year at the time of the study in the age group of 19-31 years took part in this research. Results provide evidence for the emotional pathway. The results are discussed in the light of existing work on discrimination, collective action and social wellbeing as well as the unique context of Northeasterners in Delhi.

AB  - The present study employed a variety of existing measures to assess openness to the other in the ecologically valid context of listening to real-life testimonies of race-based suffering. Variation in system threat, and individual differences in two measures of prejudice-right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO)-were all investigated for their impact on respondent openness. Among 36 student volunteers, it was found that a woman's testimony featuring a high degree of system threat engendered less openness to the other among participants high in SDO than less threatening testimony offered by a man. Additionally, participant levels of RWA explained a significant amount of variance in their openness to the other across both male and female testimonies. This study quantitatively confirms that testimonies of race-based suffering-utterances that have great potential to interrupt master narratives and invite deep learning-are likely to be met with a complex and interactive pattern of resistance that must be more fully understood.

AB  - To counter homophobic behavior in schools, research is needed on heterosexual youth who act as allies to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth by engaging in LGBT-affirming behavior (e.g., voicing support, engaging in advocacy, countering homophobia). Among 624 heterosexual high school students (M (age) = 16.11; 53 % female; 88 % white), this study found that critical thinking, self-reflection, lower sexual prejudice, having more LGBT friends, and having sexual orientation-based discussions with peers were associated with engaging in more LGBT-affirming behavior. Several factors moderated the association between having sexual orientation-based discussions and LGBT-affirming behavior: the association was stronger among youth who described the tone of these discussions as more positive, who more often used positive problem-solving strategies, and who reported low sexual prejudice. The degree to which conversations were challenging did not moderate this association. Finally, having LGBT friends was more strongly associated with affirming behavior for youth who felt more connected and had more sexual orientation-based discussions with these friends. The findings underscore the need for research to identify other factors that prompt heterosexual youth to act as allies to LGBT youth.

AB  - In this study we focus on underlying determinants of interethnic contact of natives within a large number of European regions. We use the 'opportunity-preference-third parties' framework to explain differences between social groups and distinguish interethnic contact with colleagues from interethnic friendship. Using the first wave of the European Social Survey (2002/2003), we found clear differences between social groups in terms of how likely they are to have interethnic contact. Men have more interethnic contact in terms of both colleagues and friends. Older residents in Europe have fewer immigrant friends, but hardly differ in terms of immigrant colleagues. Opportunity plays a significant role in fostering interethnic contact in terms of both friends and colleagues. Preference and third parties predominantly affect the chances of having interethnic friendships. The three mechanisms partly explain differences between social groups. Although social groups tend to differ in their probability of having interethnic contact, they 'profit' more or less equally in terms of increased interethnic contact if objective opportunities rise. Our results stress the importance of distinguishing both dimensions of interethnic contact, i.e., with friends and colleagues, and shed more light on underlying determinants and mechanisms of interethnic contact.

AB  - This study examined American attitudes toward transsexual and gay male parenting, compared to straight parenting. After reporting levels of transphobia, participants read a vignette regarding a couple seeking child adoption. Individuals high in transphobia perceived nontraditional couples as more emotionally unstable than straight couples and were less willing to grant custody of a child to the nontraditional couples vs. the straight couples. In addition, the transsexual couple faced more prejudice and discrimination than the gay male couple. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The present article is based on a small-scale research that took place with third-year students in the department of social work at Technological Educational Institute of Patras. During class the students, who undertake the laboratory course 'Social Work with Families', were asked to discuss family roles and depict them on drawings. Analysing their drawings in a qualitative approach the findings suggest that students adopt traditional views on family issues and the family roles. Various gender stereotypes and prejudices were reflected in students' drawings and this is alarming for both social work education and practice.

AB  - In the delivery of social work education, how can we devise a relevant curriculum that addresses the development of cross-cultural competencies? Some of the assumptions that our students bring to their study programme (many already work in different parts of the human services profession) are premised on outdated ideas that have as their source prejudice, racism, whiteness behaviours, fear and mistrust, and a lack of knowledge and understanding about the complex layers in understanding situations of access and equity, discrimination and the abrogation of human rights for marginalised communities. In this paper, I share some of the strategies and content material that we use at Charles Sturt University (CSU), Australia, together with professionals-in-the-field, in developing cross-cultural competencies to prepare our students for work in the profession. For example, as part of our current social work curriculum, students are introduced to intense debates that scrutinise the above phenomena-in-practice; in particular, they scrutinise their own biases and entrenched worldviews that are often developed out of an ethnocentric monoculturalism. At the very least, a critical reflection framework explores assumptions embedded within practice; this is not a new dynamic for social work and is worth revisiting here, but, ultimately, are we doing enough?.

AB  - Antifat attitudes (AFA) refer to stereotyping based on people's weight. Literature suggests that people who have an ideologically conservative outlook on life also report negative attitudes toward obese people. Also, it is well established that one of the roots of AFA is the perception that prejudiced individuals have about the controllability of the weight. Therefore, in the current study it is analyzed if Right Wing Autoritharism (RWA, predisposition that individuals have to follow the dictates of a strong leader and traditional and conventional values) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO, the desire that one's ingroup dominates other outgroups) predicts prejudice toward obese people and if controllability of the weight mediates this relationship. 456 female students of the UNED (Spanish Open University) from 18 to 35 years were part of the final sample of the study. Results showed that RWA, SDO, controllability and AFA were positively correlated and that the relationship between RWA, SDO and AFA was mediated by the controllability of the weight.

AB  - Purpose: The article aims to examine the extent to which ageism is connected with the social integration of older adults in their neighborhoods and to identify factors that explain social integration. Design and Methods: A convenience sample that included 300 older adults aged 65 and older and 300 younger people under the age of 65 who resided in 3 neighborhoods in Tel-Aviv with varied socioeconomic status were interviewed. Kogans Attitudes toward Old People scale was used to probe ageism. Social integration index included 3 dimensions: frequency of participation in activities in the neighborhood, familiarity with neighbors, and sense of neighborhood. Hierarchical regression analyses examined 3 groups of independent variables: older adults sociodemographic characteristics, their perceived health and outdoor mobility, and neighborhoods characteristics including level of ageism. Results: Neighborhoods varied by levels of ageism and social integration. Higher level of social integration of older neighborhoods residents was explained by a combination of factors: younger age, better self-rated health, and fewer limitations of outdoor mobility, lower levels of ageism reported by a sample of younger respondents, and higher socioeconomic status of the neighborhood. Implications: To enable better social integration, intergeneration programs should be developed to decrease ageism, and in order to make communities more age-friendly, there is need to facilitate accessibility to services and public spaces.

AB  - Although higher social class carries mental and physical health benefits, these advantages are less robust among members of racial and ethnic minority groups than among European Americans. We explore whether differential reactions to discrimination may be a factor in explaining why. Working-class and middle-class Latino American women engaged in an evaluative interaction with a European American woman who rejected them and held either prejudiced or unprejudiced attitudes. We examined how participants responded to this rejection by measuring neuroendocrine reactivity, executive functioning, and the affective content of their verbal responses during the interaction. Among middle-class Latinas, rejection from a prejudiced, compared to unprejudiced, out-group member was associated with less adaptive stress responses, greater cognitive depletion, and more feelings of uncertainty. In contrast, among working-class Latinas, neuroendocrine, cognitive, and affective responses were similar across the two sources of rejection. Results suggest that social class is an important moderator of responses to discrimination.

AB  - Educational access was central in the racial inscription of class identities in the late nineteenth century. In Atlanta and New Orleans, white newspapers, politicians and ordinary citizens launched vigorous campaigns against integrated schools, which resulted in limited access to elite public schooling for upwardly mobile Blacks. Jewell's study analyses these cases to explore social reproduction as a link between race and class as social structures. Whites in both cities used the concept of miscegenation, or racial mixing, to define Blacks' access to elite cultural knowledge and social networks as a violation of the colour line. Jewell argues that analyses of racial formation should give attention to discursive links between race and class in struggles over social reproduction because maintaining racial hierarchies in periods of social change requires constructing new cultural narratives that reproduce economic dominance over racial minorities.

AB  - Rigid social categorization can lead to negative social consequences such as stereotyping and prejudice. The authors hypothesized that bodily experiences of fluidity would promote fluidity in social-categorical thinking. Across a series of experiments, fluid movements compared with nonfluid movements led to more fluid lay theories of social categories, more fluidity in social categorization, and consequences of fluid social-categorical thinking, decreased stereotype endorsement, and increased concern for social inequalities. The role of sensorimotor states in fluid social cognition, with consequences for social judgment and behavior, is discussed.

A validation study of a new instrument, the Sexual Prejudice Scale, is reported. Students (N = 851) from 4 different universities participated in this study. An exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted, and results of these analyses indicated a 3-factor solution (affective valuation, stereotyping, and social equality beliefs) for each of the sex-specific scales. Evidence of validity and the results of the reliability analysis are reported. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Although homophobic verbal victimization has been associated with negative mental health outcomes, little actually is known about its general prevalence and relationship to mental health among adolescents. In addition, the relationship of homophobic name-calling to mental health in gender non-conforming adolescents is not well understood. This study examined the relationship between homophobic verbal victimization and mental health in adolescents, accounting for their sexual orientation and level of gender non-conformity. Survey data was collected from 513 adolescents (ages 11-17) who attended eight schools in and around Amsterdam, the Netherlands; 56.7 % of the participating adolescents were female and 11.1 % reported same-sex attractions. As hypothesized, male adolescents and those with same-sex attractions were more likely to report victimization from homophobic name-calling than were their female and non-same-sex attracted peers. Contrary to expectations, homophobic name-calling was not independently associated with psychological distress after controlling for gender, sexual attractions, gender non-conformity, and other negative treatment by peers. The hypothesis that homophobic name-calling would be more strongly associated with psychological distress in male, same-sex attracted, and gender non-conforming adolescents was also not supported. The results suggest that same-sex attracted and gender non-conforming youth are particularly vulnerable to homophobic name-calling, in the Netherlands as in other contexts, but also that other forms of peer victimization may be more strongly related to mental health.

AB  - The relationships between threat on one hand and right-wing attitudes and ethnic prejudice on the other were investigated in a heterogeneous sample (N=588). Specifically, we considered the perception of economic and terroristic threats in terms of their consequences at the societal and personal levels. Previous studies revealed that societal consequences of threat, rather than personal consequences, are related to right-wing attitudes. However, the present results challenge these findings. More specifically, three important results emerged. First, items probing the distinct threat levels loaded on separate dimensions for economic and terroristic threat, validating the distinction between societal and personal threat consequences. Second, consistent with previous research, this study revealed that perceived societal consequences of threat yield strong and robust relationships with all target variables. However, personal consequences of threat were also associated with higher levels of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and ethnic prejudice in particular. Third, societal and personal consequences of threat interacted in explaining the target variables. More specifically, feeling personally threatened by terrorism was only related to higher levels of RWA in the presence of low levels of threat to society, whereas experiencing personal economic threat was only related to higher levels of SDO and ethnic prejudice when high societal economic threat was experienced. In sum, although the perception of societal consequences of threat plays a prominent role in explaining right-wing attitudes and ethnic prejudice, the perception of being personally affected by threat is also associated with higher levels of RWA and SDO, and especially ethnic prejudice.

AB  - The Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice states that 'dangerous world' and 'competitive jungle' beliefs shape Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), respectively. We investigated whether the associations of the HEXACO personality traits with SDO and RWA were mediated by these beliefs. Study 1 (297 Italian participants) investigated mediation at the general factor level. Study 2 (344 US participants) focused on the components of Honesty and Humility and of Openness-culture and Openness-curiosity. Personality associations with SDO were mostly mediated by Competitive Jungle beliefs, whilst personality associations with RWA were mostly unmediated. At the level of narrow trait components, different effects for Honesty and Humility and for Openness-culture and Openness-curiosity were revealed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the effects of social power and disparagement humor on the evaluation of subordinates. According to prejudiced norm theory, it is proposed that powerful people, compared with the powerless, are more likely to negatively evaluate subordinates when exposed to disparagement humor against subordinates. To test this hypothesis, two studies were conducted. Study 1 (N = 116) aimed to analyze and select humorous material (neutral vs. disparagement humor against subordinates) that allowed us to test our hypothesis. Study 2 (N = 116) investigated the effect of the exposure to disparagement humor in people who hold or not a power position. Results showed an interaction between power and type of humor: when powerful people were exposed to disparagement humor they evaluated subordinates worse than the powerless, whereas when they were exposed to neutral humor there were no differences between groups. The implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Agentic female leaders risk social and economic penalties for behaving counter-stereotypically (i.e., backlash; Rudman, 1998), but what motivates prejudice against female leaders? The status incongruity hypothesis (SIH) proposes that agentic women are penalized for status violations because doing so defends the gender hierarchy. Consistent with this view, Study 1 found that women are proscribed from dominant, high status displays (which are reserved for leaders and men); Studies 2-3 revealed that prejudice against agentic female leaders was mediated by a dominance penalty; and in Study 3, participants' gender system-justifying beliefs moderated backlash effects. Study 4 found that backlash was exacerbated when perceivers were primed with a system threat. Study 5 showed that only female leaders who threatened the status quo suffered sabotage. In concert, support for the SIH suggests that backlash functions to preserve male dominance by reinforcing a double standard for power and control. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: We evaluated the type and incidence of different chromosomal abnormalities among paediatric patients presented with congenital abnormalities in a paediatric hospital over the past 15 years. Material and methods: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from 8584 paediatric patients with suspected chromosomal aberrations in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School from 1996 to 2010. Their age were between 0 and 18 years. Cytogenetic analysis was performed by G-banding technique. The cases were grouped according to the reasons of referral for cytogenetic analysis. The frequency of various abnormal karyotypes was analysed. Results: The main indications for cytogenetic analysis were congenital genitourinary defect, which accounted for 39.6% (3402/8584). The referrals of congenital genitourinary defects group increased while other groups decreased during 2006-2010 compared to 1996-2000. Abnormal karyotypes were found in 24.4% (2094/8584) and 77.0% (1612/2094) had autosomal abnormalities. Among them, trisomy 21 was the most frequent one. The remaining 23.0% (482/2094) were sex chromosome abnormalities, 199 cases were structural abnormalities and 283 cases were numerical abnormalities. The ratio of autosomal abnormalities to sex chromosome abnormalities showed a decrease trend. Turner syndrome accounted for 12.7% (265/2094) of abnormal karyotypes. Eighty nine cases of XY female (46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis) and 58 cases of XX male (46,XX testicular disorder of sexual development) were diagnosed, which consisted of 7.0% (147/2094) in all chromosomal anomalies. Conclusions: The incidence and distribution of cytogenetic abnormalities by karyotype were reviewed. The high rate of chromosomal abnormalities (24.4%) found in our referred population demonstrates the importance of cytogenetic evaluation in patients who are clinically abnormal. The main clinical indications for genetic analysis were congenital genitourinary defects, the ratio between sex chromosome abnormality and autosomal abnormality elevated with the increase of cases referral for congenital genitourinary defects. This is due to referral bias of a paediatric medical center with developed paediatric urology subspecialty. Our data may help in providing some correlation data for genetic counselling on this aspect.

AB  - This paper examined differences in American adolescents' (n = 1069) beliefs about the origins of homosexuality and how these beliefs related to adolescents' judgments and reasoning about homosexuality, their comfort interacting with lesbian and gay peers, and their judgments and reasoning about the treatment of lesbian and gay peers. Using Latent Class Analysis four origins cluster profiles were determined (choice/early socialization, choice, socialization, and biological). Results provide evidence that adolescents endorsing socialization beliefs about the origins of homosexuality were more likely to evaluate homosexuality as wrong, least comfortable interacting with lesbian and gay peers, and least likely to evaluate exclusion and teasing a lesbian or gay peer as wrong. Conversely, adolescent endorsing biological beliefs were least likely to evaluation homosexuality as wrong, most comfortable interacting with lesbian and gay pears, and most likely to evaluate exclusion and teasing as wrong. Further, the results provide evidence that origins beliefs were also related to the type of reasoning (moral, conventional, personal) that adolescents bring to bear on these issues.

AB  - Studies on infra-humanization have confirmed a greater attribution of secondary emotions to the ingroup than to outgroups, independently of the valence of these emotions. However, the variables leading to the choice of which outgroups are likely to be infra-humanized have received limited attention in the literature. This study is concerned with determining some of the relevant variables within the intergroup domain that may elicit this type of prejudice. The roles of similarity, intergroup friendship, knowledge of the outgroup, and status are analyzed with respect to the humanization of outgroups throughout the world. Results verify that not all outgroups are equally humanized. A second finding reveals that intergroup similarity, friendship, and knowledge of the outgroups increase the attribution of secondary emotions towards them, while status, as expected, is not related with outgroup humanization.

TI  - Police Responses to Diversity: A Social Representational Study of Rural British Policing in a Changing Representational Context

KW  - theory of social representations

AB  - In the first decade of the 21st century, British policing faced two new challenges in how it responded to social diversity: As well as instituting reforms in response to a highly publicized report describing the British police as 'institutionally racist' (Macpherson, 1999), they faced challenges associated with rapid increases in numbers of immigrants into the UK. Studying social representations at such times of change allows access into processes, themes and value systems that may otherwise remain hidden. This paper uses social representations theory to explore interview accounts provided by regular police officers of interactions with members of minority groups. Empirically, we focus on an area of diversity policing that has received relatively little previous attention: Police work in a rural context that has recently played host to large numbers of migrant workers. Our analysis shows that interviews operate as a site of resistance in which respondents attempt to rework hegemonic representations of the police as prejudiced and to re-present themselves and their work as able to respond appropriately to diversity. Fairness as a defining characteristic of good police practice is a central representational theme that links identity construction processes to police work with minority groups. Recent immigrant groups are represented as both needing and deserving help to assimilate into British culture: Their lack of acculturation and language difficulties provide additional challenges to police work and to how this is judged as 'fair'. We discuss the broader origins and implications of police officers' understandings of fairness and the use of social representations theory to study representational fields within organizational settings.

AB  - Do infants develop meaningful social preferences among novel individuals based on their social group membership? If so, do these social preferences depend on familiarity on any dimension, or on a more specific focus on particular kinds of categorical information? The present experiments use methods that have previously demonstrated infants' social preferences based on language and accent, and test for infants' and young children's social preferences based on race. In Experiment 1, 10-month-old infants took toys equally from own- and other-race individuals. In Experiment 2, 2.5-year-old children gave toys equally to own- and other-race individuals. When shown the same stimuli in Experiment 3, 5-year-old children, in contrast, expressed explicit social preferences for own-race individuals. Social preferences based on race therefore emerge between 2.5 and 5 years of age and do not affect social choices in infancy. These data will be discussed in relation to prior research finding that infants' social preferences do, however, rely on language: a useful predictor of group or coalition membership in both modern times and humans' evolutionary past.

AB  - Prejudices against minorities are still a cause of inter-ethnic conflict and violence, although their expression has changed from blatant to more subtle forms. There has been a shortage of valid and reliable German-language scales for the measurement of contemporary racial prejudices. The Racial Argument Scale (RAS; Saucier & Miller Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 35:433-450, 2003) measures contemporary prejudice indirectly by asking respondents to judge how well given arguments support a conclusion. This scale was adapted to the German context with Turks as the target group. A validation study using a diverse sample of German adults (N = 194) attests to the reliability and construct validity of the German RAS (RAS-G). The adapted instrument is thus suitable for the indirect measurement of prejudice in German-speaking samples.

AB  - This study uses data from the 1996 through 2002 General Social Survey to examine whether one variant of modern racial prejudice-"color coding"-explains support for several ostensibly nonracial government spending policies regarding crime, urban problems, and drug addiction (welfare and race spending are used as baseline measures). Findings indicate that color coding does not extend appreciably beyond its established focus of welfare and race and operates along a continuum with welfare and race at one end (heavily influenced by prejudice), addiction spending and urban spending at the other end (not influenced by prejudice), and crime spending situated in the middle (moderately influenced by prejudice). Possible causes of the continuum, as well as emerging aspects of the color coding phenomenon- specifically, its possible bidirectional effects and its subordination to political party affiliation in explanatory value-are discussed. Directions for future research that would shed additional light on the color coding phenomenon are also discussed.

AB  - Although it is generally assumed that support for democratic values and beliefs develops as a result of social learning, the concrete socializing circumstances through which this occurs are less obvious. This study investigated the relationship between democratic family functioning and democratic values of adolescents. Adolescents' (N - 1,341, 16- to 17-year-olds) reports on their parents' psychological control, autonomy granting, warmth, and behavioural control were considered predictors of adolescents' democratic orientation. The results demonstrated that the democratic functioning of families was positively related to adolescents' support for democratic values when controlling for the effects of gender, political experience, authoritarianism, empathy, and political activism. Additionally, this study examined the possible role of empathy as a mediator in the relation between democratic family functioning and adolescent's democratic values. The results show that empathy was a partial mediator of a family's contribution to adolescents' democratic orientation.

AB  - Interethnic contact is essential to move past out-group prejudice. However, prior work on the relationship between interethnic contact and out-group attitudes mostly considers core social ties. Here, I consider ethnic majority adolescents' interethnic weaker ties. To do so, I embrace a key feature of adolescent contemporary social life: they overwhelmingly maintain relations online that snapshot hundreds of ties. Using a combination of survey data among Dutch ethnic majority adolescents and linking this with information on their large circle of online contacts, I study whether and to what extent interethnic weak ties online correlate with out-group attitudes. I conjecture and find that interethnic contacts online correlate to less-negative out-group attitudes. Yet, there is a diminishing return for interethnic contacts on less-negative out-group attitudes. These patterns are carried by the Dutch majority's out-group contacts with Turkish and Moroccan backgrounds. I discuss the implications of these results and suggest directions for future research.

AB  - Background In many countries, policy makers and practitioners turn to prejudice reduction programs and interventions to tackle prejudice in the community. However, successfully addressing prejudice requires an effective intervention that can scale to match the broad span of the problem. The scalability assessment frameworks from health sciences have varying emphasis on four categories-intervention, delivery, costs, and context. For example, the high-level factors in the two Milat et al. scalability assessments are weighted towards details of the intervention (Milae et al. in Health Promot Int 28(3):285-981, 2013; Health Res Policy Syst 2:1-17, 2020). Investigation into scalability, specific to prejudice reduction, is necessary to understand how scalability frameworks apply in a different discipline. Methods Using a Delphi approach-a structured method to obtain consensus from experts (Milae et al. Health Promot Int 28(3):285-981, 2013; Linstone and Turoff in The Delphi method-techniques and applications, Addison-Wesley, 1975; de Meyrick in Health Educ 103(1):7-16, 2003)-to bring together 16 prejudice reduction experts from multiple sectors including NGOs, private, government and academia, we developed a scalability assessment framework of criteria that are important for the successful scaling of prejudice interventions. We then applied that framework to exemplars of prejudice reduction interventions published in the academic literature. Results For prejudice reduction interventions, contextual factors are key considerations for successful scaling. Commonly used prejudice reduction intervention approaches like contact, whether face-to-face or online, can have limited scalability. Conclusions To reduce prejudice there needs to be consideration of scalability. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind framework for assessing scalability for prejudice reduction interventions. Applying the empirically developed framework to actual interventions demonstrated that for interventions to be effective and scalable, a greater focus on approaches beyond face-to-face contact is required.

AB  - The past few years have witnessed the development of prejudiced attitudes in some places in Europe. Biases alike are often considered a consequence of increased migratory movements to the continent and have also been connected to a more general crisis of the European Union political project. However, societies have diversely responded to migration even in countries presenting similar economic performances and immigrant inflows. Akin different reactions have raised some important questions: is prejudice connected to a broader European crisis and what does the latter consist of? This article responds to these research questions through a multilevel analysis of 24 European countries, and shows that the percentages of migrant population alone are not associated to anti-migrant sentiments. Such a situation has instead been the case only in those countries that have concurrently experienced cuts to the two key public sectors of education and health care, which constituted the pillars of the European Welfare State and one of the cores of the European Union's political project.

AB  - How does implicit bias contribute to explicit prejudice? Prior experiments show that concept knowledge about fear versus sympathy determines whether negative affect (captured as implicit bias) predicts antisocial outcomes (Lee et al.). Concept knowledge (i.e., beliefs) about groups may similarly moderate the link between implicitly measured negative affect (implicit negative affect) and explicit prejudice. We tested this hypothesis using data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2008 Time Series Study (Study 1) and Project Implicit (Study 2). In both studies, participants high in implicit negative affect reported more explicit prejudice if they possessed negative beliefs about Black Americans. Yet, participants high in implicit negative affect reported less explicit prejudice if they possessed fewer negative beliefs about Black Americans. The results are consistent with psychological constructionist and dynamic models of evaluation and offer a more ecologically valid extension of our past laboratory work.

AB  - Ableism is the systematic oppression of and prejudice toward individuals with disabilities due to the idealization of nondisabled bodies and minds. Despite legislation aimed at broadening the rights of individuals with disabilities, ableism persists, including in classrooms of postsecondary institutions and within the field social work. However, changes can be made with adoption of the social model of disability, and in applying Universal Design for Learning (UDL). UDL offers a more holistic framework for curriculum and instruction, benefiting institutions of higher education in the education and retention of individuals with disabilities, and more importantly, individuals with disabilities themselves. This analysis examines UDL as a potential solution for reducing ableism in institutions of higher education and the field of social work.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brought along with it concerns about anxiety, racial bias, and pushback against public health recommendations, all of which are intensified by the news and social media. This study investigated the effects of constructive journalism in the context of this crisis, by randomly assigning 492 subjects to view simulated social media news updates with different headlines and images. The results showed positive and constructive headlines led to less anger and anxiety than negative headlines. The sanitization of graphic images decreased anger, anxiety, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and anti-Chinese sentiment-a relationship that was mediated by anger and anxiety. These findings suggest constructive journalism can be useful in times of crisis, and that its visual aspect warrants more scholarly attention. Further, these results shed new light on the effects of news exposure via social media in times of crisis, and how this impact depends on specific attributes of the headlines and images of the content being shared. The findings are discussed in relation to the theory of affective intelligence and recent concerns about how news and social media influence the public in times of crisis.

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain that affects approximately 50 million people globally, with over 80 % of them living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Madagascar, as in most LMICs, one of the main obstacles to treatment is the stigma and discrimination experienced by patients. Beliefs and prejudices regarding this disease are common, especially among children. "Ao Tsara" is an educational comic book regarding epilepsy, which has been translated in Malagasy from a French version, and which objective is to raise awareness and fight epilepsy related stigma and discrimination. Comic books have indeed been used successfully to raise awareness and change behaviors in several areas of public health. Methods: We conducted a study to evaluate the effect of a single reading of this comic book on epilepsy related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in schoolchildren in Madagascar. This quasi-experimental study compared data collected before and immediately after reading "Ao Tsara". It was conducted both in a school in an urban area and in a school in a rural area. Results: We recruited 244 children with a mean age of 11.4 (+/- 1.5) in this study. We noted a significant improvement in the global KAP score after reading the comic book, overall as well as both in the urban school and the rural school. Out of a maximum score of twenty, the global KAP score increased from 9.4 to 11.2 (p < 0.001). Although the increase in knowledge was reasonable (from 10.2 to 12.9, p < 0.001) and the corresponding subscore after reading the comic book was at a satisfactory level, that was not the case for attitudes & practices, where the sub-score despite a significant increase remained low (from 8.7 to 9.5 out of a maximum score of twenty, p < 0.001). The comic book was much appreciated by the children with more than 50.0 % giving it the top rating, and 66.4 % stating they had learned a lot from it. Conclusion: A single reading of the comic book has demonstrated a positive effect on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of primary school children in Madagascar. This educational tool, which was much enjoyed by the children, could be of great value to raise awareness about epilepsy in Madagascar. By targeting a slightly older age group and adjusting the reading approach, the outcomes could be optimized especially in terms of attitudes and practices.

AB  - Childhood obesity in the United States has disproportionately affected Latinx and Black children. The authors examine this issue by drawing upon implicit social cognition theory and social-psychological models of health and stress to propose and test a relation between negative implicit self-stereotyping and body mass index (BMI) and diet. Furthermore, it was predicted that self-esteem would buffer this relation because it is a psychological resource that functions to protect against stressors like the psychological experience of stigma. The authors recruited a community sample of 9-12-year-old Latinx and Black children and measured individual differences in implicit and explicit associations between the self and group stereotypes, self-esteem, objective BMI, and diet. Consistent with the main hypotheses, strong negative implicit (but not explicit) self-stereotyping was associated with higher levels of body mass indices in the obesity range and less healthy diet, but only among children with low self-esteem. Among children with 4 high self-esteem, these relations were absent. These results held even after controlling for the contribution of parents' BMI, diet, education, and household income. These data are the first to theoretically and empirically link implicit self-stereotyping and self-esteem with physiological risk factors for chronic health conditions. Thus, this research contributes to understanding disparities among stigmatized ethnic-racial children in the United States and beyond.

AB  - This work analyzes the prevalence of words denoting prejudice in 27 million news and opinion articles written between 1970 and 2019 and published in 47 of the most popular news media outlets in the United States. Our results show that the frequency of words that denote specific prejudice types related to ethnicity, gender, sexual, and religious orientation has markedly increased within the 2010-2019 decade across most news media outlets. This phenomenon starts prior to, but appears to accelerate after, 2015. The frequency of prejudice-denoting words in news articles is not synchronous across all outlets, with the yearly prevalence of such words in some influential news media outlets being predictive of those words' usage frequency in other outlets the following year. Increasing prevalence of prejudice-denoting words in news media discourse is often substantially correlated with U.S. public opinion survey data on growing perceptions of minorities' mistreatment. Granger tests suggest that the prevalence of prejudice-denoting terms in news outlets might be predictive of shifts in public perceptions of prejudice severity in society for some, but not all, types of prejudice.

AB  - Members of social categories defined by attributes such as sex, race, and age occupy certain types of social roles much more than members of other social categories do. The qualities that define these roles become associated with the category as a whole, thus forming a stereotype. In a vicious cycle, this stereotype then hinders category members' movement into roles with different demands because their stereotype portrays them as well matched to their existing roles but not to these new roles. This vicious cycle has important implications for stereotype change. Given the difficulties of producing enduring change by directly attacking stereotypes in the minds of individuals, a more effective strategy consists of policies and programs that change the distributions of category members in roles, thereby changing stereotypes at their source. If the vicious cycle is not interrupted by such social change, observations of category members' typical social roles continually reinstate existing stereotypes.

AB  - How do different forms of group alignment influence our attitudes toward outgroups? To answer this, the current fieldwork study explored how identification and identity fusion differentially impact outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility toward rival football fan supporter groups in Australia. The community participants (N = 100) were members of two active fan groups who had experienced a history of intergroup tensions. The findings from the full path model confirmed that the predictor group alignment variables of identification and fusion were correlated, and the two outcome variables of outgroup prejudice and hostility were correlated, as predicted. The findings also revealed that fusion with one's club predicted outgroup hostility, but not prejudice, whereas identification with one's club predicted outgroup prejudice, but not hostility. Additionally, outgroup anxiety was found to significantly mediate the relationship between ingroup identification and outgroup prejudice, whereas a similar relationship was not found for fusion. These findings highlight the differential impact of group alignment (i.e., identification and identity fusion) on social constructs of outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility. Empirically, this is the first study to demonstrate the workings of these distinct group alignment pathways in an applied setting involving hard-core football fans. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for a fuller understanding of the drivers of intergroup tensions and conflict.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION

AB  - Similar to discussions in social work education classrooms facilitated by Intergroup Dialogue (IGD), the Human Library (HL) is an opportunity for students to engage in personal one-on-one dialogue about prejudice, discrimination, and oppression. To date, no study has been conducted of the use of the HL in social work education. A qualitative case study approach exploring the perceptions of 11 participants in an HL event hosted by one midwestern university explored two research questions: How do those in the role of enlisted participants (Books) describe the HL experience? and What potential does the HL have to create IGD in the social work classroom? Data analysis revealed the following unique themes: (a) arriving with the baggage of the narrative, (b) intention to educate and raise awareness, (c) surprise at the undeserved respect they received from readers, (d) perception of a shift from monologue to dialogue, and (e) recognition of expanding the narrative that fueled positive self-perceptions. Freire's critical theory was applied to the findings, identifying the benefits of its use in social work education compared to more traditional IGD offerings.

AB  - The trait justice sensitivity captures individual differences in the tendency to perceive injustice and to negatively respond to these perceptions. The tendency to negatively respond to injustice to one's disadvantage (victim justice sensitivity) was reliably linked to different measures of antisocial behavior and conservative values. Thus, we assumed that victim justice sensitivity should also be positively related to prejudice and discrimination. In contrast, the tendency to negatively respond to injustice to the disadvantage of others (altruistic justice sensitivity), was reliably linked to prosocial behavior. Hence, we assumed that altruistic justice sensitivity should also show negative relations with prejudice and discrimination. In order to test these assumptions, we surveyed justice sensitivity, prejudices against three different groups, and discrimination experiences among N=343 participants (M=26.61 years, 79 percent women) in Germany. We found that victim justice sensitivity predicted more self-perpetrated discrimination. Altruistic justice sensitivity predicted less total prejudice and self-perpetrated discrimination and mediated the link between self-experienced discrimination and prejudice/self-perpetrated discrimination unless age, gender, and education were controlled for. Discrimination can promote discrimination. Future research on correlates and potential risk and protective factors of prejudice and discrimination should also consider justice sensitivity as a moral-related trait.

AB  - A number of psychological theories suggest that increased economic inequality may lead to greater social class stereotyping. However, all existing evidence for this claim is correlational. Across three experiments (one exploratory and two confirmatory, N = 2,286), we observed that exposure to socially signaled inequality-operationalized in terms of variation in perceived incomes among groups of target individuals-amplified the endorsement of one key social class stereotype: the perception that higher income individuals are more competent. When judged amid greater inequality, the same high-income targets were perceived as more competent and the same low-income targets were perceived as less competent, compared with when judged amid greater equality. By contrast, we found no consistent effect of exposure to inequality on stereotypes regarding warmth and relatively weak class-based stereotyping on the warmth dimension in general. We discuss implications of these findings for theories regarding the effects of economic inequality.

AB  - Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, heteronormative ideology serves as a social force that maintains dominant group members' status (e.g., heterosexual men). Disgust may be an emotional reaction to gay men's violation of heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior) and motivate hostile attitudes toward gay men to promote interpersonal and intergroup boundaries. Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust-compared to pathogen or moral disgust-would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men's sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men.

AB  - Teachers provide emotional and behavioral supports essential for success in the classroom. This study examined the roles of child interpersonal skills, teacher expectations, and school racial and poverty compositions on the quality of relationships formed between teachers and children. A subsample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort 2010-2011 data set was used to fit two-level, multivariate regression models. Findings showed children with higher interpersonal skills had lower conflict and higher closeness with teachers. High teacher expectations were associated with less conflicting relationships. At the school level, the association between teacher expectations and teacher-child conflict was moderated by the Asian and Hispanic student population, and teacher-child closeness was moderated by the Asian student population. In addition, a higher proportion of school poverty and high teacher expectations was associated with lower teacher-child conflict. Overall, findings suggest the importance of investigating teacher-child interpersonal processes within a school context.

AB  - Three studies supported a model whereby associations between ideologies that share roots in biological determinism and outcomes that reinforce inequality (based on gender, race, or class) were mediated by system justification beliefs (SJB). Outcomes included support for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton as president (Study 1), justifying police brutality (Study 2), and support for a White House budget that slashed the social safety net to endow the wealthy with tax cuts (Study 3). These findings provoke a vital question: How do people deem unequal systems worthy of defense? Each study compared social Darwinism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and biological essentialism. We expected social Darwinism to account for the most variance in SJB because it provides both the rationale for social hierarchies (natural selection) and defends them as required for human welfare. This prediction was supported in each study. Implications for the psychology of legitimacy are discussed.

AB  - The current article addresses bystander action to confront disparaging humor as a form of moral courage. We ask: When is disparaging humor seen as harmless fun or as a pernicious form of prejudice? What are the social and psychological processes through which bystanders confront, evade, or collaborate in disparaging humor? Three experiments (Ns = 95, 213, 220), involving a novel paradigm (`the shared media paradigm') test the role of bystander emotional responses (anger/amusement) in shaping action to confront disparagement humor, through emotion-based social influence. Study 1 demonstrates that bystander action to confront disparagement humor as prejudice is shaped by the angry (but not amused) responses of co-present others. Study 2 considers a moderator of the influence process: the role of one's own emotional reaction to disparagement humor (angry/amused). Bystander confrontation was more intense when one's own angry reaction was validated by that of other bystanders but there was otherwise mixed evidence that the two interacted to promote collaboration/confrontation. Study 3 tests the claim that disparagement humor is especially challenging to confront because humor disarms opposition. Intergroup commentary was seen as more amusing and confrontation was more strongly resisted when humor was used (vs. a non-humorous control remark). Overall, the results show that the reactions of bystanders play an important role in shaping what is (or is not) perceived to be prejudice. Courageous action to confront the disparagement of members of minority groups is enabled by the emotional signals of others who are co-present.

AB  - We analysed effective and promising interventions, within the classroom and school microsystems, aiming to promote equality and belongingness for immigrant, Roma, and low-income children attending early childhood education and care (ECEC) and primary education in eight European countries. Over 500 interventions were identified, and 78 interventions were analysed. We found that while 79% of the interventions provided some type of language support, only 32% considered children's heritage language. Importantly, around 22% of the interventions targeted ECEC settings specifically, with most ECEC interventions implemented at the national level, taking place in the classroom and implemented by classroom teachers, and involving language support and family involvement activities. Language support seems to be widespread, recognising the foundational nature of language for learning, communication, and belongingness. However, comprehensive intercultural policies that explicitly support culture maintenance, communication, and positive contact may be valuable in guiding future developments.

AB  - Student respect toward teachers is traditionally considered in terms of behavior or authority. Yet, because of cultural differences and historic oppression of marginalized students in schools, not all students express respect in ways in which teachers are familiar. Because of structural inequalities and individual differences, standard behavioral definitions of respect are insufficient to address how students and teachers actually experience respect in the classroom. Using a comparative case study design, this study examined two female White novice teachers' beliefs and experiences of student respect within a novel relational respect framework. Results identified that teachers' respect beliefs were based on notions of authority, while respect experiences reflected authority and relationship-based respect. Importantly, these relationships were conceptualized as role model and friend-based respect. To help novice teachers balance their roles as both caring and authoritative figures, I propose that student respect should be thought of in relational, rather than behavioral, terms, and that teachers need to employ cultural competence when developing and maintaining their student-teacher relationships.

AB  - I briefly describe my experiences that gave rise to a life-long motivation to work on these issues. I then discuss the roots of extreme violence by groups, focusing on passivity by witnesses/bystanders that allows the evolution of increasing violence, including genocide. As an example, I discuss the genocide in Rwanda, and describe work I and my associates have done there to help with healing and reconciliation after the genocide of 1994, and to prevent future violence. I then discuss reasons for bystander passivity and the power of bystanders to make a difference. I describe ways of generating caring, helping/active bystandership, first through positive socialization of children, in the home and in classrooms, and then the development of caring and helping in people who have suffered, "altruism born of suffering." I then describe interventions based on research that promote active bystandership: the training of police officers to prevent or stop unnecessary harmful behavior by fellow officers, with a successful example in New Orleans; the training of students to stop fellow students from harming others; an intervention in Amsterdam to improve relations between ethnic Dutch and Muslims after intense violence there. In the latter instance, the city government was the primary active bystander. I mention my colleagues' and my theory and research on constructive (vs. blind) patriotism, and the special relevance of different forms of patriotism in the United States under the Trump Presidency.

Contact with gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals negatively correlated with transgender prejudice. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that contact apprehension, right-wing authoritarianism, and contact with gay men and lesbians were significant predictors of antitransgender prejudice. Implications for clinicians, educators, advocates, and other health providers are discussed.

AB  - In his many writings, John Cacioppo stressed how neural and physiological events could reveal psychological phenomena. Far from merely "physiologizing" psychology, John advocated social neuroscience in service of theory development and causal inference. These themes can be seen in his ERP work, which he began in the early 1990s to answer basic questions about attitudes. Fortuitously, his foray into ERP research overlapped with the dominance of the social cognition perspective in social psychology, which argues that complex thoughts and behaviors can be understood by breaking them into their underlying elements. ERPs are a natural methodological complement to this perspective, assuming that complex thoughts and behaviors are composed to separable information processing stages that manifest on the scalp as ERPs. Social cognitive theories, with their roots in mental chronometry, are thus fertile ground for researchers possessing a way to quantify underlying mental operations. This review illustrates John's influence by tracing its impact on our own research.

AB  - The present study surveyed the understanding of epilepsy and attitudes toward epilepsy among teachers in Japanese schools for special needs education. An adapted version of a self-reported questionnaire, consisting of 27 questions, was sent to 3474 teachers at all schools for special needs education in Saitama Prefecture. The response rate to the questionnaire was 62%, corresponding to 2109 valid responses. The responses to three basic questions were as follows: 99% had heard about "epilepsy", 90% had seen epileptic seizures, and 63% had an acquaintance who had epilepsy. Numerous questionnaire items gave low correct answer rates for knowledge- and attitude-related questions. Correct responses to knowledge questions and a positive attitude toward epilepsy were associated with whether individuals had acquaintance with epilepsy, experience seeing a seizure, and read or heard about epilepsy. There was skepticism and uncertainty about whether people with epilepsy should be allowed to drive, likely due to vague fears of the risks of driving with epilepsy. According to our results, knowledge about epilepsy does not necessarily lead to a positive attitude. However, respondents who had acquaintances with epilepsy were most likely to demonstrate a positive attitude. Thus, familiarity is an essential factor in the likelihood of having a positive attitude toward epilepsy. Therefore, it is essential for teachers to understand how to manage and respond to epilepsy. There were a variety of concerns related to people with epilepsy driving. This finding highlights the importance of disseminating correct information on the risks of driving with epilepsy.

AB  - We investigated how gatekeepers sometimes arrive at discriminatory hiring selections to accommodate prejudiced third parties due to role demands (i.e., the "third-party prejudice effect"). Studies 1 and 2 show that individuals in charge of personnel decisions were significantly less likely to select a woman when a relevant third party (the chief executive officer of the company in Study 1; the "proposer" in an ultimatum game in Study 2) was prejudiced against women. Gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice in this way in order to avoid conflict in relations and task-related problems that would likely occur if the gatekeeper introduced a member of the target of prejudice into an organization. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that both interpersonal and task-focused concerns significantly mediated third-party prejudice accommodation. Furthermore, experimentally reducing task-focused concerns significantly reduced the accommodation of third-party prejudice against women (Study 4). We also found that gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice regardless of their own beliefs and attitudes (Studies 5 and 6), or their own desire to get along or affiliate with the third party (Study 7), and despite leading to feelings of guilt (Studies 4 and 5). Both men and women accommodated third-party prejudice against women. A role-based framework can be useful to understand the persistence of gender inequality in various fields and organizations, even as individuals endorse increasingly gender-egalitarian views.

AB  - The field of social robotics offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the process of impression formation and the effects of identity-based stereotypes (e. g. about gender or race) on social judgements and interactions. We present the concept of fair proxy communication-a form of robot-mediated communication that proceeds in the absence of potentially biasing identity cues-and describe how this application of social robotics may be used to illuminate implicit bias in social cognition and inform novel interventions to reduce bias. We discuss key questions and challenges for the use of robots in research on the social cognition of bias and offer some practical recommendations. We conclude by discussing boundary conditions of this new form of interaction and by raising some ethical concerns about the inclusion of social robots in psychological research and interventions.

AB  - Transgender people are exposed to great amounts of discrimination and violence, but research has yet to fully understand what drives stigma towards this community. In this study, we hypothesized that social dominance orientation would be associated with greater gender minority stigma (i.e., stigmatizing views of transgender people), with this association mediated by higher levels of trait aggression and lower levels of critical consciousness. Data were collected online from 254 cisgender individuals (158 women, 96 men; M age = 30.81 years). Social dominance orientation was associated with higher levels of gender minority stigma. Trait aggression was not a significant mediator of this association. However, there was a significant indirect effect via lowered critical consciousness (B = 0.10, SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.17). Approaches that increase awareness about social hierarchies and systems of privilege will likely prove fruitful in facilitating social change in attitudes towards transgender people.

AB  - The implicit association test (IAT) is one of several measures of implicit attitudes, but it has attracted especially intense criticism. Some methodological objections are valid, but they are damning only if one accepts false analogies between the IAT and measures of intellectual aptitude, clinical diagnosis, or physical height. Other objections are predicated on misconceptions of the nature of attitudes (which are context-sensitive and reflect personal and cultural forces) or the naive assumption that people cannot be biased against their own group. Other criticisms are ideological, pertaining to questions of moral and political value, such as whether it is good to have fewer pro-White/anti-Black implicit attitudes and to provide respondents with feedback about their implicit attitudes. Implicit-attitude measures have been extremely useful in predicting voting and other political behavior. An indirect, unobtrusive, context-sensitive measure of attitudes is far more useful to social and political psychologists than an IQ test or clinical "diagnosis" would be, insofar as it reflects a dynamic Lewinian conception of the "person in the situation."

AB  - ObjectiveWe examine how women high in social dominance orientation reconcile supporting a social system that seemingly disadvantages them. We propose that women high in social dominance orientation are more likely to adopt a benevolently sexist worldview.
   MethodThis paper contains data from two survey studies. Study 1 used data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Survey (N=10,485) which is a study of social attitudes, personality, and health outcomes among New Zealanders. Measures of Social Dominance Orientation, as well as Hostile and Benevolent Sexism were included in Study 1. Study 2 consisted of data from a smaller sample of American females (N=269). In addition to the variables described above, we also measured the extent to which participants perceived the gender hierarchy to be legitimate and their perceived personal need for protection from men. Control variables included hostile sexism and demographic variables (participants' age, race, and socioeconomic status).
   ResultsResults revealed that social dominance orientation was a stronger predictor of benevolent sexism among women compared to men. Serial mediation analysis was then conducted in Study 2. Study 2 confirmed the hypothesised mechanism: Higher social dominance orientation was associated with perceptions that women's low status is legitimate which, in turn, was associated with higher perceived personal need for protection from men. This was then associated with the endorsement of a benevolently sexist worldview.
   ConclusionOur findings suggest that social dominance orientation might help to explain why some women endorse benevolent sexism.

AB  - Two dimensions persist in social cognition when people are making sense of individuals or groups. The stereotype content model (SCM) terms these two basic dimensions perceived warmth (trustworthiness, friendliness) and competence (capability, assertiveness). Measured reliably and validly, these Big Two dimensions converge across survey, cultural, laboratory, and biobehavioral approaches. Generality across place, levels, and time further support the framework. Similar dimensions have emerged repeatedly over the history of psychology and in current theories. The SCM proposes and tests a comprehensive causal theory: Perceived social structure (cooperation, status) predicts stereotypes (warmth, competence), which in turn predict emotional prejudices (pride, pity, contempt, envy), and finally, the emotions predict discrimination (active and passive help and harm). The SCM uncovers systematic content and dynamics of stereotypes, which has practical implications.

AB  - Psychological essentialism is a pervasive conceptual bias to view categories as reflecting something deep, stable, and informative about their members. Scholars from diverse disciplines have long theorized that psychological essentialism has negative ramifications for inter-group relations, yet little previous empirical work has experimentally tested the social implications of essentialist beliefs. Three studies (N=127, ages 4.5-6) found that experimentally inducing essentialist beliefs about a novel social category led children to share fewer resources with category members, but did not lead to the out-group dislike that defines social prejudice. These findings indicate that essentialism negatively influences some key components of inter-group relations, but does not lead directly to the development of prejudice.

AB  - There is no evidence that learning a natural human language is cognitively harmful to children. To the contrary, multilingualism has been argued to be beneficial to all. Nevertheless, many professionals advise the parents of deaf children that their children should not learn a sign language during their early years, despite strong evidence across many research disciplines that sign languages are natural human languages. Their recommendations are based on a combination of misperceptions about (1) the difficulty of learning a sign language, (2) the effects of bilingualism, and particularly bimodalism, (3) the bona fide status of languages that lack a written form, (4) the effects of a sign language on acquiring literacy, (5) the ability of technologies to address the needs of deaf children and (6) the effects that use of a sign language will have on family cohesion. We expose these misperceptions as based in prejudice and urge institutions involved in educating professionals concerned with the healthcare, raising and educating of deaf children to include appropriate information about first language acquisition and the importance of a sign language for deaf children. We further urge such professionals to advise the parents of deaf children properly, which means to strongly advise the introduction of a sign language as soon as hearing loss is detected.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Sitting down to read a work of fiction was a well-established is activity within. British society by the early-twentieth century but one duct was mainly enjoyed by the country's more leisured classes. After the First World War, however, changes to the publishing industry's working practices, coupled with the growth of the "open access" system in public libraries in the 1920s and the spread of twopenny libraries in the 1930s, created a new type of reader, drawn principally from the country's working-class communities. This article reveals that the spread of the working-class hook-reading habit prompted a series of discussions among the country's cultural elites, publishers, and public and commercial librarians regarding how that social group engaged with the written word. Many of these commentators were highly disparaging of the working classes' reading and book-borrowing habits and, based on a prejudiced understanding of that social group's cultural capital, sought to influence the types of reading material available to them, particularly with regard to what was accessible in the country's public libraries. The article argues that while the outbreak of the Second World War may have tempered these discussions somewhat, class distinctions surrounding the reading habit continued to shape people's participation in it, thus revealing that even during a period when class divisions were supposedly blurring, attitudes toward social class and leisure remained essentially unchanged.

AB  - This study focused on the endorsement of Roma empowerment in Macedonia among Roma (N = 187) and non-Roma (Macedonian, Albanian, and Turkish; N = 627) adolescents. Using structural equation modelling, we examined the mediating roles of out-group feelings, negative Roma stereotypes, and perceived social injustice towards the Roma in the association between out-group contact and endorsement of Roma empowerment. In line with the prejudice reduction model, we found for the non-Roma sample that the endorsement of Roma empowerment was higher among adolescents who had more frequent (as well as more positive) contact with Roma, and this was due to more positive feelings towards the Roma, less negative Roma stereotypes, and, in the case of Albanian and Turkish minorities, more perceived social injustice towards the Roma. There was little evidence for the collective action approach in the Roma sample.

AB  - Introduction. - The high prevalence and numerous negative correlates of weight-related bullying among youth emphasize the need to prevent and counter this phenomenon in school settings. This scoping review aims at: (a) determining whether the anti-bullying programs identified in previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses take weight-related bullying into account, and (b) pinpointing effective intervention strategies against weight-related bullying.
   Literature findings. - None of the 10 systematic reviews and meta-analyses retained addressed weight related bullying directly. However, their findings highlighted some intervention strategies that may help prevent and reduce this type of bullying.
   Discussion and conclusion. - The results underscore the need to consider weight-related bullying more closely in anti-bullying programs implemented in elementary, middle, and high schools. It is also important to target the intervention strategies most likely to lead to the prevention and reduction of weight-related bullying. Such strategies could include, for example: (a) education, training, and awareness-raising, for school personnel, concerning weight bias, norms and prejudices; and (b) social and emotional support for students who are victims of weight-related teasing or bullying.

AB  - Previous research shows that Multiracial adults are categorized as more Black than White (i.e., Black-categorization bias), especially when they have angry facial expressions. The present research examined the extent to which these categorization patterns extended to Multiracial children, with both White and Black participants. Consistent with past research, both White and Black participants categorized Multiracial children as more Black than White. Counter to what was found with Multiracial adults in previous research, emotional expressions (e.g., happy vs. angry) did not moderate how Multiracial children were categorized. Additionally, for Black participants, anti-White bias was correlated with categorizing Multiracial children as more White than Black. The developmental and cultural implications of these data are discussed, as they provide new insight into the important role that age plays in Multiracial person perception.

AB  - With the shift of political discourse in the European Union away from the idea of multiculturalism, the notion of 'civic integration', frequently accompanied by the language of cultural differences, has become prominent in policies and social interventions. This study explores the experiences of an integration project entitled 'Cultural Friend Tibro', initiated in Western Sweden by local authorities. The main idea of the project is to bring together representatives of different cultural groups - immigrants and local residents - and facilitate the development of friendship-like relationships. Mutual learning, exchange and joy are especially emphasised as a means to overcoming prejudices and social divisions. No specific requirements in terms of ethnicity are demanded of the participants: local residents involved in the project are not expected to be of Swedish origin. Instead, the requirement is that they possess sufficient knowledge of Swedish culture and society. Both categories of participants are considered 'cultural friends'. The procedure of 'matching' newly arrived and 'established Swedes' is hoped to initiate interpersonal interactions. Matching couples individuals or families is done with reference to gender, family situation and possible common interests or hobbies. It is left to the participants themselves to decide whether they would like to develop further relationships. In spite of the seemingly open and friendly format initially promoted by the project organisers, practices of estrangement ('othering') have surfaced in participant reflections on how the project was implemented. In this study, I identify and critically examine manifestations of othering as an effect of employing the notion of culture in the project's rhetoric, as well as possible ways by which participants may spontaneously destabilise the constructed cultural boundaries. This case study is built on the analysis of multiple sources, including ten semi-structured interviews with project participants, inquiries with the project leader, analysis of project documents and advertisements and social media materials.

AB  - Power is thought to increase discrimination toward subordinate groups, yet its effect on different forms of implicit bias remains unclear. We tested whether power enhances implicit racial stereotyping, in addition to implicit prejudice (i.e., evaluative associations), and examined the effect of power on the automatic processing of faces during implicit tasks. Study 1 showed that manipulated high power increased both forms of implicit bias, relative to low power. Using a neural index of visual face processing (the N170 component of the ERP), Study 2 revealed that power affected the encoding of White ingroup vs. Black outgroup faces. Whereas high power increased the relative processing of outgroup faces during evaluative judgments in the prejudice task, it decreased the relative processing of outgroup faces during stereotype trait judgments. An indirect effect of power on implicit prejudice through enhanced processing of outgroup versus ingroup faces suggested a potential link between face processing and implicit bias. Together, these findings demonstrate that power can affect implicit prejudice and stereotyping as well as early processing of racial ingroup and outgroup faces.

AB  - Introduction: People with disabilities often identify professionals' stigmatic views as significant barriers to accessing mainstream services. This study aimed to examine differences in stigmatic attitudes held by social workers toward individuals with intellectual disabilities ( ID), mental illness ( MI), or dual diagnosis ( DD) of ID and MI. Methods: One hundred and fifty-eight social workers responded to three versions of a structured questionnaire. Participants were provided, in random order, with vignettes describing an individual with ID, MI, and DD, after which they completed the Attribution Questionnaire. Results: Results revealed a significant effect of disability type, so that individuals with MI were perceived to be more responsible for their condition than were individuals with ID or DD. Individuals with MI and DD were perceived as more dangerous than those with ID, and social workers endorsed more coercive and segregating behaviors toward individuals with MI and DD than toward those with ID. No differences were found in helping and avoidant behaviors in relation to disability type, and correlations between stigma constructs were found across all three disabilities. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in light of social workers' obligation to assist individuals to realize their rights to full social and civil inclusion. Given these obligations, they are expected to set aside their personal views and provide help to all their clients regardless of their diagnosis.

AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention-in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N5105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

AB  - Using data from a 2011 national household survey, this study examines the factors shaping urban residents' prejudice toward rural-to-urban migrants and the impacts of prejudice on rural migrants' integration into urban communities. The author addresses the endogeneity of the prejudice variable by employing an instrumental variable method. The results show that urban residents with higher education and household income report stronger prejudice. Also, urban residents with urban hukou at birth are more prejudiced toward rural migrants. Given that hukou status at birth is tied to parental hukou status, this result implies that prejudice can be transferred across generations. With regards to rural migrants' integration into urban communities, high levels of prejudice in one's current county of residence reduces perceived social standing of rural migrants and increases the number of livelihood problems they encounter. The author also conducts a falsification test, which provides support that the effect of urban residents' prejudice on rural migrants' integration is causal.

AB  - Purpose Perceived vulnerability to disease (beliefs about personal susceptibility to contracting an infectious disease) is usually related to the expression of prejudice towards different stigmatized groups. In this study, the relationship between this variable and the expression of the prejudice towards obese people was analyzed.
   Method The sample comprised a total of 137 children and teenagers, aged between 12 and 17 years, from a Spanish high school who fulfilled several scales which measure perceived vulnerability to disease, antifat attitudes and perceived controllability of weight. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) was calculated by means of the participants' height and weight.
   Results Perceived infectability (one of the factors of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale) was negatively related to controllability of weight, and germ aversion (the second factor of the vulnerability scale), showed a positive relationship with the antipathy towards obese people. Finally, perceived controllability of weight was positively correlated with BMI.
   Conclusions The implications of these results in the field of the study of the prejudice toward obese people are discussed. To our knowledge, no other studies have investigated the relationship between perceived vulnerability to disease and antifat attitudes in minors. Additionally, this is the first time that the measured BMI has been used instead of the self-reported one.

AB  - Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-, regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types, and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment. Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always better than cure.

AB  - This paper explores religious adolescents' reported experiences of secondary schools. Fifty-four qualitative interviews were conducted in places of worship in three cities in England with Christians (n=46), Jews (n=38) and Muslims (n=15). Secondary schools of a religious and non-religious character were reported as not providing a suitable environment for religious observances, nor as a place to act and behave according to participants' religious principles. Religious adolescents reported prejudice and criticism of their beliefs or religious affiliations from their peers and sometimes from teachers. They also perceived their religious traditions to be distorted, inaccurately or unfairly represented in some lessons. The focus of this paper is the identity choices religious adolescents reported in response to these challenges. Three groups of identity choices are theorised and explored: religious identity seeking, religious identity declaration and religious identity masking. The findings are discussed in view of religious identity construction theory, good practice for teachers and also the potential concerns of faith communities.

AB  - Sexually permissive individuals are judged harshly by others, yet little research has examined whether these individuals themselves feel more victimized and socially isolated. Among 810 undergraduates (74% females; 38% non-White; ages 18-23), linear, logistic, and negative binomial regressions indicated that, after controlling for demographics, higher numbers of lifetime casual sex partners predicted (a) more relational aggression experiences and sexual behavior-based prejudice, but (b) less loneliness, greater likelihood of having a best friend, and higher numbers of close friends, acquaintances, and relatives. Controlling for extraversion rendered most isolation, but not victimization, links nonsignificant. There were few sex differences. Results suggest a complex relation between permissiveness, victimization, and isolation, indicating resiliency among permissive individuals in the face of adversity.

AB  - There are conflicting findings regarding the development of essentialist beliefs about social categories. The present studies address these findings by differentiating between the developments of the relative versus absolute essentialist status of categories. Participants were Israeli Secular Jewish and Muslim Arab kindergarteners, second graders, and sixth graders. Study 1 asked children which among alternative properties of a parent was most likely to transfer to a child. Findings showed that while kindergarteners did not systematically discriminate among properties, second and sixth graders privileged ethnicity. Study 2 asked children whether membership in various social categories was biologically or environmentally determined. Findings showed that kindergarteners and second graders, but not sixth graders, believed ethnicity to be biologically inherited. These results are discussed vis-a-vis different theories about the origins of social essentialism.

AB  - This article presents key findings from the International Child Neurology Association/African Child Neurology Association Workshop. The viability of international guidelines for the management of children with epilepsy should be reviewed within each African country, and adapted to comply with the regional capacity. Such recommendations can be used to lobby for resources. More training centers should be developed in Africa, so that specialists can be trained within Africa, in skills relevant to the continent, in collaboration with "out of Africa" visiting-specialists to develop the concept of "train the trainers." At least 1 child neurology specialist per 100 000 of the population is required. Specific to Africa are the challenges from stigma, prejudice, and misconceptions. "Epilepsy teams," inclusive of the traditional healers, would enable management of increased numbers of children, and challenge policy such that it is the right of the child with epilepsy to have reliable access to appropriate antiepileptic drugs, support, and health care equity between the rural and urban settings.

AB  - Background. In this paper, we focused on mixing in educational settings between members of Catholic and Protestant ethnoreligious groups in Northern Ireland. Aims. In Study 1, we examined whether opportunities for contact at home and at university were associated with greater actual out-group friendships, and whether this friendship was associated with a reduction in prejudice. We also assessed whether the impact of out-group friendships at university was moderated by experience of out-group friendships outside university, such that the prejudice-reducing effect of university friendships was stronger for those with fewer friendships at home. In Study 2, we assessed opportunities for contact and actual out-group friendships at prior stages of the educational system and their relationship with prejudice. Sample(s). In both studies, our participants were students at universities in Northern Ireland (Study 1 N= 304 and Study 2 N= 157). Methods. We analysed the data using multiple regression and structural equation modelling. Results. First, opportunities for contact were positively associated with self-reported out-group friendships in all domains and stages of the educational system. Second, having more out-group friends was associated with reduced prejudice. Finally, the relationship between out-group friendships and current levels of prejudice was moderated by prior levels of out-group friendships (at home in Study 1; and at secondary and primary school in Study 2). Conclusions. Contact, in the form of out-group friendships, was more powerful when it was a novel feature in a person's life. We discuss these findings in terms of the impact of mixing in educational contexts, especially in Northern Ireland, and outline suggestions for future research.

AB  - Humans are empathic animals. We automatically match other people's motor responses, allowing us to get "under the skin" of other people. Although this perception-action-coupling a form of motor resonance occurs spontaneously, this happens less readily with the outgroup (vs. the ingroup) and for those high (vs. low) in prejudice. Thus, prejudice diminishes our tendency to resonate with the outgroup. Here we suggest that the reverse is also possible that resonating with the actions of an outgroup member can reduce prejudice. We predict, in other words, that explicitly mimicking the outgroup can reduce prejudice. Participants watched a 140-second video depicting actors repeatedly reaching for and drinking from a glass of water. They passively watched a video with Black actors; watched the video and mimicked the Black actors; or watched and mimicked a video with actors from their ingroup. Participants then completed the Affect Misattribution Procedure (Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005), a measure of implicit anti-Black prejudice, and an explicit symbolic racism measure. Results indicate that the outgroup-mimicry group had similar implicit preference for Blacks and Whites, unlike the other two groups, which preferred Whites over Blacks. The outgroup-mimicry group also reported less explicit racism towards Blacks than the ingroup-mimicry group, but no less than the ingroup-observation group. Mimicking specific outgroup members, therefore, reduces implicit, and possibly explicit, bias against the outgroup more generally. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a substantial literature documenting pre-schoolers' racial awareness and affect from multiracial societies in North America and a fast-growing body of work from societies that are or were once more racially homogeneous. However, studies in Britain, a racially diverse society, on this developmental period have been curiously rare. This study examined racial awareness and affect of 125 White, Black, and Asian 3-to 5-year-olds in London. Children were tested on cognitive level, person description and classification, race labelling and matching, self-categorization and asked about their racial preference and rejection and inferences about their mothers' preference and rejection. Children were least likely to use race versus other categorical cues to spontaneously describe or classify others, even though the majority correctly sorted others by race labels, matched them to drawings, and categorized themselves by race. With age and increasing cognitive level, children described and categorized others by race more and improved in race matching. White children from age 4 preferred White peers and inferred that their mothers would prefer White children at age 5. Children's own preference and inference about mothers are related. Children did not show race-based rejection, but boys inferred that their mothers would prefer White children and reject Black children. The findings are discussed in relation to racial salience between contexts, previous research, and theories.

AB  - Adopting an evolutionary approach to the psychology of race bias, we posit that intergroup conflict perpetrated by male aggressors throughout human evolutionary history has shaped the psychology of modern forms of intergroup bias and that this psychology reflects the unique adaptive problems that differ between men and women in coping with male aggressors from groups other than one's own. Here we report results across 4 studies consistent with this perspective, showing that race bias is moderated by gender differences in traits relevant to threat responses that differ in their adaptive utility between the sexes namely, aggression and dominance motives for men and fear of sexual coercion for women. These results are consistent with the notion that the psychology of intergroup bias is generated by different psychological systems for men and women, and the results underscore the importance of considering the gender of the outgroup target as well as the gender of the agent in psychological studies on prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Four studies examined whether members of the dominant group ( New Zealand Europeans) who were high in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) employed ideologies of equality-as-meritocracy to legitimate opposition toward policy-based resource allocations that favor disadvantaged groups. We tested this model, derived from Social Dominance Theory, using cross-sectional ( Study 1; N = 338) and longitudinal data ( Studies 2-4) collected in New Zealand. As predicted, SDO ( but not Right-Wing Authoritarianism) exerted a cross-lagged effect on Equality Positioning and not vice-versa ( Study 2; 1 year, N = 81); Equality Positioning exerted a cross-lagged effect on attitudes toward resource-specific social policies but not vice-versa ( Study 3; 4 months, N = 132); and the cross-lagged effect of SDO on attitudes toward resource-specific policy was mediated longitudinally by Equality Positioning ( Study 4; 1 year, N = 47). These findings indicate that the ideological positioning of equality is ( at least partially) driven by individual differences in the motivation for group-based social dominance, and this in turn determines support for social and political policies that govern the group-based allocation of resources within society and thus systemic inequality.

AB  - Although researchers predict that experiencing greater trait mindfulness should be related to less prejudiced attitudes towards others, the evidence has been inconsistent. We suggest that this is due to the narrow operationalizations of mindfulness that have been utilized thus far. Specifically, research to date has relied solely on mindfulness as it pertains to the self. We therefore examined an expanded definition of mindfulness to study the role of nonjudgmental attitudes towards others and its relation with prejudice. Using a new measure of Nonjudgmental Regard towards Others (NRO), the current study found that Ideological Acceptance, or judgments of another's actions, ideas, and personality, and Emotion Acceptance, or acceptance of another's emotions and emotional expressions, were independently associated with prejudiced attitudes towards numerous different outgroups such as drug users, people who are overweight, homosexuals, and people with disabilities. Furthermore, they were able to explain variance over and above the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism. Having a nonjudgmental regard towards others, not just the self, may be an important component of mindfulness that has not yet been explored.

AB  - Mental illness (MI) stigma has been characterized as multi-dimensional including problems of knowledge (stereotypes), attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination); however, most research practice is predominantly applying unidimensional behavioral measures such as social distance scales. Moreover, specific types of MIs and different forms of discriminatory behaviors are not being differentiated. The Stereotype Content Model predicts that group stereotypes (warmth, competence) are linked with different forms of discriminatory behaviors (harm or facilitation) via emotional prejudices (pity, envy, contempt). The present study sought to establish how differential stereotypic perceptions of MI subgroups elicit distinct forms of behavioral discrimination via emotional prejudices. A community sample (N = 60) was randomly assigned to one of three conditions representing MIs across the warmth-competence stereotype space. Patterns of self-completed measures for stereotypes, emotions and behaviors differed significantly between conditions. The association between stereotypes and behaviors were largely mediated by emotions. Systematic patterns of stereotypic perceptions, emotional prejudices and behavioral discrimination are present for individuals with different types of MIs. Hence, generic measures of discrimination, such as social distance scales, may be misleading. Intervention strategies should consider the systematic variation of the factors involved in stigma, differentiating by type of MI and discriminatory behaviors.

AB  - Deeply embedded racism and white supremacist beliefs have made efforts to dismantle discriminatory norms an elusive civil liberty endeavor. In the United States, social welfare policies have historically been founded on prejudicial values of racism and white privilege. Key historical events and political eras have catalyzed the pervasive dominance of white patriarchal values that embody dismissive social constructs that undergird public service institutions. The content of this dialogue will discuss America's social welfare history beginning with the British era through the Biden/Harris era utilizing critical race theory (CRT) and intersectionality theory to deconstruct the daunting biases that perpetuate racial inequities in the development and administration of social welfare policies. In addition, this conversation will aim to identify strategies to address the structural racism and prejudicial practices within public service institutions in hopes of shifting the dialogue towards evidence-based research, policies, and equitable public administration systems. This Vantage Point commentary provides an opportunity to reflect on emerging issues related to the perpetuation of structural racism and institutionalized discriminatory practices woven into America's social welfare policies' historical context Moreover, this timely discussion offers strategies to deconstruct, dismantle, disregard, devise, and disseminate white-supremacist practices embedded within social welfare policies and public service systems.

KW  - MORAL EXCLUSION
AB  - This article describes a Baha'i concept of peace in the context of discussions about the nature and focus of peace education, in particular the role of moral education as an element of peace education. It introduces the notions of human nobility and the oneness of humanity as the moral basis for holistic peace within a framework of the collective social evolution of humanity, and explores the idea of identifying, understanding, and removing barriers to unity, specifically in the form of inequalities and prejudices, as the foundation of an approach to peace education. The application of such an approach to a university level course is shared through a case study of 'The Problem of Prejudice', offered by the Baha'i Chair for World Peace at the University of Maryland, College Park. Key strands of content and pedagogy are described, and qualitative data from students participating in the course in 2021 (n = 20), collected in the form of self-perceptions of changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes and commitment, are presented. The article concludes with a discussion of the learning gained from this study and how a Baha'i concept of peace may serve as a resource for university peace educators and students.

AB  - This study examined the extent to which social stress stemming from a stigmatized social status (i.e., minority stress) was associated with three domains of health in younger as compared with older age cohorts of sexual minority individuals. Data were analyzed from the Generations Study, a longitudinal study using a probability sample (N = 1518) of age cohorts of sexual minority individuals in the USA. Exposure to a variety of minority stressors was associated with poorer health for all age cohorts. We hypothesized that because of improved social and legal environments in recent years, the associations between minority stress and health would be diminished in the younger cohort. As expected, we found that the associations between some minority stressors and health outcomes were diminished in the younger cohort compared to older cohorts. Positive associations between community connectedness and mental health and social well-being were observed for all participants but were attenuated in the younger cohort. Findings demonstrate the continuing negative association between minority stress and health among sexual minorities, which, despite some attenuation, persists even for young cohorts of sexual minority individuals in a more equal and accepting social climate.

AB  - There has been a resurgence in populist politics, often accompanied by anti-immigrant rhetoric. This may potentially spill over into societal hostility towards immigrants. We use census data on 5th -grade Italian students to estimate the causal effect of anti-immigration politics on school bullying. Using variations in the timing of municipal elections, we demonstrate that where elections occur and the anti-immigration party Lega Nord is highly active, the victimisation of immigrant children increases, while we find no effect where Lega Nord has little support and for native children, suggesting important negative spillovers from politics to the wellbeing of children.

AB  - Prejudice against people with Vitiligo is pervasive across societies. However, little attention has been given to measuring individual differences on the way that it is expressed. To overcome this gap, we developed and validated the Scale of Prejudice towards People with Vitiligo (SPV) throughout six online studies. Studies 1a and 1b (N = 136) addressed the development of the SPV's items, their content and semantic validity. Study 2 (N = 121) showed that its nine items are organized into three correlated factors (cognitive, behavioral, and affective) with high internal consistency. Studies 3a and 3b (N = 386) confirmed this factor's structure using confirmatory factor analysis, and explored the convergent-discriminant validity of the instrument. Study 4 (N = 417) replicated these findings and demonstrated the SPV's configural, metric, and scalar invariance between two experimentally manipulated target-groups: Black person with Vitiligo versus White person with Vitiligo. Results also showed experimental criterion validity, in that participants scored higher on SPV in the Black (vs. White) Vitiligo condition. Furthermore, results revealed that the higher the social contact with people with Vitiligo, the lower the prejudice expressed towards this population. When combined, these findings are the first to document the correlational and experimental evidence of a measure of prejudice towards individuals with Vitiligo.

AB  - This study examines the interplay of positive and negative intergroup contact with majority group members from the perspective of ethnic minority youth. Taking a social identity approach, we posit that negative contact experiences (i.e., hostile interactions) may undermine the benefits of some positive contact experiences (i.e., friendly interactions) for minority contact orientations (e.g., openness to and anxiety about cross-group interactions). Conversely, for other positive contact experiences, in particular high-quality forms of positive contact (e.g., friendship), we expect that their beneficial effects will not be undermined, and that the adverse effects of negative contact may even be buffered by such high-quality positive contact experiences. We tested our predictions in a sample of U.S. Latino/a youth (N = 126) nested in 41 classrooms, using a multilevel design. As expected, friendly interactions predicted more favorable contact orientations only in the absence of negative contact, while high-quality positive contact robustly predicted more favorable contact orientations and even buffered negative contact effects. These findings illuminate how negative contact can cast a long shadow over the inclusion of minority youth in intergroup settings; moreover, they indicate the importance of curbing hostile treatment targeting minority youth and of promoting high-quality positive contact over and above mere friendly interactions.

AB  - Socially disadvantaged youth are a group to which prejudices are attached which question the appropriateness of their participation, communication and language in the digital setting. From this perspective, the aim of the present research proposes to identify the forms and expressions of communication used by socially disadvantaged young people from the city of Madrid in social networks. This will be examined as a tool for the development of interpersonal and social relatedness processes, which will enable inclusion and socialisation in contemporary society. To this end, a qualitative approach was proposed which enabled a set of core memos, codes, networks and categories to be established, through which study data were interpreted. WhatsApp images and interviews conducted with 78 informants were analysed using Atlas.ti 9 software. All participants belonged to a social group characterised by circumstances of social vulnerability. Of the main findings, it should be indicated that these young people exhibit a social network use that is not limited to engagement in digital leisure but, instead, is based on the exchange of communication. For this reason, these individuals have developed their own language, a fact that highlights specific traits of the digital culture to which they belong and contributes to disproving the idea that these young people use the digital setting inappropriately.

AB  - Generics (e.g., "Dogs bark") are thought by many to lead to essentializing: to assuming that members of the same category share an internal property that causally grounds shared behaviors and traits, even without evidence of such a shared property. Similarly, generics are thought to increase generalizing, that is, attributing properties to other members of the same group given evidence that some members of the group have the property. However, it is not clear from past research what underlies the capacity of generic language to increase essentializing and generalizing. Is it specific to generics, or are there broader mechanisms at work, such as the fact that generics are terms that signal high proportions? Study 1 (100 5-6 year-olds, 140 adults) found that neither generics, nor high-proportion quantifiers ("most," "many") elicited essentializing about a novel social kind (Zarpies). However, both generics and high-proportion quantifiers led adults and, to a lesser extent, children, to generalize, with high-proportion quantifiers doing so more than generics for adults. Specifics ("this") did not protect against either essentializing or generalizing when compared to the quantifier "some." Study 2 (100 5-6 year-olds, 112 adults) found that neither generics nor visual imagery signaling high proportions led to essentializing. While generics increased generalizing compared to specifics and visual imagery signaling both low and high proportions for adults, there was no difference in generalizing for children. Our findings suggest high-proportion quantifiers, including generics, lead adults, and to some extent children, to generalize, but not essentialize, about novel social kinds.

AB  - The increasing sectarianization of the international relations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a defining feature of the region's contemporary politics. Iran has sought to increase its influence among Shi'i populations of foreign countries, while Saudi Arabia and other Sunni regimes have moved to curtail it. In heterogeneous and polarized MENA societies, like Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, where the Shi'a constitute a sizable proportion of the population and compete for political power, it is natural to presume that sectarianization likely increases tension and prejudice against the Shi'a. Yet, little is known about homogenous MENA societies, where the Shi'a exist as an infinitesimal, uninfluential minority that does not seek political power. This topic is examined using an original, nationally-representative survey of 2,000 respondents in Morocco. We find that about 59 per cent of individuals express interpersonal prejudice against Moroccan Shi'a, expressing discomfort at the prospect of having a Shi'i neighbour. Such prejudice is counter-intuitive, given that Moroccan Shi'a constitute a miniscule minority - less than .1 per cent of the population. We investigate three hypotheses concerning the sources of anti-Shi'i prejudice, which locate them in social marginalization, religious beliefs and practices, and views about regional politics. The first two hypotheses are drawn from the existing literature, whereas the third is our unique theoretical contribution. Our results, which find support for the connection between individuals' views about regional politics and anti-Shi'i prejudice, advance scholarly understanding of religious diversity in the MENA, showing how international developments can trickle down into interpersonal relations to hinder the acceptance and tolerance of sectarian minorities.

AB  - Sexual minority men living in Africa, where many countries criminalize same-sex behavior, are vulnerable to HIV and experience significant barriers to HIV care. Sexual prejudice in healthcare settings is a key contributor to these barriers. Building on social psychological models of prejudice and interpersonal contact at the clinic, we examined the associations between healthcare workers' sexual prejudice and their comfort to provide care to MSM, and assessed the moderating role of workers' prior interpersonal contact with MSM. A cross-sectional survey of 147 healthcare workers varying in level of training and expertise working in HIV care organizations was conducted in western Kenya. Sexual prejudice was negatively associated with comfort to provide care to MSM. Prior interpersonal contact with MSM moderated the association between sexual prejudice and comfort to provide care to MSM among nurses/counselors, such that those with low prior contact and high sexual prejudice were the most uncomfortable providing care to MSM. Interventions are needed to address sexual prejudice and encourage positive forms of interpersonal contact with MSM, especially with nurses and counselors who might have more and varied patient interactions, to improve access to the continuum of HIV prevention and care for MSM in Kenya.

AB  - Research links intrinsic religiousness to less prejudice toward Black people and greater prejudice toward gay people. We examined longitudinally in a sample of 865 adolescents three variables that might serve as a mediator of attitudes toward Black people yet produce a suppression effect in attitudes toward gay people: (a) humanitarian values, (b) favorable evaluations of social groups, and (c) socially desirable responding. In light of evidence that Black people on average are more religious than are White people, we also examined whether self-identifying as Black helped explain racial prejudice. Our mediation analyses provided strong evidence that humanitarian values and the tendency to view all social groups favorably accounted for the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and positive attitudes toward Black people. We found no support that socially desirable responding or identifying as Black accounted for our effects. Consistent with a suppression effect, controlling statistically for the agreeable aspects of religiousness strengthened the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and prejudice toward gay people. These findings illustrate mechanisms through which intrinsic religiousness can correspond both positively and negatively with attitudes toward marginalized groups.

AB  - The interpersonal distance kept by each individual plays a prominent role in daily social interactions and typically communicates implicitly human attitudes toward conspecifics. While it is held that men dyads keep a larger distance than women, information about whether such sex-related distance is moderated by sexual orientation and implicit/explicit sexual prejudice is scarce. To explore this issue, Heterosexual and NonHeterosexual Men and Women (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual) were immersed in virtual reality and asked to provide comfort-distance judgements in relation to approaching male or female avatars. Results showed that same-sex comfort-distance was smaller for Non-Heterosexual compared to Heterosexual participants. Moreover, the larger distance toward the male avatar kept by Heterosexual Men was associated with the implicit prejudice toward gay men. Our results indicate that comfort-distance demarcation is modulated by sexual orientation and that implicit sexual prejudice leads to increased interpersonal comfort-distance, a possible proxy to avoidant behaviors. Our approach suggests that immersive virtual reality may allow to overcome limitations typical of studies with real participants and provide a unique opportunity to explore the physiological and neural underpinnings of sexuality-related variables that regulate interpersonal distance.

AB  - The social identity theory proposed by Tajfel et al. provides insight into how group membership and self-categorization cause intergroup prejudice and discrimination, finally leading to social conflicts. However, unanswered questions remain: under what conditions can an "in-group" and an "out-group" transform conflictual intergroup behavior into a more harmonious relationship and avoid social conflict? Opinion dynamics theory and social simulation are appropriate methods to answer this question. In this study, a new model of opinion dynamics proposed by Ishii is adopted, and we conduct simulations of intergroup conflicts. The new model, along with social simulations, presents how an in-group and an out-group can develop social harmony and avoid social conflict. According to our simulations, when the two groups trust their members 100%, the opinion inside an in-group converges. However, intragroup opinion diverges as trust within the group gets lower. On the other hand, intergroup opinion converges when the intergroup trust is higher than 50%. If intergroup trust is higher than 80%, then the intergroup opinions of the two perfectly overlap. Furthermore, if intragroup trust is 70% and intergroup trust is as low as 50%, the two groups' opinions completely polarize. We also calculated additional cases where intragroup trust was fixed at 70%, but for one-third of an in-group member trust an out-group with various values. Finally, a method to avoid further social crises can be obtained by examining real-world cases of partisan conflicts in recent America.

AB  - Parents of sexual minority youth are an important population for research, both because parent support is a key predictor of the mental health of sexual minority youth and as a population with their own experiences and needs. Despite this importance, there are challenges to recruiting parents of sexual minority youth for psychological research, including relatively few community-based organizations for this population and the stigma some parents feel about having a sexual minority child. The current study evaluated the feasibility of 4 online strategies for recruiting parents of sexual minority youth ages 13-18 for a study about parent support: web search advertisements, parent support networks, social media, and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We found that MTurk was the most effective of the recruitment strategies attempted in terms of number of participants recruited (n = 184; 90% of participants who completed the study), completion rate, and ease of recruitment, whereas both MTurk and social media yielded more diverse samples than parent support groups in terms of gender. Web search advertisements were the least effective and did not yield any participants who completed the study. We discuss implications for future research and provide recommendations for researchers who are conducting online research with this population.

AB  - One prominent social-cognitive model of internalized stigma by Corrigan and his colleagues (2012; 2002) proposes that individuals are exposed to societal stereotypes about mental illness, at least tacitly agree with them, and may apply them to oneself, engendering harmful self-beliefs. There is limited empirical support for this model in serious mental illness. Moreover, it is not clearly established how internalized stigma and its associated factors impact recovery in this population. The current study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the social-cognitive model?s goodness of fit in a sample of Veterans with serious mental illness (Veteran sample, n = 248), and then validates the model in a second and independent sample of individuals receiving communitybased psychiatric rehabilitation services (community sample, n = 267). Participants completed the Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (SSMIS; Corrigan et al., 2006) and measures of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and recovery attitudes. Consistent with Corrigan and colleagues? formulation of internalized stigma, SEM analyses showed a significant indirect pathway from stereotype awareness, to stereotype agreement, to application to self, to selfesteem decrement, to poorer recovery attitudes. Additionally, there was a significant direct effect from stereotype awareness to self-esteem. This study shows that individuals with serious mental illness experience psychological harm from stigma in two ways: (1) through perceived public prejudice and bias, and (2) through internalizing these negative messages. In particular, stigma harms individuals? self-esteem, which then reduces their recovery attitudes.

AB  - The paper aims to investigate whether trust in a host government can mitigate the negative effects caused by the social complexities facing low-status expatriates (LSEs) living in China. It models trust in host government as a mediator in the relationship between expatriates' perception of status-based prejudice and their work attitudes; it further outlines the role of self-esteem in this relationship. The study seeks to expand knowledge in the domain of expatriate management by explaining the prejudicial behavior of host country towards low-status expatriates. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze responses from LSEs in China. The results provide the evidence that perceived discrimination negatively affects expatriates' work attitudes and suggest that trust in the host government can mediate such effects. Self-esteem is found to be a significant moderator in the relationship. With this, the study empirically affirms social categorization theory, showing it to be a powerful lens through which LSE adaptability can be the behavior of host nationals towards low-status expatriates and can be further developed with regard to the adaptability of low-status expatriates.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its intensity are harbingers of demographic change. In the context of social demography, it is crucial to explore the social challenge emerging from the coronavirus disease. The main purpose of this study is (i) to explore the determinants that affected the population in Greece in terms of social isolation during the lockdown period and (ii) to examine possible differences in the assessment of the social isolation factors depending on whether individuals live in urban or rural areas or regions with relative geographical isolation. Field research was conducted with 4216 questionnaires during the first wave of COVID-19 (March to April 2020). Multivariate analysis methods were applied to detect the main factors that impacted the feeling of social isolation, and nonparametric tests were performed to detect possible differences between population groups. Despite the resistance shown to the spread of the disease, the Greek population totally complied with the measures of social distancing and thus was socially and psychologically affected. The results indicate that psychosomatic disorders, employment situations, changes in sleep habits, socialization on the Internet, demographic status, health concerns, and trust in government and the media response determine the Greeks' social isolation feeling. Pandemic and confinement measures have consequences for individuals and social groups and may prejudice social cohesion at multiple levels. By understanding how the pandemic affected the societies, interventions and public policies may be implemented to ensure both social cohesion and populations' wellbeing by addressing the social isolation feeling.

AB  - Aim: This research was planned and conducted as a cross-sectional descriptive study in order to determine the nutritional status, compliance with the Mediterranean diet, physical activity levels, and obesity prejudices of adolescents, and to evaluate the relationship between them. Methods: The research was conducted with 233 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years who studied at a high school in the Oskiidar district of Istanbul. A 3-day food consumption record and anthropometric measurements of the participants were made, and the KIDMED scale, IPAQ scale, and GAMS-27 scale were applied. Results: 50.2% of the adolescents participating in the study were girls and 49.8% were boys; the mean age was 15.57 +/- 1.12 years. The mean BMI scores of the girls and boys were 22.55 +/- 3.85 kg/m(2) and 22.85 +/- 3.52 kg/m(2), respectively (p>0.05). The average waist / height ratio for girls was 0.45 +/- 0.05, and for boys it was 0.47 +/- 0.05 (p <0.05). It was determined that girls consumed an average of 1673.28 +/- 469.36 calories daily and boys consumed 1823.31 +/- 576.70 calories (p<0.05). The mean KIDMED score of the participants was 4.31 +/- 2.48, the mean IPAQscore was 3524.65 +/- 2236.81 MET, and the mean GAMS-27 score was 82.56 +/- 11.46. Discussion: As a result of the research, it was concluded that the participants complied with the Mediterranean diet at a low-moderate level, were minimally active, and prone to having obesity prejudices.

AB  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have suffered violence and extreme prejudice in every walk of life as a result of the European colonisation of Australia. We acknowledge the ongoing colonial legacy to this suffering and discuss how cultural safety is a solution to overcoming some elements of the disadvantages that still beset Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in terms of accessing health care. Accessible and culturally safe health services are critical in reducing health inequalities for First Nations' people because of the burden of ill-health they experience. 'Cultural safety' in this context refers to approaches that strengthen and respectfully engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures in mainstream services. Alongside holistic Indigenous health and primary prevention approaches, a broad range of medical, socio-cultural and allied health support is needed to alleviate these inequalities. In this article, we describe how the working relationship between Aboriginal Hospital Liaison Officers and Social Workers in public hospitals in Victoria, Australia, contributes to cultural safety, and thereby improves the quality of care and a reduction in discharges against medical advice by Aboriginal patients. We conclude that elements of this model may be applicable to improving care for First Nation peoples in other countries.

AB  - This current study qualitatively explored Chinese international students' coping strategies and social support resources in dealing with academic stressors. A consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology was used on analyzing data gathered from semi-structured interviews. We identified an array of academic stressors and differentiated them according to the frequency labels (from general to rare). Academic competency, academic culture shock, academic resources, intercultural communication and pressure were found to be the main sources of Chinese students' academic stressors. In response, Chinese international students tended to utilize different coping strategies and social support resources to deal with academic stressors. Specifically, they generally employed problem-coping strategies to deal with competency-related challenges, but more preferred forbearance coping for other types of academic stressors. Furthermore, co-national peers emerged as the primary source of Chinese students' social support in academic learning, followed by support from multi-national students, university/tutors, and host students, respectively. The results obtained from the data implied that it was the heritage culture, instead of the host academic context, that strongly affected Chinese students' behavioral features in class and their responses to academic stressors. We provided practical implications for the host university, as well as interventions at the individual and institutional levels.

AB  - In current immigration debates ethnic prejudice is often expressed in a subtle manner, which conceals its xenophobic content. However, previous research has only insufficiently examined the specific features that make certain ethnically prejudicial statements subtler, i.e., less readily identifiable as xenophobic, than others. The current study employs an experimental factorial survey design and assesses the subtlety of systematically manipulated prejudicial statements. Our data from a German random population sample (N = 895) indicate that the subtlety of ethnically prejudicial statements is manipulable along the dimensions of topic, linguistic (essentialist) phrasing, and target group: Prejudicial statements that refer to culture, that are phrased weakly essentialistically, and that target Muslims were subtlest, in being evaluated as least xenophobic by the respondents. Moreover, with an increasing internal and a decreasing external motivation to respond without prejudice, individuals reacted more strongly to the variation of the statements' topic and linguistic phrasing and were thus more sensitive to features determining subtler and more blatant ways of ethnic prejudice expression. These findings contribute to a better understanding of current migration discourses, in demonstrating that the specific manner in which ethnic prejudice is communicated can camouflage the xenophobic nature of a statement, so that it is less readily recognized as prejudicial.

AB  - This essay brings together political theories of empire and racial capitalism to clarify the entanglements between socialist and imperial discourse at the turn of the twentieth century. I show that white labor activists and intellectuals in the United States and the British settler colonies borrowed from imperial scripts to mark non-white workers as a threat. This discourse was thus both imperial and popular, because it absorbed the white working class into settler projects and enlisted its support in defense of imperial logics of labor control. While white workers' demands of enfranchisement were part of a transnational imagination that was both imperial and narrowly emancipatory, this discourse reemerged as one of popular sovereignty and found channels and paths to institutionalization through national states. These institutional formations arose out of the encounter between capitalists interested in facilitating mobility of racialized laboring subjects around the globe, elite projects invested in sheltering settler spaces, and white workers concerned with protecting their own labor from competition by excluding exploitable non-white workers. White labor's embrace of racial prejudice and the exclusion of workers of color created segregated labor spaces that fit neatly with both capitalist goals of labor control and the protection of the settler status of emerging polities. Bringing to the forefront the imperial genealogy of popular sovereignty and immigration control disrupts liberal political theory frameworks that condemn restrictions as well as those that find migration restrictions permissible. The analysis also illuminates contemporary immigration politics.

AB  - Sexual prejudice toward men who have sex with men (MSM) is a pressing concern in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Given the high HIV infection risk among this population, sexual prejudice perpetuated by healthcare providers, affects access to and willingness of MSM to seek HIV care services. However, data on healthcare providers' attitudes towards MSM in SSA are limited, and there are no locally-adapted measures of sexual prejudice. We adapted a scale to measure sexual prejudice with a sample of 147 healthcare providers in western Kenya. Results from exploratory factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure. The scale demonstrated high internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha = 0.91. Healthcare providers who had prior interpersonal contact with MSM, had ever been trained on counselling MSM, and had higher knowledge about MSM health needs reported lower sexual prejudice scores, compared with peers who lacked these experiences (p < 0.001). In contrast, healthcare providers who had experienced secondary stigma (negative judgments from peers and community) for providing care to MSM reported higher scores of sexual prejudice scale (p < 0.001) compared with providers who had not experienced secondary stigma. The scale provides a contextualised tool to assess healthcare providers' attitudes toward MSM in Kenya and countries in SSA with similar cultural norms.

AB  - Despite the common belief that sport is an excellent instrument to promote social inclusion, distal minority stressors, such as homophobic slurs and insulting or degrading comments, are frequently reported in sport contexts. The aim of this contribution was to expand previous knowledge on negative attitudes toward sexual minorities (gay and lesbian people) in sport-related contexts, by examining how staff employed in organizational sport contexts scored on three different dimensions of sexual prejudice toward sexual minority athletes: open rejection (i.e., blatant prejudice), denial of visibility (i.e., negative attitudes toward the coming out), and gendering performance (i.e., gender stereotypes about sport performance and skills). Furthermore, we examined the relationship between traditional norms of masculinity and dimensions of sexual prejudice. The sample consisted of 178 Italian sport directors and coaches who were asked to complete an online survey (70 women and 108 men, mostly aged from 38 to 65 years old). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that participants scored higher on denial of visibility, with respect to open rejection and gendering performance, independently of gender and sport role. The structural equation model showed that endorsing traditional male role norms was significantly associated with open rejection and gendering performance, whereas no significant association was found with denial of visibility. The findings provide further evidence that sexual prejudice is prevalent in sport organizations, supporting the importance of raising awareness among sports personnel about prejudiced beliefs that may lead minority people to experience severe stress-inducing situations.

AB  - We review recent research investigating the effect of shared human values on personal and social outcomes. Using more precise methods than past research, cross-sectional and experimental evidence suggests that well-being and prejudice are predicted by the extent to which people's values align (or are perceived to align) with those of other people around them. Importantly, this research shows that these effects depend on the type of values being considered and are more nuanced than prior research suggests. For example, well-being is higher among individuals who perceive their fellow citizens to share their values of power and achievement. Prejudice against immigrants is higher among individuals who value conservation more but perceive immigrants to value openness. Moreover, experimentally highlighting actual value similarities rather than mean differences improves attitudes towards outgroups. We discuss how future studies can improve our understanding of value similarity effects and their underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Given the aggressive behaviours and negative attitudes associated with hegemonic masculinity, and the fact that men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women, people might choose to avoid men displaying characteristics consistent with hegemonic masculinity. In a vignette-based study, we assessed whether the gender of a person displaying behaviours and attitudes consistent with hegemonic masculinity influenced people's desire for social distance. Further, we explored whether the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and social distance was mediated by perceived dangerousness. A fictitious man displaying attitudes and behaviours consistent with hegemonic masculinity was perceived to be more dangerous than a woman displaying the same characteristics, and an increase in perceived dangerousness was associated with a desire for greater social distance. Once this was removed from the direct path, there was no link between the gender of the fictitious individual and social distance, indicating that people do not desire greater social distance from men but from anyone exhibiting 'toxic' attitudes and behaviours. The findings have important clinical implications, highlighting the role social connections play in changing prejudiced attitudes and recovery from depression.

AB  - This article explores the challenges facing British Muslim women in the UK today in the face of increased racism. Taking Fanon as an initial inspiration, we ask: how can British Muslim women reconcile a British and Muslim identity when government strategy and widespread prejudice make these two identities irreconcilable? The study uses social dreaming as a method to provide opportunities for uncovering hidden and unconscious emotions and thoughts among the participants. We provide a contextual background followed by an analysis of the dreams and associations provided by the group. We conclude that the difficulties in identity for the women are accompanied by profound emotions of fear, mourning and desperation, as welt as gender insecurities in relationships with men. Finally, we suggest that policymakers and community leaders should focus on issues around belonging, acceptance, safety and agency for British Muslim women in order to encourage stronger and fairer integrated communities.

AB  - Scholars have addressed how the socially marginalized, individuals with fringe viewpoints, or the politically marginalized in authoritarian regimes use social media to organize or connect in secret. Yet intensifying partisan polarization and prejudice in the United States has made it necessary to study how mainstream partisans in liberal democracies use social media to organize in secret. This study explores why mainstream partisans in the United States-average Republicans or Democrats-organize in secret online and analyzes the unique functions of social media for political organizing amid contextual marginalization. Through interviews with group leaders and a digital ethnography of a secret Facebook group in the United States, I find that mainstream partisans use social media to form secret political groups when they are the minority in their local community and that the online secret group serves several unique functions for members. First, the group operates as a community of solidarity for those reticent to disclose their political beliefs and as a community of contention to criticize and revitalize the minority Party in their region. The group also operates as a community of practice, allowing members to learn and rehearse communication among like-minded others. These findings hold implications for how scholars study communication in a digital and polarized era and how practitioners gauge public opinion.

AB  - The present study aims to explore classical and modern prejudice towards individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) among a sample of Italian university students who attend Social Sciences and Physical Sciences degree courses. A convenience sample of 280 university students (51.4% doing Social Sciences degrees, and 48.6% doing Physical Sciences degrees) participated in this research. Two separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between the variables in order to identify which predictors affect the expression of prejudice towards people with ID. The results showed that classical prejudice was predicted by males, no prior work experience with individuals with ID, Big Five, personality traits such as agreeableness and openness, low reactive empathy, reduced quality of contact, and intergroup anxiety. Modern prejudice was predicted by males, students who attended Physical Sciences degree courses, no prior work experience with individuals with ID, low parallel and reactive empathy. Limitations and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - In post-conflict and segregated societies, overcoming high prejudice between groups is essential for peaceful coexistence. In this paper, we explore the roles of direct contact (face-to-face contact and cross-group friendship) and indirect contact (extended cross-group friendship) in reducing prejudice between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots living in Cyprus. Moreover, this study further explores whether the effects of direct and indirect contact vary between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, as well as across a ten-year period. To explore these issues, we analyze data from different representative samples of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots at two different time points (years 2007 and 2017). The results suggest that all three forms of contact have significant effects on prejudice. However, they also exhibit some variations by community (but not year of data collection) in the effects of direct (but not indirect) contact on prejudice.

AB  - This interpretative study examines the complexities of lesbian parents' experiences in organized youth sport programs. Specifically, it seeks to understand youth sport as a potential site for social change that facilitates a sense of inclusive community for diverse family structures. Using thematic analysis, the author examines perspectives of nine participants from Australia, Canada, and the United States. Emphasis is placed on how the lesbian parents (a) negotiate heightened visibility, sexual stigma, and parental judgment; (b) foster social relationships through participation, volunteerism, and positive role models; and (c) create shared understanding toward building an inclusive sport culture. The findings call attention to the importance of intentional and unintentional acts (by families as well as sport organizations) that create a sense of community and an inclusive organizational culture. The connection of lesbian parents' experiences to broader concepts, such as sexual stigma and transformative services, are also examined within the context of youth sport.

AB  - Prejudices against the unemployed pose an enormous threat to their self-confidence and can make it difficult for them to re-enter the labour market, resulting in further long-term unemployment. Given these high costs for the unemployed and for society as a whole, our knowledge of prejudices against the unemployed is surprisingly scarce. We focus on the question of what determines the strength of prejudice among employees. By applying social identity theory, we assume that people who are disadvantaged in the labour market in general, also hold stronger prejudices. In addition, we assume that social status mediates this association and that self-efficacy moderates it. We use data from the German panel study "Labour Market and Social Security" (PASS) and show that some groups of people who are themselves disadvantaged in the labour market (women and first-generation immigrants) have more prejudices against the unemployed; however, people with poor mental health have even fewer prejudices. Low social status (in terms of educational background, income, and job status) is associated with strong prejudices; however, social status does work as mediator to a minor degree only. People with low self-efficacy in general (main "effect") and first-generation immigrants in particular (moderating "effect") have stronger prejudices. These results can be a starting point for developing measures to reduce prejudice and for the onset of a debate about the origins of prejudices against the unemployed.

AB  - Previous research shows that the first year of a school counsellor's career is one of the most critical stages. However, despite this importance, there is a limited number of studies that examine what novice school counsellors experience during their first year. The primary purpose of this qualitative study is to examine in detail the common experiences of novice school counsellors who have worked the first year of their professional career and to explore comprehensive themes regarding these experiences. Following a purposive sampling strategy, 33 school counsellors who started their profession in 19 different cities of Turkey were interviewed. As a result of the thematic analysis, five major themes emerged describing the first-year experiences of school counsellors: 'Introduction', 'Fighting against Prejudices', 'Organising Counselling Service Room', 'Incongruence between Training and Work Definitions', and 'Longing for College Years'.

AB  - In the United States more than 8 million adults currently are covered by the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, with enrollment projected to increase in the coming decades. This qualitative study explores views on work disability in the United States, and specifically on the SSDI program, among the general public. Six focus groups with a convenience sample of nonbeneficiary adults (N = 41) were conducted in Los Angeles. We found that in spite of low levels of familiarity with the program, suspicion and prejudice against people claiming disability benefits and against the program itself were widespread among our participants. Specifically, participants argued that (a) there is a high prevalence of "scammer" disability applicants, and (b) the program fails to adequately safeguard against nondisabled claimants. Moreover, they viewed disability benefits as a symbolic admission of weakness, contrary to the U.S. ethos of hard work and against "government handouts," and expressed a preference for claiming disability benefits as a last resort if they were ever to develop a disabling condition. Exploring public perceptions of disability and disability benefit programs helps us shed light on current cultural narratives around these topical issues. Future research could examine the impact of stigma of beneficiary status on beneficiaries' wellbeing.

AB  - Can the military bridge social schisms? Conventional wisdom supports this assumption. However, it seems that, at best, the effect of military service on bridging social schisms and promoting social cohesion is limited. This article examines the extended effect of contact hypothesis in the military, both in practice and as an element capable of bringing about a change in veterans' thinking. It asks: are veterans who had diverse friendships during their service more likely to have diverse friendships in the future? If so, do they attribute their ability and willingness to include others within their ingroup to their military service? Based on findings from a study of Israeli college and university students, the article demonstrates that while indeed service friendships may be short lived, service alongside members of outgroups has certain longer-term effects and influences the social perception of veterans. Social messages can be both positive and negative and teach veterans the limits of redrawing social boundaries.

AB  - Aims Improving mental health literacy through school-based education may encourage mental health promotion, prevention and care and reduce stigma in adolescents. In Japan, instruction about mental illness has been formulated in a Course of Study that reflects governmental curriculum guidelines, which will be enforced from 2022 to promote an understanding of current issues of adolescent health. Educational resources available to schoolteachers have been developed. This article describes the development processes and contents of these resources. Methods Our collaborating team, consisting of mental health professionals and schoolteachers, developed educational resources, based on feedback from high school students in general and young people who had experienced mental health problems. Results The new Course of Study covers: (1) mechanisms of mental illness, prevalence, age at onset, risk factors and treatability; (2) typical symptoms of mental health problems and illnesses; (3) self-help strategies for prevention of and recovery from mental illness; (4) enhancing help-seeking and helping behaviour and (5) decreasing the stigma associated with people with mental health problems. The educational strategy is targeted at high school students (grades 10-12) and is conducted by teachers of health and physical education. The educational resources include short story animated films, filmed social contact and educators' manuals, which are freely available through the internet and open to all concerned including schoolteachers in Japan. Conclusions Our efforts are expected to help implement mental health education of the public throughout Japan and other countries and promote the practice of early intervention and prevention of mental illnesses in adolescents.

AB  - An increasing literature has emerged to examine development of social enterprises (SEs) in varying national or regional contexts. This paper presents empirical research on SEs in Finland's Swedish-speaking regions. Differences between Finnish speakers and Swedish speakers have been identified in studies on, for instance, social capital and communality. Both groups have equal constitutional status. This study focuses on the prevalence, role and characteristics of SEs in Swedish-speaking regions. The research data consist of statistical and other background data, a survey and strategy documents. The study shows that SEs do not appear to be more common in the Swedish-speaking regions, despite positive preconditions for SEs and their operations in those regions. At the same time, Finnish SEs still appear to face similar challenges in, for instance, their funding and management, and general prejudice and ignorance about SEs.

AB  - We investigate whether personal information posted by job candidates on social media sites is sought and used by prospective U.S. employers. We create profiles for job candidates on popular social networks, manipulating information protected under U.S. laws, and submit job applications on their behalf to more than 4,000 employers. We estimate employer search activity and bias in interview callbacks. We find evidence of employers searching online for the candidates. At the national level, we find no significant difference in the callback rates for a Muslim versus a Christian candidate, or for a gay versus a straight candidate. However, employers in Republican areas exhibit significant bias against the Muslim candidate relative to the Christian candidate. This bias is significantly larger than the bias in Democratic areas. The results on callback bias are robust to using state- and county-level data, to controlling for firm, job, and geographical characteristics, to including additional interaction effects in the empirical specification, and to several estimation strategies. The results suggest that the online disclosure of certain personal traits can influence the hiring decisions of some U.S. employers, but the likelihood of hiring discrimination via online searches varies across employers.

AB  - This study examines the migration experiences of women and men in Thai-European transnational couples, focusing on how their respective identities and social locations affect their engagement with the host society. It is based on in-depth interviews with 13 European husbands in Thailand and 13 Thai wives who have recently returned from Europe. We find that European husbands in Thailand experience elevated status as they are perceived by Thai locals to be transnationally privileged with wealth and power; while Thai wives in Europe experience cultural and social downward mobility, often facing prejudice and discrimination. The elevated status that European husbands experience in Thailand leads many to adopt a 'Eurocentric' approach, leading to a lack of engagement with Thai society. However, both groups of migrants are relatively vulnerable: the perceived elevated status of European husbands tends to decline over time; while Thai wives in Europe lack substantive social and emotional safety nets.

AB  - Radicalization and violent extremism are pressing problems across the world. After initially addressing problems in defining radicalization and extremism, this article sketches a new social-developmental model based on a systematic integration of theories and empirical findings. We propose a three-step model of radicalization starting with ontogenetic social-developmental processes during the most dynamic period for social development, from early childhood to late adolescence. These processes include the interaction of societal, social, and individual risk and protective factors. In adverse cases this interplay encourages the establishment of proximal radicalization processes between early adolescence and middle adulthood. We assume that four interrelated bt distinct social-developmental processes are central conditions for radicalization and extremism: identity problems, prejudice, political or religious ideologies, and antisocial attitudes and behavior. These proximal processes are triggered by actual societal, social, or individual conflicts (such as economic crisis, victimization) and marked by continuous intergroup processes. The more intense the proximal processes, the greater the likelihood of extremist attitudes and behavior. The article closes by discussing implications for early prevention and an outlook for further research.

AB  - Background: Most studies suggest that immigrant youth are more likely to be victimized than their non-immigrant counterparts. In Italy, a country in which the number of foreign migrants has grown exponentially over recent decades, this line of research is particularly interesting. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between peer victimization, gender, and immigrant status in a large sample of students. Method: The research used data from a cross-sectional Italian survey on the "Integration of Second Generations," which was administered to 68,127 students in grades 6 through 13 (49% female; 47% immigrant). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between immigrant status and gender with verbal, physical, and relational victimization, after adjusting for socio-demographic variables. Results: Immigrant and male participants were more likely to be classified as frequently victimized. The significant interaction effect between immigrant status and gender revealed that male immigrant students were more likely to belong to the frequently relationally victimized category compared to their counterparts. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of including immigrant status disparities in peer victimization research. Prevention efforts and intervention strategies should be implemented to create safe environments in Italy.

AB  - With the lack of "gay" social spaces, their community has gone through integration but also fragmentation processes; the need to relate safely still emerges among its members. This study aims to understand whether the relationships between loneliness and relational motives towards People- Nearby Applications (PNAs) uses are moderated by individuals' sexual orientation. An online questionnaire including the Cyber Relationships Motives Scale and the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults - short version was administered to 618 PNAs users. No significant differences emerged between heterosexual people and people from sexual minorities except for the relationship between Social Loneliness and PNAs use to search for love, which emerged as positive for the first group and negative for the latter. These results suggest that nowadays the loneliness characterizing how people live local communities has the same role for both heterosexual people and sexual minorities, but also that the latter could still perceive stigma and prejudices when it comes to the search of romantic partners; it seems like PNAs have the role of adaptive answer to the troubles in meeting new people offline for them.

AB  - This research aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between racial prejudice and White Americans' views on cannabis legalization. The recent legalization of recreational cannabis in a handful of states, along with many other states legalizing medical cannabis in recent years, has catapulted the flowering plant back into the spotlight and nightly news cycles. Given the historically racist propaganda used to criminalize the plant, it follows that Whites' support for legalization may be associated with racial prejudice. Using data from the General Social Survey data from 1972-2018, we find that different forms of racial prejudice have a negative effect on Whites' support for cannabis legalization generally. Additionally, as the negative effect of overt, old-fashioned racism diminishes over time and across birth cohorts it is supplanted by the more subtle laissez-faire racism. In conclusion, we discuss the implication of the relationship between racial prejudice and views on marijuana for the increasingly complicated racial dynamics surrounding cannabis legalization.

AB  - Recent work on the social effects of video gaming has moved away from the view they are detrimental, and has instead demonstrated how they may be a force for good. One example is how collaborative intergroup play can reduce prejudice between groups. However, this literature is at a nascent stage, and many of the intricacies of such a mechanism are unknown. Previous work has predominantly used attitude scales and ignored other measures. Factors such as the role of the opponent in games and what may be the mechanism behind any effects have likewise received little attention. In this laboratory study, participants played collaborative games with an outgroup member or alone. Their opponent was also reported to be computer controlled or controlled by another person. Following play, intergroup anxiety was reported, and participants wrote a short passage of prose regarding the outgroup and rated on attitude scales. Analysis demonstrated that playing with outgroup members was indeed an effective method of increasing the positivity toward outgroup members, reflected in both scale and prose measures. Anxiety was also found to be a significant mediator; however, it was less clear whether a human opponent moderated any effects. Further ideas of how these findings could be developed are then discussed.

AB  - This research investigates the phenomenon of "friendly" sexist teases (FSTs), which we define as playful intergroup teases that are based on the negative gender stereotypes that devalue one's gender group. We first employed a diary study to explore the prevalence of FSTs in college students' everyday life and found that this type of teasing tends to occur in social situations and often between close others. In a second study, we experimentally manipulated perceived closeness with the teaser. We predicted that individuals teased by someone with whom they shared a perceived closeness would interpret FSTs as playful fun; therefore, the tease would not have a negative psychological effect. We further predicted that those teased by someone less close would likely focus on the literal content of the sexist tease, resulting in negative consequences to gender self-esteem. Results supported these predictions and provided insight into the phenomenon of FSTs.

AB  - For LGBT students in England, a curious contradiction exists between policy and practice. Within government policy, teachers have been discursively constructed as protectors and defenders of students' rights. Yet, within everyday schooling, teachers might perpetuate or enable discrimination themselves. In order to explore this tension, this article creates four categories to deconstruct different motivations for, and manifestations of, teacher discrimination: 'unaware' teachers, 'apathetic' teachers, 'reluctant' teachers and 'prejudiced' teachers. It interrogates how ignorance, apathy, reluctance and prejudice become imbricated in complex social, historical and political legacies of identity erasure, normalised violence and moral discourses of young people's welfare and desexualised innocence. Seeking to apply international human rights law to the best of its (imperfect and ever-evolving) capacity, the article then evaluates how each category of teacher discrimination might be addressed by the text and jurisprudence of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The goals of the article extend beyond the British context: to generate new analytical tools for conceptualising and differentiating between diverse types of teacher discrimination and to utilise human rights frameworks in advocating for more inclusive classrooms.

AB  - Roma people all over the world have often been subject to prejudice, stigma, discrimination and oppression. Many Roma have little or no education, which in combination with other factors often leads to unemployment and marginalization. Based on a case study in Sweden, this paper proposes an approach that can be used in participatory projects aiming at improving the living situation of marginalized people. In such an approach, the Roma themselves would be the leaders in all activities concerning the group. The first aim of this paper is to describe how health literacy and work-integrated learning functioned as empowering tools for a Roma-led inclusion process within a participatory action research framework. The second aim is to discuss and reflect on the use of participatory action research in community work with Roma based on the experiences of the participatory action research participants. The findings indicate that work-integrated learning may be a worthwhile approach for increasing the individual empowerment and self-led social inclusion of vulnerable people. However, the obstacles of structural discriminatory nature hindered the project to reach its full potential in its intended emancipatory goals.

AB  - Objectives We examined whether and how habitual mindfulness (defined as a broad manifold of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence) relates to ethical sensitivities, operationalized as moral attitudes (as measured by the Moral Foundations Questionnaire) and prejudice. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using factor analysis and path analysis in two independent samples (n = 358 and 424) of college students. Results With regard to mindfulness, we found that two higher-order measures of self-awareness (i.e., reflective awareness and controlled sense of self in the moment) influenced two higher-order measures of self-regulation (i.e., self-preoccupation and self-compassion), as well as self-transcendence, which was additionally influenced by self-regulation. Path analysis showed that reflective awareness and self-transcendence were directly related to individualizing aspects of morality (i.e., an emphasis on care and fairness); only self-transcendence and social conservatism were related to binding aspects of morality (i.e., an emphasis on loyalty, authority, and sanctity). The individualizing stance, in turn, led to less explicit prejudice, more awareness of privilege, and, indirectly, a higher motivation to control one's prejudiced reactions. Implicit prejudice, however, was not related to any of the examined variables. Conclusions The Stoic and Buddhist conjecture that ethical sensitivities can be fostered through mindfulness might well work: Distinct aspects of the mindfulness manifold were directly and indirectly related to the moral foundations; explicit prejudice, awareness of privilege, and the motivation to control one's prejudiced reactions were likewise related to select aspects of the mindfulness manifold. Within the manifold, reflective awareness and self-transcendence are key variables implicated in awakening and fostering ethical sensitivities.

AB  - BackgroundThe use of arterial closure devices in achieving femoral hemostasis has been well documented in adults but insufficiently studied in the pediatric population. An earlier study from our institution of 40 Angio-Seal devices in 38 patients concluded that the arterial closure device is safe in children with only a single minor complication. Ongoing experience with this device at our institution, however, suggests a higher rate of complication.ObjectiveTo retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Angio-Seal in a pediatric population.Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis reviewed all cases in which the Angio-Seal was deployed from June 2011 to September 2017. Peri-procedural documentation was reviewed for pre-procedure labs, clinical effectiveness in achieving hemostasis and complications related to the use of this device. Logistic regression analysis was also used to evaluate the relationship between patient demographic, vessel size and indication for angiography, and the presence or absence of complications.ResultsDuring the study period, 48 additional Angio-Seal devices were deployed in 41 consecutive patients. Five patients were excluded for being older than 18years. The mean age of the patients was 13.3years (range: 4-18years) with 18 patients female. The mean common femoral artery diameter was 5.98mm in short axis diameter (range: 4-9mm). Complications were present in 6/43 cases (14%) including 3 minor and 3 major complications that included additional procedures. No significant relationship was identified between vessel size, age and the indication for angiography, and the rate of complication on logistic regression analysis.ConclusionWhile percutaneous arterial closure devices can be efficacious for achieving hemostasis, our experience demonstrates a higher rate of complications in children, contrary to a previous report. The deployment of such devices should be performed with prejudice in this population.

AB  - The current study integrated prior research demonstrating 1) a mediational process by which the Five-Factor Model personality factor Openness to Experience, transmitted through right-wing authoritarian ideology, predicts sexual prejudice and 2) that the Five-Factor Model personality facet Openness to Values may be the more precise personality root of this process. Participants were 79 college students who completed a comprehensive measure of Five-Factor Model personality factors and facets and other relevant measures. Results supported hypotheses. In particular, facet-level Openness to Values accounted for comparable unique variance in sexual prejudice as factor-level Openness, and analyses of direct and indirect effects and overall model fit supported Openness to Values as the precise source predictor of the mediational pathway. Discussion focuses on preliminary evidence that Openness (and perhaps its facets) may be cultivated, and sexual prejudice reduced, by contact interventions. I emphasize in particular the promise of contact interventions that avoid frustration of the dogmatic personality by enhancing the experiential processing mode, including encouraging mental simulation of alternate social values.

AB  - Prejudice can be expressed toward a wide array of target groups, but it is often operationalized as being expressed toward a narrower array of groups. By studying a heterogeneous array of target groups, we can draw broader conclusions about prejudice writ large. Here, we describe our research, in which we seek to understand constructs that consistently predict prejudice across a wide array of groups (consistent predictors), as well as constructs that predict prejudice for only some types of groups (inconsistent predictors). For inconsistent predictors, we can also identify the perceived characteristics of the target groups (e.g., status, ideology) that are associated with expressed prejudice. Studying a heterogeneous array of target groups opens up new questions related to morality, cognitive processing, and perceived discrimination but also suggests that prejudice, depending on the group, can be a motivating force preserving the status quo or prompting social change.

AB  - Many older adults require assistive technology to maintain mobility (e.g., canes, walkers, wheelchairs, or scooters), but concerns about experiencing prejudice because of mobility devices can deter use. We explore this potential prejudice in a sample recruited through online crowdsourcing. Overall, prejudice toward older adult mobility device users was not observed. Older adult mobility device users were evaluated more positively than common prejudice target groups. However, heightened prejudice toward older adult mobility device users was observed among those higher in authoritarianism or social dominance orientation. This was explained by perceptions that older adult mobility device users are a greater threat to resources (e.g., health care spending. time, attention) among those higher in these qualities. This pattern was present at all ages assessed but was stronger for those who were younger versus older. Relationships between ideology and heightened threat from older adult mobility device users were not present for those older than 60 years of age. Our results demonstrate that concerns about this prejudice are not completely unwarranted.

AB  - The present study tested a three-component model of homophobia and transphobia that differentiates between general and specifically gender-based social threats that motivate these prejudices. A sample of 187 female and 107 male heterosexual U.S. college undergraduates were randomly assigned to complete survey measures of homophobia and transphobia with either born-female (lesbian and female-to-male transgender, respectively) or born-male (gay man and male-to-female transgender, respectively) targets, as well as measures of religious fundamentalism, right wing authoritarianism, aggression, and ambivalent sexism. The participant by target-gender interaction for transphobia showed that transphobia was particularly high for male participants judging born-male transgender targets. Possibly reflecting a fear of any social non-conformity, religious fundamentalism and right wing authoritarianism were positively correlated with homophobia and transphobia regardless of participant or target gender. Possibly reflecting specific fears among men about threats to male privilege, physical aggression proneness was strongly positively correlated with homophobia and transphobia for men judging a male target. Aggression proneness was also positively correlated with homophobia for women judging a female target. Possibly reflecting specific fears among women about threats to female social roles, benevolent sexism was only positively correlated with transphobia for female but not for male participants, with no target-gender difference. Benevolent sexism was also correlated with homophobia for female participants judging a male target. These findings were largely supportive of the three-component model of gender-based prejudice.

AB  - Although Finnish politics relating to the Roma tend to be perceived internationally as fairly successful, several obstacles exist for the Roma in education and the labour market. Training of Roma mediators has been actively promoted in Finland to improve the school performance and equality of Roma pupils. This article, based on ethnographic research, focuses on exploring how the current discursive terrain around the topics of tolerance and prejudice functions in the everyday work of mediators. It is argued that the present discourses in school expose the mediators to unequal power relations of tolerance. The terms for being tolerated are set by the potential tolerating actors, the school community. The mediators aim to supply knowledge about the Roma and try to address prejudices as representatives of the Roma. The study identified three different strategies that the mediators used when encountering prejudice: making sure one does not seem too different, parody and feigning naivety. The analysis suggests that the present discursive terrain creates obstacles to addressing inequalities, discrimination and racism in educational contexts. The responsibility for tackling discrimination is placed on the shoulders of individual Roma - not the whole school community.

AB  - Despite the increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ community, sexual minorities continue to face prejudice and discrimination in many domains. Past research has shown that this prejudice is more prevalent among those holding conservative political views. In two studies, we merge strategic essentialism and motivated ideology theoretical perspectives to empirically investigate the link between political orientation and sexual prejudice. More specifically, we examine how conservatives strategically use different forms of essentialism to support their views of gay individuals and their reactions to messages aimed at changing essentializing beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 220), we demonstrate that conservatives endorse social essentialism (i.e., the belief that gay and straight people are fundamentally different from each other) more than liberals do. In turn, they blame gay individuals more for their sexual orientation and show more prejudice toward them. At the same time, conservatives endorse trait essentialism (i.e., the belief that sexual orientation is a fixed attribute that cannot be changed) less than liberals do, which in turn predicts greater levels of blame and prejudice for conservatives relative to liberals. In Study 2 (N = 217), we additionally show that conservatives, but not liberals, are resistant to messages aimed at increasing trait essentialism and reducing prejudice toward sexual minorities. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB  - The 20th and 21st centuries have been marked by a number of traumatic events: with the two World Wars, Korean War and, especially in the last twenty-five years, with conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa, as well as others, vast numbers of people have been displaced and have had to journey far and wide to find not only a new home but a safe haven from the atrocities of war. While discrimination against newcomers to a country, prejudice, racism, nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and authoritarian dictatorships are not new phenomena, what makes the recent reactions to the current worldwide human influxes different is the use of language manipulation, propaganda and hate speech via social media to re-stigmatize and re-traumatize the new refugees, asylum-seekers, immigrants and migrants. Social media platforms give everyone the opportunity to express their views, whether positive or negative, about anyone who could be considered the other. Both right-wing and left-wing parties and governments also see the usefulness of using the manipulation of the labels given to newcomers and inciting fear of them for their own agendas. In this paper we will investigate how the use of linguistic labels and stereotyping about the other contribute to the rise of hate speech worldwide and how the presence of hate speech about the newcomers has re-traumatized many refugees who had thought they had reached a safe haven after fleeing the source of their original trauma. For the purpose of this study, we will be using data that primarily refers to Italy and Poland, as well as some other examples.

AB  - In this article, we propose the conceptualization of family structure as an important socially stratified grouping within a social determinants of health (SDOH) framework. We explore how family science literature supports this conceptualization of family structure through evidence of inequity in health outcomes across structurally diverse families that can and ought to be addressed; social stratification across family structures in which some family forms have greater prestige and power than others; and internalized, personally mediated, and institutional prejudices and discriminations that operate on the basis of these social stratifications. Ultimately, we contend that conceptualizing family structure as a socially stratified grouping within an SDOH framework can help enhance family science scholarship and assist family professionals in more effectively serving contemporary families.

AB  - Stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminatory behaviors directed toward people based on their sexual orientation vary broadly. Existing perspectives on sexual prejudice argue for different underlying causes. sometimes provide disparate or conflicting evidence for its roots, and typically fail to account for variances observed across studies. We propose an affordance management approach to understanding sexual prejudice, which weds the fundamental motives theory with the sociofunctional threat-based approach to prejudice to provide a broader explanation for the causes and outcomes of sexual prejudice and to explain inter- and intragroup prejudices more broadly. Prejudices arise as specific emotions designed to engage functional behavioral responses to perceived threats and opportunities (i.e., affordances) posed by different sexual orientation groups. and interact with the perceiver's chronic or temporarily activated fundamental motives (e.g.. parenting, mating), which determine the relevance of certain target affordances. Our perspective predicts what stereotype content is likely to direct specific affective and behavioral reactions (i.e., the stereotypes that relay threat- and opportunity-relevant information) and when the affordance-emotion-behavior link is likely to engage (i.e., when those threats and opportunities are directly relevant to the perceiver's current fundamental goal). This article synthesizes the extant sexual prejudice literature from an affordance management approach to demonstrate how fundamental goals interact with preexisting perceptions to drive perceptual, affective, and behavioral responses toward sexual orientation groups, and provides a degree of explanatory power heretofore missing from the prejudice literature.

AB  - When doing research among vulnerable populations, researchers are obliged to protect their subjects from harm. We will argue that traditional ethical guidelines are not sufficient to do this, since they mainly focus on direct harms that can occur: for example, issues around informed consent, fair recruitment and risk/harm analysis. However, research also entails indirect harms that remain largely unnoticed by research ethical committees and the research community. Indirect harms do not occur during data collection, but in the analysis of the data, and how the data is presented to the scientific and wider societal community. Highly stigmatized research subjects, like substance-dependent parents, are especially at risk of encountering indirect harm, because the prejudice against them is so persistent. In this paper we discuss two forms of indirect harm. First, researchers have to be aware how their results will be preceived by society. Even when subjects are presented in an objective way, further, out of porportion stigmatization can occur. Researchers sometimes try to counteract this by whitewashing their results, at the risk of downplaying their respondents' problems. The second risk researchers face is that their own normative judgements influence how they question such parents, report results and interpret statements. Researchers' own normative judgements may influence the way they present their subjects. This article reviews a broad range of research that exhibits such indirect harms, discussing how and why indirect harms occur and formulating corresponding recommendations on how to prevent them.

AB  - The turn to language in social psychology is closely related to the study of prejudice as racist discourse has been the subject matter of some of the ground-breaking discourse analytic work. A widely accepted argument was that there seems to be a norm against prejudice informing Western societies: people commonly engage in denials of prejudice when they make negative comments about minorities. Recent work has argued that, due to ideological shifts in the wider societal context or because denying prejudice may not be people's only rhetorical concern, it is possible to find people admitting prejudice. We examine how people in Greece, Greek majority and immigrants, formulate admissions of racism in interviews on migration and citizenship in Greece. Drawing on Ideological Dilemmas and Critical Discursive Social Psychology, we argue that these admissions ironically operate within the norm against prejudice and discuss our findings in relation to the wider socio-political Greek context.

AB  - Both ability and motivation aspects of cognition have been shown to relate to ethnic prejudice. In line with recent theorizing, the present study advances an integrated cognition perspective on ethnic prejudice by examining the interplay between cognitive ability (measured with the Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test) and cognitive motivation (measured with the Need for Cognitive Closure [NFC] Scale) in a Belgian, heterogeneous adult sample (N = 315). Path analysis revealed that intelligence and NFC each have unique and independent effects on ethnic prejudice, and that both right-wing authoritarianism and essentialist thinking play a mediating role in these effects. Hence, although cognitive abilities and motivations are to some extent interrelated and operate in similar ways, they uniquely and additively contribute to the explained variance in ethnic prejudice.

AB  - Individuals do not become immune to the risks of violence and abuse as they age, and older adults-particularly older women-face intersectional stigma: the compounding of social prejudice and assumptions that draw on a range of factors, such as age, gender and sexuality. These biases influence perfections of risk, the relative invisibility of older women in the fields of elder abuse, intimate-partner and sexual violence, and a lack of recognition of older survivors' needs among professionals in positions to help. Given that older women face attitudinal and practical barriers to services, social workers must comprehend the impact of both ageism and gender disparities on older survivors of intimate-partner and sexual violence. We offer recommendations to bridge the gaps between service providers' assumptions about older women in crisis and the support survivors actually need.

AB  - Most social psychological research on anti-immigration prejudice has examined the point of view of the national ingroup-generally defined as the citizens of the country under consideration-toward immigrant outgroups. Threat perceptions related to immigration as well as national identification have been shown to underlie negative attitudes. Whether these two factors also explain attitudes among individuals sharing characteristics with the immigrants remains largely unstudied. To fill this gap, the present research examines perceived threat, national identification, and different facets of anti-immigration prejudice among Swiss residents with and without an immigrant background. Results of a path model conducted on data from the International Social Survey Programme 2013 (N = 1,198) showed that, as expected, natives reported higher levels of prejudice than both citizens of foreign descent and immigrants. While group differences in prejudice were in part explained by differences in threat perceptions, the role of national identification was more nuanced. Altogether, these findings suggest that social psychological research should go beyond simplistic "national ingroup vs. immigrant outgroup" conceptualisations when examining anti-immigration prejudice.

AB  - Psychological essentialism is the layperson's belief that social categories are natural and entitative. Studies have shown that essentialist beliefs are strongly connected with different types of prejudice. Previous research into essentialist beliefs predominantly used a variable-centred approach to investigate the relationship between essentialist beliefs and prejudice. Extending this research, we used a person-centred approach to explore the relationship between different essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation and gender (naturalness, homogeneity, discreteness and informativeness). The study involved 282 (sample 1) and 194 (sample 2) respondents from Russia with different sexual orientations. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three distinct essentialist belief profiles, which are the same for both our target groups, gay men and lesbian women. We examined the relationships between belonging to essentialist belief profiles and social distance towards gay men and lesbian women. We found individuals from various profiles differed in levels of gender identification and right-wing authoritarianism. Individuals with relatively low levels of naturalness beliefs and high levels of essentialist beliefs about the social and psychological differences between gender groups and between heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals demonstrated greater social distance towards gay men and lesbian women compared to respondents with lower essentialist beliefs in the differences between groups.

AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s , which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as guestworkers' or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a natural reaction' against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the guestworkers'. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian tigers' pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century.

AB  - This research aimed at understanding the social representations of leprosy constructed by adolescents with the disease and their family members, including their perception about the impact of the disease in their daily life. Data of semi-structured interviews with 19 adolescents aged 12-18 years receiving medical treatment for leprosy and with 18 family members who lived in the same address were collected. Data were treated with thematic content analysis. Results showed that the emotion of fear and beliefs about contagion and prejudice were important elements of the leprosy representations. Participants perceived important negative changes in their daily life after diagnosis confirmation including suffering caused by the routine of medical procedures and physical pain. Patients perceived discrimination in the relationship with family members and friends, associated to the fear of contagion. and reported practices of concealment of signs of the disease to their peers. It was concluded that, given the permanence of a the archaic view of the disease and the impacts caused on the daily life of adolescents with leprosy and their families, it is necessary to expand information about the disease, to rethink health practices and to establish dialogic meetings in order to enable the reflection and construction of new meanings in relation to the disease, improving their quality of life.

AB  - This study examined attitudes about social acceptance, discrimination protection, and marriage equality for gay/lesbian people with a representative sample of 1,008 Hong Kong Chinese adults via a telephone survey. Despite majority endorsement of homosexuality (52.29% positive vs. 34.12% negative) and discrimination protection (50.72% favorable vs. 14.64% opposed), attitudes toward same-sex marriage diverged (32.79% favorable vs. 39.41% opposed). There was a sharp distinction in accepting gay/lesbian people as co-workers (83.57%) and friends (76.92%) versus relatives (40.19%). Having more homosexual/bisexual friends or co-workers contributed to greater endorsement of social acceptance and discrimination protection but not same-sex marriage. Age, religion, political orientation, and homonegativity consistently predicted attitudes toward social acceptance, discrimination protection, and same-sex marriage, whereas gender-role beliefs, conformity to norms, and cultural orientations had varying impacts. This article informs theory and advocacy by disentangling homonegativity from attitudes about gay/lesbian issues and highlighting the centrality of family-kinship and relative-outsider delineation in Chinese societies.

AB  - In May 2015, Ireland held a referendum to legalize same-sex marriage, which passed with 62% of the vote. This study explores the role played by appeals to nature' in the referendum debate. Little research has investigated how biological attributions are spontaneously generated in real-world discourse regarding sexual rights. Through content analysis of newspaper and Twitter discussion of the referendum, this study aims to (1) establish the frequency of appeals to nature and their distribution across the various sides' of the debate and (2) analyse the forms these natural claims took and the rhetorical functions they fulfilled. Appeals to nature occurred in a minority of media discussion of the referendum (13.6% of newspaper articles and .3% of tweets). They were more prominent in material produced by anti-marriage equality commentators. Biological attributions predominantly occurred in relation to parenthood, traditional marriage, gender, and homosexuality. The article analyses the rhetorical dynamics of these natural claims and considers the implications for marriage equality research and activism. The analysis suggests appeals to nature allow anti-marriage equality discourse adapt to a cultural context that proscribes outright disapproval of same-sex relationships. However, it also queries whether previous research has overemphasized the significance of biological attributions in discourse about groups' rights.

AB  - This essay explores the educational contribution of the Comtesse de Genlis' Theatre A l'usage des jeunes personnes [Theatre of Education] (1792/1779-1780), a four-volume collection of closet drama, in light of the social, political and cultural shifts occurring in France in the period prior to the French Revolution. In particular, in two plays from Theatre of Education, La Marchande de Modes [The Milliner] and Le Libraire [The Bookseller], Genlis depicts the bourgeoisie's proper behaviour toward the aristocracy and its natural place in the world. Thus both plays exemplify the educational and the political role of Genlis, who attempts to tame the bourgeoisie through the twofold argument of proper education and effective parenthood, so as to keep alive the social order of the ancien r,gime.

AB  - The effect of atomic bomb radiation exposure on the survivors and their children has been a worrisome problem since soon after the 1945 Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Researchers have examined physical and genetic effects; however, no research has focused on second-generation survivors' (SGS) psychological effects. Consequently, this study shed light on the SGS' experience of discrimination and prejudice and their anxiety concerning the genetic effects of radiation exposure. This study utilized semi-structured interviews with 14 SGS (10 women, mean age = 56 +/- 6.25 years, range = 46-68 years). Data were analyzed using a modified version of the grounded theory approach. Three categories were extracted: low awareness as an SGS, no health anxiety regarding the effect of radiation, and health anxiety regarding the effect of radiation. The results did not reveal that SGS who grew up in the bombed areas experienced discrimination or prejudice. They had little health anxiety from childhood to adolescence. In this study, some of the SGS developed health anxiety about their third-generation children, but only among female participants. Perhaps the transgenerational transmission of anxiety concerning the genetic effects of radiation exposure causes stress, particularly among women with children. However, a change was seen in adulthood health anxiety regarding the effects of radiation, suggesting the possibility that changes in the psychological experiences of SGS can be observed throughout their lifetimes and that their own health status, and that of their children, the third-generation survivors, affects their health anxiety regarding radiation.

AB  - Allport (1954) proposed a series of preconditions that have subsequently been shown to facilitate effects of intergroup contact on attitudes toward outgroups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). The present study examines whether objective threat, in the form of the 2005 London 7/7 terror attack, can inhibit the positive effects of contact. We tested hypotheses that contact would affect prejudice toward Muslims regardless of the bombings (contact prevails) or that the bombings would inhibit the effects of contact on prejudice (threat inhibits). Data were collected through representative national surveys 1 month before and again 1 month after the attacks in London on July 7, 2005 (pre-7/7 N = 931; post-7/7 N = 1,100), which represent relatively low and relatively high salience of "objective threat." Prejudice against Muslims significantly increased following the bombings. Psychological threats to safety (safety threat) and to customs (symbolic threat) mediated the impact of the bombings on prejudice, whereas perceived economic threat did not. All 3 types of psychological threat mediated between contact and prejudice. Multigroup structural equation modeling showed that, even though the objective threat did raise levels of psychological threats, the positive effects of contact on prejudice through perceived psychological threats persisted. Results therefore support a contact prevails hypothesis.

AB  - We use a theory of semantic representation to study prejudice and stereotyping. Particularly, we consider large datasets of newspaper articles published in the United States, and apply latent semantic analysis (LSA), a prominent model of human semantic memory, to these datasets to learn representations for common male and female, White, African American, and Latino names. LSA performs a singular value decomposition on word distribution statistics in order to recover word vector representations, and we find that our recovered representations display the types of biases observed in human participants using tasks such as the implicit association test. Importantly, these biases are strongest for vector representations with moderate dimensionality, and weaken or disappear for representations with very high or very low dimensionality. Moderate dimensional LSA models are also the best at learning race, ethnicity, and gender-based categories, suggesting that social category knowledge, acquired through dimensionality reduction on word distribution statistics, can facilitate prejudiced and stereotyped associations.

AB  - This article helps close two voids in the literature dealing with dual language (bilingual) marketing. First, it adds to the discussion about whether dual language (specifically English/Spanish) marketing that targets Hispanic consumers living in the U.S. is socially responsible. Second, it discusses how U.S. Hispanics feel about learning English and why some react negatively to bilingual marketing efforts. To determine whether dual language marketing is socially responsible, the corporate governance theories of Milton Friedman and R. Edward Freeman are used. The first conclusion is that, from Friedman's shareholder perspective, bilingual marketing may be much less profitable than expected, if at all. From Freeman's stakeholder perspective, dual language marketing is socially responsible if the focus is on perceived short-term needs of Hispanic consumers; however, from a broader, long-term societal approach, it is not. The second conclusion is that non-Hispanic Americans do not favor bilingual marketing. Recommendations for socially responsible ways of targeting this group are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: We explored the moderating role of observed skin color in the association between prejudice and concurrent and lagged psychological functioning (i.e., depression, ingroup/outgroup psychological connectedness). We further aimed to understand gender differences in these processes. Method: Data from 821 Asian American undergraduate students (57.5% female and 42.5% male) were drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshman. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression-based moderation models were conducted with PROCESS 2.13 for SPSS. Results: Lighter skin color nullified the association between prejudice and recent depression for Asian American females. This moderating effect did not hold over time with regards to depression symptoms 1 year later. Additionally, prejudice predicted psychological distance to other Asian students 1 year later among females rated as lighter in skin color, whereas prejudice was tied to psychological closeness for females with darker skin ratings. Conclusions: Results highlight skin color as a pertinent factor relevant to the short-term and long-term mental health and social experiences of Asian American women in particular.

AB  - This study examines the factorial invariance of the Scale on Beliefs About Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families (SBCASSF) across countries in three samples: Chilean, Spanish, and Hispanic university students. The scale analyzes attitudes toward the consequences of the rearing and education of children by parents with a homosexual sexual orientation. The instrument consists of two subscales: Individual Opposition and Normative Opposition. The Spanish sample is composed of 199 university students, the Chilean sample is made up of 279 students, and the Hispanic sample consists of 114 students. The results provide empirical evidence for the reliability of the SBCASSF in the samples from the countries and its factorial invariance (strict invariance). Results are also provided about differences between countries and by sex. The SBCASSF could be a potentially useful measure for educators, psychologists, and other mental health professionals who wish to study beliefs about the child-rearing practices of same-sex parents.

AB  - We show the promotion intervention has positive effects during intergroup contact, but that high levels of compunction can have negative effects.
   Intergroup contact is probably the longest standing and most comprehensively researched intervention to reduce discrimination. It is also part of ordinary social experience, and a key context in which discrimination is played out. In this paper, we explore two additional interventions which are also designed to reduce discrimination, but which have not yet been applied to real intergroup interactions. The promotion intervention encourages participants to relax and enjoy an interaction, while the compunction intervention motivates participants to avoid discrimination. Across two studies, we tested the separate effects of promotion (Study 1) and then compunction (Study 2) on participants' interactions with a confederate whom they believed to have a history of schizophrenia. In Study 1, participants received either a promotion intervention to "relax and have an enjoyable dialogue" or no intervention (control; n = 67). In Study 2, participants completed a Single-Category Implicit Attitude Test before being told that they were high in prejudice (high compunction condition) or low in prejudice (low compunction condition; n = 62). Results indicated that promotion was associated with broadly positive effects: participants reported more positive experience of the interaction (enjoyment and interest in a future interaction), and more positive evaluations of their contact partner (increased friendliness and reduced stereotyping). There were no effects on participants' reported intergroup anxiety. In contrast, high compunction had broadly negative effects: participants reported more negative experiences of the interaction and more negative evaluations of their contact partner (using the same dependent measures outlined above). In addition, participants in the high compunction condition reported increased intergroup anxiety and increased self-anxiety (anxiety around thinking or doing something that is prejudiced). Participants in the high compunction condition also reported reduced expectancies of self-efficacy (i.e., they were less confident that they would be able to make a good impression).

AB  - A primary concern in the psychology of religion is the distinct possibility that responses to empirical assessments of individuals' degree and type of religiosity and spirituality are exaggerated owing to social desirability bias. In spite of increased secularization in American culture and a growing distrust of organized religion, religious involvement, personal religiosity, and spirituality are still viewed as highly desirable characteristics. This study estimates the extent of social desirability biases that affect self-reports of religion and spirituality by utilizing a bogus pipeline procedure. In this procedure, participants are convinced that experimenters can detect disingenuous responses to individual items on questionnaires through the use of physiological measures, although no physiological data are actually collected. If the self-reports of participants in the bogus pipeline condition indicate greater religiosity or spirituality than those in the control condition, self-report bias is indicated. The bogus pipeline procedure has been used in other areas of study to increase veracity of self-reports when social desirability effects are present (such as reporting sexual behaviors or prejudice). The results indicate that social desirability biases influence multiple constructs including religious orientations, religious coping, and daily spiritual experiences. Implications for future research relying on self-reports of religion and spirituality are discussed.

AB  - Building on psychological research linking essentialist beliefs about human differences with prejudice, we test whether lay belief in the biological basis of political ideology is associated with political intolerance and social avoidance. In two studies of American adults (Study 1: N = 288, Study 2: N = 164), we find that belief in the biological basis of political views is associated with greater intolerance and social avoidance of ideologically dissimilar others. The association is substantively large and robust to demographic, religious, and political control variables. These findings stand in contrast to some theoretical expectations that biological attributions for political ideology are associated with tolerance. We conclude that biological lay theories are especially likely to be correlated with prejudice in the political arena, where social identities tend to be salient and linked to intergroup competition and animosity.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the social and economic disparities across social groups in rural Uttar Pradesh. The paper demonstrates that the structure of the rural economy in India is characterised by deeply ingrained prejudices and social discrimination. The four-village study undertaken in one of the most populated states in India, Uttar Pradesh, clearly reveals that there is a huge disparity in terms of various social and economic indicators and that the so-called high growth has hardly helped in bettering their lives.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on primary data collected from the Census survey of villages exploring socio-economic disparities across social groups by using decomposition models.
   Findings - The results evidently lend credence to the postulations that a large proportion of the disadvantaged groups are prone to multiple deprivations, both in the society and in labour markets. The inquiry reveals this phenomenon clearly.
   Research limitations/implications - From the policy point of view, it is therefore imperative to ensure the direct and focussed provision of basic human requirements in terms of education, employment and income of the state. The implementation of direct policy interventions is an absolute necessity if the state has to guarantee convergence and the inclusive growth process on a sustained basis.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need to study the inequality among the social groups in terms of education, employment, income and livelihood opportunities in selected villages of four districts of Uttar Pradesh.

AB  - Generalized prejudice (GP), biases expressed toward multiple outgroups, is typically explained by two aspects of authoritarianism: 'bowing' in the form of submission (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism, RWA); and 'kicking' in the form of dominance (i.e., social dominance orientation, SDO). Whereas contemporary approaches treat RWA and SDO as separate GP predictors, we statistically model the commonality between RWA and SDO reflecting an underlying tendency toward generalized authoritarian (GA). Re-analyzing data from an existing meta-analysis (Study 1), and modelling meta-analytic data from studies containing clear GP-relevant information (Study 2), we compare: (a) the standard approach of predicting GP based on RWA and SDO as unique predictors (Model 1); with (b) an alternative approach based on a latent GA factor indicated by RWA and SDO (Model 2). The alternative model provided stronger (and near-perfect) prediction of GP, along with specific associations between RWA and two types of prejudice (sexism, homophobia). These findings have fundamental implications for understanding authoritarianism and prejudice-proneness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although children typically elicit benevolence and care from adults, these protections are not afforded equally to children of all races: Implicit racial biases commonly directed toward Black adults appear to generalize to young Black children. In two experiments, we tested whether such effects reflect biases in semantic associations (i.e., automatic stereotyping), evaluative associations (i.e., automatic prejudice), or both. White participants categorized objects and words that varied in racial stereotypicality and valence after brief presentations of male faces that varied in race (Black, White) and age (adults, children). Results revealed consistent support for a general-stereotyping account: Seeing Black male faces, regardless of age, facilitated the identification of both negative and positive stereotypic stimuli. We also found some support for a prejudice account, as these same faces facilitated the identification of negative stimuli more generally. Process-dissociation-procedure analyses further revealed that these effects were driven primarily by automatic (i.e., unintentional) racial bias.

AB  - The study examined the impact of a cross-cultural musical programme on young Portuguese adolescents' anti-dark-skin prejudice. A sample of 229 sixth-grade pupils who attended public schools in the area of Lisbon, Portugal, were presented with the Implicit Association Test (IAT) - an instrument that measures the strength with which dark-skinned faces or light-skinned faces are associated with attributes that can be considered as negative or positive, and with a test measuring explicit anti-dark-skin prejudice. Half of the pupils were subsequently exposed, at school, to a 6-month musical programme that included Cape Verdean songs and Portuguese songs. The other half was exposed to the usual programme. Measures taken at the end of the programmes showed a reduction in anti-dark-skin prejudice, either implicit or explicit, among pupils in the experimental group and no reduction among pupils in the control group. Measures taken 3 months later and 2 years later showed that the impact of the experimental programme was enduring.

AB  - From early childhood onward, individuals use behavior copying to communicate liking and belonging. This non-verbal signal of affiliation is especially relevant in the context of social groups and indeed both children and adults copy in-group more than out-group members. Given the societal importance of inter-group interactions, it is imperative to understand the mechanistic level at which group modulations of copying occur early in development. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of novel group membership on young children's motor behavior during a simultaneous movement observation and-execution task. Four- to six-year-olds (n = 65) first gained membership to one of two novel groups based on their color preference and put on a vest in their chosen color. Subsequently, they were instructed to draw a straight line back and-forth on a tablet computer that was concurrently displaying a stimulus video in which a model moved her arm congruently or incongruently to the child's instructed direction. In half of the stimulus videos the model belonged to the in-group, while in the other half the model belonged to the out-group, as identified by the color of her dress. The deviations into the uninstructed direction of the children's drawings were quantified as a measure of how much observing the models' behaviors interfered with executing their own behaviors. The motor interference effect, namely higher deviations in the incongruent trials than in the congruent trials, was found only for the out-group condition. An additional manipulation of whether the models' arms followed a biological or non-biological velocity profile had little effect on children's motor interference. The results are interpreted in the context of the explicit coordinative nature of the task as an effect of heightened attention toward interacting with an out-group member. This study demonstrates that already during early childhood, novel group membership dynamically influences behavior processing as a function of interaction context.

AB  - In many Ibero-American countries children in the early childhood education (ECE) system have the opportunity to interact with textbooks on a regular basis. The powerful social function of textbooks in socializing children in primary and secondary school, and in legitimizing what counts as cultural norms and officially sanctioned values and knowledge, is clearly documented. However, the examination of ECE textbooks especially in the context of developing countries for messages about the social construction of the body is virtually nonexistent. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to examine, through a content analysis of the illustrations, the representation of the body across the different categories of gender, age, activity level, space and disability in eight Colombian ECE textbooks from the three major commercial publishing houses between 2009 and 2012. Our results show that these textbook authors and publishers have made an effort to promote equality between the genders. However, only four disabled people were portrayed in the illustrations and there was a lower proportion of older adults doing a limited range of gross motor activities. Likewise the results note that, although progress has been made in terms of the balance of gender representation in textbooks, these still reinforce and legitimize the status of the "able-body", and contribute to consolidating a view of able-bodiedness as the dominant norm. Taking into account that beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education and social participation, these results suggest that the representation of children with disabilities in ECE textbooks at the earliest stages of education should be mandatory.

AB  - Survey research on ethnic prejudice often relies on statements focusing on generic labels such as 'immigrants', 'strangers', or 'foreigners'. In this paper we argue that there are, however, good reasons to expect certain heterogeneity in the denotations respondents assign to these labels, and that the specific group respondents think of matters with respect to their response. We tested this assumption by using survey data from Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, N = 1375) that includes an open-ended question asking respondents which groups they associate with the label 'strangers' (Dutch: `vreemdelingen'). Content analysis revealed that the ten different meanings people in Flanders give to this label can be organized into four main groups concerning the content of the criterion (nationality, culture, race, no answer/refusal) and two ways concerning how the criterion is used (strangers defined as 'them' versus 'not us'). Regression analyses subsequently showed systematic differences in general ethnic prejudice depending on the meaning of strangers, with people in Flanders who associate strangers with Muslims or people from predominantly Muslim countries reporting the highest level of prejudice. Finally, our data suggests that that the group people in Flanders associate with the label stranger varies according to respondents' socio-demographic background. Not taking into account these different meanings of strangers might lead to an underestimation of the social differences in ethnic prejudice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While the concept justice' undergirds every discourse on affirmative action, its meaning is feverishly contested with contradictory definitions wielded as battling swords in a zero sum struggle over the distribution of scarce material resources and symbolic goods. In part, the issues have become even more important since the number of states that have now embarked on affirmative action policies have been growing and the results have been diverse. Affirmative action policies have occurred most frequently in internally heterogeneous societies marked by deep ethno-cultural divisions in which one ethnic community has tended to dominate the rest. To overcome inequalities and ingrained segmental prejudices in these multi-ethnic countries that witnessed over the years the cementing of advantages and privileges among certain ethnic groups has been the primary aim of affirmative action policies. Upheavals and ongoing conflicts have generally dogged these experiences, attesting to some successful societal changes in institutions and practices, to winners and losers. In this paper, we examine some of the controversies, especially in relation to two paradigms and perspectives of social justice.

AB  - This article investigates the consequences of migrant encounters with difference in terms of ethnicity, religion, class, social status, sexuality and gender. While the notion of encounter has attracted much academic attention, in particular with regard to multiculture, social diversity and the challenge of living with difference, many of these debates tend to, oddly enough, overlook migrant populations. Furthermore, although they acknowledge that significant numbers of migrants to diverse societies such as the UK originate from much less diverse communities, they rarely reflect on the intricacies of production of difference in these respective places. Recognising these limitations, this article outlines the consequences of encounters with difference in the context of migration from Poland (a relatively homogeneous postcommunist society) to the UK (a superdiverse' post-colonial society). The article draws upon extensive empirical material collected among Polish post-2004 migrants to the Northern English city of Leeds. It establishes that migrant encounters result in development, revision or change of values and attitudes towards difference. This may involve a range of personal stances including favourable and prejudiced attitudes as well as, most likely, 'complicated' and 'in-between' responses.

AB  - Social neuroscience and psychology have made substantial advances in the last few decades. Nonetheless, the field has relied mostly on behavioral, imaging, and other correlational research methods. Here we argue that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an effective and relevant technique to be used in this field of research, allowing for the establishment of more causal brain-behavior relationships than can be achieved with most of the techniques used in this field. We review relevant brain stimulation-aided research in the fields of social pain, social interaction, prejudice, and social decision-making, with a special focus on tDCS. Despite the fact that the use of tDCS in Social Neuroscience and Psychology studies is still in its early days, results are promising. As better understanding of the processes behind social cognition becomes increasingly necessary due to political, clinical, and even philosophical demands, the fact that tDCS is arguably rare in Social Neuroscience research is very noteworthy. This review aims at inspiring researchers to employ tDCS in the investigation of issues within Social Neuroscience. We present substantial evidence that tDCS is indeed an appropriate tool for this purpose.

AB  - Even though prejudice toward male homosexuality is one of the main reasons for discrimination in Argentina, there is no valid measure to assess it. The aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Attitudes Toward Gay Men Scale (ATG) and to examine the influence of sex, right wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation on anti-gay attitudes. Data were collected with a convenience sample of 436 undergraduate students from University of Buenos Aires. Analysis of the data showed adequate psychometric properties for the ATG Scale and the moderating effect of sex, right wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation on anti-gay attitudes. Implications of these findings were discussed.

AB  - In this qualitative study, we examined the sources and nature of social support reported by 24 gay, bisexual and queer Hispanic college men at a small liberal arts college and a large university in the USA. We identified four themes of support across the interviews: Shared experiences (46%), Protector (42%), Support in the air (33%) and Gradual support (29%). Shared experiences included support from those who had previous experience with the lesbian, gay or bisexual community. Protector indicated a type of support that was psychologically, emotionally or physically protective in nature. Participants also reported receiving indirect support such as nonverbal behaviours or indirect gestures of endorsement and caring (support in the air). Participants reported that many of their network members came to support them gradually over time (gradual support). Within each theme we found support from both women and men, who provided support in gender-consistent ways. Our results highlight that despite continued prejudice and discrimination in society, sexual and racial/ethnic minority men have strongholds of support from men and women in their lives that enable them to navigate their development successfully. ResumeCette etude qualitative conduite sous fore d'entretiens avec 24 hommes gays, bisexuels et hispaniques queer etudiant dans une petite universite d'arts liberaux et dans une grande universite de recherche aux Etats-Unis, nous a permis d'examiner les sources et la nature du soutien social dont avaient fait part les participants. Des entretiens ont emerge quatre themes : les experiences partagees (46 %), le soutien protecteur (42 %), le soutien du stereotype (33 %) et le soutien graduel (29 %). Les experiences partagees incluaient le soutien obtenu de la part de personnes ayant deja une connaissance de la communaute lesbienne, gay ou bisexuelle. Par soutien protecteur, il fallait entendre un type de soutien qui, par nature, etait protecteur aux plans psychologique, emotionnel ou physique. Les participants ont egalement declare avoir experimente des formes de soutien indirect, telles que des comportements sans expression verbale ou des gestes indirects d'approbation et de bienveillance (soutien du stereotype). De meme, beaucoup des membres de leurs reseaux leur avaient apporte un soutien croissant au fil du temps (soutien graduel). Relativement a chacun de ces themes, nous avons identifie du soutien social provenant aussi bien de femmes que d'hommes, qui avaient agi conformement aux genres. Nos resultats soulignent que malgre les prejuges et la discrimination, encore presents dans la societe, les hommes issus des minorites sexuelles et raciales/ethniques obtiennent enormement de soutien de la part d'hommes et de femmes tout au long de leur vie, et que celui-ci leur permet de poursuivre leur developpement avec succes. ResumenEn el presente estudio cualitativo las autoras examinaron las fuentes y la naturaleza del apoyo social que dicen tener 24 hombres latinos gais, bisexuales y queer, adscritos a una pequena universidad de humanidades y a una universidad grande de Estados Unidos. De las entrevistas surgieron cuatro temas transversales que las autoras identifican como: experiencias compartidas (46%), protector (42%), apoyo en el aire (33%) y apoyo gradual (29%). La categoria de experiencias compartidas hace referencia al apoyo recibido por aquellas personas que habian tenido experiencia previa con la comunidad lesbiana, gay o bisexual.
   La categoria protector da cuenta de un tipo de apoyo que, por su naturaleza, es protector en terminos psicologicos, emocionales o fisicos. Los entrevistados tambien afirman haber recibido apoyo indirecto, lo que se traduce en conductas no verbales o en actos indirectos de respaldo o solidaridad (apoyo en el aire). Ademas, los participantes indicaron que muchos integrantes de sus redes terminaron apoyandolos gradualmente con el transcurso del tiempo (apoyo gradual). En cada tema, las autoras encontraron que dicho apoyo proviene tanto de mujeres como de hombres, quienes prestaron su ayuda de manera coherente con su genero. En este sentido, los resultados subrayan que, a pesar del prejuicio y la discriminacion que perviven en la sociedad, los hombres que conforman minorias sexuales y raciales/etnicas cuentan con bastiones de apoyo entre quienes integran sus redes, lo que les permite sortear con exito su desarrollo personal.

AB  - The present study aimed at exploring the role of social dominance orientation (SDO) on awareness of corruption and the mediating effect of moral outrage on this relationship. To accomplish the objectives, we performed three empirical substudies with both correlational and experimental designs. In Substudy 1, SDO, moral outrage, and awareness of corruption were all measured with scales. The results indicated that SDO was negatively with moral outrage and awareness of corruption. In addition, moral outrage mediated the relationship between SDO and awareness of corruption. In Substudy 2, awareness of corruption was measured in a bribery scenario, and the results also indicated that moral outrage mediated the dampening role of SDO on awareness of corruption. In Substudy 3, SDO was manipulated by placing respondents in a dominant or a subordinate condition. The results indicated that compared with the subordinate position condition, the respondents primed by the dominant position condition reported less moral outrage and lower awareness of corruption. The three substudies consistently confirmed the dampening effect of SDO on awareness of corruption and the mediating effect of moral outrage on this relationship. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Space and time (or rather space-time) are crucial concepts in the legitimation of policy interventions into citizens' private lives. Across Europe, social policy measures to promote activation' among migrant communitiesemployment guidance, parenting training, youth work and so onhave proliferated, aiming to move' the Other into the here-and-now of European modernity. Van den Berg brings together theories of space-time, alterity and cultural lag logics' in an analysis of a contemporary case of such a policy: parenting training in the Netherlands. Based on ethnographic research, her study shows how certain societal problems are translated into problems of difference, and how that difference is in turn conceptualized as distance in space and time to be overcome through professional intervention.

AB  - Worldwide racial prejudice is originated from in-group/out-group discrimination. This prejudice can bias face perception at the very beginning of social interaction. However, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanism underlying the influence of racial prejudice on facial emotion perception. Here, we examined the neural basis of disgust perception in racial prejudice using a passive viewing task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that compared with the disgusted faces of in-groups, the disgusted faces of out-groups result in increased amygdala and insular engagement, positive coupling of the insula with amygdala-based emotional system, and negative coupling of the insula with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-based regulatory system. Furthermore, machine-learning algorithms revealed that the level of implicit racial prejudice could be predicted by functional couplings of the insula with both the amygdala and the ACC, which suggests that the insula is largely involved in racially biased disgust perception through two distinct neural circuits. In addition, individual difference in disgust sensitivity was found to be predictive of implicit racial prejudice.

AB  - Research inspired by terror management theory has established that being reminded of the inevitability of death (i.e., "mortality salience") leads people to express more negative attitudes toward out-groups. We examined the hypothesis that being affiliated with a religion may buffer individuals against this negative impact of mortality salience. Two studies, conducted in two cultures that differ in their emphasis on religiosity (the United Kingdom and Italy), supported this hypothesis. Specifically, we found that mortality salience resulted in more negative out-group attitudes only among participants not affiliated with any religion. Further, this buffering effect of religious affiliation was not moderated by participants' specific religious orientations or by their levels of social dominance orientation. In addition, the buffering effect did not hold when prejudice against the target out-group was not proscribed by religious authorities. Implications for research on religion, prejudice, and terror management are discussed.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of tonal gravity through a multimodal analysis of a YouTube video to demonstrate how multimodality is key to the construction of Rule Britannia as a sectarian song. The analysis focuses upon the multimodal semiotics of social distance which has been a key concept in sociological and anthropological traditions in recent times. This concept offers a means to understand the social semiotic relationship between Self and Other in multimodal discourse. Following previous work in social semiotics and music studies which examine how visual composition, music and the voice have constructed social distance or expressions of intimacy, I introduce the concept of tonal gravity which extends the metaphors of semiotic space in previous work in the musical mode, to account for a fuller understanding of how music helps narrate the multimodal Self and Other. This is introduced via a close multimodal analysis of Rule Britannia as a Rangers Football fan video which is only transformed into a sectarian text through multimodal collocation where different semiotic resources in various modes act in combination to produce a dominant Self actively prejudiced against a low Other.

AB  - Though numerous experiments support the presence of linguistic prejudice toward English speakers with foreign accents, there is, to date, no self-report measure of such prejudice. To capture the multidimensional nature of linguistic prejudice, we created the Measure of Prejudice Against Accented English via using the nominal response model under the item response theory. The resulting 36-item scale, using an empirically derived response format, is informative about individuals across all levels of accented-English prejudice. The scale has good psychometric properties. In addition, it displayed concurrent validity through positive correlations with self-reported xenophobia and feelings of threat from immigrants; it showed discriminant validity by not correlating with social desirability. To evaluate predictive validity, we conducted an experiment in which high linguistic prejudice scores were associated with lower ratings of job applicants who spoke with foreign accents.

AB  - Terror management theory posits that the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially paralyzing terror that is assuaged by embracing cultural worldviews that provide a sense that one is a valuable participant in a meaningful universe. We propose that pervasive and pronounced anti-atheist prejudices stem, in part, from the existential threat posed by conflicting worldview beliefs. Two studies were conducted to establish that existential concerns contribute to anti-atheist sentiments. Experiment 1 found that a subtle reminder of death increased disparagement, social distancing, and distrust of atheists. Experiment 2 found that asking people to think about atheism increased the accessibility of implicit death thoughts. These studies provide the first empirical link between existential concerns and anti-atheist prejudices.

AB  - In this article we review contemporary research testing Martineau's (1972) hypothesis that disparagement humor fosters or introduces prejudice against the disparaged out-group. Supporting Martineau's hypothesis, research suggests that instigating disparagement humor might indeed foster prejudice against the targeted group; however, through mechanisms that do not implicate unique effects of humor as a medium for communicating disparagement. Contrary to Martineau's hypothesis, it does not appear that exposure to disparagement humor promotes a negative disposition toward the targeted group. Rather than acting as an initiator of prejudice, disparagement humor functions as a releaser of existing prejudice. Lastly, following Martineau's theoretical framework, we identify new questions about the social consequences of disparagement humor that require further theoretical development and empirical research.

AB  - Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of big data: disruptive technologies that have transformed commerce, science, and many aspects of society. Despite the tremendous enthusiasm for big data, there is no shortage of detractors. This article argues that many criticisms stem from a fundamental confusion over goals: whether the desired outcome of big data use is better science or better engineering. Critics point to the rejection of traditional data collection and analysis methods, confusion between correlation and causation, and an indifference to models with explanatory power. From the perspective of advancing social science, these are valid reservations. I contend, however, that if the end goal of big data use is to engineer computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-defined metrics, then whatever improves those metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientific reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering. Understanding the distinction between science and engineering resolves many of the apparent controversies surrounding big data and helps to clarify the criteria by which contributions should be assessed.

AB  - In two experiments, we examine the moderating effect of the legitimacy and the stability of the advantaged in-group status on the relationship between measures of group relative gratification (GRG) and traditional prejudice among members of a structurally advantaged group. In Study 1, 133 participants learned that their advantaged in-group status was based on legitimate or illegitimate grounds. As expected, when participants learned of the legitimate status of their in-group, GRG was associated with the endorsement of traditional prejudice. In Study 2, 188 participants learned that their advantaged in-group status was expected to remain stable or to fluctuate. As predicted, when participants were alerted to the decline in the privileged status of the in-group, GRG was positively associated with traditional prejudice. These findings illuminate the ways in which members of advantaged groups perpetuate intergroup inequities and point to a fuller, more nuanced conceptualization of system stability.

AB  - Historically, leading scholars proposed a theoretical negative association between cognitive abilities and prejudice. Until recently, however, the field has been relatively silent on this topic, citing concerns with potential confounds (e.g., education levels). Instead, researchers focused on other individual-difference predictors of prejudice, including cognitive style, personality, negativity bias, and threat. Yet there exists a solid empirical paper trail demonstrating that lower cognitive abilities (e.g., abstract-reasoning skills and verbal, nonverbal, and general intelligence) predict greater prejudice. We discuss how the effects of lower cognitive ability on prejudice are explained (i.e., mediated) by greater endorsement of right-wing socially conservative attitudes. We conclude that the field will benefit from a recognition of, and open discussion about, differences in cognitive abilities between those lower versus higher in prejudice. To advance the scientific discussion, we propose the Cognitive Ability and Style to Evaluation model, which outlines the cognitive psychological underpinnings of ideological belief systems and prejudice.

AB  - A secondary analysis of survey data of Hong Kong school students (N=2,865) examines social learning about persons with a (physical) disability (PWDs). Path models, connecting recalled information in communication about PWDs of different sources (media, significant others, and contact) and content (assistance, pity, and fear) with perceptions, general attitude, and behavior inclination toward PWDs, showed content as better predictor than either media channels or interpersonal sources. Interpersonal sources were better predictors than media channels were. The effects were also mediated by perception of PWDs' capabilities, perception of PWDs' inner state, and general attitude toward PWDs. The findings are interpreted and discussed.

AB  - Reducing mental illness stigma in youth is an important societal goal, but much of the existing literature focuses on knowledge enhancement strategies. These alone may not be sufficient to enhance empathy, change fundamental attitudes, or reduce social distance.
   To evaluate a youth-initiated, discussion- and empathy-based antistigma school program, called "Let's Erase the Stigma" (LETS), among adolescents from Los Angeles. We hypothesized that participation in such clubs, for a semester, would be associated with better attitudes toward mental illness, reduced social distance against those with mental illness, and enhanced performance of antistigma actions, but not greater knowledge about mental disorder.
   Participants were involved in LETS clubs for a semester; non-participants, also interested in such involvement, were evaluated prior to club activities. Outcomes in this quasi-experimental, non-randomized trial included (a) quantitative measures of attitudes, social distance, positive antistigma actions, and knowledge, all related to mental illness; and (b) open-ended responses related to stigma awareness, potential antistigma actions, and antistigma rationale. The design did not allow for evaluation of pre-post differences but afforded insight into potential contributions of LETS participation regarding outcomes of interest.
   LETS participation was associated with statistically significant differences across attitudes, social distance, antistigma actions, and knowledge, with effect sizes ranging from small to large.
   Although not meeting the standard of a randomized trial, the findings suggest that a youth-directed, discussion- and action-based intervention may provide a novel means of reducing mental illness stigma in adolescents. The preliminary nature of the results mandates experimental investigations.

AB  - Whitfield's essay seeks to identify and explain a tendency that emerged in the United States in the 1940s and extended through the 1950s. It was then that a notion became commonplace, especially among liberals, that the victims of prejudice were interchangeable and that bigotry was undifferentiated. Before the 1940s, the problem of prejudice was not widely believed to be urgent; but the war against the Third Reich heightened awareness of the price of an irrational hostility to minorities. American liberals in particular came to the understanding that bigotry was indivisible; and, for its objects, the cards of identity could easily be shuffled. Whether the victims were Jews or Negroes or homosexuals, the hatred that they elicited appeared to be formed without making any distinctions among them. Evidence can be found in the culture of those two decades, in novels, plays and films. The unitary view of the character of prejudice had some support in social science, including in the authoritative volume The Authoritarian Personality. The theory would also be reflected in a major shift in the agenda of Jewish civil rights organizations, which redefined their mission as promoting the democratic rights of all minorities rather than the particular interests of American Jews. This distinctive tendency vanished in the 1960s, however. One reason for the change was a fuller appreciation of the hostility that minorities could harbour towards other minorities. The realization also deepened of the singular vulnerability of black Americans under the pressure of racism, which demonstrated a tenacity as well as a proclivity for violence that had been largely absent from other forms of bigotry. Finally, a broader legitimation of difference itself emerged in the 1960s to bury the notion that minorities were fungible.

AB  - Heterosexual people with more positive attitudes to lesbians and gay men generally believe that homosexuality is immutable, is not a discrete social category, and that homosexuality exists in all cultures and time periods. Equivalent beliefs about heterosexuality and beliefs about components of sexuality have been less often researched. 136 people with diverse sexualities described heterosexuality as more universal across history and culture than homosexuality (Study 1). 69 heterosexual-identified participants similarly believed that love, identity, behavior, and desire were more historically invariant aspects of heterosexuality than of homosexuality (Study 2). Less prejudiced participants thought all components of homosexuality-except for identity-were more historically invariant. Teasing apart beliefs about the history of components of heterosexuality and homosexuality suggests that there is no "essential" relationship between sexual prejudice and the tension between essentialist and constructivist views about the history of sexual identity.

AB  - Transcripts from radio broadcasts that aired in pre-, early-, and late-genocide Rwanda were content analyzed from a social identity theory perspective to examine whether language use was consistent with theoretical predictions. The data yielded by these analyses (N = 59) are noteworthy because the broadcasters on this station were eventually charged with war crimes for inciting and endorsing the violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The results from this study found that the transcripts contained language in support of theory such that the Tutsi out-group was increasingly dehumanized as the conflict escalated, the Tutsi were blamed for their fate-while the Hutu were presented as victims of the violence, and an overt prejudice that was initially directed at Tutsi rebel group grew to include all Tutsi people near the end of this conflict. These data provide compelling support for the communication processes that arise within intergroup conflict situations and support the continued application of social identity theory to real-world situations.

AB  - Against the background of evidence for links between ill-health and prejudice, in this article we discuss how to promote inclusive communities in contexts of diversity. A brief critical overview of dominant psychological approaches to prejudice reduction reveals the apolitical nature of these approaches, and thus, we argue for a more contextual and political model on how to promote inclusive communities. Drawing on examples of different school practices on cultural diversity from across England, we argue that we need to develop a perspective that connects local contexts of everyday practice, resistance and agency to the institutional and structural realities of prejudice.

AB  - This article integrates discursive psychology and argumentation studies to discuss the regularities identified in two sets of data - focus group discussions amongst indigenous Greeks residing in Central Northern Greece and interviews with non-indigenous women with children, resident in the greater London area. The initial regularity identified consisted of participants talking as parents and talking about children mobilizing the normative expectations of parenthood in voicing strong views about others' from ethnic, cultural and racial backgrounds other than those of the speakers. This seemed to function as a form of denial, identifying further regularities in the discursive strategies used by participants and in the lines of arguments developed. Furthermore, two themes emerged as commonplace in talking about others' in the lines of argument developed by participants - security/insecurity and hierarchies. These regularities are considered and the potentials of analysing discourse from two integrated approaches are discussed.

AB  - Compared to the attention that children's literature scholars have paid to the construction of childhood in children's literature and the role of adults as authors, mediators and readers of children's books, few researchers have made a systematic study of adults as characters in children's books. This article analyses the construction of adulthood in a selection of texts by the Dutch author and Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award winner Guus Kuijer and connects them with Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's recent concept of 'childism' - a form of prejudice targeted against children. Whereas Kuijer published a severe critique of adulthood in Het geminachte kind [The despised child] (1980), in his literary works he explores a variety of positions that adults can take towards children, with varying degrees of childist features. Such a systematic and comparative analysis of the way grown-ups are characterised in children's texts helps to shed light on a didactic potential that materialises in different adult subject positions. After all, not only literary and artistic aspects of children's literature may be aimed at the adult reader (as well as the child), but also the didactic aspect of children's books can cross over between different age groups.

AB  - Attempts to measure and analyze public opinion attitudes toward racial/ethnic minorities often confront the "social desirability" problem: those who have prejudiced attitudes are rarely willing to admit them to surveyors. Instead, they may be more likely to give a socially acceptable answer rather an accurate reflection of their views. Previous research has clearly established that this effect presents a challenge for accurately measuring self-reported racial and policy attitudes that primarily affect African-Americans. It is less clear, however, how it might affect self-reported responses to attitudes dealing with Latinos and immigration. This study thus seeks to analyze the extent to which social desirability may affect survey measures of perceived levels of cultural threat (nativism). Results from two separate analyses using the Crowne-Marlowe "social desirability scale" and a survey "list experiment" demonstrate that social desirability is indeed a concern for accurately measuring nativism in the American public, but that it exerts an opposite effect from what has previously been observed: nativist attitudes tend to be over-reported in opinion surveys.

AB  - This study investigated parental decision making about non-parental child care programs based on the technological and quality components of the program, both child-focused and parent-focused. Child-focused variables related to children's access to technology such as computers, educational television programming, and the internet. Parent-focused variables related to parental access to observe the program via the internet, and methods of communication by teachers, as well as traditional indicators of quality such as experience and education of the caregivers and type of curriculum offered.
   The study investigated which of these variables were most influential to parents' decision-making processes when choosing programs based on hypothetical scenarios. The study sought to examine which variables emerged as most important to parents, and whether these technological variables were more important than traditional indicators of quality, such as staff education level.
   A sample of 82 parents of children between the ages of 1 and 6 years (M = 3.6) completed a questionnaire gathering demographic information, as well as information about their perceptions of their children's media usage. The questionnaire also included hypothetical scenarios created using the SPSS ORTHOPLAN procedure to examine technology related variables (both child-focused and parent-focused) and traditional quality indicators that emerged as most influential to the decision-making process when choosing a child care program.
   Using conjoint analysis, the results revealed that the child-focused technology variables that emerged as most influential to parents' decision making were educational software usage, television usage, and internet availability. In regard to parent-focused variables, conjoint analyses revealed that experience of the caregivers, type of curriculum offered, and education level of the caregivers were more influential to the decision making process than the ability to observe the program via the internet or method of communication used by the provider.
   The results provide additional support for the importance of well-trained and experienced staff in child care programs, as well as for a developmentally appropriate curriculum. These findings suggest that administrators interested in marketing early child care programs should continue to focus on these traditional indicators of quality, rather than on improving parental access to the program via technology.

AB  - Background: "Mental health for everyone" is a school program for mental health literacy and prevention aimed at secondary schools (13-15 yrs). The main aim was to investigate whether mental health literacy, could be improved by a 3-days universal education programme by: a) improving naming of symptom profiles of mental disorder, b) reducing prejudiced beliefs, and c) improving knowledge about where to seek help for mental health problems. A secondary aim was to investigate whether adolescent sex and age influenced the above mentioned variables. A third aim was to investigate whether prejudiced beliefs influenced knowledge about available help.
   Method: This non-randomized cluster controlled trial included 1070 adolescents (53.9% boys, M age14 yrs) from three schools in a Norwegian town. One school (n = 520) received the intervention, and two schools (n = 550) formed the control group. Pre-test and follow-up were three months apart. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations models were employed for analysis.
   Results: Mental health literacy improved contingent on the intervention, and there was a shift towards suggesting primary health care as a place to seek help. Those with more prejudiced beleifs did not suggest places to seek help for mental health problems. Generally, girls and older adolescents recognized symptom profiles better and had lower levels of prejudiced beliefs.
   Conclusions: A low cost general school program may improve mental health literacy in adolescents. Gender specific programs and attention to the age and maturity of the students should be considered when mental health literacy programmes are designed and tried out. Prejudice should be addressed before imparting information about mental health issues.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status, parental control, and authoritarianism in Iran. A sample of 460 students was surveyed from Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz in Iran. Results demonstrated that subjective socioeconomic status, parental control, and parents' education have significant influence on authoritarianism. Further analysis showed that parental control partially mediates parents' education association with authoritarianism with a relatively high effect size. These findings highlight the importance of parental control and socioeconomic status in the development of authoritarianism in Iran. Furthermore, the higher authoritarianism of low socioeconomic status is mostly due to lower education levels rather than the income of the family. The findings were discussed with regards to literature as well as the socio-cultural sphere of Iran.

AB  - The Bogardus social distance scale, which measures the level of acceptance that Americans feel toward members of the most common ethnic and racial groups in the United States, was administered six times nationally between 1920 and 2001. Replicating the most recent study with its revised list of ethnic and racial groups, the authors of this study analyzed a stratified random sample of 3,166 college students, making it the largest national social distance study ever conducted. The findings indicate an increase since 2001 in the mean level of social distance toward all ethnic groups, as well as in the spread between the groups with the highest and lowest levels of social distance. Further, a consistency between studies in group preferences reaffirms the relevance of the similarity-attraction bond in accepting those who are racially and culturally different. Mean comparisons and analysis of variance tests also showed that gender, birthplace of respondents and/or their parents, race, and year in college are all significant indicators of the level of social distance toward groups.

AB  - People often displace their anger and aggression against innocent targets, sometimes called scapegoats. Tragic historic events suggest that members of ethnic minority out-groups may be especially likely to be innocent targets. The current experiment examined displaced aggression of Dutch youths against Dutch in-group peers versus Moroccan out-group peers. Participants (N = 137, M-age = 11.6 years) completed a personal profile that was allegedly evaluated by Dutch peer judges. After randomly receiving negative or neutral feedback from these peers, participants were given the opportunity to aggress against other innocent Dutch and Moroccan peers by taking money earned away from them. Results showed that in response to negative feedback, participants displaced aggression disproportionally against innocent Moroccan out-group targets. This effect was not driven by ethnic prejudice; in both conditions, participants holding more negative attitudes of Moroccans engaged in higher levels of aggression regardless of the ethnicity of the target.

AB  - It is commonly accepted that social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) are potent unique predictors of a variety of prejudice and prejudice-related constructs. However, contrary to some predictions, there has been little evidence that these constructs interact to produce this outcomethey appear to be additive but not interactive in their prediction of prejudice. We extend the interaction hypothesis to consideration of another broadly relevant constructpolitical ideology. Drawing from 14 independent New Zealandbased samples, we show, through meta-analysis and multilevel random coefficient modelling, that SDO and RWA additively and interactively predict levels of political conservatism operationalised in a variety of ways. Specifically, both constructs are associated with increasing political conservatism, and the lowest levels of conservatism (or highest levels of political liberalism) are found in those lowest in both SDO and RWA.

AB  - In the context of school segregation in China, the authors propose that disadvantaged group members' self-esteem should improve when they consider the prospect of a better future for the group (i.e., awareness of cognitive alternatives to the lower status position). A pilot study established that country workers' children who were educated with city children (i.e., in integrated schools) reported higher self-esteem than country workers' children who were educated separately (i.e., in segregated schools). Study 1 showed that self-esteem among country workers' children was predicted by awareness of cognitive alternatives, but not by contact with city children. Study 2 experimentally manipulated cognitive alternatives, showing that self-esteem was enhanced when awareness of cognitive alternatives was high rather than low. Contact with city children again did not predict self-esteem. Findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving that social change is possible.

AB  - Research has indicated that people who are more open to novel and diverse experiences express less prejudicial views concerning minority group members. The openness prejudice relationship, however, may be mediated by the degree to which individuals adhere to traditional social convention and absolutist thinking patterns. Thus, informed by the Dual-Process Cognitive-Motivational Model of ideology and prejudice (Duckitt, 2001; Duckitt & Sibley, 2009) and the Five-Factor Model of personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992; McCrae & Costa, 2003), we investigated right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) as a mediator of the relationship between openness and antigay prejudice. Participants were college students from universities in the mid-Atlantic (Sample 1, n = 199) and southeastern (Sample 2, n = 244) United States. Hypotheses were tested in both samples. First, bivariate relations among openness, RWA, and antigay prejudice were assessed. Second, RWA was tested was a mediator of the relationship between Openness and antigay prejudice. Results supported expected bivariate associations in that openness negatively, and RWA positively, associated with antigay prejudice. Moreover, results showed that RWA mediates the negative relationship between openness and antigay prejudice. Implications of the supported model are discussed with respect to antigay prejudice theory as well as prejudice-reduction interventions for use on college campuses.

AB  - The present research demonstrates that pride has divergent effects on prejudice, exacerbating or attenuating evaluative biases against stigmatized groups, depending on the form of pride experienced. Specifically, three experiments found that hubristic pride-associated with arrogance and self-aggrandizement-promotes prejudice and discrimination, whereas authentic pride-associated with self-confidence and accomplishment-promotes more positive attitudes toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals. Findings generalized to discriminatory judgments (Experiment 2) and were found to be mediated by empathic concern for the evaluative target. Together, these experiments suggest that pride may be a cause of everyday prejudice and discrimination but that these social consequences depend on whether hubristic or authentic pride is experienced, and the degree to which empathic concern is subsequently aroused.

AB  - The present study focused on the buffering role of positive intergroup contact in the intergenerational transmission of authoritarianism and racial prejudice in a sample of adolescents and one of their parents. In accordance with our expectations, adolescents' intergroup contact experiences moderated the mediated relationships between parental authoritarianism and adolescents' prejudice, both via adolescents' authoritarianism and via parental prejudice. These relationships were stronger among adolescents with lower, rather than higher, levels of intergroup contact. We conclude that intergroup contact buffers the indirect relationship between parents' authoritarianism and adolescents' racial prejudice and therefore constitutes a promising means of reducing the intergenerational transmission of prejudice.

AB  - This study aimed to identify theoretically relevant key correlates of anti-transgender prejudice. Specifically, structural equation modeling was used to test the unique relations of anti-lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) prejudice; traditional gender role attitudes; need for closure; and social dominance orientation with anti-transgender prejudice. Social desirability was controlled as a covariate in the model. Analyses of data from 250 undergraduate students indicated that anti-LGB prejudice, traditional gender role attitudes, and need for closure each had positive unique relations with anti-transgender prejudice beyond the negative association of social desirability with such prejudice. By contrast, social dominance orientation was not related uniquely to anti-transgender prejudice. Additional analyses indicated that women's mean level of anti-transgender prejudice was lower than that of men's, but the pattern of relations between the predictor variables and anti-transgender prejudice did not differ between women and men. A confirmatory factor analysis also supported the unidimensional structure of anti-transgender prejudice as operationalized by Nagoshi et al.'s (2008) Transphobia Scale.

AB  - Recently, a number of people of Chinese descent (first-generation Americans and recent immigrants) have contacted me for psychotherapy. Many complain that they do not know who they are or that they are confused about their professional and personal goals. My attempt to understand their complaints has led me in two directions, each of which is briefly described in this article. First, I have had to learn something about the trauma experienced by some of their parents during the Cultural Revolution and the effects it had on them. For the sake of contrast, I briefly compare this experience with the experience of children of European Holocaust survivors. Second, I have had to learn something about self-development in Asian families as observed, above all, by Alan Roland (1989, 1996, 2005). In an attempt to demonstrate how the interaction of these two factors can result in the confusion my Chinese-descended patients report, I describe a complex case. The article concludes with some comments on my countertransferential feelings and technique.

AB  - In comparison to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth are more likely to experience victimization. Multiple studies have connected anti-gay prejudice and anti-gay victimization to negative outcomes. Research shows that social support may protect sexual minorities from the harmful effects of anti-gay victimization. However, rates of victimization and the negative outcomes linked to sexual identity within the sexual minority community have been relatively unexplored. Using data from three years of statewide data from heterosexual and sexual minority adolescents in grades 9-12, this study examines victimization, substance use, suicidality, and access to social support by sexuality. Results indicate that sexual minority youth are at increased risk for victimization, substance use, suicidality, and social isolation compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Results also indicate that there is very little bivariate difference within the sexual minority community. Multivariate results indicate differences among sexual minorities' experiences with victimization and substance use.

AB  - Social behavioral abnormalities are commonly seen in the later stages of dementia. However, there has been only limited empirical study of social functioning in the earlier stages of the disease, or in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of the present study was to test whether these clinical groups show more socially inappropriate and prejudicial behavior relative to controls, as rated by informants. No group differences were identified for ratings of either socially appropriate behavior or stereotyping and prejudice. However, the results also indicated that informants rated participants with dementia as showing the most inappropriate behavior, and that these ratings were related to participants' degree of immediate logical memory impairment, but not to delayed memory recall or to more general neurocognitive decline as indexed by the Mini Mental State Examination. Together, these results have implications for an understanding of some of the changes in social function seen in abnormal adult aging.

AB  - Despite a decline in explicit prejudice, adults and children from majority groups (e.g., White Americans) often express bias implicitly, as assessed by the Implicit Association Test. In contrast, minority-group (e.g., Black American) adults on average show no bias on the IAT. In the present research, representing the first empirical investigation of whether Black children's IAT performance parallels that of Black adults, we examined implicit bias in 7-11-year-old White and Black American children. Replicating previous findings with adults, whereas White children showed a robust ingroup bias. Black children showed no bias. Additionally, we investigated the role of valuing status in the development of implicit bias. For Black children, explicit preference for high status predicted implicit outgroup bias: Black children who explicitly expressed high preference for rich (vs. poor) people showed an implicit preference for Whites comparable in magnitude to White children's ingroup bias. Implications for research on intergroup bias are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on self-reported ageism among social work students and academic staff in the Social Work Department of Crete, Greece; the 20-item questionnaire Relating to Older People Evaluation (ROPE) was used to measure negative and positive ageist behaviours that respondents engage in during everyday life. Positive ways of relating to old people were reported much more often than the negative ways; no significant differences in mean endorsement scores between academic staff and undergraduate students in either the positive or the negative dimensions were found. Women endorsed positive ageism items more often than men did, but the two genders did not differ in their endorsement of negative ageism items. This association was observed both for the students and academic staff. For students, no relationship between how many years they had spent studying and endorsement score was observed for either the positive or the negative behaviour items. Social work students and academic staff should be aware that positive ageism may turn into paternalism; it is important that social work education prepares students in order to approach clients with a non-prejudiced attitude and to provide them with quality services.

AB  - This paper considers the implications for training and practice of counsellors' responses to the notion of challenging clients' prejudices. It explores tensions in counselling discourse between social responsibility, responsibility to the client and responsibility for one's self as counsellor. Three focus groups of counsellors were asked whether a counsellor should challenge clients' prejudices. Responses were categorised as challenge, not-challenge or exit responses. Discursive themes identified in the responses are: managing congruence and being non-judgemental; self-care and self-respect; and social responsibility. Strategies for managing the discursive conflicts identified in responding to counsellor-identified client prejudices are summarised.

AB  - Education for children with disabilities in Afghanistan, particularly disabled girls, continues to lag behind despite laudable efforts of the Ministry of Education to promote universal access for all. The opportunity for education constitutes not just a means of achieving learning outcomes but also a space for social interaction, individual development and psychosocial support, which are paramount in Conflict-Affected Fragile States (CAFS). However, many persisting barriers still need to be overcome in Afghanistan to allow education for all and change negative attitudes towards education of children with disabilities. In this paper we argue that viewing education as a basic commodity, which is the widespread practice in CAFS, is not conducive to expanding human freedoms and capabilities. More specifically, through analyses of a national survey, we demonstrate that despite considerable resources, increasing access to education in Afghanistan has maintained processes of marginalisation of the already excluded.

AB  - Recent polls indicate that atheists are among the least liked people in areas with religious majorities (i.e., in most of the world). The sociofunctional approach to prejudice, combined with a cultural evolutionary theory of religion's effects on cooperation, suggest that anti-atheist prejudice is particularly motivated by distrust. Consistent with this theoretical framework, a broad sample of American adults revealed that distrust characterized anti-atheist prejudice but not anti-gay prejudice (Study 1). In subsequent studies, distrust of atheists generalized even to participants from more liberal, secular populations. A description of a criminally untrustworthy individual was seen as comparably representative of atheists and rapists but not representative of Christians, Muslims, Jewish people, feminists, or homosexuals (Studies 2-4). In addition, results were consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between belief in God and atheist distrust was fully mediated by the belief that people behave better if they feel that God is watching them (Study 4). In implicit measures, participants strongly associated atheists with distrust, and belief in God was more strongly associated with implicit distrust of atheists than with implicit dislike of atheists (Study 5). Finally, atheists were systematically socially excluded only in high-trust domains; belief in God, but not authoritarianism, predicted this discriminatory decision-making against atheists in high trust domains (Study 6). These 6 studies are the first to systematically explore the social psychological underpinnings of anti-atheist prejudice, and converge to indicate the centrality of distrust in this phenomenon.

AB  - Background Social integration of people with intellectual disability (ID) moving into regular neighbourhoods tends to be studied and evaluated without detailed knowledge about the social psychological aspects of everyday interaction between neighbours with and without ID. The goal of the present paper is to show how the authors' social psychological research programme may contribute to this field of inquiry.
   Methods The different ways in which societies respond to features and behaviours that may be perceived as deviant are theoretically analysed. Results of empirical studies are reported to clarify how social responses to people with ID are special in terms of perceptions, emotions and interaction desires of people with and without ID during a pre-contact and contact phase.
   Results On the basis of the theoretical analysis, it is concluded that regular neighbouring in modern Western society often takes the form of benevolent tolerance, rather than stigmatisation and prejudice. However, empirical studies reveal that, prior to getting people with ID as new neighbours, prospective neighbours without ID experience a specific pattern of emotions that are associated with specific desires (e. g. with respect to information supply or a caring relationship). These anticipatory reactions are dependent on the expected size of the group moving in and on the severity of ID. Furthermore, while actually engaging in neighbouring, neighbours with and without ID appear to have experiences related to behaviour of residents, staff and features of housing facilities that are perceived as (in) congruent with regular neighbouring.
   Conclusions It is concluded that interpersonal relationships between neighbours with and without ID should not be simplified in terms of attitudes that would be primarily prejudiced/stigmatising versus entirely accepting. Rather, our studies paint a more complex picture of sometimes ambivalent thoughts, feelings and interaction needs that all should be taken into account to make social integration a success.

AB  - We suggest that new forms of family households, especially same-sex couples and single parents, are likely to face discrimination in their interactions with rental markets. Following the contact hypothesis, we hypothesize that the geographic distribution of discrimination is likely to vary Specifically, in places with more new family households we are likely to find less discrimination against these households. We investigate these issues in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, Canada, through analysis of 1,669 inquiries made about one- and two-bedroom apartments. Using afield experimental design similar to audit studies, we analyze landlord responses to five different two-person household scenarios, including one heterosexual couple, two same-sex couples, and two single parents. Evidence suggests that male same-sex couples, single mothers, and single fathers all face significant discrimination relative to heterosexual couples. The contact hypothesis was supported for male same-sex couples, but not for single parents. This could indicate that single parents are facing discrimination primarily based upon their economic marginalization rather than other forms of prejudice.

AB  - This article explores and extends Blumer's work on race prejudice and discrimination by using empirical data from an ethnographic study of minority communities in Greece. Blumer explains prejudice as the result of an interactional process through which one group defines itself as superior or dominant in relation to the other. His work on race prejudice has often been misinterpreted as emphasizing the individual's subjective imaginary of the "other." Here I illustrate the importance of the intersubjective processes involved in defining a particular social situation as discriminatory. A central point of the article is to elaborate on his analysis by looking at the experience of prejudice and discrimination from the receiving end, through the participants' interpretation of their social interactions with the dominant group. Therefore I focus on how members of the subordinate group interact with the process that Blumer identifies.

AB  - Five studies tested whether need for closure (NFC) moderates the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice toward immigrants. The results consistently showed that intergroup contact was more strongly associated with reduced levels of prejudice among people high in NFC compared to people low in NFC. Studies 1 (N = 138 students) and 2 (N = 294 adults) demonstrated this moderator effect on subtle, modern, and blatant racism. Study 2 also replicated the moderator effect for extended contact. An experimental field study (Study 3; N = 60 students) provided evidence of the causal direction of the moderator effect. Finally, Studies 4 (N = 125 students) and 5 (N = 135 adults) identified intergroup anxiety as the mediator through which the moderator effect influences modern and blatant racism as well as hostile tendencies toward immigrants. The role of motivated cognition in the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice is discussed.

AB  - Public schools have transformed significantly over the past several decades in response to concerns about rising school violence. Today, most public schools are high-security environments employing police officers, security cameras, and metal detectors, as well as strict discipline policies to keep students in line and maintain safe campuses. These changes undoubtedly influence the social climate of schools, yet we know very little about how students experience and perceive these measures. Via ethnographic research in two contemporary public high schools, the author examines students' perceptions of high-security school environments, including perceptions of their school resource officer, schools' discipline policies, punishments, and fairness in rule application. Findings show that students believe their schools to be safe places and think many of the security strategies their schools use are unnecessary. Students further express feeling powerless as a result of the manner in which their schools enforce rules and hand down punishments.

AB  - We report longitudinal data in which we assessed the relationships between intelligence and support for two constructs that shape ideological frameworks, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). Participants (N = 375) were assessed in Grade 7 and again in Grade 12. Verbal and numerical ability were assessed when students entered high school in Grade 7. RWA and SDO were assessed before school graduation in Grade 12. After controlling for the possible confounding effects of personality and religious values in Grade 12, RWA was predicted by low g ([3=.16) and low verbal intelligence ((3=.18). SDO was predicted by low verbal intelligence only ((3=.13). These results are discussed with reference to the role of verbal intelligence in predicting support for such ideological frameworks and some comments are offered regarding the cognitive distinctions between RWA and SDO.

AB  - There has been considerable debate regarding the extent to which prejudice results from individual differences versus situational factors affecting self-categorization. We provide evidence for a stable baseline level of association between one individual difference index of prejudice proneness, that of social dominance orientation (SDO), and generalized racist attitudes. Consistent with an individual difference perspective, SDO retained a baseline level of association with racism across conditions invoking ethnic versus personal identity (N = 179 European/white undergraduates). Consistent with a self-categorization theory perspective, however, this association was heightened when ethnic (vs. personal) identity was made salient prior to (but not after) the assessment of SDO. Although the salience of different social identities moderated the association between SDO and prejudice, manipulating identity salience did not entirely remove or alter the direction of the effect. This supports our argument that there exists a baseline level or individual difference component of SDO that predicts prejudice and that cannot be accounted for by the manipulation of social identification as an individual versus a member of the ethnic majority in New Zealand.

AB  - We modelled the associations between the HEXACO dimensions of personality, Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and prejudice towards dangerous, derogated and dissident groups (N = 454 undergraduates). Consistent with a Big-Five model, low Openness to Experience predicted RWA and therefore dangerous and dissident group prejudice. As predicted, low Emotionality (and Openness) rather than Agreeableness predicted SDO and therefore derogated and dissident group prejudice. Comparison with meta-analytic averages of Big-Five data supported expected similarities and differences in the association of Big-Five and HEXACO models of personality with ideology. Finally, Honesty-Humility simultaneously predicted increases in RWA but decreases in SDO, and thus opposing effects on prejudice. These opposing effects have gone unidentified in research employing Big-Five models of personality structure. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - How are people's social policy attitudes related to their affective reactions to the social groups affected by those policies? From a threat-based perspective. specific emotions toward a group-above and beyond general prejudice toward that group-should predict attitudes toward a policy affecting the group To test this. 128 participants reported their support far four social policies, their general and specific affective reactions to each affected group, and the threats ostensibly posed by that group Although general prejudice failed to predict each policy attitude after controlling for the specific emotions, Specific emotions did indeed significantly predict each policy attitude after controlling for general prejudice Moreover, these specific emotions tended to mediate predicted relationships between perceived threats and policy attitudes in all, these results highlight the benefits of assessing specific intergroup emotions as they relate to political arenas (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved

AB  - The paper examines the hypothesis that the effects of mortality salience on attitudes toward illegal immigrants are moderated by individual differences predisposing participants toward prejudice or intolerance. A total of 122 university students completed measures of political orientation, authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation prior to being randomly assigned to a mortality salience or control condition. Political conservatism, authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation were all associated with more negative attitudes toward illegal immigrants. Although there was no main effect for mortality salience, there was an interaction between mortality salience and social dominance orientation. Higher social dominance orientation was associated with more negative attitudes toward illegal immigrants, albeit only in the mortality salience condition.

AB  - Discursive deracialization-the use of veiled references to racial groups is associated with the discourse of new racism in which racist sentiments are conveyed in a subtle manner This article presents a specific strategy of deracialization using place names and terms to index race In focus groups held in the United States with African American and White parents this strategy allowed speakers to covertly connect race to school quality With the White parents the indexing of race through place names and terms functioned as a defense against interpretations of their words as racist regardless of whether racialized groups were explicitly presented in a negative light In contrast in the African American group the strategy allowed speakers to indirectly critique racial inequality in education

AB  - Despite equal opportunities legislation in many western societies, overt prejudice against minority groups is still evident. Yet, despite the persistence of equality issues, 'prejudice' is a term that is not widely employed in geography because of its association with a particular history of meaning within social psychology. In this paper I explore the concept of prejudice and its relationship to geographical research on discrimination and oppression. Then using original empirical research in three communities I examine how prejudice is justified and articulated by majority people. In doing so, I explore the complex intersectionalities of negative attitudes towards specific minority groups and the ways that specific mechanisms of sub-ordination can reinforce and support one another.

AB  - Conspiracy theories have recently come under the scrutiny of social psychology. While some theorists have treated them as a deficient way of thinking, others have considered them as a form of political rhetoric with important social implications. We focus on conspiracy theories in the context of online public deliberation on legislation allowing registration of self-defined gender in Greece. Employing the tools of Critical Discursive Psychology, we analyse comments posted on the Ministry of Justice's website created for public consultation about the law change. We focus on the mobilization of conspiracy theories by people who oppose Law 4491/2017 ("Legal Recognition of Gender Identity - National Mechanism for the Development, Monitoring and Evaluation of Action Plans on Children's Rights and Other Provisions"). These commentators often argued that powerful groups are behind the proposed legislation, aiming at decreasing Earth's population, disrupting moral order, and violating humanness. We demonstrate how these constructions helped participants to perform various tasks, such as delegitimizing the legislation while at the same time avoiding the stigma of prejudice, promoting far-right political practices, and rebutting accusations of political partisanship. The results are discussed in relation to conspiracy theories' role in countering "gender ideology" and in promoting cisgenderism and heteronormativity.

AB  - The current study examined how ingroup and outgroup Theory of Mind (ToM) predicts children's and adolescents' reasoning for their acceptability judgments of intergroup bullying of Syrian refugee peers and group support of intergroup bullying. Participants included 587 Turkish middle (n = 372, M-age = 12.19, SD = 1.01; 208 girls) and high school (n = 215, M-age = 14.81, SD = 0.97; 142 girls) students. Participants read a bias-based bullying story with a Syrian refugee peer targeted by an ingroup Turkish peer. Then, participants rated the acceptability of bullying and group support of bullying and were presented with a reasoning question (Why?) after each acceptability question (bullying and group support of bullying). Reasoning codes included Fairness, Refugee Status/War, Prejudice and Discrimination, Harm, Prescriptive Norms, Group Functioning, and Relationship with the Bully. Participants' ingroup and outgroup ToM abilities (measured using the Strange Stories) were evaluated as predictors of reasoning. Results documented that middle school students were more likely to attribute mental states to their ingroup members compared to outgroup members while high school students' ToM performance did not differ across contexts. Further, the more unacceptable participants judged bullying to be, the more they reasoned about the bullying by referencing fairness, refugee status, discrimination, and harm. Results also documented that ingroup and outgroup ToM were positively related to attribution to fairness and participants' usage of multiple reasoning judgments while only outgroup ToM was a significant predictor of reasoning around refugee status/war, discrimination, and prejudice. The findings provide implications for intervention programs that tackle intergroup bullying by examining bystanders' social cognitive skills in a specific context.

AB  - Colourism - skin shade prejudice - is a social justice issue for People of Colour globally. Yet, there has been no major sociological study that explores colourism in the UK. Addressing this gap, we draw on nine in-depth qualitative interviews with Black and Mixed-Race heterosexual men living in England that formed part of a larger study of colourism. Using reflexive thematic analysis through an intersectional feminist lens, we argue that colourism is gendered. We found that Black men both experience colourism and perpetuate it by teasing male peers and favouring women with light skin. Our analysis generated three themes: (1) navigating colourism as part of growing up; (2) skin shade paradoxes for Black and Mixed-Race men; and (3) colourism and desirability through the Black male gaze. This research provides a nuanced exploration of colourism from Black and Mixed-Race men's perspectives. It underscores the significance of colourism in the UK.

AB  - Our perception of someone's accent influences our expectations about what they might say or do. In this experiment, EEG data were recorded while participants listened to cliche ' sentences matching or not the stereotypes associated with the speaker's accent (upper-class Parisian accent or banlieue accent, a negatively connoted accent associated with youth from suburban areas; e.g. "I always listen to rap in my car" said with a banlieue accent (congruent) or an upper-class accent (incongruent)). Mismatches between social accent and stereotypical content triggered an event-related potential (ERP) known as the N400, albeit more anterior than the one observed for semantic violations, as well as a P3. These results are in line with other studies - conducted in particular with gender stereotypes - suggesting that stereotypes are stored in semantic categorical knowledge and that mismatches trigger integration difficulties and checking and updating mechanisms, and extend them to socially marked accents.

AB  - Objective: To assess stigma and prejudice in the organization of the Psychosocial Care Network for drug users. Methods: this is a qualitative study, developed through Empowerment Assessment. The survey was conducted in a municipality in Rio Grande do Sul, with 42 network workers. For data collection, participant observation, semi-structured interviews and open forum were used. For data analysis, thematic analysis was used. Results: the network's mission involved a proposal for care without prejudice and judgments for drug users. It was identified that the composition of the network with training in multidisciplinary residency and psychiatry facilitates achieving the mission, and among the difficulties, the challenges to overcome prejudice were analyzed. Strategies for continuing education, seminars, and user empowerment in the community are suggested. Final considerations: stigma and prejudice need to be problematized in the networks for the organization of more inclusive and rehabilitating psychosocial care.

AB  - The current heightened social awareness and anxiety triggered by escalating violence against Black Americans in the United States demands a safe space for reflection, education, and civil discourse within the academic setting. Too often there is an unmet need paired with a collective urgent desire to better understand the chronic existing structural, social, educational, and health inequities affecting disadvantaged populations, particularly Black Americans. In this perspective, the authors provide insight into a shared learning approach that provided a forum to discuss Perspectives Against Racism (PAR). Unlike existing topdown approaches, faculty, trainees, and staff were engaged in leading a series of focused discussions to examine unconscious bias, promote awareness of implicit biases, and reflect on individual and collective roles and responsibilities in working toward becoming antiracist. An existing 1-h graduate elective seminar course was dedicated to creating a space for learning, discussion, and exchange of ideas related to the experience and existence of racism (personal and institutional/systemic). A goal of each session was to go beyond didactics and identify mechanisms to implement change, at the level of the individual, department, and institution. This perspective of the shared experience may provide an adaptable framework that can be implemented in an academic setting at the departmental, center, or institutional level.

AB  - Following the COVID-19 outbreak, anti-Asian racism increased around the world, as exhibited through greater instances of abuse and hate crimes. To better understand the scale of anti-Asian racism and the characteristics of people who may be expressing racial prejudice, we sampled respondents in Australia and the United States over 31 August-9 September 2020 (1375 Australians and 1060 Americans aged 18 or above; source YouGov). To address potential social desirability bias, we use both direct and indirect (list experiment) questions to measure anti-Asian sentiment and link these variables to key socioeconomic factors. We find that, instead of being universal among general populations, anti-Asian sentiment is patterned differently across both country contexts and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, the most significant predictor of anti-Asian bias is political affiliation. By contrast, in Australia, anti-Asian bias is closely linked to a wide range of socioeconomic factors including political affiliation, age, gender, employment status and income.

AB  - Over recent years, globalisation occasioned a dramatic rise in cross-cultural interactions until this was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability to competently engage in a multicultural world is often considered the "literacy of the future". Global interconnectedness has brought studies into intercultural competence to centre stage. This has increased the demand for cross-cultural education experiences that facilitate such learning. However, there is a dearth of empirical research into the issues and effects surrounding short-term cross-cultural educational experiences for adolescents. This mixed-methods study extends previous research by looking specifically into what impact short-term cross-cultural experiences may have on the formation of intercultural competence (IC) and emotional intelligence (EI) of Australian high school students. This study used two instruments for measuring IC and EI in a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design (n = 14), the General Ethnocentrism (GENE) Scale and Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ). Moreover, it conducted in-depth post-experience qualitative interviews (n = 7) that broadly followed a phenomenological paradigm of inquiry. The findings suggest that fully embodied cross-cultural immersive experiences can effectively support the formation of IC and EI in high school students and may thereby play a contributing role in redressing ignorance, xenophobia, prejudice, and discrimination. A greater understanding of the linkages between immersive cross-cultural experiences and intercultural competence offers prospects for policymakers, educators, pastoral carers, and other relevant stakeholders who might employ such experiential learning to foster more interculturally and interracially harmonious human relations.

AB  - Promoting tolerance of diversity in schools is essential for improving students' mental health outcomes and has an impact on their quality of life. There are sociodemographic and emotional variables (empathy and emotional intelligence) that seem to be related to being more tolerant of personal diversity, whether due to culture, political ideas, social class or physical or psychological conditions. A transversal study was conducted to examine these relationships, using hierarchical regression models (HRM) and qualitative comparative analysis of fuzzy sets (fsQCA) with a convenience sample of 1069 adolescents from six Spanish schools (47.4% were male). The inclusion criteria were studying in the selected compulsory secondary education or high schools. The parents voluntarily signed the informed consent so that the students could participate. The participants completed self-reported questionnaires to evaluate their tolerance to diversity the Diversity Tolerance Scale and the Trait of Meta-Mood Scale 24 were used to measure emotional intelligence, and the Basic Empathy Scale to assess empathy. The results suggest the emotional intelligence variable, specifically emotional repair, is more predictive of tolerance for diversity in adolescents. In the fsQCA model, the interaction of sex, emotional repair and emotional empathy is better predictor for a tolerant attitude. Finally, the development of emotional skills intervention programmes for adolescents will have a direct and positive impact on tolerance of diversity in schools. These findings are important and useful because tolerance of diversity in the classroom seem to have a positive effect on the reduction of prejudice or discrimination, promoting more inclusive environments.

AB  - This research with the title of the project called "Outdoor Education Activities for Elementary School Teachers" was carried out within the framework of TUBITAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) 4005 Innovative Education Implementations Support Program. The aim of the applied project carried out for 10 days with 28 elementary school teachers working in Ankara was to enable elementary school teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills about planning and administering out of school activities. By organizing trips to Rahmi Koc Musem, Ali Dayi Children's Library, Feza Gursey Science Centre, Sehit Cuma Dag Natural History Museum, Gordion Museum, Beypazari and Salt Lake, it was aimed that teachers would learn the characteristics outdoor education activities via experiential learning and the implementations were supported with the theoretical principles of outdoor education. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection tools were used in the process which was completed with the teachers' development of their own outdoor education activities. "Self-Efficacy Belief Scale for Planning and Organizing Educational Trips to Out of School Settings" and "An Evaluation Form on Outdoor Education Activities Project for Elementary Teachers" were administered to the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the process. At the end of the project, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 5 elementary school teachers. The results obtained revealed that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about planning and organizing educational trips to out of school settings increased. Moreover, teachers comprehended the importance of planning outdoor education activities and the qualities of planning process at the end of the process and in addition to this, it can be stated that the participants' awareness about the definition of outdoor education and characteristics increased, their prejudices about the feasibility of outdoor education decreased and thus their motivation to organize trips could have raised. In order to promote the applicability of outdoor education in elementary schools, projects and in-service training should be organized to increase elementary school teachers' knowledge and skills about this subject and the courses in undergraduate studies should include education outside the class. Thus, the applicability of this process must be provided by enriching it with establishing relationship between disciplines via rich materials and teaching methods such as drama.

AB  - Achieving the educational inclusion of students with special educational needs (SEN) is one of the significant challenges of the current Spanish educational system. This is a group of students with a high rate of bullying that leads to academic failure, as well as significant psychological and social consequences. Despite the fact that the behaviours and psychological characteristics of their peers seem to influence the degree of inclusion, there is no detail on this subject. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence, psychological flexibility, prosocial behaviour and inclusive behaviour. To carry out this study, a sample of 642 students between the ages of 12 and 19 years old participated and answered four questionnaires, one for each variable under study. The relationships established were extracted from different statistical analyses and a hypothesised predictive model. The results obtained revealed that emotional intelligence is positively related to psychological flexibility and prosocial behaviour and that these, in turn, are positively related to the development of inclusive behaviour. Therefore, the importance of considering the variables under study during the teaching-learning processes carried out in the classroom is highlighted.

AB  - Country-level structural stigma, defined as prejudiced population attitudes and discriminatory legislation and policies, has been suggested to compromise the wellbeing of sexual minority adults. This study explores whether and how structural stigma might be associated with sexual minorities' school-based and adulthood experiences of victimization and adulthood life satisfaction. Using a sample of 55,263 sexual minority individuals (22% female; 53% 18-29 years old; 85% lesbian/gay, 15% bisexual) living across 28 European countries and a country-level index of structural stigma, results show that sexual minorities, especially men, reported school bullying in both higher- and lower-stigma countries. Higher rates of school bullying were found among sexual minorities living in higher-stigma countries when open about their identity at school. Past exposure to school bullying was associated with lower adulthood life satisfaction, an association partially explained by an increased risk of adulthood victimization. These findings suggest that sexual minorities living in higher-stigma countries might benefit from not being open about their sexual identity at school, despite previously established mental health costs of identity concealment, because of the reduced risk of school bullying and adverse adulthood experiences. These results provide one of the first indications that structural stigma is associated with sexual minority adults' wellbeing through both contemporaneous and historical experiences of victimization.

AB  - There is a pervasive stigma attached to being Haitian in the Bahamas. This article examines reflections on the experiences of the stigma of being Haitian at primary and secondary school among second-generation Haitians in the Bahamas. Based on this research, I argue that primary school functions as the first major institution where children of Haitian descent experience stigma as it relates to their ethnic heritage and, in turn, are exposed to the idea of being the 'other' in Bahamian society through bullying and anti-Haitian sentiments from students and teachers. Stigma, prejudice, exclusion, and discrimination characterize primary and secondary education for Haitians living in the Bahamas and are manifest in the form of cruel teasing, bullying, and discrimination primarily from students and teachers. The goal is not to argue that children of Haitian descent are completely unaware of anti-Haitian sentiment in the Bahamas until they attend school but, rather, that school functions as one of the first institutions children of Haitian descent learn there is stigma in being Haitian in the Bahamas.

AB  - With the growing pervasiveness of social media in our daily lives has come a recognition that these platforms have an influence over societal standards. The way women are represented on social media may reflect how they are treated in real life. The purpose of this study was to identify common themes among social media posts about women from four Chicago neighborhoods-Little Village, Pilsen, South Shore, and Englewood-to learn about the acceptability of traditionally negative gender-specific language in these communities, and to determine their potential effects. Public posts were abstracted from four diverse Chicago neighborhoods and coded into six major themes: (1) pride for women by women, (2) pride for self, (3) positive depictions of women by men, (4) violent imagery, (5) sexually explicit imagery, and (6) aggressive sexual imagery. We found that the meanings of traditionally derogatory language have evolved. Our findings may contribute to research that can establish relationships between representations of women on social media and gender dynamics in urban communities.

AB  - Although pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) have been characterized as feminine, some PEBs are masculine suggesting that gender bending (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors inconsistent with one's own gender) and gender conformity (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors consistent with one's own gender) are possible for both women and men. Social consequences for gender bending versus conformity with PEBs were assessed in three studies. Gender bending created uncertainty about an actor's heterosexual identity (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with stigma-by-association, actors' gender bending influenced judgments about an actor's friend's sexual identity (Study 2). However, gender bending had limited effects on ascription of gendered traits: More feminine than masculine traits were ascribed to PEB actors, even actors of masculine PEBs (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with social ostracism, Study 3 illustrated that men were most likely to socially distance themselves from female gender benders, likely as a result of prejudice against gender-bending women. In contrast, women preferred to socially interact with gender-conforming women, likely resulting from a combination of their greater interest in feminine than masculine PEBs and preferring to interact with women more so than with men. Social repercussions are discussed in terms of stigmatizing engagement in PEBs.

AB  - Objectives: to understand the psychosocial repercussions experienced by caregiving parents, resulting from care for the child with dysphagic cleft lip and palate. Methods: qualitative study, developed in a tertiary hospital in September 2016. The sample defined by theoretical saturation consisted of seven mothers. Data collection was performed by unstructured interview, being audio-recorded and fully transcribed. Symbolic Interactionism was used as theoretical framework, and Thematic Content Analysis as methodological framework. Results: the following themes emerged: diagnosis impact and coping; coping with overload and stress; interaction between caregivers as an acceptance and coping strategy; impact on family and social life of caregivers; and curiosity coping, and family and community prejudice. Final considerations: despite the physical and emotional overload, the mother figure plays the main and determining role in care, reflecting the complexity of care.

AB  - Background: Expectations that students should request assistance from teachers when needed, a set of classroom behaviors termed "help-seeking" have the potential to contribute to inequitable access to quality learning experiences in traditional classroom settings.
   Purpose: This study extends current literature by mapping the nature of help-seeking interactions between students and teachers in online high school credit-recovery classrooms, where the implications of help-seeking have yet to be examined systemically.
   Research Design: Drawing on qualitative and quantitative analysis of data collected from the 2014-2015 through 2016-2017 school yews in a large, urban school district serving predominantly low-income student of color, we identify patterns in these interactions and their implications for disparities in academic opportunities.
   Findings: We find that few of the high school students enrolled in online credit-recovery courses had access to consistent, constructive interactions in instructional spaces, even though most students required instructor support to obtain full access to the learning environment. Our observations point to disparate access to quality educational experiences in online credit-recovery labs that mirror those documented by others in traditional classroom settings.
   Conclusions: Based on these findings, we identify strategies to support more equitable learning in online courses including explicit expectations and proactive assistance to students as well as the use of real-time data by teachers, lower student t-teacher ratios, and assigning teachers certified in course subjects to improve educational quality.

AB  - This article analyses the issue of miscegenation in Portugal, which is directly associated with the context of its colonial empire, from late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The analysis considers sources from both literary and scientific fields. Subsequently, aspects such as interracial marriage, degeneration and segregation as well as the changes brought about by the end of World War II and the social revolutions of the 1960s are considered. The 1980s brought several changes in the attitude towards Portuguese identity and nationality, which had meanwhile cut loose from its colonial context. Crossbreeding was never actually praised in the Portuguese colonial context, and despite still having strong repercussions in the present day, lusotropicalism was based on a fallacious rhetoric of politically motivated propaganda.

AB  - When a person states that s/he is disgusted by an outgroup, what can we conclude about his/her attitudes, beliefs, and character? Based on an analysis of physical disgust, we predicted that expressing disgust toward a social group would convey a belief that this group possesses a negative essence; namely, that it has a biological basis, and clear boundaries, and that its members share immutable, inherent characteristics. Because being disgusting violates the moral foundation of purity, we also predicted that expressing disgust toward a social group would convey moral condemnation of that group. In three studies, we found that an expression of disgust (vs. anger, hate) toward homosexuals (Studies 1 and 3) and Arabs (Study 2) was perceived as conveying a negative and essentializing attitude toward that group and a perception of this group as impure and immoral. Expressions of disgust conveyed a more avoidant yet less violent and a less prejudiced (and therefore more legitimate) attitude than expressions of hate. Similar results were obtained in Study 4, in which beliefs were expressed toward unidentified social groups and participants had to indicate which emotions accompany that belief.

AB  - Objective The current study examined the relationship between minority stress, social support, and the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Australians during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Method A sample of 1,305 Australian LGB adults completed an online survey that measured their frequency of exposure to negative and positive media messages about same-sex marriage, perceived personal support, and psychological distress during the postal survey. Results More frequent exposure to negative media messages about same-sex marriage was associated with greater psychological distress. This association, however, was significantly weaker amongst participants who perceived greater personal support for same-sex marriage from their immediate social network. Alternatively, exposure to positive messages of public support via public and social media was not associated with psychological distress, and did not moderate the association between negative media message exposure and psychological distress. Nonetheless, more frequent exposure to public support was more strongly associated with reduced psychological distress amongst participants who perceived their immediate social network to be less supportive of same-sex marriage. Conclusions The findings highlight how legislative processes related to the rights of stigmatised, minority populations have the potential to adversely affect their mental health. The findings also highlight the role of personal and public support as protective factors against minority stress. Within the limits of a cross-sectional study design, these findings have implications for public policy and legislative decision-making, treating clinicians of LGB clients, and LGB rights and mental health organisations.

AB  - The current research investigates whether automatic associations between race and social class predict deliberative attitudes toward wealth redistribution policies. In three studies, we found that participants were significantly more likely to associate African Americans (vs. White Americans) with the concept of poor in an implicit task. In addition, we found that this implicit association between poor and African Americans predicted explicit attitudes toward wealth redistribution (Study 1) an effect mediated by the belief that redistributive policies benefit African Americans over White Americans (Study 2). Further, these associations held when controlling for implicit affective associations and explicit prejudice. Manipulating people's metacognitive beliefs about the validity of their implicit associations shifted whether implicit Black-poor associations predicted support for wealth redistribution (Study 3). Overall, these findings suggest race/class associations are well-learned, spontaneously activated, and may predict explicit policy attitudes toward wealth redistribution above and beyond implicit or explicit affective prejudice.

AB  - This article outlines a generic process in the reproduction of inequality the authors name obscuring oppression. On the basis of 35 in-depth interviews with college students seeking to make sense of two contemporary social movements, Black Lives Matter and Transgender Bathroom Access, the authors demonstrate three ways people obscure (i.e., avoid, ignore, hide, or explain away claims of) oppression in response to minority protest: trusting the public (i.e., suggesting that an educated public would not allow inequalities to persist), appealing to order (i.e., arguing that if protesters followed the rules, society would be more welcoming to change), and dismissing oppression (i.e., framing movement claims as false or exaggerated). In conclusion, the authors argue that examining processes of obscuring oppression may provide insight into (1) the persistence of inequality in society, (2) linkages between color-blind racism and systemic patterns of sexism and cissexism in society, and (3) potential reactions to other social movements seeking justice for marginalized groups.

AB  - The study examines whether there is a primus inter pares effect in the domain of prejudiced attitudes, where there is hardly any information on this effect. It also explores the relationship between the prejudiced attitudes perceived in others and one's own and how this relationship influences our general prejudice. To do so, we compared two opposite hypotheses in two studies. The assimilation hypothesis suggests that attitudes perceived in others influence our own attitudes and our general prejudice. The social projection hypothesis claims that our attitudes influence the attitudes we perceive in others, and consequently our prejudice. A total of 243 students in compulsory secondary education participated in the first study, in which the attitudes towards fat(1) people were measured. In the second study, 442 psychology students participated, and we measured their attitudes towards Moroccan immigrants. In both studies, participants considered themselves less prejudiced than others, and their own attitudes mediated the relationship between the attitudes perceived in others and their general prejudice. ResumenEsta investigacion examina si se produce un efecto primus inter pares en el marco de las actitudes prejuiciosas, donde apenas hay datos sobre este efecto. Tambien explora la relacion entre las actitudes prejuiciosas percibidas en los demas y las propias y como influye esa relacion en nuestro prejuicio general. Para ello contrastamos dos hipotesis contrarias en dos estudios. La hipotesis de la asimilacion sugiere que las actitudes percibidas en los demas influyen en nuestras actitudes y estas en nuestro prejuicio general. La hipotesis de la proyeccion social sostiene que nuestras actitudes influyen en las actitudes que percibimos en los demas y, consiguientemente, en nuestro prejuicio. En el primer estudio participaron 243 estudiantes de ESO y se midieron las actitudes hacia los gordos. En el segundo participaron 442 estudiantes de psicologia y se midieron las actitudes hacia los inmigrantes marroquies. En ambos estudios los participantes se consideran menos prejuiciosos que los demas y las actitudes propias median la relacion entre las actitudes percibidas en los demas y el prejuicio general.

KW  - show racism the red card
KW  - education
AB  - How can we best connect and understand issues of power, privilege and justice in a human rights framework? One approach is to explicitly position intersectionality as a theoretical lens that can assist a critical understanding of the connections between these concepts and realities. The paper does this through an examination of the situation in Scotland via Show Racism the Red Card, an anti-racist non-governmental organisation that works with school-age children to raise awareness on the power of prejudice and discrimination in everyday, interrelated lives. It is shown that despite its complexities, intersectionality can work both conceptually and methodologically in complex environments such as classrooms. The realisation of rights is foregrounded and an appreciation of context, politics, social divisions and outcomes vis-a-vis inclusive equalities needs to be fully grasped. The case study of Show Racism the Red Card situates the nuances of intersectionality as both theory and method, illustrating the need for human rights to be mindful of past, present and future. Overall, it is argued that the example of Scotland offers opportunities to witness a critique of how power, privilege and justice are connected and challenged in a human rights context and how rights can be realised in everyday settings.

AB  - Studies have shown that a person can consciously believe that they value racial equality and desire not to perpetuate racial stigmas, but unwittingly exhibit racist attitudes and beliefs. In order to explain this discrepancy between conscious beliefs and behavior, scholars have turned their attention to unconscious racial prejudice. One approach that is gaining wide acceptance is the Implicit Bias Model, which appeals to distinct implicit and explicit cognitive processes, coupled with an account of the ways in which people unconsciously internalize widespread stereotypes and stigmas. This article claims that although the Implicit Bias Model is in many respects useful, it leaves out a central aspect of unconscious racial prejudice: the underlying motivations and incentives for harboring racist attitudes and beliefs, which generate psychological resistances to knowing about or changing prejudices. A more complete account of unconscious racial prejudice can be developed by turning to theories of active ignorance, which contribute to what this article calls the Resistance Model.

AB  - It is a widespread belief that individuals are able to detect other people's sexual orientation from vocal information alone (auditory gaydar). We argue that auditory gaydar, although often inaccurate, leads to stereotyping, avoidance, and discrimination of gay/lesbian-sounding speakers. Much like "social vision," these voice-based inferences are driven by two distinct processes-a direct feature-based path and an indirect path mediated by categorization. As a way to either underline their social identity or prevent stigmatization, gay/lesbian speakers tend to modulate their voice depending on the interlocutor and on their conversational goals. Together, our findings suggest that vocal information plays a subtle but powerful role in intra- and intergroup communication.

AB  - In South African schools, the textbook serves as an indispensable trustworthy source of disciplinary content knowledge. While the constitution and vetting of such knowledge is subject to the state's textbook publication protocols as they relate to screening for discrimination and prejudice in relation to race, gender, sexuality etc., there is a dearth of understanding of covert ideological hegemony embedded in the textbook as revered artefact. This programmatic curriculum, the school textbook, has received minimal attention from local curriculum theorists and researchers, so it is likely to masquerade as innocent purveyor of selected (or subversive) ideology. In an attempt to unveil the subtext, we report on a study that set out to examine the discourses of globalisation that manifest in selected contemporary high school economics textbooks. The study draws on the tenets of Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis to reveal how particular knowledge selections romanticise globalisation through the discourses of financescapes, presenting and perpetuating a neoliberal discourse as normal and acceptable. We present reflections on how critical curriculum theory might offer insights for classroom pedagogy, especially as it relates to re-embracing the critical pedagogy project in South African schools.

AB  - A group-based affirmation reminds individuals of important ingroup attributes and highlights positive distinctiveness. Because nonprototypical ingroup members threaten the distinctiveness of the ingroup, group-affirmed individuals may be motivated to derogate fellow nonprototypical ingroup members. Four experiments test this hypothesis by affirming masculinity in heterosexual men and examining its effect on their judgments of gay men, who are often considered nonprototypical of their gender. Consistent with the main hypothesis, heterosexual men whose masculinity was affirmed via feedback or a values writing task expressed more prejudice against gay men relative to heterosexual men who were not affirmed (Experiments 1-4). Second, affirming masculinity and threatening masculinity had the same effect-both increased antigay prejudice (Experiment 2). Third, antigay prejudice increased in response to a masculinity affirmation only when the affirmed attribute was in a domain in which gay men are considered nonprototypical (masculine toughness), but not in a domain irrelevant to gay men's prototypicality as men (professional ambition; Experiment 3). Finally, affirming masculinity by targeting masculine characteristics important to individual male participants versus the group as a whole both increased antigay prejudice, which was mediated by social categorization (Experiment 4). Together, these findings suggest that a group-based affirmation can sometimes paradoxically increase prejudice.

AB  - Purpose In this paper, the authors focus on a professional development programme in Cyprus aiming to enhance teachers' intercultural understanding, awareness and competencies. This paper aims to focus on trainers' and teacher trainees' reflections upon a teacher professional development programme in the primary school in Cyprus with the largest number of Roma children.
   Design/methodology/approach The training was provided by a small team of six trainers. Immediately after each training session, each trainer participated in an interview, while three of the trainers participated also in a focus-group interview at the end of the training. The trainers' data were complemented by semi-structured interviews with a number of trainees either before or after the training. All interviews were transcribed, while interview questions comprised the framework for the qualitative analysis. The findings are presented by means of content analysis which formed the basis for emerging themes.
   Findings The authors claim that trainee teachers appeared culturally aware and sensitive, as well as knowledgeable about intercultural education; furthermore, they seemed to implement different teaching methodologies and curriculum interventions to support Roma children's inclusion in the local school community. At the same time, they seemed to adopt instrumental approaches towards the content and purpose of the programme, seeking explicit instructional guidelines, plans and heuristics to deal with Roma inclusion. Considering the mis-recognition of teachers' efforts by stakeholders outside the school and the expectations of the educational authorities - voiced via their school inspectors - teachers desperately asserted the need for tangible strategies to help them cope with difference in their classrooms.
   Research limitations/implications The authors argue that such professional development programmes should aim at facing, deconstructing and bringing to the fore prejudices and discrimination against the Other/s by valuing teachers, first, as reflective individuals and, second, as professionals with their own cultural backgrounds and identities, on which any training programme, of the kind presented in this paper, could start from and build on.
   Practical implications Even though there is no tailored magic recipe to make teachers' daily professional enterprise in multicultural settings easy, to help teachers master the necessary knowledge, skills and confidence, the authors suggest that training should be directly linked to classroom practice and acknowledge stress and helplessness that accompany work in multicultural school settings.
   Social implications The inclusion strategy in many educational systems needs to become more comprehensive to cope with varying sources of social exclusion, faced by vulnerable groups of a different cultural background, such as Roma. Teacher training thus needs to meet the challenges of working in a diverse and multicultural environment in general and with Roma children in particular. In view of the multicultural character of local societies, a more critically oriented humanistic education is needed based on tolerance and understanding.
   Originality/value The limited participation of Roma in the school system could be related to teachers' (mis)conceptions about the Roma culture and that the widely different ways in which Roma relate to schooling are often disregarded by the school.

AB  - Children typically receive investments from their fathers, but absent fathers often invest at low levels. In a father's absence, what types of nonfathers invest heavily in children? This article investigates educational participation as a reflection of childhood investments on Ibo Island, Mozambique, where only one third of school-aged children live with their biological fathers. Father-present children generally attended school at the highest rates. Stepchildren and father-absent relatives (e.g., grandchildren, nieces) attended school at comparably high rates if any coresiding children were father-present. This may signal high altruism among present fathers toward some nonoffspring. Consistent with this result, a fixed effects model indicates that, within the same household, adult males invested equally in their own children, relatives, and stepchildren. Prejudicially lower investments were made in children who were unrelated to the household's adult males, however; this result has strong negative implications for the well-being of African children fostered by nonrelatives.

AB  - People often view certain ways of classifying people (e.g., by gender, race, or ethnicity) as reflecting real distinctions found in nature. Such categories are viewed as marking meaningful, fundamental, and informative differences between distinct kinds of people. This article examines the development of these essentialist intuitive theories of how the social world is structured, along with the developmental consequences of these beliefs. We first examine the processes that give rise to social essentialism, arguing that essentialism emerges as children actively attempt to make sense of their environment by relying on several basic representational and explanatory biases. These developmental processes give rise to the widespread emergence of social essentialist views in early childhood, but allow for vast variability across development and cultural contexts in the precise nature of these beliefs. We then examine what is known and still to be discovered about the implications of essentialism for stereotyping, inter-group interaction, and the development of social prejudice. We conclude with directions for future research, particularly on the theoretical payoff that could be gained by including more diverse samples of children in future developmental investigations.

AB  - Public discourse in Western countries on the 2014 Ebola epidemic provided a unique natural opportunity to study the relationship between a disease's sociocultural representation and health policy support. Our main prediction stated that among Western citizens, support for restrictive health policies (e.g., mandatory quarantining) would be determined more through preexisting prejudice towards African immigrants than fears of Ebola infection. A questionnaire study with time-lagged measurement of predictor and criterion variables employing a German sample (N=218) that was heterogeneous in terms of gender, age, profession, political orientation, and income level provided clear support for this assumption. Although variables related to fear-of-infection were significant predictors, prejudice-related variables explained several times more variance in participants' support for restrictive policies. Moreover, the degree to which participants adopted prevalent beliefs regarding the sociocultural origins of Ebola (e.g., eating bushmeat) further intensified the impact of prejudice-related variables.

AB  - Anti-fat bias in healthcare providers and medical students has serious implications for quality of care of higher-weight patients. Studies of interventions aimed at reducing anti-fat attitudes in medical students have generally been disappointing, with little enduring effect. It is possible that some students may be more receptive to prejudice-reducing influences than others, due to underlying differences in their personal characteristics. It is also possible that attitudes toward patients, specifically, may differ from anti-fat attitudes in general, and prejudice-reduction effectiveness on patient-specific attitudes has not yet been evaluated. The present study explored the effect on general and patient-specific anti-fat attitudes of (1) contact with higher-weight individuals prior to and during medical school; and (2) training designed to increase medical students' empathy toward patients by encouraging them to take the patient's perspective during clinical encounters. The moderating role of individual difference factors on effectiveness of contact and student-reported hours of empathy training on patient-specific attitudes was assessed. A total of 3,576 students enrolled across 49 US medical schools completed an online survey at the start of their first year of medical school and at the end of their fourth year. Favorable contact experience with higher-weight patients predicted improved attitudes toward heavier patients after 4 years of medical school, and appeared sufficient to partially offset the effects of dislike of higher-weight individuals at baseline. The impact of favorable contact on general anti-fat attitudes was less strong, highlighting the importance of using target-specific outcome measures. The positive effects of favorable contact on attitudes toward higher-weight patients did not differ based on students' baseline levels of social dominance orientation, dispositional empathy, or need for cognitive closure. In contrast, the effectiveness of training did vary by student characteristics, generally being more effective in students who were more egalitarian and empathic at baseline, with little effect, or even adverse effects in students low in these traits. Overall, however, perspective-taking training produced only small improvements in attitudes toward higher-weight patients.

AB  - Although recent research has highlighted that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youths represent a resilient population, they still suffer from social stigma and oppression, being potentially at additional risk of developing negative mental health outcomes. One of the main environments where violence and harassment against this population are present is the school. Within school contexts, the impact that teachers can have on the educational experiences of LGBT youths seems to be a crucial point. This paper explored sexist, homophobic and transphobic attitudes among 438 pre-service teachers in relation to specific socio-demographic features. Results indicated that being male, heterosexual, conservative and currently religious were positively associated with sexist, homophobic, and transphobic attitudes and feelings, and having a LGBT friend was negatively associated with homophobic and transphobic attitudes and feelings. These results suggest the need to introduce specific training on the deconstruction of gender and sexual stereotypes and prejudices, to provide teachers with efficient tools to address diversity in the classrooms and to implement inclusive school policies. Suggestions for the implementation of good practices are provided.

AB  - The Great Recession, a marked global economic decline that began in December 2007 in the United States, has affected the entire world economy, although more in some countries than others. It has increased income inequality, intergenerational tensions, and anti-immigrant prejudices. This issue aims to discuss social psychological effects of economic downturns on intergroup and interpersonal relations. Two lines of research, closely related, converge in this issue because the Great Recession has brought social-class inequality into the foreground of worldwide contention. The first line of research here explores how social-class membership influences interpersonal and intergroup processes: trust, deservingness, identity, educational attainment, stereotypes, ideologies, and group behaviors. The second line analyzes how the Great Recession has been affecting people's own lives and their psychological reactions, depending on their social class. Throughout this overview, we introduce the contributions to this special issue. The volume contributes to social psychological ideas about both social classes and the recession.

AB  - Although intergroup friendships have been shown to reduce prejudice, little research has considered whether interventions fostering intergroup friendship would be effective in highly prejudicial contexts. We conducted a quasi-experiment (N=61) to test whether a contact-based intervention based on intergroup friendship could reduce bias against Roma people among non-Roma Hungarians. Participants in the contact condition engaged in a face-to-face interaction with a Roma person, and responded to questions involving mutual self-disclosure. Through pre- and post-test questionnaires, we observed significant positive change in attitudes and contact intentions among participants in the contact condition, while these effects were not observed among participants in the control condition. Positive change was moderated by perceived institutional norms, which corroborates the potential of contact-based interventions.

AB  - Research on intergroup contact has grown exponentially over the past decade. Such research has typically extolled the benefits of positive interaction between members of historically divided communities, particularly on outcomes related to prejudice reduction. Emerging work in the field, however, has qualified this optimistic picture by identifying three gaps in the existing literature. First, in everyday life, contact may be construed as a negative experience that increases rather than decreases responses such as prejudice, anxiety, and avoidance. Second, in real-life settings, contact is often circumscribed by informal practices of (re)segregation that are easily overlooked if researchers rely primarily on examining structured contact and explicit processes using primarily laboratory and questionnaire methods. Third, positive contact may have ironic effects on the political attitudes and behaviors of the historically disadvantaged, undermining their recognition of social injustice and decreasing their willingness to engage in collective action to challenge the status quo. Although it is now a truism that intergroup contact can reduce intergroup prejudice, these developments emphasize the importance of maintaining a critical perspective on the contact hypothesis as a model for promoting social change in historically divided and unequal societies. They also lay the foundations for future developments in the field.

AB  - Despite the increasing proportion of marriageable females who are single, the mass media still relegate unmarried womanhood to a stereotypical, second-tier life trajectory, which contrasts the ideal of happiness and fulfillment provided by marriage. The study explores single women's responses to the media's stereotyping of single womanhood. Drawing on the third-person effect framework, the study uses data gathered from survey of single women in urban China to examine how they perceived stereotyped media message as influencing both themselves and two important stakeholders in marriage choices (parents and unmarried peers). The results revealed significant third-person perceptions in judging the perceived influences of a prejudicial advertisement for a matchmaking service. The third-person effect appeared to be larger when unmarried peers were picked as the reference group for single women with higher education levels and for single women from families scoring high in conformity communication orientation and low in conversation orientation. The behavioral component of third-person perceptions was more aligned with the influence of the presumed effect, which suggests that single women counteracted because they were concerned with the negative effects of media on parents and peers.

AB  - Background: American Indian children have high rates of emergency department (ED) use and face potential discrimination in health care settings.
   Objective: Our goal was to assess both implicit and explicit racial bias and examine their relationship with clinical care.
   Research Design: We performed a cross-sectional survey of care providers at 5 hospitals in the Upper Midwest. Questions included American Indian stereotypes (explicit attitudes), clinical vignettes, and the Implicit Association Test. Two Implicit Association Tests were created to assess implicit bias toward the child or the parent/caregiver. Differences were assessed using linear and logistic regression models with a random effect for study site.
   Results: A total of 154 care providers completed the survey. Agreement with negative American Indian stereotypes was 22%-32%. Overall, 84% of providers had an implicit preference for nonHispanic white adults or children. Older providers (50 y and above) had lower implicit bias than those middle aged (30-49 y) (P = 0.01). American Indian children were seen as increasingly challenging (P = 0.04) and parents/caregivers less compliant (P = 0.002) as the proportion of American Indian children seen in the ED increased. Responses to the vignettes were not related to implicit or explicit bias.
   Conclusions: The majority of ED care providers had an implicit preference for non-Hispanic white children or adults compared with those who were American Indian. Provider agreement with negative American Indian stereotypes differed by practice and respondents' characteristics. These findings require additional study to determine how these implicit and explicit biases influence health care or outcomes disparities.

AB  - Developmental research on social categorization has overwhelmingly focused on perceptions about and experiences of individuals who are clear or prototypical members of discrete and usually dichotomous social categories. For example, studies of social categorization, stereotyping, prejudice, and social identity have generally explored how children reason about others who are gender-typical boys or girls or monoracial White or Black children. Similarly, research participants have generally been gender-typical and monoracial. However, our efforts to build theories that account for the true range of variation require acknowledging the increasing visibility of children who do not fit into these discrete categories and raise the question of whether existing theories can capture the dynamics that arise for them. Focusing on race and gender/sex, the social categories that have received the most attention in the developmental literature, we review research that has gone beyond simple dichotomies by including multiracial, gender-nonconforming, or intersex children, either as the targets of social perception or as participants themselves. We argue that this emerging work reveals problematic assumptions built into our theories and methods and highlights the value of building a more inclusive science.

AB  - The present study tested the hypothesis that the relation between social dominance orientation and the endorsement of legitimizing myths about the human use of nonhuman animals is moderated by the salience of that use. Eighty-two student participants read an article about agriculture that focused on either animal or crop production and then completed measures of legitimizing myths about animal use, speciesism, and social dominance orientation. In support of the hypothesis, legitimizing myths and speciesism were endorsed among people higher in social dominance orientation in the animal agriculture condition but not in the crop agriculture condition. This illustrates that when issues regarding the human use of animals are salient, people who support inequality between human groups are likely to appeal to justifications of practices in animal use that benefit humans. More broadly, it illustrates that a similar nexus between social dynamics and psychological variables sustains both human intergroup inequality and hierarchical human-animal relationships.

AB  - Video games have traditionally held a dubious reputation in the media and have been linked to many antisocial behaviors. A large amount of research has borne out some of these concerns, linking video games with addiction and particularly aggression. However, recent work in this area has begun to examine the positive aspects of video gaming. In this work, we examine how playing casual, low-involvement video games with an outgroup member may reduce prejudice. In Study 1, participants played cooperatively or competitively with a (trivial) outgroup member or alone. In Studies 2 and 3, a meaningful social identity was used: students' university affiliation. Participants played either cooperatively with a rival university student against the computer, or alone. Analyses of all three studies showed that attitudes toward the outgroup were more positive after playing with an outgroup member compared with control conditions. How these findings may be applied to real world groups and extensions for future research are then discussed.

AB  - In the current research, we examined whether the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) could be successfully adapted as an implicit measure of children's attitudes. We tested this possibility in 3 studies with 5- to 10-year-old children. In Study 1, we found evidence that children misattribute affect elicited by attitudinally positive (e.g., cute animals) and negative (e.g., aggressive animals) primes to neutral stimuli (inkblots). In Study 2, we found that, as expected, children's responses following flower and insect primes were moderated by gender. Girls (but not boys) were more likely to judge inkblots as pleasant when they followed flower primes. Children in Study 3 showed predicted affect misattribution following happy-face compared with sad-face primes. In addition, children's responses on this child-friendly AMP predicted their self-reported empathy: The greater children's spontaneous misattribution of affect following happy and sad primes, the more children reported feeling the joy and pain of others. These studies provide evidence that the AMP can be adapted as an implicit measure of children's attitudes, and the results of Study 3 offer novel insight into individual differences in children's affective responses to the emotional expressions of others.

AB  - Not only Swedish studies, but also several international studies, claim an increase in anti-Semitic attitudes in recent decades. As prejudice is acquired in the early years of socialization, and/or is innate and fairly stable over the life cycle, examining adolescents' attitudes is vitally important. Hence, by controlling for individual demographic and socio-economic background factors, we study two interrelated questions: Has anti-Semitism among Swedish secondary school-age youths changed between 2003 and 2009? Are changes equal across groups, with a specific focus on religious groups? Using two unique cross-section surveys of secondary school-age students in Sweden for the years 2003 and 2009, we try to address the above questions. Our analysis shows, in contrast to the views of the general public and other related studies, that anti-Semitism has decreased slightly during the examined period. Moreover, the study finds a variation in anti-Semitism by religious affiliation: it has increased among Muslim youth, but remains stable in other groups.

AB  - We introduce the balanced ideological antipathy (BIA) model, which challenges assumptions that right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) predict inter-group antipathy per se. Rather, the effects of RWA and SDO on antipathy should depend on the target's political orientation and political objectives, the specific components of RWA, and the type of antipathy expressed. Consistent with the model, two studies (N = 585) showed that the Traditionalism component of RWA positively and negatively predicted both political intolerance and prejudice toward tradition-threatening and -reaffirming groups, respectively, whereas SDO positively and negatively predicted prejudice (and to some extent political intolerance) toward hierarchy-attenuating and -enhancing groups, respectively. Critically, the Conservatism component of RWA positively predicted political intolerance (but not prejudice) toward each type of target group, suggesting it captures the anti-democratic impulse at the heart of authoritarianism. Recommendations for future research on the relationship between ideological attitudes and inter-group antipathy are discussed.

AB  - Over the past few decades, Australia has implemented increasingly restrictive measures to try and deter the arrival of asylum seekers. In our article, we review what is known in the literature about the antecedents of prejudice against asylum seekers. We outline 11 mechanisms, or variables, as being particularly important. We then draw out the practical implications as they relate to antiprejudice interventions. Within the research and implications, we discuss our own experiences of working directly with asylum seekers over the past decade and in running antiprejudice interventions. We conclude that even though the situation is bleak in Australia at the time of writing this article (at the end of 2014), we must continue with attempts to combat the demonisation of asylum seekers both on an individual level and a structural level.

AB  - A relatively large literature has demonstrated that sexual orientation can be judged accurately from a variety of minimal cues, including facial appearance. Untested in this work, however, is the influence that individual differences in prejudice against gays and lesbians may exert upon perceivers' judgments. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of 23 unpublished studies testing the relationship between anti-gay bias and the categorization of sexual orientation from faces. Aggregating data from multiple measures of bias using a variety of methods in three different countries over a period of 8 years, we found a small but significant negative relationship between accuracy and prejudice that was homogeneous across the samples tested. Thus, individuals reporting higher levels of anti-gay bias appear to be less accurate judges of sexual orientation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - How impressionable are in-group biases in early childhood? Previous research shows that young children display robust preferences for members of their own social group, but also condemn those who harm others. The current study investigates children's evaluations of agents when their group membership and moral behavior conflict. After being assigned to a minimal group, 4- to 5-year-old children either saw their in-group member behave antisocially, an out-group member act prosocially, or control agents, for whom moral information was removed. Children's explicit preference for and willingness to share with their in-group member was significantly attenuated in the presence of an antisocial in-group member, but not a prosocial out-group member. Interestingly, children's learning decisions were unmoved by a person's moral behavior, instead being consistently guided by group membership. This demonstrates that children's in-group bias is remarkably flexible: while moral information curbs children's in-group bias on social evaluations, social learning is still driven by group information.

AB  - A traditional psychoanalytic view of parenting a disabled child emphasises responses of shock, grief and depression. Parent activists and social model disability authors dismiss such accounts as destructive and prejudiced, foregrounding structural barriers to accessing services and resources. Further, psychoanalysis is criticised for its anachronistic, ideologically uncritical discourse. Each position brings valuable insights as well as silences. This paper seeks to overcome an assumption of mutual exclusivity by creating a new synthesis, drawing on the work of Winnicott and Kittay. Conclusions are that it is both possible and necessary to allow for ambivalent feelings within parents, while attending to the external, material realities of contextual factors.

AB  - Inhibition of prejudice appears to be more problematic for older adults, hence the need to develop programs to reduce intergroup bias at later stages in life. Perspective taking was analyzed in this study, as one of various cognitive strategies that have been shown to reduce such bias. Data on a sample of 63 Spanish participants with a mean age of 64.1 years was gathered after an intervention based on mental imagery, aimed at reducing explicit prejudice. A wide array of variables was measured (personality traits, values, empathy, and attribution) which may moderate effectiveness in perspective taking. Despite no main effect was found, effects due to interaction of perspective taking found in OLS regression analysis revealed that perspective taking based intervention was effective for some older adults, particularly those who had low scores on agreeableness, empathy, and universalism, and high scores on conformity. The conclusions suggest that perspective taking might be successfully applied to some profiles of older people albeit it is not as strong and transferable strategy as it used to be thought.

AB  - Objective: Our purpose was to assess stigma toward schizophrenia in a representative sample of the Brazilian general population.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 1015 individuals interviewed by telephone. A vignette describing someone with schizophrenia was read, and four stigma aspects regarding this hypothetical individual were assessed: stereotypes, restrictions, perceived prejudice and social distance. Latent profile analysis searched for stigma profiles among the sample. Multinomial logistic regression was used to find correlates of each class.
   Results: Four stigma profiles were found; 'no stigma' individuals (n = 251) mostly displayed positive opinions. 'Labelers' (n = 222) scored high on social distance; they more often had familial contact with mental illness and more often labeled the vignette's disorder as schizophrenia. 'Discriminators', the group with the majority of individuals (n = 302), showed high levels of stigmatizing beliefs in all dimensions; discriminators were significantly older. 'Unobtrusive stigma' individuals (n = 240) seemed to demonstrate uncertainty or low commitment since they mostly answered items with the middle/impartial option.
   Conclusion: Some findings from the international literature were replicated; however, familial contact increased stigma, possibly denoting a locally modulated determinant. Hereby, our study also adds important cross-cultural data by showing that stigma toward schizophrenia is high in a Latin-American setting. We highlight the importance of analyzing the general population as a heterogeneous group, aiming to better elaborate anti-stigma campaigns.

AB  - This study uses Goffman's [1963. Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity, New Jersey, Prentice-Hall] theory of stigma as an intellectual scaffold to help understand the social meaning of HIV/AIDS stigma from People Living with HIV/AIDS. The study adopts a qualitative approach because of its appropriateness for unravelling subjective phenomena such as the experiences of HIV/AIDS stigma. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 HIV-positive employees of a retailing company located in the Western Cape province of South Africa who volunteered to participate in the study. The participants with the discreditable stigma internalised society's prejudice towards those living with the virus. As a result, the participants relied on self-isolation and social withdrawal to cope with enacted stigma. Managing information about one's status and deciding whether, who, when, etc., to tell are crucial questions. The participants feared being devalued by family, friends, co-workers and the community. In concurrence with Goffman [1963. Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity, New Jersey, Prentice-Hall] the HIV/AIDS stigma is seen as about relationships.

AB  - The development of technology affects all spheres of human life, including children's play. The changes resulting from the fast development of technology and new media leave a huge dent in the process of children's play.
   This paper tends to answer the question how the development of technology and new media influences the changes in the context of children's play, whether the new media has become just a good excuse for some other, deeper social changes taking place in a society and influencing all segments of human life, including children. It is concluded that, with the development of technology, children's play has evolved in another direction, a direction that has not been sufficiently explored, often unfavourably judged and blamed for all the negative changes in children's life. A basic developmental characteristic of children is their openness to something new and different. Children are by nature explorers who investigate everything in their environment and beyond. The possibilities of technology and new media in children's play are just another segment that requires exploration and investigation, and that is interesting for children to research. Simplicity and openness to new things is something one needs to appreciate and nurture in children. On the trail of these changes adults are faced with new tasks, such as showing complete openness to new things and discarding all prejudices, limitations and ignorance. When all of this is behind us, we can help children get into great exploration of the new media as a new and inevitable part of their new play. Accepting the strong impact of the new media on children's play allows us a certain amount of control over the quality of play in order to protect children.
   Technology and the new media have become part of children's play, of the way children play in the 21st century.

AB  - We examined the association between two individual differences (race-based rejection sensitivity and social constraints in talking about racism with family, friends, and/or intimate partners) and psychological reactions to an incident of racial discrimination. Participants were 551 African American undergraduates from either a predominantly white university (PWU) or a historically black university (HBU). Race-based rejection sensitivity (RS-Race) predicted higher negative affect and lower forgiveness for the perpetrator. Social constraints predicted higher negative affect and (marginally) lower forgiveness. There was also an interaction between social constraints and RS-Race: RS-Race was strongly negatively related to positive affect and forgiveness among participants with low social constraints but essentially unrelated among those with high social constraints. Thought intrusions (that might prolong the memory of the prejudicial event) also mediated the effects of RS-Race and social constraints on negative affect and forgiveness. The results document how individual differences are associated with reactions to being the target of racial discrimination in day-to-day interactions.

AB  - Two studies examined how managers' pay decisions for male and female employees are affected by the opportunity to provide social accounts and how managers think about the value of accounts for men versus women. I theorized that managers would treat social accounts as substitutes for pay for women but not for men, paradoxically leading managers who could behave more procedurally fairly to create gender-based distributive injustice. Study 1 confirms this hypothesis. Practicing managers who learned before making pay decisions that they could provide a social account-here, an explanation of circumstances justifying low raises-paid women less than men and less than women for whom they could not provide this account. Also as hypothesized, when an account was available, experienced managers paid women less than did inexperienced managers. In addition to pay decisions, participants' explicit beliefs about the value of accounts as substitutes for pay (Study I) and in motivating male and female employees (Study 2) were examined. When participants expected the account to make the employee feel that he or she had been treated with a high level of procedural fairness (Study 1), or the language of the account explicitly acknowledged and apologized for unfair treatment (Study 2), participants assumed that the account would be significantly more valuable for women than for men. This difference was greater for experienced participants than inexperienced ones. I discuss the implications of this "substitutability thesis" and these results for research on justice and gender as well as for achieving gender equity in the workplace.

AB  - Myrdal (1944) described the American dilemma as the conflict between abstract national values (liberty and justice for all) and more concrete, everyday prejudices. We leveraged construal-level theory to empirically test Myrdal's proposition that construal level (abstract vs. concrete) can influence prejudice. We measured individual differences in construal level (Study 1) and manipulated construal level (Studies 2 and 3); across these three studies, we found that adopting an abstract mind-set heightened conservatives' tolerance for groups that are perceived as deviating from Judeo-Christian values (gay men, lesbians, Muslims, and atheists). Among participants who adopted a concrete mind-set, conservatives were less tolerant of these nonnormative groups than liberals were, but political orientation did not have a reliable effect on tolerance among participants who adopted an abstract mind-set. Attitudes toward racial out-groups and dominant groups (e.g., Whites, Christians) were unaffected by construal level. In Study 3, we found that the effect of abstract thinking on prejudice was mediated by an increase in concerns about fairness.

AB  - Contemporary interpersonal biases are partially derived from psychological mechanisms that evolved to protect people against the threat of contagious disease. This behavioral immune system effectively promotes disease avoidance but also results in an overgeneralized prejudice toward people who are not legitimate carriers of disease. In three studies, we tested whether experiences with two modern forms of disease protection (vaccination and hand washing) attenuate the relationship between concerns about disease and prejudice against out-groups. Study 1 demonstrated that when threatened with disease, vaccinated participants exhibited less prejudice toward immigrants than unvaccinated participants did. In Study 2, we found that framing vaccination messages in terms of immunity eliminated the relationship between chronic germ aversion and prejudice. In Study 3, we directly manipulated participants' protection from disease by having some participants wash their hands and found that this intervention significantly influenced participants' perceptions of out-group members. Our research suggests that public-health interventions can benefit society in areas beyond immediate health-related domains by informing novel, modern remedies for prejudice.

AB  - Although perceived differences between outgroup social categories and the self are often cited as a major contributor to prejudice and intergroup tension, surprisingly few studies have examined ways to improve associations between the self and racial outgroups. The present research investigated one strategy to increase these associations-approach training. Specifically, 3 studies investigated the impact of training participants to conceptually approach Blacks on 3 separate measures: 2 response latency measures indexing the strength of association between the self and Blacks and a psychophysiological measure indexing brain activity in response to Blacks in the context of the self. A fourth study examined the link between earlier research on the impact of approach training on implicit prejudice against Blacks and the current results related to self-Black associations. Together, these findings provided consistent evidence that training in approaching Blacks increases associations between the self and Blacks that in turn reduce implicit prejudice against Blacks.

AB  - The present study examined whether the length of an individual's written explanation for an instance of subtle, attributionally ambiguous racism related to their perception of racism, levels of prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Individuals (n = 51) read a brief vignette describing an instance of subtle racism and then wrote a description explaining what they believed was happening in the situation. Individuals higher in prejudice and social dominance orientation wrote longer situational explanations. Individuals who wrote longer situational explanations were less likely to perceive the situation as racist and more likely to attribute that situation to a chance happening. Finally, longer explanations also contained more situational attributions unrelated to race. As the number of attributions unrelated to race increased, the perception of racism decreased. The present results suggest that longer explanations helped individuals explain away subtle racism.

Two experiments, each with different participants, assessed how changes in characteristics of hypothetical patients described as having a tattoo that reduced employment prospects affected how participants allocated access to the procedure. Patient characteristics assessed were parental status, age, and tattoo content. Participants ranked prospective patients (all described as having an undesirable tattoo, and varied with respect to the aforementioned characteristics) on the priority for receipt of removal. Young patients with children, and with specific tattoo contents, were favored. Implications for prejudice against certain groups are noted.

AB  - Social Dominance Orientation, one of the most popular individual differences measures in the study of generalized prejudice, can be understood as having two components: Opposition to Equality (OEQ) and support for Group-Based Dominance (GBD). We consider these components in terms of system justification theory and social identity theory. We find that each component best explains different kinds of political views, consistent with the theory that they arise from different motivations. OEQ reflects system justification motives. It better predicts attitudes towards redistributive social policy, political conservatism, and a lack of humanitarian compassion for the disadvantaged. GBD reflects social identity motives. It is more associated with hostility toward outgroups and concerns about intergroup competition. GBD and OEQ have different personality and demographic correlates, exhibit distinctive relations with explicit and implicit attitudinal preferences, and differentially predict a variety of policy attitudes. Use of GBD and OEQ as separate constructs enriches the understanding of prejudice, policy attitudes, and political ideology.

AB  - Bertha Pappenheim was the real name of Anna O, the first psychoanalytic patient. In her treatment with Joseph Breuer, Pappenheim invented what she called "Chimney-sweeping," the procedure of tracing a symptom back to its origins using free association. After her treatment and several subsequent hospitalizations, Pappenheim went on to become a pioneer of German-Jewish social work, a leading feminist, campaigner for women's rights, and protector of unwed mothers and orphans. I have obtained multiple documents that reveal aspects of her life that have been unappreciated. She was cured not just by her psychoanalytic treatment, but also by realizing her intellectual gifts via her writing and by changing the society that was making her ill. In these ways, she resembled Harry Stack Sullivan, the founder of interpersonal psychoanalysis. Both faced a major crisis in late adolescence and went on to create environments that insulated victims of prejudice and allowed them to flourish.

AB  - This paper analyzes the ethics of social science research (SSR) employing big data. We begin by highlighting the research gap found on the intersection between big data ethics, SSR and research ethics. We then discuss three aspects of big data SSR which make it warrant special attention from a research ethics angle: (1) the interpretative character of both SSR and big data, (2) complexities of anticipating and managing risks in publication and reuse of big data SSR, and (3) the paucity of regulatory oversight and ethical recommendations on protecting individual subjects as well as societies when conducting big data SSR. Against this backdrop, we propose using David Resnik's research ethics framework to analyze some of the most pressing ethical issues of big data SSR. Focusing on the principles of honesty, carefulness, openness, efficiency, respect for subjects, and social responsibility, we discuss three clusters of ethical issues: those related to methodological biases and personal prejudices, those connected to risks arising from data availability and reuse, and those leading to individual and social harms. Finally, we advance considerations to observe in developing future ethical guidelines about big data SSR.

AB  - Psychedelic science has generated hundreds of compelling published studies yet with relatively little impact on mainstream psychology. I propose that social psychologists have much to gain by incorporating psychoactive substances into their research programs. Here I use (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an example because of its documented ability in experiments and clinical trials to promote bonding, love, and warmth. Social connection is a fundamental human need, yet researchers still possess few tools to effectively and durably boost it. MDMA allows investigators to isolate the psychological mechanisms-as well as brain pathways-underlying felt social connection and thus reveal what should be targeted in future (nondrug) studies. Accordingly, I introduce a conceptual model that presents the proximal psychological mechanisms stimulated by MDMA (lowered fear, increased sociability, more chemistry), as well as its potential long-term impacts (improved relationships, reduced loneliness, stronger therapeutic alliances). Finally, I discuss further questions (e.g., whether using MDMA for enhancing connection can backfire) and promising research areas for building a new science of psychedelic social psychology. In sum, psychopharmacological methods can be a useful approach to illuminate commonly studied social-psychological processes, such as connectedness, prejudice, or self, as well as inform interventions to directly improve people's lives.

AB  - This study illustrates how speech features that emerged from language contact and acquisition in a pluralistic society can accrue diverse social-indexical meanings over time. The social perceptions towards three variants of coda /l/ in Singapore English-namely dark-l, the variant associated with prescriptive norms, and clear-l and vocalised-l, which are variants that arose through language contact-are examined. The findings show that clear-l and vocalised-l are associated with specific ethnic groups and have equally diverse meanings, but their meanings have evolved differently; vocalised-l is an emerging local standard, whereas clear-l remains largely stigmatised Their diverse meanings are shown to be connected by social factors within a network of interrelated signs, and their interpretations are dependent on the hearer's experiences, such that we are observing different parts of the sociolinguistic reality. Restricted experiences with the social world and regulation of social perception are also shown to potentially contribute to accent-based prejudices.

AB  - Purpose The paper introduces a multi-level model to reduce prejudice through supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels. The purpose of the model is to provide theoretically undergirded pathways to explain how societal events calling for systemic changes in DEI practices can engage and inculcate such systemic changes in organizations and institutions. Design/methodology/approach The model draws upon macro-level (i.e. institutional theory and institutional logics) theories from sociology and strategic management, meso-level theories from leadership and strategy, and micro-level organizational behavior and human resource management theories. Findings Resting on open systems theory (Katz and Kahn, 1966) as a backdrop, the authors address how institutional changes result in organizational level changes driving multi-level outcomes of increased DEI, reduced prejudice in work-related settings, and performance gains. The authors suggest the recursive nature of the model can trigger institutional level shifts in logics or result in isomorphic pressures that further change organizational fields and organizations. Originality/value The contribution rests in a multi-level examination to help understand how environmental pressures can motivate organizations to enact broader changes related to social justice, specifically increasing efforts in DEI inside the operational aspects of the organization. By enacting these changes, the authors suggest the resultant positive changes in organizations will enhance culture and performance, creating isomorphic pressure for industry wide changes that may begin to move the needle on addressing systemic problems that feed prejudicial behavior in the workplace.

AB  - StyleLikeU is a hugely successful online social media platform that presents itself as a social justice movement related to body acceptance. Presenting moving personal stories, it offers a site for what it calls 'diverse individuals' to share their experiences as part of promoting individual self-acceptance in the face of a world that prioritizes one kind of body over another, which take the form of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, sizeism and prejudice against disfigurement. Drawing out the discursive script carried across the platform, we show how, beneath the rhetoric of progressiveness, social justice becomes a kind of personal therapy, related to empowerment and transformation, which erases actual differences in personal circumstances and the very forces of injustice. We place StyleLikeU into broader scholarly concerns about the neoliberal colonization of identity politics, diversity and intersectionality in institutions and in branding, drawing attention to how this can form one part of what are now presented as social justice movements.

AB  - It is well established that parents with disabilities are likely to have adverse experiences within the U.S. child welfare system, including disproportionately high rates of involvement and termination of parental rights. However, no known studies have examined the child welfare system through the lens of ableism. This qualitative phenomenological study included interviews with 15 parents with disabilities, 15 child welfare workers, and 15 attorneys who represent parents. Interviews revealed four levels of ableism within the child welfare system: (1) internalized, (2) interpersonal, (3) institutional, and (4) structural. Participants described their own internalized ableism, offered examples of interpersonal prejudice against disabled parents in the child welfare system, and discussed the institutional practice of using parents' disabilities as a reason to separate them from their children and deny them services and accommodations. Interviews with parents also revealed that ableism across the child welfare system and other institutions could make it more difficult for them to reunify with their children. At the same time, child welfare workers and attorneys noted that disabled parents are disadvantaged by federally mandated reunification timelines. Ameliorating ableism in the child welfare system requires interventions at each level.

AB  - Although an ever-increasing number of social interactions are taking place virtually, people's relationships with their neighbors remain important. Apartment residents make up a growing proportion of the population in cities worldwide, but there is evidence that many find it challenging to form and maintain local social connections, especially those renting their home. This can negatively impact physical and mental health, and have implications for the management of apartment complexes and local area social sustainability. In this paper, we draw on interviews (n = 41) with renters of four large case study condominium complexes in Sydney, Australia, to investigate their local social interactions. The findings reveal that while many renters desire greater local connection, their opportunities and motivations are limited by factors relating to mobility, tenure security, prejudice, and exclusion from building-related governance. The paper concludes by considering the scope for interventions in design, management and governance to enhance opportunities for social connection.

AB  - In Job 30:1-8, Job dehumanises his detractors: he depicts his low-class opponents as vile creatures in the wilderness. Dehumanisation has been a common strategy to devalue outgroups from Job's time to our own. It functions by assuming a human-animal hierarchy (in which animals lack value), and mapping it onto a social hierarchy, delegitimising the animalised individuals at the bottom. By using this strategy, Job reveals his prejudice around other species and low classes. The logic of the divine speeches, however, overturns both these prejudices. The speeches respond to Job's classism, not by denying that low-class humans are animals, but rather by celebrating animals (38:39-39:30). For Job, the non-human was a source of derision; for God it is a source of delight.

AB  - Existing studies of the multi-group dynamics of prejudiced societies focus on the social-psychological knowledge behind the relevant processes. We instead create a multi-agent framework that simulates the propagation of prejudice and measures its tangible impact on prosperity. Levels of prosperity are tracked for individuals as well as larger social structures including groups and factions. We model social interactions using the Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma (CPD) and a new agent type called a prejudiced agent. Our simulations show that even modeling prejudice as an exclusively out-group phenomenon nonetheless generates implicit in-group promotion, leading to higher relative prosperity of a prejudiced population. This skew in prosperity is seen to be correlated to factors such as size difference between groups, and the fraction of prejudiced agents in a group. Our model is a step towards a deeper understanding of the origins, propagation, and ramifications of prejudice through simulative studies grounded in apt theoretical backgrounds.

AB  - Purpose: The cardio-respiratory function is compromised in children recovering from burns, particularly, those who sustain a burn injury across the chest, which leads to further prejudicial effects on physical and psychosocial health. This study endeavored to explore the efficacy of 12 weeks of graded aerobic exercise (GAEx) on the cardiorespiratory capacity and physical and psychosocial functioning in children with burn sequelae of the chest.
   Methods: Thirty-six burn-injured children aged 10 -18 years (%TBSA: 24.2 +/- 4.9, and 38.8 +/- 12.9 months since injury) were randomly assigned to GAEx group (n = 18; undergone a 12-week intensity- and time-graded aerobic exercise program plus standard rehabilitation) or control group (n = 18; received the standard rehabilitation only). The cardiorespiratory fitness [marked by the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), minute ventilation (V-E), ventilatory equivalent of inhaled oxygen (VEq/VO2), oxygen pulse (O2P), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximum heart rate (HRmax), and the heart rate recovery at one minute (HRR1)] and physical and psychosocial functioning were assessed pre- and post-intervention.
   Results: Children in the GAEx group showed significant increases in VO2peak (P = 0.013), V-E (P = 0.026), O2P (P = 0.034), HRmax (P = 0.035), and HRR1 (P = 0.04) and declines in VEq/VO2 (P = 0.009) and RER (P = 0.011) as compared to the control group. Additionally, the GAEx group reported higher physical (P = 0.029) and psychosocial (P = 0.012) functioning.
   Conclusion: Twelve weeks of GAEx has salutary effects on cardio-respiratory capacity and physical and psychosocial functioning in children with burn sequelae of the chest. These findings suggest that adding GAEx as a complementary therapy to the long-term rehabilitation protocol for this patient population is worthwhile. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB  - Taiwanese students who graduated from Polish medical schools (P-IMGs) accounted for the second-largest group of international medical graduates in Taiwan. In 2009, domestic medical students in Taiwan staged mass demonstrations against P-IMG's exemption from the qualifying test before the licensing exam. Although medical circles in Taiwan might still hold prejudices against P-IMGs, little is known about their career development. This study will analyze P-IMGs' choices of specialties and training sites from 2000 to 2020 using data from the membership section of the Taiwan Medical Journal, the monthly official publication of the Taiwan Medical Association. Of 372 P-IMGs, 34.2% chose internal medicine and 17.1% surgery. Although academic medical centers offered 76% of all available trainee positions in a year, only 49.3% of P-IMGs received training there. By contrast, 20.9% of P-IMGs were trained at nonmetropolitan hospitals that altogether accounted for only 5.8% of trainee positions. In conclusion, P-IMGs had their residency training at less favorable specialties and sites. Their long-term career development deserves further study.

AB  - The process of Jungian analysis is reviewed and considered as inexorably intertwined with our lives in society and with aspects of our social interactions that long for interpersonal and restorative justice. Various models are reviewed, including Fanon, Gambini, Kimbles, Levine, Saban - each with an eye toward Jung's injunction that we must move beyond 'knowledge' toward 'eating and digesting', thereby metabolizing and shifting our way of living. Dissociated aspects of the analytic couple are discussed, both as represented by and articulating transgenerational issues, phantoms, and as presented in often neglected aspects of embodiment. Jeremy Harris's Slave Play is offered as an amplification of ubiquitous and unacknowledged transgenerational presences in our analytic interactions. Clinical examples explore countertransference aspects that illustrate Jung's challenge, such as an unwitting prejudice toward analysis as equalling transformation and integrating resolution, or toward analysis as leaving unexamined the presumptions of class structures and privilege. A personal dream is offered to illustrate a necessary reorientation of the analyst's ego toward an attitude in which rebirth comes only in and through interaction with the collective. It is argued that only with such interaction, which manifests movement toward social justice, is there an efficacious analysis.

AB  - This study used in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of women with disabilities in Burkina Faso to explore how discrimination based on gender and disability intersects and influences exposure to violence, as well as the impact of such discrimination on social participation, a theme barely studied in West Africa. The study thematically analysed the narratives of 35 women with disabilities - including mental, physical, auditory and visual - (age range = 15-53), rural and urban that were collected through four focus groups and eight case stories of rape survivors. As presented in the statements of the women surveyed, the combination of stereotypes and prejudices linked to disability and unequal gender relations make these women predominantly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially sexual violence. This increased vulnerability to sexual assault emphasises the processes of social exclusion these women experience, at all levels of society, which for most of them results in limited social participation. The findings of this study showed the need for policies related to women's empowerment and inclusion of people with disabilities to adopt an intersectional approach, to better consider the specific issues of women with disabilities.

AB  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is most common chronic disease among male population. Symptoms that appear due to benign prostate enlargement significantly influence patients` quality of life, activities, and psychosocial behaviour. The aim of this study is to evaluate the affection of psychosocial factors on diagnosis and treatment of the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) so a new insight on morbidity and treatment can be reached. The expression of the lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH is scored through International Prostate Scoring System (IPSS). We have made a prospective analysis of patients who are looking for urologist opinion for the first time; we quantified their symptoms with IPSS questionnaire and gathered information about patients` social status. Out of 89 patients with BPH symptoms, 47 come from rural areas and lower social status, although other 42 come from bigger cities. Patients from rural areas expressed more severe symptoms due to the longer time from the beginning of the symptoms to the time they seek for specialist opinion. Reasons are patients` habits, more expressed prejudices in accepting the disease and patients` lower education. Organising campaigns for raising the awareness of the patients with BPH symptoms will result with lower morbidity of these patients living in the smaller municipalities.

AB  - Objective The stigma and prejudice of the public regarding psychiatric disorders are a long-standing social problem. However, health professionals are more likely to have negative attitudes and label people with mental health conditions. This study aimed to investigate how self-rated familiarity and literacy about schizophrenia are related to social distancing towards schizophrenia patients among health professionals in Taiwan. Method This study used a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and invited respondents to complete the survey either electronically or in a pencil/paper format. Respondents included health professionals in different disciplines and students under medical placements. The survey instrument consists of three parts: sociodemographic information, the 18-item Social Distance Scale for schizophrenia, and the 19-item Schizophrenia Experience and Knowledge Questionnaires. Data were analyzed using linear regression models to explore sociodemographic factors, self-rated familiarity, and literacy total scores about social distance, attitude, and opinions towards schizophrenia. Result In total, 420 health professionals completed the questionnaire, of which 24.5% were physicians, 36.0% nurses, 6.7% pharmacists, and 28.6% interns. The majority of respondents (n = 360, 85.7%) had contact experience with schizophrenia patients, and approximately 60% rated their experience as a positive impression. Although 62.9% of respondents had received psychiatric education or training, 86% believed that such education/training was insufficient. Moreover, over half of the respondents did not have confidence in their knowledge of schizophrenia. Older age, being married, and having more working experience were associated with high social distance, a negative attitude, and high prejudice. More familiarity with schizophrenia was associated with low social distance, a positive attitude, and less prejudice. A high literacy score was associated with a positive attitude and less prejudice, but no significant correlation was observed with social distance (beta +/- SE = -0.26 +/- 0.14, p = .057). Among respondents who rated their past contact experiences as negative, neither familiarity nor literacy was associated with social distance. Conclusion High levels of self-rated familiarity and high literacy about schizophrenia were associated with low social distance, a positive attitude, and less prejudice towards schizophrenia among health professionals. Therefore, sufficient education and training are imperative to increase familiarity and knowledge of schizophrenia. Appropriate education could be implemented from different perspectives, including communication skills, resources of social support, and topics to reduce stigma and prejudice.

AB  - Social enterprises appear to offer innovative solutions for empowering women in entrepreneurship and achieving gender equality. This research, however, finds that female social entrepreneurs remain disadvantaged relative to their male counterparts during social entrepreneurial financing. Although this female-male disparity becomes diminished when ventures indicate more social value orientation, the results show that this is because more social value orientation reduces the funding to male founders but has no apparent effect on female founders. These results contribute to research on social entrepreneurship from a gender lens and call for greater attention to gender assumptions about social entrepreneurship in practice.

AB  - The identification-prejudice link describes the defensive stance toward immigrants held by strong national identifiers. Recent research refined this relationship by suggesting that defensive national identification (operationalized through national narcissism), but not secure national identification, was associated with prejudice. While previous research found intergroup threat and conspiracy beliefs to mediate the identification-prejudice link, the need to comprehensively and experimentally test the role of these defensive group beliefs remains in the context of the narcissistic identification-prejudice link. Furthermore, following the group-based control model, we proposed that these defensive group beliefs might be more pronounced among national narcissists compensating for a low personal control. In Study 1 (N = 1104, nationally representative sample), national narcissism, but not secure national identification, was related to prejudice against immigrants, and a serial model composed of perceived intergroup threat and conspiracy beliefs mediated this relationship. These relationships held when controlling for conspiracy mentality, supporting the notion that these conspiracy beliefs were motivated at the intergroup level. In Study 2 (N = 474, pre-registered), we experimentally induced intergroup threat and exposure to conspiracy theories about immigrants. Induced threat increased conspiracy beliefs, and both increased prejudice, corroborating their causal relationship. In Study 3 (N = 350, pre-registered), we induced low personal control and made national narcissism salient to test the group-based control hypothesis. The relationship between measured (but not manipulated) national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs was more pronounced under low personal control. We discuss the role of defensive group beliefs on group-based control and prejudice against immigrants.

AB  - In the matter of human resource management in enterprises, the recruitment stage plays a crucial role. Candidates apply for jobs in enterprises in many different fields, ranging from culture, construction, education, healthcare to hotels. They are of different ages according to the provisions of the Labor Code 2019, and of different groups of people in society who participate in the socio-economic development of the country. In fact, there have been a number of countries such as Canada, Japan and the United States, which increase GDP by recruiting people with disabilities. However, there are still some businesses that refuse to hire workers with disabilities due to their subjective and objective prejudices. In this study, the authors want to delve into the research that the recruitment of people with disabilities in enterprises is one of the effective solutions to help enterprises fulfil their social responsibilities.

AB  - The concept of epistemic (specifically testimonial) injustice is the latest philosophical tool with which to try to theorise what goes wrong when mental health service users are not listened to by clinicians, and what goes right when they are. Is the tool adequate to the task? It is argued that, to be applicable at all, the concept needs some adjustment so that being disbelieved as a result of prejudice is one of a family of alternative necessary conditions for its application, rather than a necessary condition all on its own. It is then argued that even once adjusted in this way, the concept does not fit well in the area where the biggest efforts have been made to apply it so far, namely the highly sensitive case of adult patients suffering from delusions. Indeed it does not serve the interests of service users struggling for recognition to try to apply it in this context, because there is so much more to being listened to than simply being believed. However, the concept is found to apply smoothly in many cases where the service users are children, for example, in relation to children's testimony on the efficacy of treatment. It is suggested that further research would demonstrate the usefulness of the concept in adult cases of a similar kind.

AB  - People from marginalized groups are often discriminated against in traditional recruitment processes. Yet as companies faced with skill shortages change their recruitment strategies, the question arises as to whether modern recruitment trends such as the use of professional social network sites, active sourcing, and recruitment assignment to external agencies are affected by implicit or explicit discrimination. In our mixed-method study, we first conducted expert interviews with different types of recruiters to explore the potential for discrimination in the modern recruitment process. We then analyzed panel data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Germany to see whether there is quantitative evidence of discrimination in modern recruitment. A content analysis of the interviews shows that active sourcing and assignment of recruitment to private agencies are potentially affected by explicit discrimination. We identified three sources of discrimination in personnel selection: recruiters' own attitudes, explicit instructions from managers, and the recruiters' assumptions regarding companies' preferred candidates. The results of mixed multilevel analyses with the company as a second level resonate with the qualitative findings: companies actively approach female employees, older employees, and employees who are born in Southern/Eastern Europe less often and offer women jobs less often. The effects for gender were still significant when we included far-right voting as a moderator variable on the employee level, but the interactions were not significant. Effects for gender and older people in active sourcing were also significant and robust when controlling for income, number of children, level of school completion, and educational background. Our findings suggest that current legislation may be insufficient to protect candidates who belong to marginalized groups from discrimination in modern recruitment.</p>

AB  - Psychological essentialism has played an important role in social psychology, informing influential theories of stereotyping and prejudice as well as questions about wrongdoers' accountability and their ability to change. In the existing literature, essentialism is often tied to beliefs in shared biology-that is, the extent to which members of a social group are seen as having the same underlying biological features. Here we investigate the possibility of "value-based essentialism" in which people think of certain social groups in terms of an underlying essence, but that essence is understood as a value. Study 1 explored beliefs about a wide range of social groups and found that both groups with shared biology (e.g., women) and shared values (e.g., hippies) elicited similar general essentialist beliefs relative to more incidental social categories (e.g., English-speakers). In Studies 2-4, participants who read about a group either as being based in biology or in values reported higher general essentialist beliefs compared with a control condition. Because biological essences about social groups have been connected to a number of downstream consequences, we also investigated two test cases concerning value-based essentialism. In Study 3, beliefs about both shared biology and shared values increased inductive generalizations about the social group relative to control, but in Study 4, only the shared biology condition reduced blame for wrongdoing. Together these findings join with recent work to support a broader theoretical framework of essentialism about social groups that can be arrived at through multiple pathways, including, in the present case, shared values.

AB  - Political scientists regularly measure anti-Black prejudice in the survey context using racial resentment, an indirect measure that blends racial animus with traditional moral values. Explicit prejudice, a direct measure based in beliefs about the group-level inferiority of Blacks, is used less frequently. We investigate whether these attitudes predict anti-Black discrimination and evaluations of the fairness of intergroup inequality. Study 1 used the Ultimatum Game to obtain a behavioral measure of racial discrimination and found whites engaged in anti-Black discrimination. Explicit prejudice explained which whites discriminated, whereas resentment did not. In study 2, white third-party observers evaluated intergroup interactions in the Ultimatum Game, and explicit prejudice explained racially biased fairness evaluations, but resentment did not. This demonstrates that resentment and prejudice are distinct constructs and that explicit prejudice has clear behavioral implications. We also find that explicit prejudice is widespread among white Americans and significantly less partisan than resentment.

AB  - According to evidentialism, what is epistemically rational to believe is determined by evidence alone. So, assuming that prejudiced beliefs are irrational, evidentialism entails that they must not be properly based on the evidence. Recently, philosophers have been interested in cases of beliefs that seem to undermine evidentialism: these are beliefs that seem both prejudiced (and, thus, irrational) and properly based on the evidence (and, thus, rational). In these cases, a believer has strong statistical evidence that most members of a social group have some property and then comes to believe that an individual member of that social group will likely have that property. For example, a server at a restaurant has statistical evidence that most Black diners tip less than average and then comes to believe that a particular Black diner will likely tip less than average. The goal of this paper is to defend evidentialism from the challenge posed to it by beliefs like the server's by developing a plausible evidentialist account that explains away these conflicting intuitions.

AB  - Prejudice against tourists from the epidemic areas or those infected during the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted much attention. While many studies examined the influence of this prejudice on tourists themselves, little research has been conducted to identify cyber-bystanders' reactions to tourism companies' prejudice practice. This study aims to fill this gap by revealing the process of how cyber-bystanders identify, evaluate, and respond online to prejudice practice in the context of the tourism industry. The study developed a conceptual model to examine the influential factors and their internal relationship of cyber-bystanders' reactions. A multistage model was proposed based on the social comparison theory. An online survey was conducted in mainland China, and 558 useable questionnaires were collected. The three-process model was estimated using the Bootstrap mediation test and hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate that cyber-bystanders' prejudice recognizing process could impact their reactions through the influence of their evaluation behaviors. Meanwhile, the collective sentiment on social media has a moderating effect on the relationship between cyber-bystanders' evaluating process and their reactions to prejudice practice. Both theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

AB  - This online experimental study examined the roles of race and student-athlete status in college student perceptions of peers' academic and intellectual skills and favorability. College student participants (n = 376) were randomly assigned to view a photograph (i.e., Black student-athlete, Black non-student-athlete, White student-athlete, White non-student-athlete) then rated the academic skills, intelligence, and favorability of the respective condition target. Moderation analyses revealed that White student-athletes were appraised as having higher study skills, academic motivation, and problem-solving abilities than White non-student athletes. Moreover, Black student-athletes were rated as less intelligent and less favorable than Black non-student athletes. Results suggest student-athlete status may be an advantage for White student-athletes, but a disadvantage for Black student-athletes in terms of peers' academic, intelligence, and favorability appraisals relative to same-race, non-athlete peers. Findings imply that Black and White student-athletes likely face different campus experiences, wherein student-athlete status may pose risks of prejudiced peer evaluations and a potentially hostile campus climate for Black students.

AB  - Literature in policing has mostly overlooked the antecedents of prejudice, especially those who choose a police career. Such a choice is important given the results of prejudice that might cause police misconduct toward regular migrants, irregular migrants, and refugees. This study aims to examine the factors that explain prejudice among police cadets toward other ethnic groups. This study's data come from a survey of 725 police cadets in three police vocational schools in Turkey. We employed structural equation modeling to examine the antecedents of prejudice toward foreigners within the framework of intergroup threat theory. More specifically, in this study, we included factors such as anomie, authoritarianism, and nationalism and participants' symbolic and realistic threat perceptions in shaping prejudice toward foreigners. The findings suggest that police cadets' realistic threat perception was the most salient antecedent of prejudice toward foreigners.

AB  - Background: Research about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its epidemiology and socio-economic impact on populations worldwide has gained attention. However, there is dearth of empirical knowledge in low-and middle income settings about the pandemic's impact on survivors, particularly the tension of their everyday life arising from the experiences and consequences of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion, and how they cope with these behavioral adversities. Methods: Realist qualitative approach drawing data from people clinically diagnosed positive of COVID-19, admitted into therapy in a designated treatment facility, and subsequently recovered and discharged for or without follow-up domiciliary care. In-depth interviews were conducted by maintaining a code book for identifying and documenting thematic categories in a progression leading to thematic saturation with 45 participants. Data were transcribed and coded deductively for broad themes at the start before systematically nesting emerging themes into the broad ones with the aid of NVivo 12 software. Results: Everyday lived experiences of the participants were disrupted with acts of indirect stigmatization (against relatives and family members), direct stigmatization (labeling, prejudices and stereotyping), barriers to realizing full social life and discriminatory behaviors across socio-ecological structures (workplace, community, family, and social institutions). These behavioral adversities were associated with self-reported poor health, anxiety and psychological disorders, and frustrations among others. Consequently, supplicatory prayers, societal and organizational withdrawal, aggressive behaviors, supportive counseling, and self-assertive behaviors were adopted to cope and modify the adverse behaviors driven by misinformation and fearful perceptions of the COVID-19 and its contagious proportions. Conclusion: In the face of the analysis, social campaigns and dissemination of toolkits that can trigger behavior change and responsible behaviors toward COVID-19 survivors are proposed to be implemented by health stakeholders, policy and decision makers in partnership with social influencers, the media, and telecoms.

AB  - Viral influence of consumer reviews can change the strategic intent of co-branding relationships between minority entrepreneurial startups and established corporations. When social justice positioning is involved, the intent is often to support minority businesses. We acknowledge this strategy as social justice branding. However, such alliances can trigger vitriolic responses. This backlash is an expression of free speech, and social media provides an obscure facilitative environment. The challenges of social justice branding are complex. We examine consumer online reviews of The Honey Pot and Target Corporation partnership, to understand the implications of social justice branding in practice. Using Leximancer analysis, we find that social justice branding elicits multiple emotions that empower action. Some consumers accepted the collaboration while others resisted. Analyzing the basis of the resistance revealed some consumers expressed racist and shameful behaviors displaying disagreement. Backlash reflected willful ignorance releasing pent up prejudices and disseminating viral-like negative information as weapons of retaliation against brands and marginalized communities. We contribute a conceptual model integrating theoretical frames of social justice, social marketing, brand activism and free speech elucidating the impact of consumer response to social justice branding. The findings and model add a lens to further explore race in the marketplace.

Predictive validity of the SSDO was almost as high as that of the SSD6; internal reliability, however, was considerably lower. Further, as hypothesized, individuals exhibiting lower levels of SDO, as assessed by both SDO6 and SSDO, exhibit lower levels of speciesism as well as higher levels of empathic concern. In addition, as hypothesized, ethical vegans, as compared to carnists, display lower levels of SDO and speciesism, and higher levels of empathic concern.

AB  - This study examined prosocial bystander behavior in an online ball-throwing game (Cyberball), toward the exclusion of immigrants and nonimmigrant peers within intergroup and intragroup contexts. Participants were British children (8- to 10-year-olds) and adolescents (13- to 15-year-olds. N = 292; female N = 144). They were an ethnically diverse low-to-middle SES sample from a South Asian, White, Black, or mixed ethnic background. Participants played the game and witnessed a victim being excluded by peers. The victim's and excluders' group membership and status were highlighted in a prototypical (i.e., majority status peers excluding a minority status victim) or nonprototypical (i.e., minority status peers excluding a majority status victim) intergroup context. In intragroup contexts exclusion involved peers from the same group (i.e., majority status peers excluding a majority status victim or minority status peers excluding a minority status victim). Prosocial bystander behavior and "verbal" reactions to the exclusion were measured. Adolescents showed more prosocial bystander behavior than children when it was an intergroup context but not when it was an intragroup context. Only adolescents showed more prosocial bystander behavior when the intergroup context was prototypical compared to nonprototypical. Verbal reactions were related to prosocial bystander behavior and, with age, individuals increasingly verbally challenged the exclusion and the motivation behind it. The findings support the Social Reasoning Developmental (SRD) approach to social exclusion by showing that from late childhood into midadolescence bystander behavior is increasingly related to group membership and group status of the excluders and victim.

AB  - Before the twentieth century, debates about slavery, segregation and racial inequality in the United States were often bound up with the meanings of racial 'prejudice'. In this article, Alexander suggests that the concept was often double-edged: deployed both against racial inequality and oppression, but also to maintain it. Since the end of the eighteenth century, abolitionists and other advocates of racial equality charged that their opponents were possessed by irrational prejudice that they sought to stamp out through a variety of means. In another line of argument, however, racial prejudice was natural or, at least, so deeply rooted from centuries of slavery as to be basically ineradicable. This meant that attempts to abolish slavery and establish an egalitarian, multiracial society were forever doomed to failure. Some people drew the lesson from this conception of prejudice that it might be best to remove Blacks from American soil altogether by colonizing them elsewhere, particularly in West Africa. Abolitionists, however, did not accept the idea that racial prejudice was indestructible and thought it could be removed through greater education. After the Civil War, with the end of slavery, defenders of segregation drew on similar arguments, suggesting that, if there were prejudices between the races, these resulted from the wisdom of the ages and should be respected, even as supporters of racial equality sought to show that these prejudices need not be permanent. Alexander's article therefore explores the complex and sometimes counter-intuitive uses of the concept of racial 'prejudice' from the late eighteenth century up until the subsequent development of the Jim Crow segregation regime in the late nineteenth century.

AB  - Two experimental studies were conducted to replicate the effect found by Baus et al. where language as a marker of social categories affected recognition of faces in an old/new paradigm. In Study 1, we presented faces along with utterances in Swedish and in English to native Swedish speakers. Faces presented along with Swedish utterances were not recognized better than faces presented along with English utterances. In Study 2, we used another language pair and presented faces along with utterances in Swedish and in Spanish to native Swedish speakers. Faces presented along with Swedish utterances were recognized better than faces presented along with Spanish utterances. Our results suggest that language functions as a marker of social categories and that, similarly to other markers of social categories, it can be modulated by various factors and is not unconditional.

AB  - Taking as a context the reality of migration of Latinos to Europe and its repercussions in the educational field, a pedagogical practice carried out in the Master for Teachers in training at the University of Seville, Spain, is described and analyzed. Future teachers of Spanish Language and Literature work on the subject of prejudices toward Latinos through a critical pedagogy whose main materials are literature and the decolonial perspective. To this end, classroom practices are described and analyzed. The pedagogical design is characterized by the following objectives: (1) to recognize and identify our prejudices toward others, (2) to recognize the voice of others in their specificity, and (3) to transcend this specificity and recognize ourselves in the other. In the qualitative analysis of the didactic intervention, the 72 students involved recognize highly positive involvement in the objectives of the activities; moreover, the students' accounts show the recognition of a colonial hegemonic vision and the revision of prejudices toward the other. This framework takes students further by adopting a relationship of critical engagement with the way they approach Hispanic-American language and literature and its impact on the integration of their potential immigrant students in the classroom.

AB  - Previous research often suggests that people who endorse more essentialist beliefs about social groups are also likely to show increased prejudice towards members of these social groups, and there is even some evidence to suggest that essentialism may lead to prejudice and stereotyping. However, there are several notable exceptions to this pattern in that, for certain social groups (e.g., gay men and lesbians), higher essentialism is actually related to lower prejudice. The current studies further explored the relationship between essentialism and prejudice by examining a novel type of essentialism-transgender essentialism (i.e., essentializing transgender identity), and its relationship to prejudice towards transgender people. Study 1 (N = 248) tested the viability of transgender essentialism as a construct and examined the association between transgender essentialism and transprejudice, while Studies 2a (N = 315), 2b (N = 343), 3a (N = 310), and 3b (N = 204) tested two casual pathways to explain this relationship. The results consistently showed that the more that people endorse transgender essentialist beliefs, the warmer their feelings towards trans people (relative to cis people) were, echoing past research showing a similar relationship between essentialism and prejudice towards sexual minorities. However, the manipulations of both essentialism (Studies 2a and 2b) and prejudice (Studies 3a and 3b) were largely unsuccessful at changing the desired construct, meaning we were unable to provide direct causal tests. The one exception was a successful manipulation of the universality of trans experiences, but even here this resulted in no change in prejudice. The primary contribution of this work is in robustly demonstrating that greater transgender essentialism is associated with transprejudice.

AB  - With the global #Metoo movement yet to arrive in Nigeria, Jude Dibia's Unbridled reflects an emblematic moment for the underrepresented to occupy their stories and make their voices heard. The study analyzes patriarchy's complicated relationship with the Nigerian girl child, significantly reviewing the inherent prejudices in patriarchy's power hierarchies and how radical narratives explore taboo topics like incest and sexual violence. Contextualizing the concepts of hypersexualization and implicit bias to put in perspective how women, expected to be the gatekeepers of sex, are forced to navigate competing allegiances while remaining submissive and voiceless, the article probes the struggles of sexual victims and how hierarchies in a patriarchal society exacerbate their affliction through a culture of silence. Arguing that Dibia's Unbridled confronts the narrative of silence in Nigerian fiction, the article explores ways the author empowers gender by challenging social values and traditional gender roles, underscoring gender dynamics and the problematic nature of prevalent bias against the feminine gender in Nigeria.

AB  - Research shows that nonoffending mothers are frequently held at fault for child sexual abuse (CSA), by both society and professionals, with contradictory explanations for the fault. For example, the same maternal characteristic can be used to assign blame or alleviate blame (i.e., single mothers have been held more at fault for their child's CSA and less at fault). The purpose of this study was to assess a theoretically based model that could account for these different reasons. We tested the stereotype content model (SCM), which examines the content of stereotypes toward target groups, by focusing on perceptions of that group's levels of warmth and competence. We sampled 136 undergraduate participants who read a vignette describing CSA, and completed the SCM with the mother of the victim as the target, and measures of mother fault. Our results showed that participants fell into three SCM groups of mother fault: (a) Moderate Contemptuous Prejudice (i.e., low competence, low warmth); (b) Admiration (i.e., moderate competence, high warmth); and (c) Very Contemptuous Prejudice (i.e., very low competence, very low warmth). Each cluster also held unique emotions toward the mother, as predicted by the SCM. Results further showed that assigned levels of fault were significant, but that fault did not vary by SCM group, lending support to the ideas that the SCM can be applied to this group and that different participants assign fault for different reasons.

AB  - Self- compassion means that individual's trying to understand oneself without prejudice, and being sensitive and kind instead of being judgemental and critical. The aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of self-compassion in the relationship between perceived parental acceptance and psychological resilience in emerging adults. The study also examined whether gender differ in terms of the variables of parental acceptance, self-compassion and psychological resilience. The study group consisted of 545 university students who were studying in a state university and who were reached with stratified sampling method. The Adult Parental Acceptance-Rejection Scale, the Self-Compassion Scale and the Ego-Resilience Scale were used. Correlation analysis, path analysis, Multivariate Hotelling T-2 test were applied in the analysis of data. As a result of the study, self-compassion was found to have "full mediating" role in the relationship of perceived maternal acceptance and paternal acceptance with psychological resilience. In addition, perceived parental acceptance and psychological resilience were found to show significant differences in terms of gender. Warmth and acceptance centred parent-child relationship can be considered as a protective factor that can increase the ability to overcome challenging life events by supporting the development of self-compassion.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound health and social impacts. COVID-19 also affords opportunities to study the emergence of prejudice as a factor in taking protective actions. This study investigated the association of COVID-19 concerns, prejudicial beliefs, and personal actions that involve life disruptions among people not living with and people living with HIV. 338 Black/African American men not living with HIV who reported male sex partners and 148 Black/African American men living with HIV who reported male sex partners completed a confidential survey that measured COVID-19 concern, COVID-19 prejudice, and personal action and institutionally imposed COVID19 disruptions. Participants reported having experienced multiple social and healthcare disruptions stemming from COVID-19, including reductions in social contacts, canceling medical appointments, and inability to access medications. Mediation analyses demonstrated that COVID-19 concerns and COVID-19 prejudice were associated with personal action disruptions, indicating that these social processes are important for understanding how individuals modified their lives in response to COVID-19. It is imperative that public health efforts combat COVID-19 prejudice as these beliefs undermine investments in developing healthcare infrastructure to address COVID-19 prevention.

AB  - The object of the study is social relations regarding the prejudicial inquiry of smuggling narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, their analogs or precursors. It has been found that there are scholars who choose different definitions for interpreting the nature of the proof, but are unanimous about the role of this process in proving a person's guilt and choosing an adequate punishment.
   The authors use a set of scientific methods of modern epistemology as well as comparative, special legal, logical and other methods.
   We propose to analyze all the circumstances that are subject to proof during the prejudicial inquiry of smuggling of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, their analogs, or precursors. In this paper must identify the general grounds that must be proved in each crime and the specific circumstances that are important to prove only in the case of smuggling narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, their analogs, or precursors.
   The conclusion is made about the importance of proper procedural support of criminal prosecution of persons who have committed a crime under Article 305 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Therefore, we propose to include in the subject of evidence for the prejudicial inquiry.

AB  - Political inclusion is when someone receives a fair chance to voice one's opinions in a discussion of political topics with political outgroup members. In three preregistered studies (total n = 799), we test if political inclusion reduces or increases prejudice toward the political outgroup using either an imagined scenario (Study 1) or an experience in an ostensible online political discussion (Studies 2 & 3). Across all studies, participants who were politically included by political outgroup members reported reduced prejudice toward their political outgroup compared to participants in a neutral control condition (Cohen's ds ranging from -0.50 to -0.27). Study 3 showed that this effect extends to non-political inclusion. The effects of political and non-political inclusion were mediated by perceptions of the political outgroup as fairer and less dissimilar in their worldviews. Our results indicate that inclusive political and non-political discussions reduce political prejudice.

AB  - Black and Latina women are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Despite existing research linking social networks and HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high-risk populations, little research has examined how ethnic/racial minority women's social networks shape HIV prevention and intervention targets. Using interviews with a sample of 165 predominantly Black and Latina-identifying women from a small city in the Western U.S., this research examines the relationship between egocentric network characteristics and HIV knowledge, attitudes, and testing history. Results reveal that network characteristics play a significant role in shaping HIV-related knowledge, prejudice, and testing intention but not HIV testing history. Individual-level factors like homelessness and perceptions of testing barriers are more salient for explaining testing behaviors than network characteristics. Intervention efforts to improve knowledge and reduce prejudice among Black and Latina women may benefit from mobilizing network ties.

AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the impact of the opioid overdose epidemic on the social lives of people suffering from chronic pain, focusing on interactions within their personal and professional circles. The study was based on 22 in-depth interviews with people living with chronic pain in Canada. Using thematic analysis, we documented three main impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic: (a) increased worries of people in pain and their families regarding the dangers of opioids; (b) prejudices, stigma, and discrimination faced during conversations about opioids; and (c) stigma management attempts, which include self-advocacy and concealment of opioid use. This study represents important knowledge advancement on how people manage stigma and communicate about chronic disease during everyday life interactions. By showing negative effects of the epidemic's media coverage on the social experiences of people with chronic pain, we underscore needs for destigmatizing approaches in public communication regarding opioids.

AB  - This study seeks to advance how intergroup dynamics can help us better understand the relations between humans and robots. Intergroup contact theory states that negative feelings toward an outgroup can be reduced through controlled intergroup contact. This study tests this theory by having study participants interact with either a human (member of the ingroup) or large humanoid robot (member of an outgroup) and measuring changes in social distance before and after the interaction. The findings suggest that robotkind is a distinct social group separate from humankind and as predicted by intergroup contact theory, exposure to a specific robot can override held prejudices against robots as a social group.

This paper also examines racist ideologies in North America and how they are woven into the institutions and interpersonal relationships one can encounter. Traumas that are examined for the purposes of this paper are collective traumas such as Drapetomania, Tuskegee experiment/study, police brutality and the lynch laws. The use of some props in the dance/movement therapy field is examined through the lens of trauma-informed social justice care to prevent harm. There will be a theoretical model for clinicians to use to track their bias, assumptions, power, privilege, and prejudice.
   Please note that traumas will be discussed in this paper, take care of yourself, these topics can be difficult to read about and revisit.

AB  - Objective: To explore factors associated with social discrimination against users of health services regarding dental aesthetic conditions.
   Methods: Based on a Brazilian National Survey, multivariate Poisson regressions with robust variance were used to explore the association of outcome discrimination related to different motivations in health services and exposure to sociodemographic and dental variables. Effect modification by complete prosthesis wearing was assessed.
   Results: Among the 60,200 people interviewed, 11.5% reported being discriminated against in health services. For women, a higher prevalence of discrimination was found among those in the age group of 30-44 years. For both sexes, discrimination was associated with black and brown skin color. Regarding dental characteristics, the higher the tooth loss was, the higher the prevalence of discrimination; however, complete prosthesis wearing presented as a protective factor. Social discrimination was the major motivation for reported discrimination and presented higher prevalence in edentulous individuals who did not wear prosthesis.
   Conclusion: Dental loss may lead to self-reported discrimination in health care services. The prevalence of discrimination increases when tooth loss increases, and the major reason associated is social discrimination.

AB  - Conversations about digital inequality in education often revolve around access to technology. However, research into youth culture has shown that many Black and Latinx teens are able to access technology and have developed the same digital skills as their white peers. Social scientist Matt Rafalow observed three California middle schools where students had similar levels of access to digital technologies despite being from different racial and class backgrounds and found that teachers perceived students' technological abilities differently. Wealthy white students' digital play was seen as essential to learning, while Asian American and Latinx students' skills were seen as either a threat to their learning or irrelevant to it. Addressing digital inequality will require schools to also address the racial and class prejudice that leads teachers to view students' abilities differently.

AB  - Recent studies have indicated a positive association between patriotism and environmentalism; however, the correlation between them has not yet been quantitatively verified. Additionally, differences in "good"versus "blind" patriotism have been ignored in environmental behavior studies; thus, theoretical concepts related to their effects on environmentalism have not been empirically tested. The present study aims to reveal the effects of good patriotism and social consideration on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and the mediating effect of social consideration on the relationship between patriotism and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, while removing national or political prejudice or ideology from the measurement of patriotism. Data collected using a self-report questionnaire were analyzed for Chinese university students and workers. Results of multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis of five pro-environmental attitudes/behaviors estimation models showed that patriotism was correlated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and this correlation was completely mediated by individual social consideration, which was strongly and positively correlated with both patriotism and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Our findings show that patriotism encourages people to focus on societal structures and environmental problems. The effect of good patriotism on individual pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors is clearly different from that of blind nationalism, as shown in previous literature. The present study highlights implications for future policy-making and education on patriotism and environmentalism in China.

AB  - Online and social media platforms employ automated recognition methods to presume user preferences, sensitive attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and opinions. These opaque methods can predict behaviors for marketing purposes and influence behavior for profit, serving attention economics but also reinforcing existing biases such as gender stereotyping. Although two international human rights treaties include explicit obligations relating to harmful and wrongful stereotyping, these stereotypes persist online and offline. By identifying how inferential analytics may reinforce gender stereotyping and affect marginalized communities, opportunities for addressing these concerns and thereby increasing privacy, diversity, and inclusion online can be explored. This is important because misgendering reinforces gender stereotypes, accentuates gender binarism, undermines privacy and autonomy, and may cause feelings of rejection, impacting people?s self-esteem, confidence, and authenticity. In turn, this may increase social stigmatization. This study brings into view concerns of discrimination and exacerbation of existing biases that online platforms continue to replicate and that literature starts to highlight. The implications of misgendering on Twitter are investigated to illustrate the impact of algorithmic bias on inadvertent privacy violations and reinforcement of social prejudices of gender through a multidisciplinary perspective, including legal, computer science, and critical feminist media-studies viewpoints. An online pilot survey was conducted to better understand how accurate Twitter?s gender inferences of its users? gender identities are. This served as a basis for exploring the implications of this social media practice.

AB  - Background: Globally, COVID-19 has caused panic, fear, depression, and anxiety, especially in the absence of knowledge regarding the causes and complications of the disease, along with its high rates of morbidity and mortality. This bundle of negative emotions may trigger acts of prejudice, discrimination, negative social behaviors, and stigmatization.
   Aim: To examine general mental health and its impact on the social stigma associated with COVID-19 among general population in Egypt.
   Methodology: The study was conducted using an online cross-sectional survey. A 'snowball' sampling was used to recruit 501 participants. This study utilized three tools, including Socio-demographic Data Sheet, General Health Questionnaire, and COVID-19 related Social Stigma Scale.
   Results: The study confirms a highly statistically significant direct relationship between mental health problems and social stigma: specifically, mental health significantly impacted social stigma toward COVID-19. Besides, there is a highly statistically significant inverse relationship between social stigma and educational level. However, unlike other research studies, this study shows that social stigma associated with the COVID-19 health crisis seems entirely uncommon in Egypt.
   Conclusion: Overall, the study subjects reported having no mental health problems during COVID-19 and have no stigma towards COVID-19. Except for the timing of data collection, these unexpected findings might be explained by the fact that most of the studied sample (59.1%) reported having a close family member infected by COVID-19.

For this purpose, I surveyed 1,014 immigrants, including 800 participants and 214 nonparticipants of the KIIP; among these individuals, 46.1 % had experienced discrimination. There were several reasons they felt they had been discriminated against; general prejudice against immigrants in South Korea and lack of Korean language ability were the most common. The immigrants who participated in KIIP included several groups: visiting relatives, those who had moved to be with their families, immigrants living in Seoul, Vietnamese people, non-Korean spouses, longer-term non-Korean residents, and non-Han Chinese individuals. Those immigrants who participated in KIIP showed a high degree of adaptability to Korean culture. Korean language proficiency, a key output of KIIP, was the most important factor in improving immigrants? cultural adaptation, sense of societal belonging, and economic conditions.

AB  - China is widely considered a world leader in e-commerce. In recent years, e-commerce in China has made significant progress and gone through rounds after rounds of innovations. Technological advancements have enabled the integration of online and offline channels, allowing consumers to choose their preferred shopping channel. Thus, competition and cooperation between online and offline channels have become important issues. Drawing on confirmation bias theory and the unique cultural lens (low uncertainty avoidance and a high level of cynicism) that exists in China, we conceptualize online prejudice and propose a model to analyse how it affects channel selection. A scenario-based survey, along with an explorative pre-study, was conducted to test our hypotheses. The results showed that prejudice toward the online channel does exist in China. Further, this online prejudice mediates the relationship between perceived uncertainty and channel selection. That is, uncertainty can induce consumers' online prejudice, which in turn predicts their channel selection behaviour. Furthermore, the mediating effect of online prejudice is contingent upon product type (i.e., experience products vs. search products).

AB  - Aim. The reality genre has gained much popularity in the last few years across the globe. In India too, this genre has reportedly surpassed other genres in recognition and acceptance. Although its format and content provoke controversies at both social and academic level, its mass appeal is constantly increasing. The study examines gender and language issues in Indian reality show Bigg Boss. While keeping in view the format and claims of the genre, the study observes how the housemates negotiate with their real selves and shape their language practices under thorough surveillance. The influ- ence of neoliberalism on the society, culture and identity has been very much discussed: the paper attempts to highlight how this transition in gender identity is depicted in a show involving non-actors and common people. Concept. For the purpose of the study, scripted transcription of Bigg Boss (Season 11) has been used, wherein all the episodes have been carefully watched, and detailed notes were prepared for the analysis. Housemates' language practice, voice pattern and preference of words and statements have been observed. Results and conclusion. The study finds that game reality show Bigg Boss substantially adheres to social stereotypes and standards and while doing so, it also imitates the language practice prevalent everywhere. The active participation of women in the show is visible; however, while exhibiting their true self, sometimes gender prejudice embedded deep inside also comes out, which is particularly frequent in the case of men. The study concludes that as a globally acclaimed genre, reality show, like other genres, is very much commercialised and consumer oriented. Originality. A number of studies related to reality shows have been conducted, but in Indian context, this genre has been inadequately explored. Also, it is very difficult to find studies focusing on any specific season of an Indian reality show, so the present study might be considered one of the primary works on this subject, which aims at making some significant academic contribution related to this genre.

AB  - The study deals with linguistic prejudices of citizens of the two main Russian cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, toward speakers of foreign languages. It aims to reveal possible recent changes in the language ideology dominating Russian society. Monolingual and linguistically normative orientations rooted in the Soviet ideological approach are being challenged nowadays by global processes of migration and cultural diversification, which influence the everyday reality of Russian megalopolises. The research is based on the analysis of two sets of data: (1) meta-discourse on language attitudes derived from interviews with labor migrants and native Russian speakers in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and posts and comments on issues of language, migration, and linguistic landscapes, collected from websites and social media and (2) linguistic landscape data collected in 2016-2019, mainly in St. Petersburg, which reflect recent changes in attitude toward linguistic diversity in public space. These data show, on the one hand, that most city dwellers still relate to monolingual speech norms and try to implement control over public space; on the other hand, that the tolerance toward multilingual communication has been increasing over the years. The study suggests that these "first cracks" in monolinguals facades of Russian cities could eventually lead to the establishing of a less rigid language regime.

AB  - National and civil identity base on the mass historical consciousness, which in its turn is formed partly by the means of teaching history at schools. So school-books are an important instrument of the state-power and academic society used to influence the development of historical memory and national consciousness. In the course of time authors of school books reorient from one events and figures to some other, shift accents, estimates and interpretations. The figure of M. V. Lomonosov stays constant in the course of decades. His significance and positive estimate seem not to change. However we cannot say that the image really does not change at all. The transformations of the great Russian scientist on the pages of school books are under consideration in this article. The author differentiates the constant consistent of the narratives, which stay the same in course of many decades; accent shifts, changes in fact choice and interpretations. The main base of the research is the school books for history and literature; sciences, physics and chemistry books are used too. The analysis of school-books leads the author of current research to the following conclusions. The story of childhood and youth of M. V. Lomonosov, the image of encyclopedist and enlightener, the patriotic motive slightly changed throughout the period under consideration. The changing motives are: estimate of the port's talent, role in Moscow university foundation, the image of Elisabeth's magnate and the image of pious Christian / church and religious prejudice antagonist.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Disturbances that hinder community development affect social capital. I refer to such disturbances as social cancer. This article aims at explaining the existence of social cancers, their typologies, and implications for Sea Indigenous People's community development through economic activities.
   Methodology: This exploratory case study involved 12 Sea Indigenous People in Johor, Malaysia. Data obtained through interviews were analysed using a thematic approach.
   Findings: The findings revealed four types of social cancer in the community's economic activities: 1) jealousy, 2) prejudice, 3) slander, and 4) defamation. Those social cancers had direct impacts on community development, specifically forming sabotage actions, negligence in using community capital, reducing community cohesiveness, causing a decline in the production of social innovation, and the existence of a hanging community and the death of the community.
   Contributions: This study calls for a self-realisation mechanism to be introduced to community members so that their capacity for social capital can be developed to overcome the social cancer.

AB  - This study, aiming to reveal the experiences of prospective social studies teachers on project-based values education, was carried out in phenomenological design, which is one of the qualitative research designs. The study group consisted of 37 second-year students who received values education as an elective course in the social studies teaching department of a public university and who carried out projects for the values that they determined within the scope of the course. To create a project, the prospective teachers chose values such as equality, responsibility, sensitivity (cultural heritage), helpfulness, attaching importance to being healthy, patriotism, and savings. They implemented their projects on these values to the groups that they found appropriate. At the end of the process, a semi-structured interview form was used as data collection tool to reveal the participants' experiences of project-based values teaching. Descriptive analysis and content analysis were used to analyze the study data. As a result of the study, we concluded that the participants selected the values for their projects for reasons such as "raising awareness on the related values, embodying abstract values, eliminating prejudices, emphasizing the importance of cooperation in society". Project-based values education was observed to provide the participants with many advantages such as "provision of experience both for values education and the teaching profession, project planning and conduction, improving communication skills, developing a sense of spirituality."

AB  - The Indra Congress is a global network of community artists, cultural practitioners and educators. An alternative mediator of arts and culture for intra- and inter-personal social change, it provides a safe space for youth to communicate social issues. The network actively participates in a biannual programme where representatives of the different Indra hubs come together in a face-to-face congress. The art-based approach challenges stereotypes, prejudices, inequalities and descriptive myths in order to build bridges, to promote empathy and to help develop positive relationships. In this article a reflection on Indra practise and the use of arts for social change is related to critical questions and the on-going discussions about cultural literacy. The analysis relates to the analogy upon which the Indra Congress draws its practice namely that of the description of the god Indra's net and intersecting points. It starts with an experiential analysis of the Pathways, Indra Congress event and its host, ARROWSA. The article further analyses how themes of diversity and local and personal narratives intersect with critical cultural diversity. As such, it promotes that the Congress embodies a practice of cultural literacies, that promotes the sharing of differences and commonalities through collaboration in the arts and culture.

AB  - Centring on the imaginary, this article examines the multi-layered interactions between music, collective consciousness and social actions in mainland China. I note that behind the prejudice against 'floating' migrants and a collective ignorance of their suffering lies the Chinese imaginary, or a set of common-sense understandings and expectations based on normative and emotionally appealing images. I argue that the power of Chinese propaganda music can be understood as deriving from its ability to supply and conjure up such images, which serve the state's evolving strategic needs and promote the three fundamental beliefs by (re)interpreting past or fictional actions and their outcomes. Naturally growing within certain 'moulds', Chinese musicians do not challenge these images in public performances, but some of them are positioned as musical rebels to maintain the illusion of autonomy.

AB  - Objective To investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization. Design A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Results Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. Conclusions Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.

AB  - As a form of leisure, Pride events offer LGBTQI+ people a chance to gain visibility, advocate for their rights, and construct and express their identity. The benefits such events offer are particularly crucial within rural communities, often perceived to be heteronormative spaces that may exhibit greater levels of prejudice against sexually and gender-diverse individuals. This paper examines the perceived social impacts Pride events can have within a rural community by studying an inaugural Pride event hosted in the Australian township of Wagga Wagga. Informed by an interpretivist approach and using a mix of participant observation and semi-structured interviews, the study found the event had three key outcomes. First, the event challenged assumptions about how acceptance of diverse sexualities and gender identities were in the town. Second, it appeared to help build community acceptance by providing a public space/time for LGBTQI+ individuals to be acknowledged as legitimate citizens. Finally, it contributed to identity construction and created opportunities for connection with other LGBTQI+ residents and the rural community more broadly.

AB  - There is an achievement gap between students of different ethnic groups. An important alterable contributor to academic achievement is teacher expectations-the beliefs teachers hold about their students' academic capabilities. Teacher expectations affect students' academic performance-high expectations are associated with higher academic performance and low expectations are associated with lower academic performance. Using a survey, we collected data from 140 teachers at a teacher conference in March 2017. In addition to demographic questions, the survey had two scales that gathered information about teacher expectations and behaviours. Differential item functioning analyses showed that teachers had higher expectations for Asian Canadian students and lower expectations for Indigenous students compared with European Canadian students. Explanatory item response modeling showed teachers with six or more years of teaching experience, and teachers above 35 years old, had higher expectations for their students. Teachers did not reportbehavingdifferently towards different groups of students. Therefore, there appears to be a discrepancy between teacher expectations and their reported behaviours toward students from various ethnic groups. Implications for future research include exploring if reported behaviours can be observed in the classroom. In addition, there may be a need to modify teacher expectations within teacher education programs.

AB  - The Brazilian University for International Integration of the Afro-Brazilian Lusophony (UNILAB) was created to host students from Portuguese-speaking Africa and Brazil. In this article, we look at the aims and objectives of UNILAB, which include the social integration of these students at the university. We present results from interviews conducted at UNILAB in 2018 with 63 international and domestic students. Analysis of this material shows that despite acknowledgement of the value of internationalisation at UNILAB, the social integration level of Portuguese-speaking students from outside Brazil at the university is characteristically weak among the interviewees, a situation they attribute to a lack of suitable preparation for staff at the host institution and prejudice towards African students in the local community. We consider what these findings mean for the future of UNILAB and the development of Global South-South student migration.

AB  - The development of social gerontology has led to the emergence of its own terminology and conceptual armoury. 'Ageism' has been a key concept in articulating the mission of gerontology and was deliberately intended to act as an equivalent to the concepts of racism and sexism. As a term, it has established itself as a lodestone for thinking about the de-valued and residualised social status of older people in contemporary society. Given this background, ageism has often been used to describe an overarching ideology that operates in society to the detriment of older people and which in large part explains their economic, social and cultural marginality. This paper critiques this approach and suggests an alternative based upon the idea of the social imaginary of the fourth age. It argues that not only is the idea of ageism too totalising and contradictory but that it fails to address key aspects of the corporeality of old age. Adopting the idea of a social imaginary offers a more nuanced theoretical approach to the tensions that are present in later life without reducing them to a single external cause or explanation. In so doing, this leaves the term free to serve, in a purely descriptive manner, as a marker of prejudice.

AB  - Prior evidence suggests that White participants who repeatedly approach images of Black people and avoid images of White people can exhibit a reduction in implicit racial bias (Kawakami. Phills, Steele, & Dovidio. 2007). In contrast, a recent study by Van Dessel, De Houwer, Gast. and Smith (2015) showed that mere instructions to perform approach-avoidance training in an upcoming phase produces a similar change in implicit evaluations of unfamiliar but not familiar social groups. We report 4 experiments that examined the replicability and generalizability of these findings for well-known social groups. Experiment 1 was a replication of the study by Kawakami et al. (2007) in a different domain (i.e., Flemish students' bias toward Turkish people) showing relatively weak evidence for small approach-avoidance training effects on implicit evaluations and explicit liking ratings. Experiment 2 replicated the finding of Van Dessel et al. (2015) that approach-avoidance instructions do not influence implicit evaluations of social out-groups and found no instruction effects even when participants first completed training with nonsocial stimuli. Experiment 3 established the presence of a small approach-avoidance training effect on implicit (but not explicit evaluations) in a large online sample. Experiment 4 directly compared approach-avoidance training and instruction effects, corroborating (a) the effect of training on implicit evaluations which was both small and subject to boundary conditions and (b) the absence of such an effect of instructions. There were again no effects on explicit evaluations. Whereas the current findings provide supportive evidence for training-based approach-avoidance effects (on Implicit Association Test [IAT] scores: meta-analytic effect size current experiments: d = 0.18. Bayes Factor = 65.22; current and prior experiments: d = 0.23, Bayes Factor = 4404.42) and evidence for the absence of instruction-based effects (Bayes Factors < 0.19), they also illustrate that there is still much uncertainty regarding the boundary conditions of these effects and the underlying mental processes.

AB  - This paper investigates the effectiveness of a small experimental pilot addressed to foreign adolescents with low language skills and high dropout risk in lower secondary school in Turin, North-West Italy. The intervention aims at reducing Early School Leaving while supporting standard school curricula. In order to facilitate students' re-motivation and their attachment to the school environment, the pilot proposes an original VET approach that alternates standard school activities to innovative vocational training. In particular, treated students substitute 290 h VET courses for 10 standard school weeks along a scholastic year. First of all, the analysis aims at evaluating effects on Early School Leaving. Then, since the pilot requires a long period in VET away from school, the study evaluates effects on educational outcomes. Oltre I Muri is a very small pilot experiment, involving seven schools and offering 11 VET positions to migrant students. We investigated the effectiveness of the program by an experimental counterfactual approach: participants have been randomly assigned to a treated and a control group with similar characteristics. They are adolescent migrants attending the 2nd year of lower secondary school and manifesting very high drop-out risk. Treated students attend the alternating VET/school pilot, while control students attend standard school classes. Randomization inference allows assessing average treatment effects, but the very small sample size does not guarantee statistical significance at standard levels. Results anyhow suggests some effectiveness of the project in contrasting Early School Leaving. In particular, while some non-treated students dropped out from school during the pilot, all treated students regularly completed their scholastic year. This can be interpreted as a 20% increase in school attendance, with an 80% confidence level assessed by Montecarlo randomization. Finally, extreme value bound techniques applied to test scores suggest that treated students do not prejudice their learning by attending VET instead of standard school classes during the pilot. On the contrary, their school attachment is reinforced.

AB  - Intellectual humility has attracted attention in both philosophy and psychology. Philosophers have clarified the nature of intellectual humility as an epistemic virtue; and psychologists have developed scales for measuring people's intellectual humility. Much less attention has been paid to the potential effects of intellectual humility on people's negative attitudes and to its relationship with prejudice-based epistemic vices. Here we fill these gaps by focusing on the relationship between intellectual humility and prejudice. To clarify this relationship, we conducted four empirical studies. The results of these studies show three things. First, people are systematically prejudiced towards members of groups perceived as dissimilar. Second, intellectual humility weakens the association between perceived dissimilarity and prejudice. Third, more intellectual humility is associated withmoreprejudice overall. We show that this apparently paradoxical pattern of results is consistent with the idea that it is both psychologically and rationally plausible that one person is at the same time intellectually humble, epistemically virtuous and strongly prejudiced.

AB  - Laypersons differentiate between two confrontations styles, varying in communication style, perceived motive, and typical context: call-outs (typically public, non-accommodating language, and self-promoting confronter) and call-ins (typically private, accommodating language, and education-focused confronter). Popular press espouses a general preference for call-ins relative to call-outs, but no empirical work has addressed perceptions of these confrontation styles. To investigate the presumed efficacy of these styles, we modelled communicative differences with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT), which explores the strategies individuals use to modulate communicative differences with interaction partners. The present studies examined third-party perceptions of confronter motive and likely outcomes between call-in and call-out styles (Study 1) and between typical private and atypical public styles (Study 2) about an anti-Black comment. We examined responses of participants who imagined themselves taking part in public vs. private call-in and call-out confrontations (Study 3). Results showed that these styles are seen as similarly effective in terms of target compliance and internalization, but as operating through different mechanisms. Specifically, call-in styles facilitated positive inferences of motive, which fostered expectations of positive confrontation outcomes. Additionally, the effects of communication style superseded the impact of context. Results have implications for strategies allies can use to facilitate effective, educational confrontations of prejudice.

AB  - The group decision method is an important branch in the decision problems. A critical issue in group decision methods is how to determine the weights of the group members. To reduce the possible prejudice due to the social influences, we propose a novel group decision method under social influences based on information entropy. Firstly, the interaction degrees between the group members under social influences are determined. Secondly, the entropy of each expert from the decision group is computed. Then, according to the entropy, the weights of the experts can be determined. Finally, based on the evaluation matrix, the weighted values of the alternatives can be obtained and the alternatives are ranked. The decision steps are provided in detail and the practicality of the proposed method is illustrated through an example. The proposed decision method considers interactions between the group members, so that the possible biases due to the social influences can be reduced to some extent.

AB  - Oral isotretinoin is frequently used in the treatment of young acne patients. However, knowledge levels and attitudes about this treatment have not been studied in the parents previously. We aimed to investigate the knowledge levels and concerns about oral isotretinoin in the parents of adolescent acne patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 136 parents of adolescent patients with moderate to very severe acne vulgaris who answered the questionnaire about oral isotretinoin treatment. Demographic data and acne characteristics were recorded. The parents' knowledge levels and concerns about the treatment process were asked by the questionnaire. Since 32 parents have never heard oral isotretinoin before, they were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 104 parents, 80.8% were female and 19.2% were male. Of the parents, 62.5% had some concerns about oral isotretinoin treatment and 34.6% had no idea whether the drug is suitable for the use of <18 years. 52.9% stated that they think the drug will damage the liver. The most known and worrying side effects were dry lips and vision problems, respectively. The knowledge levels about oral isotretinoin treatment and its side effects were low in the parents of adolescent acne patients, leading to prejudice to the drug.

AB  - We study the behaviour of individuals with different geographic origins interacting in a same public good game. We exploit the peculiar composition of the experimental sample to compare the performance of groups where individuals have mixed origins to homogeneous groups. We find that, despite the absence of any geographic framing, mixed groups exhibit significantly lower contributions. We also find that cooperation levels differ significantly across geographic origins, in line with the existing literature. This is explained by a different impact of coordination opportunities, such as communication, as we show by manipulating them. Our results point towards integration as a crucial aspect for the economic development of intercultural societies. They also confirm that, rather than being explained just by the differences in institutions and economic opportunities, the Italian North-South divide embeds elements of distrust, prejudice and a consequent path dependence in the level of social capital

AB  - This study examines how the gender of corporate social responsibility (CSR) leaders (as signers of the CSR reports) could affect two psychometric properties (i.e., solidarity and certainty) and the readability of the reports. We also investigate how these gender-based differences are associated with firms' future perceived social performance. We conduct textual analyses on a sample of 346 firms in the S&P500 index that issued annual CSR reports during the period of 2006 to 2015. Our findings show that CSR reports with a female (vis-a-vis male) executive as the signer or co-signer are more readable, show more solidarity with readers, but express less certainty in the narratives. In examining their impacts, we find that readability and solidarity, but not certainty, are positively associated with firms' future social performance. Our results suggest the value relevance of leveraging greater female representation in firms' CSR reporting leadership teams so as to help firms enhance their social objectives and signal their future social performance.

AB  - Different forms of discrimination, marginalisation and exclusion have been central concerns for social geography for over 50 years now. Some forms of prejudice are historically resistant, long-lasting and have featured in social geography for many decades (such as racism and sexism); others have emerged more recently within social geography debates as well as in the wider society and are less well understood. In this second progress report on social geography, I explore recent research about Islamophobia, transphobia and sizism that demonstrates that each of these forms of prejudice is worthy of further study and analysis in their own right by social geographers and scholars in related fields. I argue that it would be productive to investigate areas of connection and solidarity across and within these different prejudices and others in order to be able to resist multiple forms of discrimination, intolerance and hate.

AB  - This research article in transnational history analyses an incident during which Hilja Parssinen, a Finnish socialist woman MP, was stopped on the Dutch border in September 1913 on her way to visit a suffragette college in London. This two-hour event at the border and public controversy that followed were clashes between competing ideological and gendered discourses on women's political agency. The incident was a nexus of intersecting discourses on a range of issues: Dutch and international debates on women's suffrage, discourse on 'white slavery', racial prejudices towards East Europeans, Marxist class struggle discourse, and fears of socialism. During the incident, the authorities seemed to be casting the identity of an illegal immigrant or a Russian prostitute on Parssinen. Provoked against her psycho-physical experiences, she protested by performing that identity. Afterwards, transnationally connected socialists politicized the case in their fight for women's political rights, while the authorities and the non-socialist press consistently depoliticized it.

AB  - Increasingly, race scholars define racism as a structural and systemic phenomenon, rather than a matter of personal prejudice alone. Various theories of racism have been developed by asking "What causes racial inequality?" and defining as racist those mechanisms that reproduce it. In this essay. I ask a different question to expand the toolkit from which scholars can identify the racisms that characterize the contemporary era. Acknowledging that dramatic changes to systems of racial oppression are historically brought about by social movements, I ask, "What causes anti-racist movements to fail?" and define as racist those factors that prevent anti-racist movements from mobilizing supporters in the pursuit of change. I thus propose, define, and describe two forms of racism that connect theories of race and racism to theories of social movements. To enable success, social movements engage in (among other tasks) diagnostic and prognostic framing-that is, they identify conditions as problems and propose solutions. I thus propose the following forms of racism that manifest as sentiments that prevent anti-racist movements from successfully carrying out these tasks: diagnostic racism and prognostic racism. In conclusion, I explain how this conceptualization of racism complements and extends prevailing theories of race and racism and underscores the utility of bridging theories of race and racism and social movement theories in studies of race relations.

AB  - We conducted an experiment to assess whether targeting multiple beliefs about sexual orientation (SO) may be more effective in reducing homonegativity than focusing only on beliefs about its biogenetic origins. Participants (116 women, 85 men) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions or a control condition. Those in the treatment conditions read essays summarizing: (1) research suggesting SO has biogenetic origins, (2) research suggesting SO is socially constructed and refuting beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories; or (3) research suggesting SO is biogenetic and research suggesting SO categories are socially constructed and not necessarily discrete, homogenous, or informative. We predicted participants in the conditions that targeted multiple beliefs related to the social construction of SO, not just its biogenetic origins, would exhibit the strongest reductions in beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories, and in homonegativity. We also predicted these participants would exhibit the greatest increases in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. We observed hypothesized shifts in SO beliefs across all experimental conditions. While there was a small main effect of time on homonegative prejudice, there was no main effect of condition and no changes in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. However, post hoc analyses suggested the two conditions addressing social constructionist beliefs accounted for most of the observed prejudice reduction. Implications for more comprehensive educational and social interventions designed to promote social justice for sexual minorities are discussed.

AB  - Research evaluation based on citation data identifies excellence using quantity and quality proxies as the main orthogonal dimensions. Citation data are readily available from aggregators such as the Web of Science or Scopus in the form of number of papers P, number of citations C and h-index. However, most of the prestigious award-giving bodies, e.g. for the Nobel Prizes or for the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) Prize in India, rely on rigorous peer evaluation rather than on citation-based performance. While peer-review judgements are holistic but also subjective, citation-based evaluations tend to be reductive and quantitative. In this study, we look at three of the most prestigious premier peer-review decision-making exercises in India, the SSB Prize, and election Fellowship of the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru. By comparing the awardees and successfully elected Fellows against a list of outstanding citation-based top performers in the world, we report a marked field dependence with citation data predicting 0% to less than 40% of the peer-review selections depending on the field. This study highlights two mixed dangers: one of compressing performance to numbers in an essentially reductive process, and the other of the possible bias and prejudices involved in what is often a subjective peer-review process. Thus, type I and type II errors cannot be avoided in any peer-review or citation evaluation taken in isolation, and vary from as much as 100% to 63%, depending on the field.

AB  - Stereotype content researchers have grown accustomed to ask participants how 'society' views social groups to tap into culturally shared stereotype content and to reduce social desirability bias (J Person Soc Psychol, 82, 2002, 878). However, methodological and theoretical considerations raise questions about this common practice, and stereotype content researchers have also asked for participants' personal perspective on social groups in the past. Nonetheless, how and whether stereotype content model scores empirically differ as a function of the instructed perspective remains questionable and to date untested. Thus, we investigated whether and, if so, how stereotype content results are affected when instructing participants to evaluate social groups from society's versus their personal perspective. Across three experiments (Study 1: N = 301; Study 2: N = 126; Study 3: N = 1,221), latent mean comparisons indicated that results regarding stereotype content ratings are affected by the instructed perspective (society's vs. personal) contingent on the social group's location in the stereotype content space: Stereotype content ratings were more negative when participants were asked to provide society's perspective on social groups compared to their own perspective, but only on an already depreciated stereotype content dimension. The number of possible comparisons across experimental conditions was substantially reduced, since preconditions for these analyses were not met. Given our methodological and theoretical considerations and empirical corroborations that the instructed perspective does affect results, we encourage a discussion on how to best measure culturally shared stereotype content and propose aggregating stereotype content scores from participants' personal perspective to the cultural level.

AB  - Studies conducted in the last few decades show that young people have a negative evaluation of politics since they relate it to conventional forms of participation. In addition, they engage in unconventional forms of political participation, though they do not think of them as political practices. In this context, a qualitative study was carried out in order to describe the social representations of politics through the narratives provided by adolescents during an interview based on Piaget's clinical method. The results obtained reveal the coexistence of two representations of politics: a conventional and an unconventional one. The representation in which politics is mainly understood as conventional forms of participation appears to be hegemonic, although a polemic unconventional representation was identified. Moreover, in many of the subjects both representations coexist in state of cognitive polyphasia that express a relation of selective prevalence between them, depending on the discursive context they are elicited.

AB  - The aim of my paper is to examine children's literature written in Italy and centred on the Holocaust. It is quite common for people to deem the subject matter inappropriate for young audiences, whilst it is also considered disrespectful to write inventive literature for children about the death camps. Nevertheless, it seems necessary to inform children about such a major historical event. Moreover, the stories written on this subject aim to introduce children to themes like prejudice, discrimination and racism. My research focuses on the recurrent patterns that occur frequently in these books. In these books, the focus lies on the victims rather than the perpetrators. They deal with the story of a Jewish family and frequently feature a child as the protagonist. These books will undoubtedly provoke questions by young readers, but they are most likely best read with an adult who can answer any questions appropriately and deepen the historical frame. These narratives are important because educators have a responsibility to teach others and read about the Holocaust.

AB  - A growing body of evidence documents that Islamophobia is a significant social issue in the UK. This evidence also reveals an empirical link to "Islamist" terrorism, revealing a nexus between security and the social emergence of prejudice. Drawing on critical approaches to security and applying them to the case of the UK in 2017, this article explores this nexus conceptually and empirically. To do so, it examines the discourses of various governance institutions (including the media, the political elite, and security professionals) as they respond to "Islamist" terrorist events. It argues that these governance institutions individually and collectively - and often unwittingly - stigmatised and securitised "Muslim" identity. The structural emergence (i.e., the institutionalisation) of Islamophobia in the UK, this article contends, can largely be understood through these processes. This article therefore offers an illustration of some of the logics of how prejudice is embedded in societal structures, which has normative implications for how these processes might be successfully contested.

AB  - Objective To describe the repercussions, from the perspectives of caregiver mothers, of confirmed congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in their offspring. Methods A descriptive-exploratory study with a qualitative approach was carried out in the state of Espirito Santo in southeastern Brazil, with 25 women who had a child diagnosed with CZS. Results Emerging themes from the content analysis were grouped into two categories: (1) inequalities experienced by mothers, including social inequality, poverty, and gender inequality; (2) the impact of a child with CZS on mothering, including feelings at the time of diagnosis, maternal isolation and mental health, experiences of stigma and prejudice, and exhausting itineraries searching for therapeutic care. Conclusion The repercussions of CZS were a huge burden on already vulnerable women, and social inequalities and poverty were important markers in the mothers' reports. Many of the families affected by CZS already lived in precarious social conditions and these conditions were exacerbated further. Robust public and social policies to support these mothers need effective implementation given that babies born with CZS need long-term care and support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the ability to and interest in work, people with disabilities are employed at significantly lower rates than nondisabled people. Employment disparities highlight persistent social and cultural stereotypes that equate disability with unemployability.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between employment of people with disabilities and disability prejudice in the United States. This study had the following research question: how does disability prejudice impact state disability employment rates?
   METHODS: To explore these questions, we used secondary data about state disability employment (2016), as well as disability prejudice data from 270,000 nondisabled people residing in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
   RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed states with higher disability prejudice scores have lower disability employment rates, suggesting employment disparities are intertwined with disability prejudice.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cultures and systems must be rid of harmful disability stereotypes to ensure people with disabilities can truly partake in their human and civil rights.

AB  - In our study, we investigated the relationship between collective narcissism and group-based moral exclusion. Since collective narcissists are motivated to see their group as unique and superior, and tend to show hostility towards outgroups threatening this presumed superiority, we hypothesized that perceived intergroup threat and social distance can mediate the relationship between collective narcissism and group-based moral exclusion. We tested this assumption in two intergroup contexts by investigating the beliefs of members of the Hungarian majority population about Muslim immigrants and Roma people. Our results showed that collective narcissism had a positive indirect effect on group-based moral exclusion in the case of both outgroups. Furthermore, both threat and social distance were significant mediators in the case of Muslim immigrants, but mostly social distance mediated the indirect effect of collective narcissism on moral exclusion of the Roma. These results indicate that collective narcissists tend to rationalize their intergroup hostility by the mechanism of motivated moral exclusion, and to find suitable justifications for doing so.

AB  - While linguistic prejudice is commonly understood to concern individuals or social groups because of the way they speak, we can also see it as damaging language used about individuals or social groups. In this article, I start by looking at the traditional sociolinguistic understanding of linguistic prejudice, then go on to look rather widely at various forms of prejudicial/sexist language about women. In doing so, I identify various lexical asymmetries and associated "lexical gaps". The main part of the article takes this further by exploring how certain insults to men draw on an understood prejudice again women. I illustrate this with a "telling case": three naturally occurring examples of prejudicial, sexist language recently used by British prime minister Boris Johnson: big girl's blouse, man up and girly swot. For all three to work, they draw on what we might call a discourse of "Women as ineffectual". I conclude with a discussion of intentionality as regards this sort of prejudicial language use, what it is intended to achieve and how it can be resisted.

AB  - Muslim Americans constitute one of the United States' most vulnerable minority groups, facing frequent discrimination from both the public and the government. Despite this vulnerability, few studies evaluate interventions for reducing prejudice against Muslim Americans. Building from an insightful literature on the sources of prejudice against Muslim Americans, this paper tests whether attitudes can be improved with information countering misperceptions of the community as particularly foreign, threatening, and disloyal to the United States. The experimental treatment modestly improved attitudes, including among some subgroups predisposed to prejudice against Muslim Americans. However, the treatment struggled to change policy views, and it demonstrated some vulnerability to social desirability bias and priming on terrorism threats. The findings suggest that information campaigns addressing misperceptions can help to reduce prejudice on the margins, but primarily in less politicized contexts.

AB  - To what extent does religious identification promote collective efficacy and perceived injustice that contribute to explain support for interreligious violence in Indonesia? This overarching research question is inspired by theoretical insights starting from social identity theory, and noticeably enriched by collective action theories. We use high-quality data of 1,995 randomly selected individuals (Muslims and Christians) from across the Indonesian archipelago to investigate the mediating effects of perceived injustice and collective efficacy on the relationship between religiosity and support for interreligious violence. We also improve upon previous research with an elaborate measure of religiosity (beliefs, practice, and salience). Our structural equation modelling analysis reveals that collective efficacy significantly mediates the relationship between the religiosity dimensions and support for interreligious violence. Moreover, on average, the Muslim community has a higher level of collective efficacy, as compared to the Christian community, which positively affects the relationship between most religiosity dimensions and support for interreligious violence. An interesting finding is that in the Christian community, salience is overall negatively related to collective efficacy, which then negatively affects support for interreligious violence. These results provide novel empirical insights on the role of religious identity in interreligious conflicts in the South Asian context, especially Indonesia.

KW  - GROUNDED THEORY
AB  - This study presents a social profile of a tolerant and global ideological behavior. The in-group-behavior revolves around enforcing the tolerant virtue and rooting out and eliminating prejudiced attitudes that affect minorities and the collective environment. The main concern is conceptualized as "enabling a nonjudgmental environment" for oneself and others. The recurrent solution to this concern is "neutralizing prejudices." Neutralizing prejudices is a means to engage and deal with prejudiced oppression and prejudice-related behavior. Mindsets with a tolerant worldview use neutralization as a way to assert their worldview and cope with the prejudiced attitudes they experience towards minorities and the collective environment. Neutralizing prejudices is a way to negate, defuse, disqualify, or override a prejudiced context by applying an opposite or contrary force or effect. As such, neutralizing is mainly a rhetorical requisite. As a basic social process, neutralizing prejudices is a process of "collective regrouping" in relation to a social, moral, and global objective.

AB  - This paper focuses on women's vocational education in Turkey as a gendered and gendering process. Cultural norms about women's role in society, a vocational curriculum that echoes these norms, and a labour market with gender inequalities constitute the background against which women formulate their vocational preferences and seek pathways into the labour market. We use the literatures on gender and vocational education, school-to-work transitions, and gender bargains to analyse data from qualitative fieldwork with students and graduates of girls? vocational high schools. First, we scrutinize how students choose vocational tracks. Our findings point to the presence of a gendered bounded agency by students and graduates, according to which their choices echo traditional gender norms. Secondly, we discuss the transition from school to work, during which they are faced with gender prejudice in the labour market. Finally, we show how that process turns into a ?school-to-home? transition whereby graduates become homemakers.

AB  - In three studies (total N = 239) we examined the unexplored question of whether voice conveying sexual orientation elicits stigma and discrimination in the context of adoption. Studies 1 and 2 were conducted in Italy where same-sex adoption is illegal and controversial. Study 3 was conducted in the United Kingdom where same-sex adoption is legal and generally more accepted. The three studies show that listeners draw strong inferences from voice when judging hypothetical adoption seekers. Both Italian and British listeners judged gay-sounding speakers as warmer and as having better parenting skills, yet Italian participants consistently preferred straight over gay-sounding applicants, whereas British participants showed an opposite tendency, presumably reflecting the different normative context in the two countries. We conclude that vocal cues may have culturally distinct effects on judgment and decision making and that people with gay-sounding voices may face discrimination in adoption procedures in countries with antigay norms.

AB  - The disproportionate incarceration of certain groups, racial minorities, and the less educated constitutes a social problem from the perspective of both policy makers and researchers. One aspect that is poorly understood is whether the public is similarly concerned about inequities in mass incarceration. Using a list experiment embedded in a framing experiment, we test for differences in attitudes towards mass incarceration by exploring three frames: race, education, and the United States in global context. We test whether social desirability bias causes people to over-state their concern about mass incarceration when directly queried. We find that mass incarceration is seen as a problem in the United States, whether the issue is framed by race, education, or as a global outlier. The list experiment reveals that public concern about mass incarceration is not quite as great as overtly-expressed opinion would suggest, and the framing experiment indicates that race-neutral frames evoke greater concern about mass incarceration than an emphasis on racial disparities.

AB  - In a recent critique of reviewers, Ralph (2016) stated that "Peer review is prejudiced, capricious, inefficient, ineffective and generally unscientific" (p. 274). Our research proposes that one way the peer review process could appear flawed is if those involved had different beliefs about what was important in evaluating research. We found evidence for a cognitive bias where respondents to a survey asking about the importance of particular validity and reliability method practices gave different answers depending on whether they were asked to answer the survey as a researcher or as a reviewer. Because researchers have higher motivation to publish research than reviewers do to review research, we theorize that motivational differences between researchers and reviewers leads to this bias and contributes to the perception that the review process is flawed. We discuss the implications of our findings for improving the peer review process in MIS.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight, challenge and explain the inequitable treatment of tax and welfare fraudsters in the criminal justice systems of Australia and New Zealand. The authors offer prejudice by way of explanation and suggest that it is also prejudice that restricts the implementation of more equitable processes. A second objective of the study is to highlight the importance of critical tax research as an instrument to agitate for social change. Design/methodology/approach A survey captures 3,000 respondents' perceptions of the likelihood that different "types" of people will commit welfare or tax fraud. Using social dominance theory, the authors investigate the extent to which prejudice impacts on attitudes towards those engaged in these fraudulent activities. Findings The authors find the presence of traditional stereotypes, such as the perception that businessmen are more likely to commit tax fraud and people receiving welfare assistance are more likely to commit fraud. The authors also find strong preferences towards respondents' own in-group, whereby businessmen, Maori and people receiving welfare assistance believed that their own group was less likely to commit either crime. Originality/value The study highlights the difficulty of social change in the presence of strong in-group preference and prejudice. Cognisance of in-group preference is relevant to the accounting profession where elements of self-regulation remain. In-group preferences may impact on services provided, as well as professional development and education.

AB  - Bullying is associated with harmful consequences for those who are involved, in particular for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and sexually questioning (LGBQ) adolescents, who are teased for their sexual orientation. Not only LGBQ youth may experience homophobic bullying, but also students who are perceived as not conforming to traditional masculine/feminine gender role expectations. Wrong beliefs, prejudices, and moral disengagement may account for the perpetration of homophobic bullying. The present work aims at investigating whether (boys and girls) heterosexual and LGBQ adolescents were differently involved in homophobic and non-homophobic bullying and victimization and whether biological sex and sexual orientation moderated the relationships between prejudice and moral disengagement and involvement in homophobic bullying and victimization. Participants were 197 adolescents (70 boys, 127 girls), aged 15-18 years (M = 16.32); 46 of them defined themselves as LGBQ people. They responded to questionnaires about bullying and victimization, prejudice against homosexuality, and moral disengagement in situations involving sexual orientation. Results of the univariate analyses pointed to a higher homophobic and non-homophobic victimization among LGBQ adolescents than among their heterosexual counterparts. In the regressions, homophobic bullying was associated with being male and heterosexual, and with moral disengagement, whereas homophobic victimization was related to a low level of prejudice, in particular for LGBQ youths. The findings underscore the importance of examining prejudice and moral disengagement when studying homophobic bullying and victimization and point to the need for developing intervention programs.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the social network of young female transsexuals who live with HIV/AIDS. Method: descriptive and exploratory study of qualitative approach, based on the Social Network Theory, developed in a Brazilian reference hospital for HIV/AIDS, with six transsexual women. Individual interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the data were subjected to analysis of similarities through the software program IRaMuTeQ. Results: the categories observed were: 1) dynamics of primary social network and social challenges; 2) dynamics of secondary social network and the institutional prejudice. Final considerations: the dynamics of the social network is based on the lack of support of primary and secondary networks, and the containment process limits the reach of quality of life and social emancipation. To deal with this theme will provide the visibility of young female transsexuals in confronting vulnerabilities and guaranteeing human rights.

AB  - Interpretation and analysis of qualitative data inevitably involves a collision with one's own lived experience. This paper reflects on a postgraduate research project that employed the methodology of grounded theory to determine themes around the meaning that individuals in a school community give to the term spirituality. Reflecting on the process has highlighted ways in which unexamined personal assumptions were at play as the researcher conducted analysis, influencing the interpretation of data. It is argued here that in researching the concept of spirituality, which is both nebulous and highly subjective, becoming aware of one's own assumptions throughout the process is integral to an interpretation that illuminates the data with greater clarity. I argue here that engaging with Gadamer's understanding of "prejudices" can assist researchers in considering their own perspective, regardless of the methodology employed, as well as providing an analytic method of engaging with these assumptions. The method for this engagement is subsequently provided.

AB  - Objective: Bisexual women report higher rates of sexual revictimization than their heterosexual and lesbian peers (Heidi, Marx, & Gold, 2005; Hequembourg, Livingston, & Parks, 2013), and limited research has examined risk factors for sexual revictimization among this population. The current study examined hazardous drinking use as a mediator of the relation between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adult rape among bisexual women. Further, antibisexual prejudice was tested as a moderator of the indirect effect to better understand the context of hazardous drinking within this population. Method: Data were collected online from 343 bisexual women. Participants completed measures of CSA, antibisexual prejudice, hazardous drinking. and adult rape. The PROCESS macro was used to test the conditional indirect effect of CSA on adult rape via hazardous drinking, moderated by antibisexual prejudice. Results: The rate of revictimization in the current sample was 38.6%. The hypothesized conditional indirect effect was supported; CSA was indirectly related to adult rape through hazardous drinking only at mean and high levels of antibisexual prejudice. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for interventions at both policy and individual levels. Policies aimed at reducing bisexual stigma may be useful in addressing high rates of revictimization and reducing the potential for victim blaming. as it highlights the role of societal stigma in creating risk for revictimization. Clinical interventions focused on helping CSA survivors cope adaptively with the added stress of antibisexual prejudice may be useful in reducing risk for sexual revictimization.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a cross-cultural musical program on young Portuguese adolescents' national prejudice. Two-hundred and twenty-nine sixth-grade pupils who attended public schools in the area of Lisbon, Portugal, were first presented with two tasks measuring national prejudice: a trait attribution task comprising positive and negative personality traits, and an overall affective evaluation of in-group and out-group people. Half of the pupils were subsequently exposed, at school, to a six-month musical program that included Cape Verdean songs as well as Portuguese songs. The other half was exposed to the usual program, which comprised no songs from Cape Verde but included all the Portuguese songs. Measures of national prejudice taken at the end of the program showed that the impact of the program was specific. In the experimental group, prejudice towards Cape Verdean people was reduced whereas attitudes to other groups were not altered (Portuguese and Brazilian). In the control group no reduction for any group was observed. Measures taken three months later showed that the impact of the experimental program was enduring.

AB  - Hiring is likely a more critical process for an organization, which might be possible through distinct procedures. Simultaneously, employee selection process has vital importance in which organizations adopt numerous methods and techniques to assess the dynamic individual. Many researchers have claimed that there are diverse factors that affect the employee selection process. Despite, this study investigates the effect of prejudice and references on the employee selection process within the context of banking sector in Pakistan. To this end, primary data were collected through questionnaire distribution among 400 human resource managers of all levels, that is, top, middle and first-line managers within the period of October 2015 to May 2016. Subsequently, 310 surveys were acquired for final analysis that indicates 78 per cent accuracy in the response rate. Furthermore, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) techniques were applied to research findings using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS. 20.0). It is revealed that prejudice (P) and reference (R) have a significant correlation on the employee selection process. However, the levels of intensity are quite different in each sub-attribute as thereafter demonstrated hierarchically. Finally, our research proposes few future studies for the research scholars and practitioners.

AB  - It is argued that far-right (FR) populism in the West is fuelled by inequality. In this paper, we argue that three social psychological processes are central to explaining these phenomena. We suggest that these processes are recursive although we do not specify their temporal order. Drawing on the social identity tradition, we first examine how inequality is linked to reduced social trust and cohesion, which has consequences for both low- and high-income groups. We examine the known effects of perceived threat in amplifying tensions between groups and consolidating identity positions. Second, we argue that national identity consolidation is a particularly likely response to inequality, which, in turn, reduces tolerance of cultural diversity as an associated consequence. Finally, we consider the value of these strengthened national identities to those who harness them effectively to gain political ground. In this way, those who offer FR populist rhetoric aligned with nationalism can blame immigrants, "foreign" powers, and mainstream politics for both the lack of social cohesion and reduced economic circumstances of many. We conclude that FR populist leaders not only tap into the negative social consequences of inequality, their policy positions also fail to address and may even compound the situation.

AB  - We propose that feminine gay men are targets of essentialist beliefs that cast them as less natural and more entitative than masculine gay men, and that this pattern of low-naturalness/high-entitativity beliefs fuels increased sexual prejudice toward, and discomfort with, feminine gay men. Data from two studies support these hypotheses. In Study 1, feminine versus masculine gay men were rated lower in naturalness and higher in entitativity, while masculine versus feminine lesbians did not elicit this pattern of beliefs. Study 2 replicated the effects of gay men's gender expression on essentialist beliefs, and demonstrated that feminine gay men arouse more prejudice and discomfort than masculine gay men because they are perceived as socially constructed (low in naturalness) and deeply homogeneous (high in entitativity). Discussion considers the implications of these findings for reducing the stigma of femininity in gay men and outlines directions for future research.

AB  - In a location-based social network, users socialize with each other by sharing their current location in the form of check-in, which allows users to reveal the current places they visit as part of their social interaction. Understanding this human check-in phenomenon in space and time on location based social network (LBSN) datasets, which is also called check-in behavior, can archive the day-to-day activity patterns, usage behaviors toward social media, and presents spatiotemporal evidence of users' daily routines. It also provides a wide range of opportunities to observe (i.e., mobility, urban activities, defining city boundary, and community problems in a city). In representing human check-in behavior, these LBSN datasets do not reflect the real-world events due to certain statistical biases (i.e., gender prejudice, a low frequency in sampling, and location type prejudice). However, LBSN data is primarily considered a supplement to traditional data sources (i.e., survey, census) and can be used to observe human check-in behavior within a city. Different interpretations are used elusively for the term check-in behavior, which makes it difficult to identify studies on human check-in behavior based on LBSN using the Weibo dataset. The primary objective of this research is to explore human check-in behavior by male and female users in Guangzhou, China toward using Chinese microblog Sina Weibo (referred to as Weibo), which is missing in the existing literature. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is utilized to explore the spatiotemporal distribution geographically and weighted regression (GWR) method was applied to observe the relationship between check-in and districts with a focus on gender during weekdays and weekend. Lastly, the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) analysis is used to systematically analyze the orientation, direction, spatiotemporal expansion trends and the differences in check-in distribution in Guangzhou, China. The results of this study show that LBSN is a reliable source of data to observe human check-in behavior in space and time within a specified geographic area. Furthermore, it shows that female users are more likely to use social media as compared to male users. The human check-in behavior patterns for social media network usage by gender seems to be slightly different during weekdays and weekend.

AB  - Purpose: Prejudice and discrimination have been associated with mental and physical health disparities among people with disabilities (Emerson, 2010) and sexual minorities (American Psychological Association [APA], 2012b). Subtle everyday communications of prejudice, known as microaggressions, are one form of oppressive experience that contribute to minority stress among these groups. As sexual minority people with disabilities (SMPWDs) embody at least two marginalized statuses, they may face unique levels of risk. While social support has been posited to buffer against the negative effects of minority stress (Meyer, 2003), the relationship between microaggressions and perceived social support is currently unknown. This study is among the first to explore the relationship between microaggressions and social support in a multiply marginalized community. Research Method: One-hundred and 92 sexual minority (i.e., bisexual, gay, lesbian, pansexual, queer, questioning, same-sex/gender attracted) participants with physical disabilities completed measures related to microaggressions, social support, and mental health via an online survey. Results: Results suggest that for SMPWDs, greater ableist microaggressions within sexual minority communities were associated with lower satisfaction with LGBTQ social supports. In addition, ableist and homonegative microaggressions within sexual minority and disability communities, respectively, were related to greater depressive symptoms. Social support was not found to moderate the relationship between microaggressions and mental health. Implications: Implications for practice, training, advocacy, and future research are discussed, such as raising critical consciousness about microaggressions and mental health, using an intersectional framework when working with SMPWDs, engaging in inclusive advocacy toward policy change, and future studies on microaggressions and social support using diverse samples.
   Impact and Implications
   This study is among the first to examine the relationship between microaggressions and social support. The results of this study highlight interpersonal barriers to supportive relationships for SMPWDs within sexual minority communities, and emphasize the need for increased advocacy toward full inclusion of SMPWDs within sexual minority and disability communities. Providers are encouraged to take a nonpathologizing stance with SMPWDs by focusing on raising critical consciousness about microaggressions and their relationship with mental health. Within-group differences, such as based on disability severity, should also be considered in treatment. Use of an intersectional framework is important when working with SMPWDs, and providers should explore experiences within various communities when assessing social support. Providers should use their expertise to intervene at a broader level to influence how SMPWDs are perceived and treated. Providers are encouraged to increase awareness of their own biases, take risks to address microaggressions, and advocate at the institutional level. As some microaggressions occur on the societal level, these policy changes may directly impact SMPWD mental health.

AB  - Only since 2011 have sexual minorities been able to serve openly in the U.S. military. The previous anti-gay policies and culture of the military may have increased anti-gay beliefs among veterans. Using data from the 2010-2016 General Social Survey, we tested whether veterans more frequently endorsed anti-gay beliefs than their non-veteran peers. Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics with multiple logistic regression, we tested the associations of veteran status with five anti-gay beliefs (i.e., disallowing a gay person (1) from publicly speaking or (2) teaching at a university, (3) removing a gay-supportive book from a library, (4) whether same-sex sexual relations are wrong, and (5) support of same-sex marriage. Veteran status was associated with greater disagreement with same-sex marriage (B = 0.16, p = 0.033) but not with other anti-gay beliefs. Most anti-gay beliefs among veterans were explained by other sociodemographic factors and may not be inherent to veteran status.

AB  - Social exclusion represents one of the main societal challenges outlined by the Europe 2020 strategy. An influential strand of the theoretical literature argues that cultural consumption may have positive social effects, favouring tolerance and fighting prejudice, thus reducing social exclusion. However, this claim has not been tested on the field. This work investigates empirically the relation between social exclusion and consumption of cultural goods in a spatial framework. Using Eurostat data, we compute the Local Moran Transition Probability Matrix for Italian Regions (NUTS-2) over the 2004-2014 timespan. The results show that social exclusion decreases significantly with cultural consumption. In particular, the spatial clusters that emerge when mapping social exclusion break up when controlling for cultural consumption. These findings point out to the importance of governmental support to cultural goods as an instrument to fight social exclusion. In this sense, cultural goods are to be viewed not only as merit goods and sources of entertainment, but also as a societal heritage and a policy instrument.

AB  - Recent research suggests that meaning in life relates to processes of social judgments and could facilitate relationships between racially diverse individuals. At this time however, there is no study that examines factors that influence the relationship between meaning, racial prejudice, and values. To fill this gap, the present study examined whether (1) self-transcendence and (2) psychological inflexibility mediates the relationship between perceived meaning in life and prejudice. The study was conducted with 253 White students (females, 77.9%; males, 22.1%) from a university located in the southern United States. Standard path-analytic approaches through the macro PROCESS program were used to examine a parallel mediational model. Results evidenced that self-transcendence and psychological inflexibility had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between meaning in life and prejudice, and that reversely, meaning also functioned as a mediator of self-transcendence and prejudice and psychological inflexibility and prejudice. Findings suggest that among White college students the effect of meaning on prejudice changes in the context of self-transcendence and psychological inflexibility, and that without self-transcendence and psychological flexibility, meaning could actually result in greater prejudice.

AB  - Background: This research deals with the way people create discourses around disability, which shape the community's concept of disability.
   Objective: The purpose of this article is to find out how the community configures "disability", in particular by understanding the ideas, needs and strategies that the community uses towards people with disabilities. Specifically, different roles have been involved, such as professionals, volunteers, family members and citizens. The final aim is intervening on the discourses that can contrast the full personal fulfilment of people with disabilities and social inclusion.
   Methods: This paper relates to discursive psychology's theoretical references and makes use of the Methodology of Textual Analysis. The tools we used include investigation protocols specially designed to detect text both through manual "pencil and paper" and computerized denominations.
   Results: The results show that those who are in direct contact with people with disabilities (volunteers and family members) are more exposed to treating them as disabled, making the deficit coincide with the person and also have a more judgemental approach.
   Conclusions: From the results obtained we can see which practices can be activated to facilitate the network between the various roles in order to implement inclusive interventions and help those more exposed to prejudices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how prejudice in a post-migration labor market can be mitigated, specifically, whether education received in the host country can serve as a signal of social integration for immigrant workers in employment settings. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an audit discrimination study, using an experimental setup to examine the interplay between prejudice and education as a signal of the social integration of immigrants in employment settings. Findings The results of the study indicate that signals of social integration, such as, qualifications acquired in the host country through education, counter prejudice against Polish immigrants in Iceland.
   Originality/value The study addresses the under-researched effects of education on human capital transferability in the host labor market. More specifically, it uncovers that the differentiation between education acquired in the home country and education acquired in the host country is a signal that can mitigate prejudice and its effects on the employment of immigrants in the host countries.

AB  - In retail settings, social perception of other peoples' preferences is fundamental to successful interpersonal interactions (e.g., product recommendations, gift-giving). This type of perception must be made with little information, very often based solely on facial cues. Although people are capable of accurately predicting others' preferences from facial cues, we do not yet know how such inferences are made by crossmodal correspondence (arbitrary sensory associations) between facial cues and inferred attributes. The crossmodal correspondence literature implies the existence of sensory associations between shapes and tastes, and people consistently match roundness and angularity to sweet and sour foods, respectively. Given that peoples' faces have dimensions characterized by roundness and angularity, it may be plausible that people infer others' preferences by relying on the correspondence between facial roundness and taste. Based on a crossmodal correspondence framework, this study aimed to reveal the role of shape-taste correspondences in social perception. We investigated whether Japanese participants infer others' taste (sweet/sour) preferences based on facial shapes (roundness/angularity). The results showed that participants reliably inferred that round-faced (vs. angular-faced) individuals preferred sweet foods (Study 1). Round-faced individuals and sweet foods were well matched, and the matching mediated the inference of other person's preferences (Study 2). An association between facial roundness and inference of sweet taste preferences was observed in more natural faces, and perceived obesity mediated this association (Study 3). These findings advance the applicability of crossmodal correspondences in social perception, and imply the pervasiveness of prejudicial bias in the marketplace.

AB  - The question of the antecedents of prejudicial responses has a long history that includes contributions of historical, structural, cultural, and psychological factors. Social-psychological research on prejudice as self-image maintenance provides evidence that manifestations of prejudice stem, in part, from the motivation to maintain a feeling of self-worth and self-integrity. Here, we review studies that indicate when and why prejudice toward out-groups in response to self-threats is weakened by affirmations of self-worth. A distinction emerges between in-group threats (e.g., negative acts committed by the in-group) and out-group threats (e.g., immigrants) to social identity, on the one hand, and the defensive reactions people make in response to each kind of threat (i.e., denying in-group responsibility vs. displaying prejudice), on the other. Such negative intergroup interactions can be attenuated by affirming the self. We present theorized moderators (i.e., individual differences and cultural norms) and proposed mechanisms underlying affirmation effects in the domain of prejudice. We discuss potential applications of self-affirmation in prejudice-reduction efforts.
