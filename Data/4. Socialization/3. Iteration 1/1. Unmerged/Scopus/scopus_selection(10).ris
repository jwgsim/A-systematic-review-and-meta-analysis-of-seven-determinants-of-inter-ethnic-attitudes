AB  - Background: Recent research has shown that pregnant individuals experience weight stigma throughout gestation, including negative comments and judgement associated with gestational weight gain (GWG). Weight bias internalization (WBI) is often a result of exposure to weight stigma and is detrimental to biopsychological health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore WBI in pregnancy and compare scores based on maternal weight-related factors including pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), obesity diagnosis and excessive GWG. Methods: Pregnant individuals in Canada and USA completed a modified version of the Adult Weight Bias Internalization Scale. Self-reported pre-pregnancy height and weight were collected to calculate and classify pre-pregnancy BMI. Current weight was also reported to calculate GWG, which was then classified as excessive or not based on Institute of Medicine (2009) guidelines. Participants indicated if they were diagnosed with obesity by a healthcare provider. Inferential analyses were performed comparing WBI scores according to pre-pregnancy BMI, excessive GWG, and obesity diagnosis. Significance was accepted as p &lt; 0.05 and effect sizes accompanied all analyses. Result: 336 pregnant individuals completed the survey, with an average WBI score of 3.9 ± 1.2. WBI was higher among those who had a pre-pregnancy BMI of obese than normal weight (p = 0.04, η2 = 0.03), diagnosed with obesity than not diagnosed (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.3), and gained excessively versus not (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.2). Conclusions: Pregnant individuals who have a higher BMI, obesity and gain excessively may experience WBI. Given that weight stigma frequently occurs in pregnancy, effective person-oriented strategies are needed to mitigate stigma and prevent and care for WBI. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lingual microcystic lymphatic malformations (LMLMs) are rare congenital vascular malformations presenting as clusters of cysts filled with lymph fluid or blood. Even small well-limited lesions can be responsible for a heavy burden, inducing pain, aesthetic prejudice, or oozing, bleeding, infections. The natural history of LMLMs is progressive worsening punctuated by acute flares. Therapeutic options include surgery, laser excision, and radiofrequency ablation but all are potentially detrimental and expose to local relapse. Therefore, the management frequently relies on a “watchful waiting” approach. In complicated LMLMs, treatment with oral sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is often used. Topical applications of sirolimus on the buccal mucosae have been reported in other oral diseases with good tolerance and none to slight detectable blood sirolimus concentrations. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1 mg/mL sirolimus solution applied once daily on LMLM of any stage in children and adults after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of treatment compared to usual care (no treatment). Methods: This is a randomized, multicentric study using an individually randomized stepped-wedge design over 24 weeks to evaluate topical application of a 1 mg/mL sirolimus solution once daily, on LMLM, versus usual care (no treatment), the control condition. Participants begin with an observational period and later switch to the intervention at a randomized time (week 0, 4, 8, or 12). Visits occur every 4 weeks, either in the study center or by teleconsulting. The primary outcome will be the evaluation of global severity of the LMLM on monthly standardized photographs by 3 independent blinded experts using the physical global assessment (PGA) 0 to 5 scale. Secondary outcomes will include lesion size measurement and quality of life assessment, investigator, and patient-assessed global disease and specific symptoms (oozing, bleeding, sialorrhea, eating impairment, taste modification, aesthetic impairment, pain, and global discomfort) assessment. A biological monitoring will be performed including residual blood sirolimus concentration and usual laboratory parameters. Discussion: Given the disappointing state of current treatment options in LMLMs, topical sirolimus could become firstline therapy in treating LMLMs if its efficacy and safety were to be demonstrated.

AB  - Background: Birth outside of marriage has been gradually increasing in Korea. However, social perception of unmarried mothers is still negative, and a number of them are not accepted by their family. Therefore, the Korean government has implemented a policy to provide financial aid and communal residence to unmarried mothers who cannot raise children with their family, or afford residence. Unmarried young mothers who rely on this government policy have low economic independence and social adaptation skills. Additionally, they have a high chance of encountering numerous challenges in raising children due to their living conditions in residential facilities and social prejudice. This study was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of the lived experience of unmarried mothers raising children in residential facilities. Methods: Data were collected through in-depth interviews with nine unmarried mothers living in residential facilities with their children. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Results: The findings revealed that unmarried mothers struggled with various difficulties given the limitations of living in the facility, but attempted to navigate their uncertain future with the determination to be good mothers. Three main themes and eight sub-themes emerged: (1) adaptation to the identity of “unmarried mother”, (2) willingly undertaking the heavy burden of childrearing, (3) indispensable but insufficient supports from facilities. Participants had childrearing responsibilities, and tried to be good mothers for their children while struggling to adapt to their new identities. However, their self-doubt as a “good mother” and the absence of the child's father made them feel sorry for their child. Their daily experiences raising children and simultaneously preparing for their own independence were exhausting. The supports from the facilities were helpful but unsatisfactory and led to various psychosocial difficulties such as anxiety, depression, fear, guilty, and anger in unmarried mothers. Conclusions: Besides information and resources for parenting and independence, active approaches are needed to improve the psychological stability of unmarried mothers raising their children in facilities, and sustain a long-term socioeconomic support system. Thoughtful services tailored to mothers and children are also needed, instead of standardized services. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cultural safety requires healthcare professionals and organisations to improve healthcare, facilitate patient access to healthcare, and achieve equity within the workforce. Methods: This ethnomethodological study, which consisted of two phases, explored the concept of cultural safety from the perspective of Advanced Practice Nurses. Semi-structured interviews and the nominal group technique were used to prioritise challenges related to cultural safety, identify barriers to clinical practise and assess educational needs. The data collected was subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Nurses working in Austria, Germany and Switzerland were recruited (N = 29). Accordingly, the phenomenon of cultural safety in health care is not generally known and there is little prior knowledge about it. The most frequently discussed themes were communication difficulties, lack of knowledge, the treatment of people with insufficient language skills and expectations of treatment goals and outcomes, which can lead to conflicts and accusations of unequal treatment due to diverse cultural backgrounds. Conclusion: Diverse cultures are encountered in German-speaking healthcare settings. Cultural safety is also about healthcare staff, as nurses with different socialisations encounter prejudice, discrimination and racism. Although the issue of power was not discussed, academic nurses were willing to make an effort to change. Only a minority were aware that lasting change requires challenging one’s own cultural structures and adapted behaviours, rather than pushing for the mere acquisition of cultural competence. Organisations were encouraged to introduce self-reflection sessions and provide better access to translation services to improve equity and support nurses. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the importance of timely diagnosis and access to treatment, previous studies have not adequately explored help-seeking behavior in cancer treatment among rural and remote residents. The barriers preventing help-seeking behavior also remain unclear. To address this research gap, this study conducted a scoping review to suggest a framework for eliminating barriers and facilitating help-seeking for cancer treatment among rural and remote residents. To conduct the scoping review, three English medical databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL) were examined for the keywords “rural,” “remote,” “cancer,” and “help-seeking.” The research objectives and study designs, participants, and excerpts describing help-seeking of the selected papers were recorded in a data charting form. Descriptions of help-seeking behavior were organized and summarized according to their meaning and integrated into factors using thematic analysis. All extracted factors related to help-seeking were sorted into four main themes according to the Ecological Model of Health Behavior, the theoretical lens for this scoping review: (1) Intrapersonal; (2) Interpersonal; (3) Groups, culture, and organizations; and (4) Policy/environment. Factors were categorized as barriers and facilitators of help-seeking. A total of 13 papers were analyzed. Intrapersonal factors such as self-reliance, symptom appraisal, and fatalism, were identified as barriers to help-seeking, whereas presentation of abnormal and serious symptoms facilitated help-seeking. Interpersonal factors such as lack of understanding of family members, influence of surrounding people, role obligations, and lack of trust in experts hindered help-seeking, whereas understanding from surrounding people such as family and friends, promoted help-seeking. Groups, cultural, and organizational factors such as prejudice, social stigma, shame, lack of anonymity, and social norms acted as barriers to help-seeking. Policy-related barriers to help-seeking included lack of medical services and physical distance from medical institutions, leading to a time burden. The study discussed the identified factors from a rural context. Future studies should consider the identified barriers and facilitators according to the four main themes in rural areas when formulating interventions to promote help-seeking. Our findings can offer a theoretical foundation to develop actionable policies, preventive strategies, and relevant interventional tools that may facilitate oncological service utilization in rural areas. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: The internet provides convenient access to information about non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) owing to its accessibility and anonymity. This study aimed to explore the distribution of topics regarding NSSI posted on the internet and yearly trends in the derived topics using text mining. Methods: We searched for the keyword “non-suicidal self-injury” (Ja-Hae in Korean) in the Naver Q&A using the statistical package R. We analyzed 7893 NSSI-related questions posted between 2009 and 2018. Text mining was performed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on the dataset to determine associations between phrases and thus identify common themes in posts about NSSI. Results: In the LDA, we selected the following 10 most common topics: anger, family troubles, collecting information on NSSI, stress, concerns regarding NSSI scarring, ways to help a non-suicidal self-injurious friend, depression, medical advice, ways to perform or stop NSSI, and prejudices and thoughts regarding non-suicidal self-injurious people. Conclusions: This study provides valuable information on the nature of NSSI questions posted online. In future research, developing websites that provide NSSI information and support or guidance on effectively communicating with NSSI is necessary. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Racism constitutes a barrier towards achieving equitable healthcare as documented in research showing unequal processes of delivering, accessing, and receiving healthcare across countries and healthcare indicators. This review summarizes studies examining how racism is discussed and produced in the process of delivering, accessing and receiving healthcare across various national contexts. Method: The PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed and databases were searched for peer reviewed empirical articles in English across national contexts. No starting date limitation was applied for this review. The end date was December 1, 2020. The review scoped 213 articles. The results were summarized, coded and thematically categorized in regards to the aim. Results: The review yielded the following categories: healthcare users’ experiences of racism in healthcare; healthcare staff’s experiences of racism; healthcare staff’s racial attitudes and beliefs; effects of racism in healthcare on various treatment choices; healthcare staff’s reflections on racism in healthcare and; antiracist training in healthcare. Racialized minorities experience inadequate healthcare and being dismissed in healthcare interactions. Experiences of racism are associated with lack of trust and delay in seeking healthcare. Racialized minority healthcare staff experience racism in their workplace from healthcare users and colleagues and lack of organizational support in managing racism. Research on healthcare staff’s racial attitudes and beliefs demonstrate a range of negative stereotypes regarding racialized minority healthcare users who are viewed as difficult. Research on implicit racial bias illustrates that healthcare staff exhibit racial bias in favor of majority group. Healthcare staff’s racial bias may influence medical decisions negatively. Studies examining healthcare staff’s reflections on racism and antiracist training show that healthcare staff tend to construct healthcare as impartial and that healthcare staff do not readily discuss racism in their workplace. Conclusions: The USA dominates the research. It is imperative that research covers other geo-political contexts. Research on racism in healthcare is mainly descriptive, atheoretical, uses racial categories uncritically and tends to ignore racialization processes making it difficult to conceptualize racism. Sociological research on racism could inform research on racism as it theoretically explains racism’s structural embeddedness, which could aid in tackling racism to provide good quality care. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives: This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods: A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results: 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions: Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Social media interactions invariably include trolling, where disruptive or annoying comments are made online, and gender trolling is one aspect of trolling. Gender trolling in India has turned ugly, with mischievous and offensive tweets transforming into threats. However, far too little research has examined the perceptions of such trolling among women. What do Indian women on Twitter feel about trolling? Are they encountering prejudice on the platform as well? How do they cope with vitriolic trolls and online threats? This study employs a feminist narrative approach to evaluate perceptions of gender trolling among women on Twitter in India. The study aims to understand the impact of online trolling among Indian women Twitter influencers. Insights into their online trolling experiences from twenty-five selected women social media influencers on Twitter were gathered through detailed interviews. This study unravelled some critical observations and responses towards gender trolling among women Twitter influencers in India. The research also explored if the regularization of misogynistic laced gender trolling within the Indian online space alters the way women social media influencers respond to trolling. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity in Australia is rapidly increasing. Although Indigenous Australians account for only approximately 3.5% of the country’s population, over 50% of Australians were born overseas or have at least one migrant parent. Migration accounts for over 60% of Australia’s population growth, with migration from Asia, Sub-Saharan African and the Americas increasing by 500% in the last decade. Little is known about Australian mental health care practitioners’ attitudes toward this diversity and their level of cultural competence. Aim: Given the relationship between practitioner cultural competence and the mental health outcomes of non-White clients, this study aimed to identify factors that influence non-White and White practitioners’ cultural competence. Methods: An online questionnaire was completed by 139 Australian mental health practitioners. The measures included: the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR); the Multicultural Counselling Inventory (MCI); and the Color-blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS). Descriptive statistics were used to summarise participants’ demographic characteristics. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests were conducted to identify between-group differences (non-White compared to White practitioners) in cultural competence and racial and ethnic blindness. Correlation analyses were conducted to determine the association between participants’ gender or age and cultural competence. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict cultural competence. Results: The study demonstrates that non-White mental health practitioners are more culturally aware and have better multicultural counselling relationships with non-White people than their White counterparts. Higher MCI total scores (measuring cultural competence) were associated with older age, greater attendance of cultural competence-related trainings and increased awareness of general and pervasive racial and/or ethnic discrimination. Practitioners with higher MCI total scores were also likely to think more highly of themselves (e.g., have higher self-deceptive positive enhancement scores on the BIDR) than those with lower MCI total scores. Conclusion: The findings highlight that the current one-size-fits-all and skills-development approach to cultural competence training ignores the significant role that practitioner diversity and differences play. The recommendations from this study can inform clinical educators and supervisors about the importance of continuing professional development relevant to practitioners’ age, racial/ethnic background and practitioner engagement with prior cultural competence training. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In many countries, policy makers and practitioners turn to prejudice reduction programs and interventions to tackle prejudice in the community. However, successfully addressing prejudice requires an effective intervention that can scale to match the broad span of the problem. The scalability assessment frameworks from health sciences have varying emphasis on four categories—intervention, delivery, costs, and context. For example, the high-level factors in the two Milat et al. scalability assessments are weighted towards details of the intervention (Milae et al. in Health Promot Int 28(3):285–981, 2013; Health Res Policy Syst 2:1–17, 2020). Investigation into scalability, specific to prejudice reduction, is necessary to understand how scalability frameworks apply in a different discipline. Methods: Using a Delphi approach—a structured method to obtain consensus from experts (Milae et al. Health Promot Int 28(3):285–981, 2013; Linstone and Turoff in The Delphi method—techniques and applications, Addison-Wesley, 1975; de Meyrick in Health Educ 103(1):7–16, 2003)—to bring together 16 prejudice reduction experts from multiple sectors including NGOs, private, government and academia, we developed a scalability assessment framework of criteria that are important for the successful scaling of prejudice interventions. We then applied that framework to exemplars of prejudice reduction interventions published in the academic literature. Results: For prejudice reduction interventions, contextual factors are key considerations for successful scaling. Commonly used prejudice reduction intervention approaches like contact, whether face-to-face or online, can have limited scalability. Conclusions: To reduce prejudice there needs to be consideration of scalability. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind framework for assessing scalability for prejudice reduction interventions. Applying the empirically developed framework to actual interventions demonstrated that for interventions to be effective and scalable, a greater focus on approaches beyond face-to-face contact is required. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Mental health literacy (MHL) is an evolving concept encompassing knowledge of mental illness, help-seeking options, perceived stigma, and discrimination. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at enhancing MHL. A human library intervention was adopted to enhance MHL in this study. The human library intervention aims to establish a positive framework and safe space for dialogue between readers and a ‘human book’. It works to promote dialogue, reduce prejudice, and encourage understanding of people who are regarded as disadvantaged or in a minority group. Methods: An experimental approach with a multigroup pretest–posttest design was adopted. Forty-five participants aged between 18 and 23 years were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (human library intervention), comparison group (didactic teaching session), or control group (no intervention). Adapted vignette-based MHL scale scores were used as the outcome measures. The overall and subscale scores were included in the analysis. Results: The human library intervention group showed a significant improvement in overall MHL compared with the other two groups. In a multivariate analysis of the variance in subscale scores, the intervention was shown to significantly reduce stigma and preferred social distance, but had no significant effect on knowledge acquisition. Conclusions: The human library intervention is effective at enhancing overall MHL and reducing stigma and preferred social distance. Further studies are suggested to further develop the MHL construct, human library interventions, and the MHL scales for consolidating evidence-based practice. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Educational attainment is a key social determinant of health. Health and education are linked by multiple pathways, many of which are not well understood. One such pathway is the association between being above a healthy weight and lower academic achievement. While various explanations have been put forward to explain this relationship, evidence for causal pathways is sparse and unclear. This study addresses that evidence gap. Methods: We interviewed 19 adults (late 20s; 14 female, 5 male) and one young person (14 years, male) from the UK in 2019/2020. Participants were recruited from the ALSPAC 1990s birth cohort, sampled to ensure diversity in socio-economic status and educational attainment, and a community-based weight management group for young people. Interviews focused on experiences of being above a healthy weight during secondary school and how this may have affected their learning and achievement. Interviews were face-to-face, digitally recorded, and transcribed verbatim. We analysed the data thematically. Results: We identified key pathways through which higher body weight may negatively impact educational performance and showed how these are linked within a novel theoretical model. Because larger body size is highly stigmatised, participants engaged in different strategies to minimise their exposure to negative attention. Participants sought to increase their social acceptance or become less socially visible (or a combination of both). A minority navigated this successfully; they often had many friends (or the ‘right’ friends), experienced little or no bullying at school and weight appeared to have little effect on their achievement at school. For most however, the behaviours resulting from these strategies (e.g. disruptive behaviour, truanting, not working hard) or the physical, social or mental impacts of their school experiences (e.g. hungry, tired, self-conscious, depressed) made it difficult to concentrate and/or participate in class, which in turn affected how teachers viewed them. Conclusions: Action to combat weight stigma, both within schools and in wider society, is urgently required to help address these educational disparities that in turn can impact health in later life. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Migration is the basis for development—economic, social, and psychological. In this paper I will examine borders on migration that entail the ambivalent relating by the societal context of migration to the act of movement of the people who become migrants, and their counterparts (“counter-migrants”) who do not. My focus on the issue stems from my theory of Cultural Psychology of Semiotic Dynamics that can deal with the process of becoming, being, and feeling as “migrant” or “counter-migrant”. A societal rule system is fortified by the system of social representations of the people who—by the act of moving from one place to another—are designated to become migrants by the rule systems of the non-migrants. Cultural psychology contributes to the study of the emerging prejudices and ways of their overcoming by the non-migrant local recipients as well as to the ambivalences of the persons who move to the relating with the social role “migrant” and its overcoming. Historically speaking—we as the species of Homo sapiens are all migrants—only at differing times and circumstances. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Telehealth and online health information provide patients with increased access to healthcare services and health information in chronic disease management of older patients with chronic diseases, addressing the challenge of inadequate health resources and promoting active and informed participation of older patients in chronic disease management. There are few qualitative studies on the application of telehealth and online health information to chronic disease management in older patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in older adults. Telehealth is widely used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of older patients and healthcare providers in the application of telehealth and online health information to chronic disease management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study with data generated from 52 individual semi-structured interviews with 29 patients [Law of the People’s Republic of China on the protection of the rights and interests of older people (2018 Revised Version) = >60 years old] with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 23 healthcare providers. The inductive thematic analysis method was used for data analysis. Results: Four themes and 16 sub-themes were identified in this study. Four themes included: faced with a vast amount of online health information, essential competencies and personality traits ensuring older patients’ participation and sustained use, user experience with the use of technology, being in a complex social context. Conclusion: The ability of patients to understand health information should be fully considered while facilitating access to online health information for older patients. The role of health responsibility and user experience in older patients’ participation and sustained use of telehealth and online health information needs to be emphasised. In addition, the complex social context is a determining factor to be considered, particularly the complex impact of a reliance on offspring and social prejudice on the behaviour of older adults using telehealth and online health information. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Inter-public conflict has largely been neglected in PR research. When left to fester, such conflict may perpetuate prejudice, injustice, inequality, and other societal ills. From a PR standpoint, organizations may find it increasingly difficult to operate in the resulting climate of hostility. This piece aims to shift focus from managing direct, organization-public conflict to navigating indirect, inter-public conflict, thus broadening conflict management perspectives. Based on contingency and social identity theories, we test the dual orientation conflict model (DOCM) in the field of government public relations. The model posits two dimensions (embracing/excluding and in-group/out-group) and categorizes four types of conflict orientation (adaptation, in-group adoption, out-group adoption, and avoidance). The proposed four-factor model, comprised of 16 items, was found to be reliable and valid in an online survey of 2498 South Korean citizens across different conflictual problems. Theoretical and strategic implications are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Two studies examined how individual differences relate to prejudiced attitudes toward asylum seekers. Results consistently showed that prejudiced people had relatively low scores on Honesty-Humility and relatively high scores on the Dark Tetrad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and everyday sadism) and ideological beliefs (social dominance orientation, patriotism, and nationalism). More importantly, multiple regression analyses revealed that the Dark Tetrad (in particular, Machiavellianism) provided incremental validity beyond Honesty–Humility in predicting explicit prejudice, but both the Dark Tetrad and Honesty-Humility were outpredicted by ideological beliefs. These findings suggest that the narrower Dark Tetrad personality traits provide additional useful information for explaining intergroup attitudes beyond the broader Honesty-Humility personality trait. However, the Dark Tetrad traits (and Honesty-Humility) are only distal determinants of explicit prejudice, while ideological beliefs are the proximal determinant. Study 2 also included a measure of implicit prejudice toward asylum seekers. Overall, Honesty-Humility, the Dark Tetrad, and ideological beliefs were much less predictive of implicit (compared to explicit) prejudiced attitudes. © 2022 The Author

This case study was guided by the frameworks of New Juan Crow in Education and racial microaggressions. Using ethnographic data from observations, semi-structured interviews with educators, and oral history interviews with Latina/o/x students, this study examined the experiences of student participants with institutional microaggressions and the influence on college-going aspirations.

AB  - Friendships between members of different ethnoracial groups can help to reduce prejudice and ease tensions across ethnoracial groups. A large body of literature has explored possible determinants for the formation of these friendships. One unexplored factor is the role of an individual's skin color in influencing their opportunities to befriend members of other ethnoracial groups. This study seeks to answer two questions: For ethnoracial minorities, how is an individual's skin color associated with the likelihood that they will engage in a cross-ethnoracial friendship? Does the role of skin color depend on the ethnoracial combination of the two groups that befriend one another? Using waves 1, 2, and 3 of the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen and a series of multinomial logit models, the results suggest that the role of skin color is a function of the relative levels of social status of the two ethnoracial groups that befriend one another. I argue that lighter-skinned members of lower status ethnoracial groups have a greater likelihood of having close friendships with members of higher status ethnoracial groups. There is also limited evidence that darker-skinned members of a higher status group, specifically Asians, have a greater likelihood of having close friends from a lower status group. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Anti-immigrant sentiment is frequently motivated by the idea that migrants are a threat to the host country's culture (Rapoport et al., 2020). We contribute to the discussion by investigating whether or not migrants adapt their social preferences (SPs) to those prevalent in their host country. Relying on a global and experimentally validated survey we show that migrants’ preferences strongly correlate with their host population's SPs and provide suggestive evidence of a causal relationship in line with the assimilation hypothesis. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The mutually exclusive authoritarianisms (i.e., nationalist, secular, and elitist vs. religious-Islamist) in West Asia (Middle East) do not correspond to the political structures in Euro-American settings (i.e., one traditional/conservative authority). This distinction suggests that the relationships of RWA and SDO with political ideologies and generalized prejudice might differ from the predictions of the dual-process motivational model of ideology and generalized prejudice (DPM). To investigate this idea, we used the DPM's structure with culture-sensitive hypotheses in the light of the socio-cultural work on ideologies and social dynamics in Turkey. In Study 1 (N = 259), belief in a competitive jungle positively predicted SDO, and belief in a dangerous world did not predict RWA. RWA negatively predicted left-wing and positively predicted right-wing ideology. SDO negatively predicted left-wing ideology but did not predict right-wing ideology. In Study 2 (N = 312), the relations between worldviews and attitudinal orientations replicated. Further, we developed a context-specific (i.e., Turkey) generalized prejudice measure to test the hypotheses associated with intergroup prejudice, which had a factor structure compatible with the DPM. SDO predicted prejudice toward derogated groups positively and dangerous groups negatively, and it was not relevant to the attitudes toward dissident groups in Turkey. RWA predicted prejudice toward dissident and dangerous groups positively, and derogated groups negatively. These two studies showed the importance of analyzing political ideology and intergroup prejudice from a cultural-ecological perspective by revealing the contextual characteristics constructing social relations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alan Turing’s﻿ ﻿1950﻿ imitation game has been widely understood as a means for testing if an entity is intelligent. Following a series of papers by Diane Proudfoot, I offer a socio-technological interpretation of Turing’s paper and present an alternative way of understanding both the imitation game and Turing’s concept of intelligence. Turing, I claim, saw intelligence as a social concept, meaning that possession of intelligence is a property determined by society’s attitude toward the entity. He realized that as long as human society held a prejudiced attitude toward machinery—seeing machines a priori as mindless objects—machines could not be said to be intelligent, by definition. He also realized, though, that if humans’ a priori, chauvinistic attitude toward machinery changed, the existence of intelligent machines would become logically possible. Turing thought that such a change would eventually occur: He believed that when scientists overcome the technological challenge of constructing sophisticated machines that could imitate human verbal behavior—i.e., do well in the imitation game—humans’ prejudiced attitude toward machinery will have altered in such a way that machines could be said to be intelligent. The imitation game, for Turing, was not an intelligence test, but a technological aspiration whose realization would likely involve a change in society’s attitude toward machines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma has corrosive effects on all aspects of care and can undermine individual and population health outcomes. Addiction-related stigma has implications for opiate agonist treatment (OAT) and the people who receive, provide and fund it. It is important to understand how stigma is made in OAT and the political purposes that it serves, in order to change the relations of stigma and avoid the reproduction of stigma in the delivery of new treatment formulations, such as extended release buprenorphine (BUP-XR). Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted at two time points with participants in a prospective single-arm, multicentre, open-label trial of monthly BUP-XR. Thirty-six participants (25 men, 11 women) were interviewed, and of these 32 participated in a second interview to explore their experience of transition from other treatment to BUP-XR. Results: Participants were highly aware of the of the social and material effects of stigma through the negative stereotypes attached to OAT and those who receive it. Participants narrated examples of how stigma governed as a biopower in the relations and practices of OAT provision at numerous levels: structural (such as in public discourse about OAT and the people who receive it, in media, in perceptions about the decisions of investment in medical technologies); organisational (policies about legitimate access to OAT); interpersonal (with health workers) and individual (self-identities). BUP-XR allowed greater freedom and normalcy for clients. The experience of BUP-XR drew attention to the stigmatising potential of time, place and things associated with other OAT requiring daily (or frequent) dosing, accentuating how stigma comes to be materialised as a relational effect of everyday practices. Conclusions: Receiving BUP-XR allowed participants to avoid some of the everyday biopolitical powers of other forms of OAT and to reshape self-identities. The altering of relations between time, place and things associated with other forms of OAT allowed participants to feel as though they “pass as normal”. However, the negative public discourse and stigma of OAT is a potential threat to BUP-XR to realise its potential for individual and population benefits. © 2022

AB  - Anti-racist messages educate people about structural racism and argue that indifference and inaction are the foundational building-blocks of race-based inequities. But these messages generate backlash, with several American states banning education about structural racism. We hypothesized that White Americans experience White identity threat and resist anti-racist messages most when they interpret these messages to equalize a lack of anti-racist action (i.e., indifference and silence), treating it as though it were the same as blatant racism. In contrast, we predicted that interpreting anti-racist messages to position silence as a foundational “building-block” for blatant racism would not evoke backlash. In Study 1 (N = 428) ~55% of White respondents in a representative American sample interpreted anti-racist messages as equating indifference with violence, and an equalizing interpretation predicted White identity threat and message resistance. In Study 2 (N = 492) we found that experimentally manipulating anti-racist messages to evoke high vs. low levels of equalizing interpretation led White Americans to feel more White identity threat and in turn be more resistant to both the anti-racist message and anti-racist action in general. In Study 3 (N = 1337) seeing anti-racist messages (vs. no-message) had little effect on White Americans in general, but evoked identity threat and denial of racism among White Americans high in equalizing interpretation who did not interpret the messages as conveying inaction to be a building-block for structural racism. In Study 4a and 4b (N = 789), we reveal a successful nudge for making anti-racist messages less threatening and more motivating for White Americans by using language less likely to evoke an equalizing interpretation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In pluralistic societies, encounters with individuals, contexts, and norms of other religions can prompt conflict. We test a novel framework for explaining how individuals apply religious norms across individuals and contexts. In Studies 1 and 2, adolescents and adults in India and the United States judged events in which religious norms were violated by protagonists of different religions in different religious contexts. Participants often judged that norm violations were wrong even when the norm religion matched only the protagonist or context religion. Study 3 presented dilemmas that pitted religious norms against non-religious concerns. Participants favored following the religious norm yet accepted the protagonist's right to violate it. In each adult sample, more religious participants more often judged that protagonists were obligated to follow the protagonist's own religious norms. These findings reveal individual and contextual determinants of judgments about religious violations with implications for peaceful coexistence in pluralistic societies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Racial disparities in the education setting are well-documented, including suspensions and expulsion for Black children beginning in pre-school. Racial bias has been hypothesized as a factor contributing to these disparities. However, little is known about the racial attitudes that childcare educators and staff have toward children. To describe levels of implicit and explicit racial bias toward children among early childhood educators, we measured implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias of teachers and staff from three urban childcare centers using the Child Race Implicit Association Test (IAT). Explicit bias was measured using a racial preference scale. Of the 48 participants in this sample, 56% were White, 29% Black, and 10% Hispanic. Although 21% (n = 10) of participants had no racial bias on the Child Race IAT, most had implicit pro-White bias ranging from weak to strong (n = 29%and 60%). The remaining participants had implicit pro-Black bias ranging from weak to strong (n = 9%and 19%). In contrast, 95% of participants reported no having no explicit racial preferences toward White or Black children. Additionally, we asked participants about perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs about sources of early childhood disparities. Knowledge of bias can be used in developing strategies to mitigate bias and reduce disparities in childcare settings. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Summary: Social workers are expected to challenge the exclusion and oppression of marginalised populations which requires the critical interrogation of prejudicial views, discriminatory attitudes, and oppressive practices. In this regard, social work practitioners need to be vigilant of their own attitudes toward the people they serve. This is relevant to social work practice with sexual minorities. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods study informed by a critical theoretical frame that explored Vietnamese social work practitioners’ attitudes toward sexual minorities. The findings presented in this article were drawn from a survey of 292 social work practitioners based in Hanoi, Vietnam and 12 semi-structured interviews with volunteers recruited from the pool of survey participants. Findings: The findings suggest that practitioners who participated in this study held relatively positive attitudes toward people who identify as lesbian or gay. However, those who had what could be considered moderate to positive attitudes were not necessarily free from prejudicial and discriminatory views, particularly when it came to certain matters such as those relating to their own families and work with young children. Applications: The discussion of the findings illustrate the relevance of the broader social context to Vietnamese social work practitioners’ attitudes toward sexual minorities. It highlights the potent influence of dominant ideologies in shaping prejudicial views and attitudes and points to the need for practice at a broader level targeting Vietnamese society and culture as a whole. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In this British Psychological Society (BPS) landmark paper, we employ an evidence synthesis approach to review the broad range of diversity research published in BPS journals between 2011 and 2021. By focusing on research that investigates stereotypes associated with, and discrimination towards, minority and minoritized groups, we seek to provide readers with a better understanding of the dynamics of a diverse workforce and, going forward, to facilitate the efforts of the psychology research community towards building a body of work that meaningfully addresses workplace inequalities. We thematically analyse and synthesize 25 articles, which fall into four interconnected themes: identity development and management; negative stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination; working in a diverse team; and the broader organizational environment. Highlighting key strengths of this work and areas for future development, we note the absence of overarching theoretical debates and discussions that might facilitate the development of an on-going narrative across diversity-related research published within BPS journals. We outline a future research agenda to bridge methodological divides and to connect with diversity literatures in related disciplines such as human resource development (HRD), human resource management (HRM), and organization studies. In so doing, we advocate for psychologists to move beyond a solely individualistic perspective and instead recognize and account for the context within which diversity-related processes take place. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In this article, the several factors have been investigated relating to the poor mental health of the children in Punjab, Pakistan. Using the data of the survey conducted by the Punjab Bureau of Statistics, different determinants of child malnutrition and poverty were diagnosed based upon sufficient information of the children under 5 year of age. Logistic regression analysis methodology has been applied for screening the most influential factors of the study. It has been observed that the rise in poverty has prejudiced the nutritional position of the children, the mother's education, and the fitness of the youth. It has also been observed that male children are more at risk to poor mental health than female children. A number of policy issues came to light from the findings of the study. The wealth index of all three anthropometric measures, the child malnutrition status of uneducated mothers, and the child diarrhea menace are the significant areas. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs) are a statutory requirement in England and Wales, conducted when somebody aged 16 and over dies from violence, abuse or neglect by a relative, intimate partner or member of the same household. While key aims of DHRs are to identify recommendations and lessons learned to eventually prevent further domestic homicides, there is limited evidence globally regarding the extent to which these are followed up or make a difference. This paper explores the barriers and facilitators to the conduct and impact of DHRs to enhance their learning potential. It is based on nineteen qualitative interviews with professionals involved in the DHR process across five Safeguarding Boards in Wales and fourteen Community Safety Partnerships in the North-West of England, UK. Findings are presented thematically under four section headings: upskilling and democratising the review process; family and friends’ involvement; negotiating organisational blame to foster learning; and actioning and auditing recommendations. It is suggested that organisational learning cannot be achieved without accepting organisational responsibility, which could be interpreted as blame. The role and skills of the Chair are perceived as key to ensure a safe, evidence-based, transparent and learning-focused DHR process. Developing and actioning recommendations may challenge longstanding prejudices. Promoting the role of families/survivor networks and professionals on an equal footing would support a more democratic process. Learning could be enhanced by thematising recommendations and proactively using lessons from one area to inform another. Participants called for appropriate central regulation and accountability to support the action of recommendations. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: There is no doubt that racial biases contribute to the overrepresentation of people of colour in the justice system. Specialized violence risk tools are meant to increase the objectivity with which certain legal decisions are made. However, the degree to which racial biases influence risk-related decisions remains unclear despite the use of these tools. Methods: This study examined whether a hypothetical defendant's race would influence the risk-related perceptions and decisions of 280 jury-eligible participants in the United States when presented with expert opinions concerning the defendant's likelihood of future violence. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions that varied the identified race of the defendant (i.e., Black, White, or not reported). Results: Participants reported their perceptions about the defendant's likelihood of violence, desired social distance from the defendant, and the severity of punishment they would recommend. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no statistically significant effects of defendant race on risk decisions, suggesting that expert testimony may have mitigated the influence of race. However participants higher in explicit racial bias were more likely to perceive a Black defendant as higher risk; no association between racial attitudes and risk perception emerged in the other defendant conditions. Conclusions: Limitations and future directions for research, including methods for increasing external validity, assessing impression management, and diversifying demographics, are discussed. In the current socio-political climate, it is imperative that forensic psychological research continue to explore the ways in which racial biases may lead to inequitable psycho-legal decisions. © 2021 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - The issue of reparations to the descendants of persons enslaved in the United States is receiving increasing attention in both the public sphere (e.g., 2020 Presidential campaigns) and in academic circles. However, the term “reparations” often goes undefined in such discussions, despite the fact that different types of government action (e.g., an apology versus financial payments) are associated with varying levels of public opposition (or support). We also know little about how attitudes toward reparations explicitly targeting the consequences of slavery differ from attitudes toward more generic race-targeted policies. Drawing on data from an online survey of white Americans conducted in 2016, we examine how levels of opposition to a range of different race-targeted government actions varies by (1) the type and aims of the intervention, and (2) whites’ social locations and political orientations. Regarding policy type, whites are least opposed to selected symbolic reparations (e.g., a memorial to enslaved persons) and to policies designed to ensure “fair treatment” of black Americans in the workplace. Whites are most opposed to reparations in the form of direct financial payments to black Americans and to policies involving “preferential treatment” of blacks in the workplace. In addition, whites who are older, more conservative, and who view race relations as unimportant are most opposed to the reparations and other race-based policies we examine. We conclude with suggestions for future work on this timely topic. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this theoretical article, we argue that discourses of diversity are shifting. In segments of the population in Western countries, the discourses on diversity appear to be shifting from multiculturalism towards narrower monoculturalism, nationalism and prejudice. We here argue that the discursive space to voice such opinions have widened. The liberal left has long been accused of “imposing” values of diversity and multiculturalism on societies, and statements that previously were largely seen as publicly unacceptable (e.g. derogatory language regarding minorities), are now becoming more mainstream (again). Drawing on social identity theory, feeling rules and critical discourse analysis, we highlight how public discourses emphasizing “us” versus “them” are shifting. Claims are highlighted through the case of Brexit, where both campaigns arguably made use of anti-immigration discourses, but where particularly the Leave campaign in general, and sections of the leave campaign in particular, contributed to legitimating negative and derogatory stances towards “others”. The article is a timely contribution to consequential directions in discourses related to monoculturalism, prejudice and definitions of “us” and “them”. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

AB  - When people are placed in a situation where they are at risk of substantiating a negative stereotype about their social group (a scenario termed stereotype threat), the extra pressure to avoid this outcome can undermine their performance. Substantial and consistent gender disparities in STEM fields leave women vulnerable to stereotype threat, including the stereotype that women are not as good at generating creative and innovative ideas as men. We tested whether female students’ creative thinking is affected by a stereotype threat by measuring power in the alpha frequency band (8–12Hz oscillations) that has been associated with better creative thinking outcomes. Counter to expectations that a stereotype threat would reduce alpha power associated with creative thinking, analyses showed increased alpha power following the introduction of the stereotype threat. This outcome suggests that women may have attempted to increase their internal attention during the task in order to disprove the stereotype. Behaviorally, this effort did not lead to changes in creative performance, suggesting that the stereotype threat decoupled alpha power from creative thinking outcomes. These results support a growing school of thought in the neuroscience of creativity literature that the alpha power often seen in conjunction with creative behavior is not necessarily related to the creativity processes themselves, but rather might be part of a larger network modulating the distribution of attentional resources more broadly. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - How do social group boundaries evolve? Does the appearance of a new out-group change the in-group's perceptions of other out-groups? We introduce a conceptual framework of context-dependent categorization in which exposure to one minority leads to recategorization of other minorities as in-or out-groups depending on perceived distances across groups. We test this framework by studying how Mexican immigration to the United States affected white Americans' attitudes and behaviors toward Black Americans. We combine survey and crime data with a difference-in-differences design and an instrumental variables strategy. Consistent with the theory, Mexican immigration improves whites' racial attitudes, increases support for pro-Black government policies, and lowers anti-Black hate crimes while simultaneously increasing prejudice against Hispanics. Results generalize beyond Hispanics and Blacks, and a survey experiment provides direct evidence for recategorization. Our findings imply that changes in the size of one group can affect the entire web of intergroup relations in diverse societies. ©

AB  - Purpose: Several previous studies showed strong social stigma toward mental illness patients from the health-care providers (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia. This stigma affects the level of care provided by HCPs. Stigma is a major barrier in treating schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Thus, it is important to clarify the difference regarding the social stigma between both diagnoses. This study aimed to identify and compare the existence of social stigma among HCPs towards schizophrenia patients compared to OCD patients. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 283 HCPs from King Abdullah Medical City (KAMC), Makkah, Saudi Arabia, were enrolled in this cross-sectional questionnaire-based study between middle and end of January 2021. The scale included a demographic questionnaire plus two vignette cases reflecting OCD and schizophrenia patients’ symptoms without mentioning diagnosis. Each case was followed with 18 questions, which measured some of the thoughts and attitudes of the social stigma of mental illnesses including negative stereotypes, discrimination, social distancing and emotional and cognitive prejudices against mental illness patients. The scale was validated by a pilot study (which included 15 other participants) with acceptable validity and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha: 81.4%). Findings: Most participants’ responses were “low” in the total score of their stigma score for both diagnosis [OCD (84.1%), mean ± SD (1.15 ± 0.366) and schizophrenia (74.2%), mean ± SD (1.25 ± 0.438)]. However, those who responded “high” in their stigma score regarding the schizophrenia section were higher in their number than those who responded “high” in the OCD section (25.8% vs 15.9%). Most participants had “low” total stigma scores for both diagnoses [OCD (84.1%), mean ± SD (1.15 ± 0.366) and schizophrenia (74.2%), mean ± SD (1.25 ± 0.438)]. However, of those with “high” stigma score responses, more were for the schizophrenia section compared to the OCD section (25.8% vs 15.9%). Being flexible to recruit any of them was more related to promoting them if they deserve promotion. The sample that answered wrong regarding OCD vignette diagnosis and had “high” stigma score was higher (n = 40) than the sample that answered correctly and had “high” stigma score (n = 5). In contrast, the sample that answered wrong regarding the schizophrenia case diagnosis and had “high” stigma score (n = 41) was not significantly different in terms of its number compared to the one that answered correctly and had “high” stigma score (n = 32). Research limitations/implications: One aspect that reduces the strength of this study is that the target number of the participants could not be reached, meaning a 95% confidence level with a ±5% margin of error could not be reached. Another limitation is the lack of contact between HCPs at the KAMC in Makkah with mental illness patients owing to lack of psychiatric inpatient departments. However, this limitation may be a strength for this study, as we were able to primarily measure medical HCPs rather than psychiatric HCPs. Although the vignette methodology in stigma studies has many benefits, the participants do not respond to real patients, and therefore miss appearance and other nonverbal cues that are typically present in real interactions. Originality/value: The social stigma level among HCPs against schizophrenia patients is higher than that against OCD patients. The factor of knowing the diagnosis of the case has a positive effect on decreasing stigma toward OCD patients but not toward schizophrenia patients. Educational awareness about stigma against mental illness patients to HCPs, rather than focusing on increasing literature knowledge, may decrease stigma among HCPs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Beliefs can be highly resilient in the sense that they are not easily abandoned in the face of counterevidence. This has the advantage of guiding consistent behavior and judgments but may also have destructive consequences for individuals, nature, and society. For instance, pathological beliefs can sustain psychiatric disorders, the belief that rhinoceros horn is an aphrodisiac may drive a species extinct, beliefs about gender or race may fuel discrimination, and belief in conspiracy theories can undermine democracy. Here, we present a unifying framework of how self-amplifying feedbacks shape the inertia of beliefs on levels ranging from neuronal networks to social systems. Sustained exposure to counterevidence can destabilize rigid beliefs but requires organized rational override as in cognitive behavioral therapy for pathological beliefs or institutional control of discrimination to reduce racial biases. Black-and-white thinking is a major risk factor for the formation of resilient beliefs associated with psychiatric disorders as well as prejudices and conspiracy thinking. Such dichotomous thinking is characteristic of a lack of cognitive resources, which may be exacerbated by stress. This could help explain why conspiracy thinking and psychiatric disorders tend to peak during crises. A corollary is that addressing social factors such as poverty, social cleavage, and lack of education may be the most effective way to prevent the emergence of rigid beliefs, and thus of problems ranging from psychiatric disorders to prejudices, conspiracy theories, and posttruth politics. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Minority faculty and trainees experience unique factors that can hinder their success in academic medicine - collectively referred to as "minority tax." The authors argue that a similar "deaf tax" of unique barriers, experiences, and responsibilities disproportionately burdens deaf trainees and faculty. The cumulative effects of these deaf tax experiences represent a significant disadvantage for deaf professionals in academic medicine. Through a combination of relevant literature and the authors' personal experiences as deaf professionals, several causative domains of deaf tax are outlined, including the fight for reasonable accommodations, prejudice and discrimination, training and diversity barriers, and a lack of deaf mentorship. In addition, a number of practical steps are offered for institutional leaders to consider implementing to improve equity and inclusion in academic medicine, including facilitating language equity and communication access, implementing deaf awareness training, fostering effective deaf mentorship, and promoting deaf professionals into leadership positions. Addressing these issues would help remove the obstacles that create the high deaf tax burden and lower the near-insurmountable barrier of entry, advancement, and retention in academic medicine for deaf professionals. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Peasant support was a crucial factor in the Bolivian military's assault on labor and the Left in the 1960s and 1970s. Analysts have offered diverse explanations for the so-called Military-Peasant Pact, ranging from the bribery of peasant leaders to rank-and-file conservatism. These interpretations tend to be methodologically superficial and often reflect elitist prejudices about peasant behavior. Archival evidence and oral histories from Cochabamba suggest that the pact did enjoy substantial rank-and-file support. The military maintained that support by protecting peasant land rights and expanding rural access to public goods while imposing high costs on peasants who dissented. However, the Military-Peasant Pact was also more tenuous than most scholarship implies. Attempts to institute a new tax on land, to disarm peasants, and to impose austerity measures engendered major opposition by the 1970s, leading to a military massacre in 1974. This trajectory reveals both the foundations and limits of the military's power. © 2022 Duke University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This qualitative, community-based participatory research (CBPR) study examines the occurrence of LGBTQ+ stigma in healthcare guided by the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework. We conducted focus groups with healthcare professionals, analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Stigma drivers included knowledge deficits and transphobia. Facilitators were the binary organization of medical education and training, cisnormative system procedures, a lack of enforceable policy to reduce stigma, and workplace culture and norms. Stigma practices, such as prejudicial attitudes, gossip, and misgendering, primarily focused on transgender individuals. This study reinforces the need to reduce LGBTQ+ stigma in healthcare settings, with implications for multi-level interventions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - More people than ever migrate across the world, thereby more people than ever live, study, and work in countries, regions, and institutions with high immigrant presence. Conflict and threat theories have argued that increasing immigration inevitably heightens native citizens' anti-immigrant prejudice. Drawing on alternate strands of social psychological literature such as contact theory, the present study challenges this argument. We highlight the role of the sociopolitical context of prejudice focusing on socioeconomic and legal integration policies. We reason that such integration policies shape intergroup relations by reducing structural (socioeconomic and legal) inequalities. Thus, inclusive policies will effectively reduce prejudice especially at high levels of immigrant presence through empowering immigrants and reducing immigrant disadvantage. Indeed our findings identify inclusive integration policies as a key condition for low anti-immigrant prejudice in high-immigration contexts. We analyze surveys of 143,752 participants across 66 different countries, 20 subnational regions, and 64 institutions as sociopolitical contexts using six different data sets in eight studies. Our multilevel analyses consistently demonstrate that anti-immigrant prejudice is lower among natives when higher levels of immigrant presence are coupled with inclusive, rather than exclusive, integration policies. Inclusive policies that render immigrants more equal to natives are the path to improved intergroup relations and social cohesion in diverse societies.

AB  - Introduction: There have been numerous reports of cluster outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitals and nursing homes. Healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 experience mental health issues. Caregivers in nursing homes experienced increased psychological distress and concern about deterioration of their mental health. We conducted a large-scale web-based survey exploring mental health among caregivers working in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of identifying their support needs. Methods: Survey participants were caregivers working at 284 nursing homes in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. The survey period was from September 2020 to March 2021. Participants responded to a questionnaire covering gender, age, occupation, infections at facilities, infection protection, changes in nursing home users, cooperation with other medical institutions, and prejudice/discrimination. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate participants' depression and anxiety. Results: In total, 676 participants completed the survey; 350 (52.5%) were with anxiety symptoms and 378 (56.7%) were with depressive symptoms (scores exceeding the HADS cut-off points). The risk for anxiety was associated with being care worker or social worker. The risk of anxiety or depression was high when family caregivers' mental state changed. Discussion/Conclusion: This study found that caregivers working in nursing homes were exposed to high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and were at high risk for developing depression and anxiety. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The use of non-motorized transportation and micro-mobility is increasing in many cities. Bicycle riding and e-scooter use are now more common and affordable than ever. However, users of these devices face certain key issues. These include their own risky behaviors as well as involvement in conflicts with other road users. Self-report data may not adequately capture these behaviors and interactions. Despite this, more objective data (i.e., how third parties perceive these users’ road behaviors) is scarce. Aims: This study aimed to understand whether e-scooter riders have comparable or different riding behaviors than cyclists. This was investigated using a mixed-method study. Methods: This paper is divided into two sub-studies. In Study 1, 950 Spanish non-cyclists and non-e-scooter riders (mean age 31.98 ± 13.27 years; 55.3% female) provided external ratings (proxies) regarding the perceived behaviors of bicycle and e-scooter riders. In Study 2, collective Rapid Assessment Processes (RAPs; n = 23) were used to develop qualitative configurations of some of the key risky behaviors highlighted in Study 1. Results: There were significant differences in the perceived errors and violations rated by proxies for both types of riders (with e-scooter riders perceived as having higher rates of risky behaviors). However, there were also structural differences in the effects of external raters’ risk perceptions, traffic rule knowledge, and traffic incidents with two-wheeled riders on how they rated the behaviors. Conclusion: The results of both studies suggest that external raters’ perceptions provide further understanding of the causes, dynamics, and conflicts related to road behaviors performed by certain groups of road users. This is particularly apparent when there is no clear legislation and information on safe riding in urban areas. In this sense, improving infrastructure could promote safer interactions. Finally, road safety education could focus on promoting safer practices and interactions in order to improve how others perceive riders’ behavior. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Caring for a child with cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging and stressful and even more so in a country with limited resources. Our aim was to study the impact of CF on the daily life of mothers with children who have CF in Tunisia, emphasizing the difficulties encountered. Methods: Overall, 20 participants were interviewed about their experiences of being caregivers and mothers of children with CF, including their knowledge about the condition, their attitude toward it, the impact of CF on their daily lives, the main difficulties they had faced, and their concerns and wishes about CF management. Results: The median age of the interviewees was 39 years. None of the mothers had known about CF before; 14 of them had difficulty accepting it at first, with suicidal thoughts in one case. Six hid the illness from the close family for fear of negative prejudices. Three mothers decided to stop having children despite availability of prenatal screening. CF also influenced the mothers’ social activities (n = 13) and interfered with their jobs (n = 5). It was responsible for additional expenses in all cases. Chest physiotherapy represented a daily source of coping for all participants. Hospitalization related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was considered stressful and constraining by 12 mothers. The mothers’ main concern was the child's life expectancy (n = 7). Their main wish was to administer a curative treatment (n = 17). Conclusion: CF was found to have deeply affected the mothers’ psychosocial life stressing the need for the involvement of qualified psychologists and social workers together with the medical staff. © 2022 French Society of Pediatrics

AB  - Drug-related overdose deaths topped 100,000 between 2020 and 2021. Opioids and stimulants are implicated as the primary drivers of this public health crisis. Stigma remains one of the primary barriers to treatment and recovery from substance use disorders. However, little is known about how stigma varies across different substance types, whether individuals are actively using or in recovery, and medical versus recreational onset. We examined these questions using data from the 2021 Shatterproof Addiction Stigma Index, the only nationally representative data available on this topic. Respondents (N = 7051) completed a vignette-based survey experiment to assess public stigma (social distance, prejudice, competence, and causal attributions) toward people with alcohol, opioid (following a prescription pain or recreational use onset), heroin, or methamphetamine dependencies. Vignette characters were described as active users or in recovery. Adjusting for covariates (e.g., race, age, gender), prejudice and desire for social distance were highest toward heroin and methamphetamine, and lowest toward alcohol dependence. The perceived onset of the dependency affected stigma. Specifically, prescription opioids with a recreational onset were more stigmatized than those with a medical onset. Moreover, individuals depicted as being in recovery were less stigmatized than those depicted as active users. Recovery status had the largest impact on prejudice and social distance toward methamphetamine, relative to other conditions. The nature and magnitude of substance dependency stigma differs across substance types and onset and offset conditions. Reducing stigma will require tailored strategies that consider the multidimensional nature of stigma toward people with addiction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Self-judgement is known to play a crucial role in academic achievement, and as such, may be expected to have an impact on students with dyslexia. Their self-judgements may reflect the negative stereotype of low competence that targets people with disabilities. Their repeated academic failures may lead to a negative association between “school” and “failure”. The aim of the present study was to investigate how such factors contribute to academic failure in students with dyslexia. Participants were 183 French middle school students. We assessed students' self-judgement and manipulated the framing of performance tasks so that students completed literacy tasks in both academic and non-academic forms. We expected a detrimental impact of dyslexia on performance in academic but not in non-academic tasks. We also expected self-judgement to account for this difference. Students with dyslexia perceive themselves as less competent than students without dyslexia. Significantly, structural equation modeling revealed that students with dyslexia performed poorly in academic tasks, compared to students without dyslexia. This difference no longer appeared in non-academic tasks. Self-judgement of competence is a predictor of the performance of students with and without dyslexia at school and their impact is related to how the academic features of the tasks are emphasized. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In three studies, it was tested whether children (N = 184; aged 6–10 years, White, mid- to high income) from a U.S. midwestern city used other individuals’ gender and race to predict who is in charge and the means by which power is gained (Study 1) and whether children's own gender predicted their assignments of positions of authority (Study 2A) and pursuits of positions of authority (Study 2B). When asked to predict who was in charge at different workplaces, with age White children decreased their race-based, power-related favoritism; children were increasingly likely with age to link White adults to rather questionable routes to power as well as Black adults with meritorious reasons for gaining power (Study 1). In addition, boys (but not girls) systematically associated power with adult workers of their own gender and did so regardless of whether or not power had been obtained meritoriously (Study 1). Nonetheless, when given the option to assign an authority role (Study 2A) or assume an authority role (Study 2B), boys and girls exhibited comparable levels of in-group and self-biases. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The human face is arguably the most important of all social stimuli because it provides so much valuable information about others. Therefore, one critical factor for successful social communication is the ability to process faces. In general, a wide body of social cognitive research has demonstrated that perceivers are better at extracting information from their own-race compared to other-race faces and that these differences can be a barrier to positive cross-race relationships. The primary objective of the present paper was to provide an overview of how people process faces in diverse contexts, focusing on racial ingroup and outgroup members within one nation and across nations. To achieve this goal, we first broadly describe social cognitive research on categorization processes related to ingroups vs. outgroups. Next, we briefly examine two prominent mechanisms (experience and motivation) that have been used to explain differences in recognizing facial identities and identifying emotions when processing ingroup and outgroup racial faces within nations. Then, we explore research in this domain across nations and cultural explanations, such as norms and practices, that supplement the two proposed mechanisms. Finally, we propose future cross-cultural research that has the potential to help us better understand the role of these key mechanisms in processing ingroup and outgroup faces. © 2022 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - A recent evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity suggests that women do not have sexual orientations in the same sense that men do, and instead women’s apparent sexual orientation is a function of their sociosexual orientation. Among other things, the theory predicts that women’s unrestricted sociosexual orientation decreases their negative attitude toward same-sex behavior, whereas men’s unrestricted sociosexual orientation increases it. An analysis of the General Social Surveys data shows that, net of age, education, race, religion, religiosity, political attitude, intelligence, urbanicity and region of residence, and survey year, sociosexually unrestricted women are less likely to believe homosexual relationships are always morally wrong, while sociosexuality was not associated with homophobia among men. The study provides further evidence for the evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ethnic diversity and interethnic contact are increasing in Europe. Intergroup contact theory suggests interethnic contact to improve interethnic attitudes, but for young children, parental attitudes toward child interethnic relations might be an important factor determining whether they are exposed to these potentially positive contact effects. This study therefore examined maternal attitudes toward child contact with different ethnic outgroups among 251 mothers (137 White Dutch, 69 Turkish-Dutch, and 45 Afro-Dutch) of a 6- to 10-year-old child (M = 7.51, SD = 0.98). Furthermore, associations between maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations and child outgroup rejection were examined, as well as mediation effects of child actual outgroup contact. Neutral to positive maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations were found, with relatively more negative attitudes among Turkish-Dutch than White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers, and toward child relations with Muslims as compared to another outgroup among White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers. Furthermore, results did not indicate that maternal attitudes were related to child actual outgroup contact or child outgroup prejudice and no support for the intergroup contact theory was found. These results suggest that intergroup contact theory does not easily apply, highlighting the need for more research on children in various populations and contexts using different measures and informants. Patterns from the present study suggest that most improvement in terms of maternal attitudes fostering child interethnic relations can be made in the interethnic relations including ethnic groups in the Netherlands that predominantly identify as Muslim. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In our current globalised, multicultural world, understanding antecedents of reciprocal interactions between native people and people of immigrant background is a major issue, because intergroup contact plays a crucial role in building inclusive societies. In this vein, using daily diary data, we examined the relation between the number of daily positive and negative interactions of White British majority (N = 744) and Asian British minority people (N = 582) with members of the respective outgroup, with RWA, SDO, perceived ingroup norms, neighbourhood diversity and contextual deprivation. Results showed that for the majority group, ingroup norms in favour of intergroup contact were positively associated with positive intergroup encounters, whereas Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was positively associated with negative intergroup contact. Neighbourhood diversity was positively associated with positive and negative intergroup encounters. Moreover, RWA moderated the relationship between neighbourhood diversity and both positive and negative contact of White British people. For the minority group, ingroup norms were positively associated with positive intergroup contact, and the relationship between ingroup norms and negative contact was moderated by SDO. Overall, different factors affect positive and negative intergroup contact of majority and minority groups. We discuss the implications of the findings for future research and interventions. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - We overwhelmingly utilize (partially) informed consent for, and debriefing of, human research participants. Also common is the practice of reconsent, particularly where changes in study protocols (or in participants themselves) occur midstream – participants consent again to remaining in the project or to having their data included. Worryingly under-discussed is post-debriefing reconsent, wherein participants can withdraw their data after learning more fully of the study's goals and methods. Yet, major ethics bodies in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom promote such practice, with vague and potentially problematic guidelines. Here, the author provides examples involving such reconsent practice, highlighting potentially serious problems that are scientific (e.g. threats to internal and external validity) and ethical (i.e. to the participant, their peers, the researcher and society) in nature. Particularly, problematic is the introduction, by design, of unknowable bias in our research findings. For example, highly prejudiced participants could withdraw data from a discrimination study after learning of the study's hypotheses and goals. The practice may arguably contradict an Open Science goal of increasing research transparency. This call for discussion about the direction of psychological science methods aims to engage a broader discussion in the research community. © 2022 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Previous studies have revealed that stereotyping processes involving negative affective content (e.g., antipathy) can lead to a significant increase in insula activity. However, whether the insula is sensitive to stereotype inconsistency or plays a crucial role in stereotype regulation remains unclear. To help fill this gap, 21 young adults were presented with a modified single-category implicit association test (SC-IAT) that assessed their stereotypes about rural migrant workers. In a within-subjects design, participants completed separate blocks of compatible and incompatible trials, each of which consisted of stereotype-consistent or stereotype-inconsistent trait labels that had a positive or a negative valence. Functional MRI was used to identify specific brain regions associated with negative and positive stereotyping. The behavioral results revealed a typical stereotype regulation effect in which participants responded slower to stereotype-inconsistent condition than stereotype-consistent condition, although such effect was significantly modulated by IAT compatibility, rather than by emotional valence. MRI results revealed that activity in the right insula was significantly sensitive to stereotype regulation processes in negative incompatible tasks, whereas such effect was marginally significant in positive incompatible tasks. Moreover, psychophysiological interaction analyses indicated complex functional connectivity among the right insula and cognitive control regions [e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)], social mentalizing regions [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)], and motivation regions (putamen) in the condition where negative stereotypes were violated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the right insula serves as a crucial node in regulating implicit stereotyping, particularly in negative stereotyping tasks. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Religious sectarian intolerance occurs when members of different religious sects within a faith are unable to tolerate the religious beliefs and practices of each resulting in bigotry and prejudice toward each other. The present research sought to develop a psychometrically sound measure of religious sectarian intolerance for Muslim adults. The research comprised two studies. Study I involved the development of an initial item pool for the Religious Sectarian Intolerance Scale (RSIS). The initial pool of items was based on thematic analysis from focus group discussions. This item pool was reviewed by a committee of experts resulting in a 39-item initial draft of the RSIS, which was administered to a purposive sample of Pakistani Muslim adults (N = 270). The exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure for the RSIS (with loadings ranging from 0.56 to 0.94) that explained 62% of the variance. The factors include dogmatic loyalty (9 items), social intolerance (13 items), renunciation of other religious Sects. (8 items), and propagation of one's Sect. (9 items). All factors were moderately related to each other with acceptable Cronbach's alpha (.78 to.92). Study II replicated the factorial structure of RSIS through confirmatory factor analysis on an independent sample of Muslim adults (N = 274). The convergent validity of the RSIS was demonstrated by a positive relationship with dogmatism. Overall, the findings indicated that the RSIS is a psychometrically sound measure that provides a standard operationalization for religious sectarian intolerance in Muslim cultures and it needs to be studied further in Muslim populations across the globe. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Previous studies have shown factors including media ownership, socio-political censorship, ethnic division and, the lack of professional training as obstacles to practising Peace Journalism principles. This research explored how social psychological processes including intergroup contact and outgroup attitudes influence Peace Journalism attitudes. Turkish Cypriot (TC) and Greek Cypriot (GC) journalists living in the divided and conflicted island of Cyprus participated. Findings highlighted that quantity and quality of contact are positively correlated with positive feelings, common ingroup identity (CII) and Peace Journalism attitudes and negatively correlated with intergroup anxiety and War Journalism (WJ) attitudes. Results shed light on the benefits of positive and frequent contact among journalists and with outgroup members that enhance positive social psychological processes as well as Peace Journalism attitudes. By recognizing the importance of intergroup contact, Peace Journalism attitudes can be improved by decreasing social-psychological tensions and contribute to reconciliation, peace-building processes, and sustainable peace in conflicted societies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Parental diversity ideologies are linked to their own interethnic prejudice, but how do they relate to children's prejudice? This study examined self-reported endorsement of colorblind ideology and multiculturalism among mothers (138 White Dutch, 65 Turkish-Dutch, and 45 Afro-Dutch) of 6-to 10-year old children (55% girls), and its association with child interethnic prejudice. Endorsement of multiculturalism was lowest among White Dutch mothers, and endorsement of colorblind ideology was lowest among Afro-Dutch mothers. Maternal endorsement of multiculturalism was negatively related to child outgroup prejudice among White Dutch families and among Turkish-Dutch families in the context of underrepresented outgroups, and results suggest no or opposite associations for colorblind ideology. Future research should explore what parenting based on these ideologies looks like, but the present study points parents in the direction of a multicultural, rather than colorblind, approach. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In this theory-driven experimental field intervention, we used vicarious intergroup contact, a popular prejudice-reduction strategy, to fight stigma-based bullying. We focused on the role of peer norms, manipulated by asking participants to work individually or collectively in reinforcing activities following vicarious contact (operationalized as story reading). Participants were 346 Italian 4th-5th grade primary school children (48% females). Participants were allocated to a 2 (Target: outgroup vs. ingroup vicarious contact) × 2 (reinforcing activities: collective vs. individual) experimental design. Results revealed that outgroup (vs. ingroup) vicarious contact was indirectly associated with greater intentions to react to name-calling and socially exclusionary behavior (two common forms of bullying) toward foreign children, only when participants collectively negotiated responses to reinforcing activities. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Positive attitudes and trust towards former adversaries facilitate reconciliation and peace building. Both historical and current intergroup experiences such as intergroup contact and conflict predict intergroup attitudes and trust, but no previous research has investigated the joint effects of these experiences. Therefore, we study the interplay of positive intergroup contact preceding conflict, negative experiences of the conflict, and positive intergroup contact following conflict. Drawing on social representations theory and using a multilevel design, we highlight the importance of both individual and collective experiences. We examine the effects of such experiences on intergroup attitudes and trust among a large sample of Greek Cypriots (N = 802) and Turkish Cypriots (N = 718) from 54 formerly ethnically mixed villages in the context of a protracted and frozen conflict in Cyprus. Present-day individual contact related to more positive attitudes and higher trust regardless of participants’ past experiences of conflict or contact. Furthermore, past collective contact experiences predict more positive attitudes and higher trust, whereas past collective conflict experiences predicted more negative attitudes and lower trust. Finally, present-day contact closes the gap in trust between respondents with low and high past contact. Overall, both current and historical and individual and collective experiences matter. © 2021 International Society of Political Psychology.

AB  - This study investigated whether negative stereotypes are responsible for the effect of ASD knowledge on social distance from individuals with ASD among college students. A sample of 869 neurotypical Chinese college students completed a cross-sectional survey to assess social distance, ASD knowledge, and negative stereotypes. Pearson correlation analysis yielded significant correlations between social distance, ASD knowledge, and negative stereotypes. Multiple mediation analysis showed that negative stereotypes mediated the link between social distance and ASD knowledge. Specifically, greater ASD knowledge predicted reduced social distance through decreased stereotyping related to dangerousness, personal responsibility for the disorder, and discontinuity, but also predicted greater social distance through increased stereotyping related to social inappropriateness. The findings deepen our understanding of the association between ASD knowledge and social distance by revealing the mediating role of negative stereotypes, and provide information that can help improve anti-stigma initiatives in college settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Why might some meat-eaters and meat-avoiders express negative attitudes toward each other? We investigated intergroup attitudes and potential underpinnings of these attitudes across three different dietary groups—veg*ans (vegetarians and vegans), flexitarians (people who restrict their meat intake partially), and meat-eaters—in Turkey (NStudy 1 = 366; NStudy 2 = 450). In both studies, veg*ans showed the greatest ingroup favouritism and reported the highest ingroup identification and perceived discrimination. Meat enjoyment, moral consideration, and perceived veg*an threat (among meat-eaters) predicted dietary ingroup identification in Study 1, whereas perceived discrimination towards one’s dietary group was the strongest predictor of identification among all dietary groups in Study 2. Among meat-avoiders, but not among meat-eaters, stronger dietary ingroup identification was associated with more negative outgroup attitudes. Findings are discussed in light of social identity theories and intergroup perspectives. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of a vicarious contact intervention program for improving knowledge and attitudes of Jewish-Israeli secular and religious children regarding their ingroup and three outgroups: secular/religious Jews, Ethiopian-descendant Jews, and Arabs. One hundred and nine kindergartners participated in a four-week intervention, in which experimenters introduced to them four persona dolls representing the different groups. Accompanied by stories, children were exposed to the dolls’ individual and group characteristics, and to positive encounters between the dolls. A pre- and post-test battery assessed the intervention’s effects on children’s intergroup knowledge and attitudes. Findings revealed an increase in children’s knowledge of the groups, improvements in religious children’s attitudes towards Arabs, and in both secular and religious children’s willingness to sit closer to Ethiopian-descendant children. These findings highlight the potential of indirect contact for reducing intergroup bias in young children living in multicultural and conflict-ridden societies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Although anti-immigrant attitudes continue to be expressed around the world, identifying these attitudes as prejudice, truth or free speech remains contested. This contestation occurs, in part, because of the absence of consensually agreed-upon understandings of what prejudice is. In this context, the current study sought to answer the question, “what do people understand to be prejudice?” Participants read an intergroup attitude expressed by a member of their own group (an “in-group” member) or another group (an “out-group” member). This was followed by an interpretation of the attitude as either “prejudiced” or “free speech.” This interpretation was also made by in-group or an out-group member. Subsequent prejudice judgements were influenced only by the group membership of the person expressing the initial attitude: the in-group member's attitude was judged to be less prejudiced than the identical attitude expressed by an out-group member. Participants' judgements of free speech, however, were more complex: in-group attitudes were seen more as free speech than out-group attitudes, except when an in-group member interpreted those attitudes as prejudice. These data are consistent with the Social Identity Approach to intergroup relations, and have implications for the processes by which intergroup attitudes become legitimised as free speech instead of prejudice. © 2021 International Union of Psychological Science.

AB  - Diversity in social relations is important for reducing prejudice. Yet, the question of when this occurs remains open. Using a social network approach, we test whether the link between outgroup attitudes and number of intra- and intergroup contacts is moderated by type of relationship (strong vs. weak ties) and personality (openness to experience) while also considering network structure (connections between contacts). In a culturally diverse sample of 122 immigrants residing in Barcelona, positive outgroup attitudes were predicted by several network characteristics: low proportion of intragroup contacts and high proportion of intergroup contacts among strong ties, high ethnic diversity among strong ties, low connectedness among contacts in the country of origin, and high connectedness between coethnic local and host national contacts. Openness to experience moderated these effects. These results affirm the intergroup benefits of having compositionally and structurally diverse networks, and the gain in examining intergroup dynamics at the meso level of analysis. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Fostering inclusive attitudes among children in host classrooms is key to integrating refugee children. A field experiment tests the prejudice reduction effects of a teacher-led activity integrating imagined intergroup contact and normative influence. To enhance the effectiveness of imagined contact, scenarios include supportive ingroup norms. In 29 classes, 545 children (Mage = 10.88, SD = 0.96) were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: standard imagined contact, imagined contact encouraged by family, class peers, or religious ingroups, or a control. Children in all norm-framed imagined contact conditions had significantly less antirefugee bias compared with the control. The class-peer norm frame significantly reduced affective and cognitive facets of bias. The family norm frame reduced affective bias, and the religious norm frame reduced cognitive bias. Standard imagined contact did not differ from the control. Potential mediating pathways are explored. These findings illustrate the utility of incorporating norms into imagined contact interventions to reduce antirefugee bias among schoolchildren. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper contributes to a small but significant body of research addressing issues of prejudice in science education. It is written in the form of a critical incident analysis that uses the framework of intersectionality to examine deficit ideologies and biases inherent in science as a body of knowledge as well as science teacher education. If left unchecked, these prejudices can filter through into school science education, reinforcing the stereotypes of who can contribute to the field of science. The paper makes a call for science teacher educators to support teacher candidates as they move past an academic understanding of diversity in science education to examine their personal dispositions. Suggestions are made for approaches that can be adopted to facilitate the forms of deconstruction necessary for progress to be made in this area. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The effects of intergroup contact in reducing prejudices have been well documented, but few studies have investigated the importance of the broader context within which contact occurs. This article examines the predictors of social distance from Muslims in a large sample of (non-Muslim) German university students (N = 404). Intergroup contact was an important predictor of reduced social distance even after demographics and perceptions of parents, tertiary institutions, media and broader intergroup dynamics were taken into account. The contact-social distance relationship was, however, mediated in part by perceived parental support for intergroup relations and perceived fairness of media representation. Students’ perceptions of broader group dynamics relating to assigning positive and negative attributes largely impeded the relationship – more so for male students than female. The findings attest to the importance of the broader context within which contact occurs. Having contact with outgroup members leads to reduced social distance from the outgroup, but perceived norms and outgroup perceptions play a pivotal role in explaining this relationship. © Equinox Publishing Ltd. 2022.

AB  - Politicians frequently use political speech to foster hostility toward immigrants, a strategy that shapes political preferences and behavior and feeds the success of the populist right. Whether political speech can be used to foster tolerance of immigrants, however, remains unexplored. We identify three mechanisms by which political speech could increase tolerance: (1) stressing in-group conceptions that highlight commonalities with immigrants; (2) emphasizing inclusiveness as an in-group norm; and (3) providing information that counters anti-immigrant stereotypes. Using quotes from US politicians in two survey experiments, we find that pro-immigrant speech that stresses inclusive norms or counters negative stereotypes about immigrants leads to more tolerant attitudes (but not behavior) toward immigrants. These effects are small and detectable only in large samples. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the European Political Science Association.

AB  - The current study explored the associations between relationship stigma, Racial-ethnic Worldview (REW; a construct developed as a comprehensive assessment of individual's perceptions of race and ethnicity), and relationship quality among those in interracial relationships (i. e., participants indicated their race was different than the race of their partner). One type of REW (Color-blind Achieved) was especially susceptible to the negative consequences of stigma from family members. Other significant differences in relationship quality and relationship stigma were found based on REW. Most notable is that individuals who acknowledge institutional racism, have positive intergroup attitudes, and a positive ethnic identity reported better relationship quality than those who denied institutional racism and/or had less positive attitudes toward their own ethnic group. These results demonstrate the utility of REW in contextualizing the experiences of individuals in interracial relationships as it relates to perceived stigma and relationship quality. The study offers a critical account of how individuals understanding of the racial and ethnic social context shapes relationship outcomes for those in interracial relationships in the United States.

AB  - Objectives: Women’s healthcare is a potential source of cross-cultural conflicts. Diverging values between healthcare providers and patients challenges the provision of culturally sensitive care and meeting migrant women’s needs. The aim is to investigate healthcare providers’ values in relation to sexual and reproductive rights, gender equality, migration and religion in Swedish sexual and reproductive healthcare. Methods: A national cross-sectional study was carried out. The questionnaire was distributed through a non-probability sample to midwives or other nurses, gynaecologists and obstetricians, and hospital social workers (n = 1,041). Through descriptive statistics, we mapped their values, comparing healthcare provider data to external representative population survey data. Results: Healthcare providers in sexual and reproductive healthcare displayed homogeneous liberal social values, being permissive towards sexual and reproductive rights and restrictive against gender-based violence. They were for gender equality, expressed low anti-immigrant sentiments, and had even more liberal values than the Swedish population and a demographically comparative sub-population. Conclusion: Individuals with very liberal values are selected to work in Swedish sexual and reproductive healthcare. Healthcare providers need self-reflexivity to avoid conflicts in clinical encounters in a diversified society. Copyright © 2022 Eriksson, Tibajev, Vartanova, Strimling and Essén.

AB  - Individuals with mental disorders are labeled in such a way that it leads to stigmatization. This generates a disadvantage as regards to the rest of the members of the society, limiting their participation as active members within it and at the same time being deleterious to their way of life. Mental health professionals are not safe from internalizing these stereotypes and prejudices assumed from their environment, thereby showing stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards the users in the different mental health resources.

AB  - Fashion design as a combined term conveys a different connotation than separate words of fashion and design. This is due to the complexity of the fashion system that also involves certain social prejudices, such as gendered practice and being shallow. This has set a gap for considering fashion design as a serious topic to study in comparison to other design subfields such as architecture and industrial design. However, this article argues that by emphasizing the dressmaking aspect in designing fashion, prejudices can be overcome. Finland, especially its capital Helsinki, is an established place for design and an emerging place for fashion. The recent development of the place where the encounter of design and fashion took place provides a unique condition for exploring the contemporary dressmaking practice of Helsinki-based fashion designers. A number of aspects identified from the context are shared to demonstrate how fashion design can be revisited besides the image-making aspect. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Objective: Analyze cases of sexual violence among teenagers at school. Methodology: The investigation originated from a macro-project, transversal, descriptive and quantitative, carried out in public schools in the city of Picos, Piauí, Brazil, with schoolchildren aged 13 to 17 years. The collection of data takes place in 2018, through a self-completed questionnaire by the participants. From the sample of 1,051 adolescents, 38 questionnaires were evaluated who reported victimization for sexual violence at some point in their lives. Results: In the analysis of these cases of sexual violence, it was noticed that they are mainly perpetrated by an ex-boyfriend (13.2%) or friend (10.5%), with more than a third of the episodes occurring in childhood (49.9%), some still persist to the present day (5.3%). As for the sociodemographic profile, there was a prevalence of females (81.6%), brown (42.1%), aged 10 to 12 years at the time of the episode, residents with father and mother (44.7%), Catholic (60.5%) and with economic weakness (23.7%). Regarding sexual and reproductive aspects, heterosexuality (86.8%), lack of a steady boyfriend (65.8%), had consented sexual intercourse (55.3%), and used condoms at the time (36.8%). Also, in relation to the violence suffered, the adolescents reported the awakening of negative feelings, such as: sadness and fear (50%), shame (44.7%) and anger (42.1%) after the episode(s). Conclusion: The theme is surrounded by cultural taboos and social prejudices. Therefore, it is expected that this study will contribute to the denunciation of cases, dissemination of knowledge and breaking these sociocultural precepts in civil society and the scientific community. © 2022.

AB  - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) stigma is an understudied barrier to PrEP uptake among Black and Latinx adolescents. U.S. Black and Latinx adolescents (13-17 years) completed an online survey or participated in focus groups/interviews. Associations between PrEP stigma, PrEP disclosure, and provider-initiated PrEP discussion preferences were examined using logistic-regression models. Qualitative data provided further context to quantitative findings. The survey sample included 208 adolescents (53% female; 58% Latinx; M = 15 years), with 98% endorsing PrEP stigma. The qualitative sample included 26 adolescents (54% female; 34% Latinx; M = 15 years). PrEP stigma was associated with lower odds of PrEP disclosure to parents/guardians, and preference for health care providers to initiate PrEP-related discussions only with patients the provider judged to be at high risk for HIV. Qualitative data supported quantitative results: Adolescents endorsed multiple negative stereotypes about PrEP users. Mitigating PrEP stigma among Black and Latinx adolescents is an important step in overcoming challenges related to PrEP uptake. © 2022 Elsevier USA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three studies examined the psychometric properties of a new scale, the Forensic Stigma Scale (FSS), designed to measure public stigma of forensic patients. In Study 1, the initial item pool was derived to measure three components of stigma (stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination). An EFA (n = 218) identified a two-factor model with 12 items. In Study 2, this two-factor solution was confirmed using CFA with a separate sample (n = 326) which had good-excellent fit indices. All 12 items loaded (&gt; 0.40) on the two latent factors (Dangerousness/Unpredictability [7 items] and Responsibility/Blame [5 items]) identified in the EFA. In Study 3, using the combined samples from the previous two studies, the 12-item FSS showed promising internal consistency reliability (0.75–0.80) and demonstrated satisfactory-good criterion validity; the scale was moderately correlated with a similar construct and was able to differentiate individuals who did and did not have specific education on forensic psychology. IRT analyses demonstrated that both subscales had discrimination parameters in the moderate-high range (α = 1.03 to 2.54), though the threshold parameters (bi) on the Dangerousness/Unpredictability subscale showed better distribution across trait levels. Overall, the 12-item FSS demonstrates strong psychometric properties, especially the Dangerousness/Unpredictability subscale. The scale may provide clinical and empirical uses for measuring public stigma of forensic patients. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The definition of sleep bruxism (SB) has changed over the years, and although it is no longer defined as a disorder, it is considered a risk factor that can result in prejudicial systemic and stomatognathic issues. The prevalence of SB in children is variable among studies, and its decrease during adolescence is a controversial matter among authors. We aimed to determine SB prevalence and assess its trend with age in a sample of pediatric patients who frequented the Lisbon Pediatric Dentistry Service. We conducted a retrospective observational study based on information provided by patients’ parents/caregivers and without examination or polysomnography examination. Data were collected between August 2019 and December 2020 by five dentists. A total of 1900 patients were included, 50.6% and 49.4% of which were male and female, respectively. Of the total sample, 334 (17.6%, 95% confidence interval of 15.9–19.4%) had bruxism, corresponding to 18.9% and 16.2% of male and female patients, respectively (p = 0.121). SB was reported in 20.7% of patients 0–6 years old, in 19.4% of those 7–11 years old, and in 14.6% of those 12–17 years old. In conclusion, SB showed a slightly higher prevalence among male pediatric patients, but further studies are needed to rule out confounding factors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - During the last decade, the body of research investigating teachers’ implicit attitudes toward different student groups, particularly toward ethnic minority groups, has been consistently increasing. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the main test that is used for this research purpose. However, what has been neglected so far is the investigation of implicit expectations about ethnic minority students in terms of their academic performance. Thus, the aim of the current study was to employ the Relational Responding Task (RRT) in the educational context as this test allowed us to assess stereotypical expectations in a more holistic way than other implicit measures would allow. We administered the IAT to assess implicit attitudes and the RRT to assess implicit expectations in a sample of teachers and preservice teachers in Italy. We also administered a questionnaire to assess explicit prejudice. For 93 teachers and preservice teachers who worked on all three measures, their implicit attitudes toward and their implicit expectations about ethnic minority students were negative, whereas their explicit prejudice was low. We did not find any correlations between the different measures. The findings are discussed in terms of the reasons for the zero correlations, and the usefulness of considering an implicit measure for teacher expectations in future research is highlighted. In this vein, we might obtain deeper insight into the role that teachers play in the disadvantages ethnic minority students experience in school. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intergroup conflict profoundly affects the welfare of groups and can deteriorate intergroup relations long after the conflict is over. Here, we experimentally investigate how the experience of an intergroup conflict influences the ability of groups to establish cooperation after conflict. We induced conflict by using a repeated attacker-defender game in which groups of four are divided into two ‘attackers’ that can invest resources to take away resources from the other two participants in the role of ‘defenders.’ After the conflict, groups engaged in a repeated public goods game with peer-punishment, in which group members could invest resources to benefit the group and punish other group members for their decisions. Previous conflict did not significantly reduce group cooperation compared to a control treatment in which groups did not experience the intergroup conflict. However, when having experienced an intergroup conflict, individuals punished free-riding during the repeated public goods game less harshly and did not react to punishment by previous attackers, ultimately reducing group welfare. This result reveals an important boundary condition for peer punishment institutions. Peer punishment is less able to efficiently promote cooperation amid a ‘shadow of conflict.’ In a third treatment, we tested whether such ‘maladaptive’ punishment patterns induced by previous conflict can be mitigated by hiding the group members’ conflict roles during the subsequent public goods provision game. We find more cooperation when individuals could not identify each other as (previous) attackers and defenders and maladaptive punishment patterns disappeared. Results suggest that intergroup conflict undermines past perpetrators’ legitimacy to enforce cooperation norms. More generally, results reveal that past conflict can reduce the effectiveness of institutions for managing the commons. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective: In 2020, for the first time, a VP candidate was a black woman of immigrant parentage. This article asks whether Kamala Harris’ vice presidential candidacy may have motivated some white voters and especially those scoring high on racial resentment, anti-immigrant attitudes, or sexism to vote for Trump instead of Biden. Methods: We conducted an online priming experiment with non-Hispanic white voters in August 2020, shortly after Harris was announced as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Half of the samples were asked about their support for the president–vice presidential tickets, while the other half were asked only about support for a presidential candidate. Results: Our results show that the Harris’ selection may have affected vote choice by pushing many whites, especially among the most racially conservative whites into the Trump column. We find mixed results for anti-immigrant attitudes and sexism. Conclusion: We conclude that one aspect of Harris’ identity—race—dominated the minds of voters relative to other aspects of her identity. © 2022 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.

AB  - Previous research has found that oxytocin (OT) is associated with intergroup behaviour in humans as well as wild chimpanzees, and that exogenous OT affects Pan social attention. The two Pan species, bonobos and chimpanzees, differ drastically from one another in their intensity of intergroup competition, with lethal intergroup aggression often led by males in chimpanzees and more tolerant associations often centered around females in bonobos. However, it remains unclear how exogenous OT changes the two species' responses to ingroup and outgroup individuals. In this study, after intranasal administration of nebulized OT or placebo control, chimpanzees and bonobos viewed image pairs of ingroup and outgroup conspecifics while their eye movements were tracked with an eye-tracker. Although the overall effect of OT was small, we found that OT shifted bonobos' and chimpanzees' attention to outgroup images of the sex primarily involved in intergroup encounters in each species. Specifically, OT selectively shifted attention towards outgroup photos of female conspecifics in bonobos, and those of outgroup male conspecifics in chimpanzees. This suggests that OT generally promotes outgroup attention in both bonobos and chimpanzees but this effect is restricted to the sex most relevant in intergroup relations. These results suggest that, although OT may have a generally conserved role in hominid intergroup behaviour, it may act in species-relevant ways under the influence of their socio-ecological backgrounds. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Both continuum beliefs (i.e., that mental disorder exists on a spectrum of normative behavior patterns) and the perception of similarities to a person with schizophrenia have shown mixed effects on reducing mental illness stigma. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address continuum beliefs and the perception of similarities to a person with depression in the context of depression-related stigma. Methods: This work is based on an online intervention study in an ethnically diverse sample recruited on Amazon MTurk including previously unanalyzed qualitive responses. Within this cross-sectional, mixed-methods online investigation (N = 304), we examined the relation of perceived similarities to continuum beliefs, social distance, and negative stereotypes in relation to a vignette about depression. A randomly assigned continuum beliefs intervention attempted to induce continuum beliefs about depression. An open-writing task asked participants to describe similarities and/or differences between themselves and the person depicted in the vignette. Results: The continuum beliefs intervention was associated to a greater number of perceived similarities to and fewer perceived differences from the target vignette. Moreover, perceived similarities were associated with increased continuum beliefs, less social distance, and less-negative stereotypes. Perceived differences from a person with depression were associated with increased social distance. Limitations: Even though the continuum beliefs intervention did not significantly alter stigma measures directly, expressed continuum beliefs were associated to decreased mental illness stigma. Conclusions: The findings emphasize that perceived similarities to an outgroup member (i.e., a person with depression) might augment the stigma-reducing mechanism of continuum beliefs. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Scholars have noted how online dating technologies are one important arena in which racism, classism, heteronormativity, and other systems of domination are reproduced. This often materializes via a “personal preference” discourse—a framing of desire as unique, individual, and untethered from systems of domination. Yet underexplored is how such a discourse, which fosters prejudice in preferences, is framed as socially acceptable. This paper draws on a content analysis of 858 unique profile screenshots and in-depth interview data of 26 users of Grindr, Scruff, and Jack’d to examine how users voice their “personal preferences.” The content analysis results indicated that 24 percent of profiles listed a preference, and that most were framed in “positive” or polite ways (e.g., “I’m into…”). Analysis of interview data demonstrated that respondents engaged in what we call blatant exclusion and positive reframing in their interactions with other users to voice their “personal preferences.” Users who did not state preferences still allowed their preferences to infuse their experiences on the app. We document how users negotiated racist, classist, and heteronormative preferences and, to an extent, how these users are understanding others’ preferences. This study has implications for understanding the logic behind “personal preference” discourse and why it remains socially acceptable even as other systems of domination do not. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As witnesses to workplace sexism, male leaders have the opportunity to leverage both their relative social privilege as men and authority as leaders to enact allyship. However, allyship is fraught. Expression of indignation may be viewed by observers as unprofessional, yet a muted response may lead observers to question their motives for allyship. Further, allyship that does not hit the mark may have a ripple effect on observers' perceptions of the leader-ally, victim, transgressor, and organization. Thus, the present research (1) examined whether emotion expression during allyship influences observers' motive inferences of the leader-ally, (2) examined whether emotion expression influences favorability of the leader-ally, and (3) explored how a leader-ally's emotional (or not) allyship behavior influences observers' perceptions of the victim, transgressor, and organization. Study 1 (n = 298) showed that prejudice confrontation accompanied by anger or sadness (vs. not) is associated with intrinsic motive inferences of the leader-ally, and anger is seen as more appropriate and sincere when confronting prejudice. Study 2 (n = 112) showed that the leader-ally was viewed as more favorable when prejudice confrontation was accompanied by anger (vs. not) because the leader-ally was perceived as more sincere. Finally, qualitative data from thought-listings across both studies showed that leader-allies' anger expression was associated with greater calls for accountability of the transgressor and more positive impressions of the organization. However, anger expression also wrought highly polarized responses toward the victim, consisting of both support and victim-blaming. Thus, authentic but measured emotion expression during confrontation is recommended. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The discrepancy between ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility is well established in social psychology. Under which conditions does “ingroup love” turn into “outgroup hate”? Studies with natural groups suggest that when group membership is based on (dis)similarity of moral beliefs, people are willing to not only help the ingroup, but also harm the outgroup. The key limitation of these studies is that the use of natural groups confounds the effects of shared morality with the history of intergroup relations. In two preregistered experiments, we test the effect of morality-based group membership on intergroup behavior using artificial groups that help disentangling these effects. We use the recently developed Intergroup Parochial and Universal Cooperation (IPUC) game which differentiates between behavioral options of weak parochialism (helping the ingroup), strong parochialism (harming the outgroup), universal cooperation (helping both groups), and egoism (profiting individually). The preliminary findings suggest that morality-based groups exhibit less egoism, more weak parochialism, more universal cooperation, and less strong parochialism. These findings contradict earlier evidence from natural groups and suggest that (dis)similarity of moral beliefs is not sufficient to cross the boundary between “ingroup love” and “outgroup hate”. The third and final preregistered study aims to replicate these findings in a different cultural setting and test the mediating role of trust in this process. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - People with concealable stigmatized identities often conceal to avoid facing prejudice and discrimination. Yet, this strategy carries risk; concealment may engender social costs. Across five studies in which participants (total n = 1992) were recruited from an online pool (Prolific) and an institutional undergraduate pool, we found that people who conceal, relative to people who disclose, were viewed as less moral and sociable (Studies 1-2B) regardless of the identity being concealed (Studies 2A-2B), and that these effects were moderated by whether or not an outgroup identity was claimed in the course of concealment (Study 2C) and the motivation for concealment (Study 3). Results suggest that concealment is strongly stigmatized, a fact which places members of already-stigmatized groups in a challenging situation wherein they must risk either the stigma of their identity or that of concealment.

AB  - Introduction: U.S. residents had varying experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and social safety net policy in 2020. Past research has suggested that partisanship, ideology, racial attitudes, and personal experience may each influence policy attitudes. In this study, we explore whether variation in support for social safety net policy in 2020 is predicted by negative experiences of the pandemic when controlling for racial attitudes, partisanship, and ideology. Methods: Support for 12 social safety net policies in 2020 was estimated using data from a nationally representative panel survey of U.S. adults conducted in 2020 (n=1,222). Logistic regression was used to examine differences in the predicted probability of supporting a majority of social safety net policies related to health, housing, and employment by partisanship, ideology, racial attitudes, and negative experiences of the pandemic. Analyses were conducted in 2021. Results: Higher levels of symbolic racism was a consistently strong predictor of lower social safety net policy support across health, housing, and employment policies; as was identifying as either Conservative or Republican. Negative experiences of the pandemic were generally unpredictive of support for the social safety net policy. Conclusions: Despite the pandemic's consequences as well as the potential for social safety net policy to address these consequences, negative experiences of the pandemic failed to predict policy support, even as racial attitudes, partisanship, and ideology strongly predicted these preferences in 2020. Building public support for social safety net policy requires communication strategies that identify the shared benefits of these policies. © 2022 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB  - Research investigating the early emergence of racial prejudice has been largely limited to contexts in which racial prejudice is most likely to emerge—multiracial societies that have pronounced racial inequality (e.g., United States, South Africa). The present study assessed whether pro-White racial bias is also early emerging in a homogenous Black community that has little exposure to modern media and where children presumably experience less overt discrimination than in past samples. Black African children (N = 214) between 5- and 12-years-old living in rural Uganda exhibited substantial pro-White racial bias, preferring White over Black children 78% of the time. Ugandan children also judged White children as higher status than Black children, and these status judgments predicted their degree of pro-White bias. Our results indicate that pro-White racial biases can emerge even in a homogenous Black community and that, in some contexts, minimal status cues can be sufficient for the early development of racial prejudice. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This scoping paper sets out to consider various aspects of the phenomenon of people on the move, and to examine some of the ways in which career guidance has responded to the challenge of integrating the newly arrived. The paper is informed by a recognition of the dignity of individuals above any classificatory system that places persons in a hierarchy, with some having access to rights that others are denied. This stance requires career practitioners to confront the prevalent vocabulary, discourses and attitudes circulating in the mainstream in order to become aware of—and to overcome—personal prejudice, thus opening up possibilities for more socially just forms of service. A synthesis of relevant literature concerning the integration of migrants and refugees in the labour market is provided in order to signpost emancipatory forms of career guidance, ones that move beyond an emphasis on individual resilience to take seriously the impact of exclusionary social practices and structures. The paper concludes by highlighting a number of initiatives that suggest that career guidance is rising to the challenge of catering for a diverse group of newly arrived by mobilising theoretical frameworks that are fit for purpose, by developing bespoke training programmes for practitioners, and by sharing the lessons learnt from the field. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Children begin interacting less across racial lines around middle childhood, but it remains unclear why. We examine the novel possibility that, at that time, children's prejudice theories—their understanding of prejudice as a fixed or malleable attribute—begin to influence their desire for interracial affiliation. We devise immersive behavioral experiences to evaluate when and how prejudice theories affect interracial affiliation. Study 1 measured prejudice theories among 8–13-year-olds (N = 152; 76 White, 76 racial minority) and observed children in a newly-developed social interaction task. In line with our hypothesis, children older than 10 years with stronger malleable-prejudice theories exhibited more interest and affiliation in a simulated cross- (vs. same-race) interaction, regardless of their preexisting prejudice level. Study 2 randomly assigned children to listen to a fixed- or malleable-prejudice theory story before engaging in a real, first-time interaction with a same- or cross-race partner at a different school via live video-stream (N = 150; 96 White, 54 racial minority). The malleable theory increased children's interest in further interaction with their cross-race partner. These findings highlight the promise of malleable-prejudice theories for sustaining positive interracial relationships during a critical developmental window—when the frequency of cross-race friendships typically declines. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Past work suggests that children have an overly rosy view of rich people that stays consistent across childhood. However, adults do not show explicit pro-rich biases and even hold negative stereotypes against the rich (e.g., thinking that rich people are cold and greedy). When does this developmental shift occur, and when do children develop more complex and differentiated understandings of the wealthy and the poor? The current work documents the developmental trajectory of 4–12-yr-old primarily American middle-class children's conceptualizations of the wealthy and the poor (total N = 164). We find: (1) age-related decreases in pro-rich preferences and stereotypes relative to the poor; (2) domain-sensitive stereotypes across prosociality, talent, and effort; (3) resource-specific behavioral expectations such that with age children increasingly expect the wealthy to contribute more material resources but not more time than the poor; (4) an increasing recognition of the unfairness of the wealth gap between the wealthy and the poor; and (5) a developing understanding of the link between wealth and power. In sum, this work illuminates the emergence of more complex understandings of wealth, poverty, and inequality. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To experimentally test weight stigma and weight stigma by association in a parent-child relationship using a large, community-based sample. Methods: We conducted a randomized experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk using an online survey. Participants were randomly assigned to view a picture of a parent-child dyad, for which the parent and child's gender (male vs. female) and weight status (with obesity vs. without obesity) were manipulated. Participants read identical parenting descriptions that adhered to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ parenting recommendations, then rated the parent's perceived effectiveness, helpfulness, and level of caring using a parenting questionnaire based on Barnhart et al (2013). Results: Participants (N = 1862; Mage = 36.8 [11.2] years) rated parents of children with obesity as less effective compared to parents of children without obesity (P = .010) and parents with obesity as less effective compared to parents without obesity (P = .033). Participants also rated parents with obesity as less helpful compared to parents without obesity (P = .021). No differences emerged in perceived caring. Parenting evaluations did not differ across daughters versus sons or mothers versus fathers. Conclusions: Parents of children with obesity may experience weight stigma by association, which could have direct consequences for the parents, the children, and the parent-child relationship. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - This article uses the case of Riace, a small multiethnic community in Southern Italy, as a lens to evaluate key theoretical and methodological aspects of the influential Intergroup Contact Theory. The article draws upon 10 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Riace, Italy, a town that for more than 20 years has hosted and integrated refugees into the local community. We analyzed the ethnographic material in light of assumptions underlying intergroup contact theory. Findings demonstrate that friendly everyday interactions between inhabitants of different ethnic backgrounds serve as the critical “social glue” for the Riace community, but that there are social inequalities, as well as group stereotypes, group-based friendships, and spatial segregation. The different interpretations and nuanced outcomes of everyday social interactions demonstrate the importance of a contextualized understanding of the nature and implications of intergroup contact in real-world settings for future research and policies. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Despite advances to promote acceptance and equity in many countries, prejudice remains a significant social problem. Promoting intergroup harmony requires knowledge about what works to reduce prejudice in community settings. This meta-analysis of field experiments reveals the most effective intervention types and conditions for reducing negative attitudes towards minority groups in real-world settings. Across 69 intervention arms and 24,378 participants, results reveal that prejudice reduction interventions are effective at improving attitudes towards minority groups in real-world settings (d = 0.51, 95% CI [0.33; 0.68]). The prediction interval was −0.90 to 1.92. In this case, the prediction interval was particularly wide because of the high degree of heterogeneity detected in effect size. Subgroup analyses indicate that less commonly explored approaches, such as perceived variability, may have larger effect sizes than contact-based interventions. Still, more research is needed to confirm the effects of these less-researched approaches. Additionally, results show that interventions are more effective for school and college cohorts than for adults, and that the effects of prejudice reduction interventions endure over time. © 2021 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Ethnic minority group members’ responses to their prejudicial treatment can take several forms. One involves identity concealment (e.g., ‘passing’). In order to understand such a response, we must explore participants’ understandings of the interactional context before them, their meta-perceptions of the identity others ascribe to them, and the varied meanings that identity concealment/non-disclosure may have in that context. Our analysis of interview data (N = 30) obtained with Roma in Hungary reveals diverse forms of, and motivations for, the concealment of their Roma identity. Some participants reported examples of proactive identity concealment, others reported more reactive forms (in which they went along with others’ mistaken assumptions concerning their identity). The motivations for identity concealment (whether proactive or reactive) included the desire to: secure material benefits; avoid conflict; take pleasure from seeing others’ assumptions blinding them to the reality before them; test (and expose) majority group members’ attitudes; allow themselves opportunities to experience the world in new ways. Our analysis highlights the importance of social identity researchers recognizing the diverse motivations for ethnic identity concealment: From the actors’ perspective concealment is not always assimilatory, and in some contexts can be experienced as empowering. © 2021 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Multiracial self-classifiers are the fastest-growing racial population in the United States. While their rise signals a departure from norms of hypodescent, little is known about the sociopolitical meanings attached to multiracial labels. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding multiracials’ sense of racial group identity, linked fate, and racial attitudes. Examining a national opinion survey that samples more than 1200 multiracial adults, we compare the identity and attitudinal profiles of the two largest multiracial groups in the United States—White-Asians and White-Blacks—with those of their component monoracial groups. We find that while White-Asians and White-Blacks often distinguish themselves from their component races, on balance, the assertion of dual racial membership signals greater solidarity and/or affect toward the minority race. These findings suggest that members of these multiracial populations are likely to align themselves relatively more with their minority background than with Whites on political issues that are racial in nature. ©2021, Midwest Political Science Association.

AB  - Indirect forms of intergroup contact have been shown to reduce prejudice. However, little is known about the factors that can contribute to implementing these methods as interventions in real-life settings. In this study, we examined whether the students' perception of the facilitator's engagement in carrying out a school-based vicarious contact intervention affects the effectiveness of the intervention among adolescents in Finland (N = 360), Italy (N = 113), and Slovakia (N = 216). As a result, the participants who perceived the facilitator as highly engaged held more positive intergroup attitudes after the intervention than those perceiving the facilitator less engaged. The results are discussed in relation to social and developmental psychological research on normative influences in adolescence and intergroup contact literature, in which normative support from authorities is considered to contribute to the extent to which contact reduces prejudice. By stressing the role of the facilitator, the results contribute both theoretically and practically to the understanding of the successful implementation of prejudice-reduction programs.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Limited exposure to radiology by medical students can perpetuate negative stereotypes and hamper recruitment efforts. The purpose of this study is to understand medical students’ perceptions of radiology and how they change based on medical education and exposure. Materials and Methods: A single-institution mixed-methods study included four groups of medical students with different levels of radiology exposure. All participants completed a 16-item survey regarding demographics, opinions of radiology, and perception of radiology stereotypes. Ten focus groups were administered to probe perceptions of radiology. Focus groups were coded to identify specific themes in conjunction with the survey results. Results: Forty-nine participants were included. Forty-two percent of participants had positive opinions of radiology. Multiple radiology stereotypes were identified, and false stereotypes were diminished with increased radiology exposure. Opinions of the impact of artificial intelligence on radiology closely aligned with positive or negative views of the field overall. Multiple barriers to applying for a radiology residency position were identified including board scores and lack of mentorship. COVID-19 did not affect perceptions of radiology. There was broad agreement that students do not enter medical school with many preconceived notions of radiology, but that subsequent exposure was generally positive. Exposure both solidified and eliminated various stereotypes. Finally, there was general agreement that radiology is integral to the health system with broad exposure on all services. Conclusion: Medical student perceptions of radiology are notably influenced by exposure and radiology programs should take active steps to engage in medical student education. © 2021 The Association of University Radiologists

AB  - Our concern in this contribution is to ask what the special features of populism in Hungary are, where government and the largest opposition party can be considered populist. The study aims at analyzing motivations, interests, benefits, and profits of populism in fragile Hungarian regions. The main part examines three peculiar features of state populism: the rural support for stabile political and social structures; early-born conservative social policy, which freezes and preserves social inequalities and pacificates social conflicts; and selective social policy that has made a strong difference between “worthy” and “unworthy” poor, thus, contributing to ethnic-based conflicts and emerging prejudice. The Hungarian case shows that poverty and social inequalities, disintegration, hierarchical local power structure with dominance of economic–political oligarchy, weak participation, monopolization of local and non-local media, and racialization of poverty are enabling factors of populism. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Media portrayals of crime help shape public perceptions of victims and the demographic groups to which they belong. For transgender people, who already face heightened disparities and stigma, news coverage may reinforce negative stereotypes and minimize the wider context of transphobic violence. The present study, a content analysis of news articles (n = 316) pertaining to 27 transgender people killed in the United States in 2016, addresses positive and negative depictions of victims, use of language affirming and delegitimizing transgender identities, and framing of transphobia as a systemic problem. Themes, implications, and future research directions are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - A recurring claim in the literature is that civic engagement in voluntary associations is crucial for the formation of a variety of interpersonal attitudes, such as social trust, tolerance, and intolerance. In this article, we study the role of membership in voluntary associations and volunteer work in the development of anti-immigrant attitudes among adolescents. Using a four-wave longitudinal design with a target sample comprising approximately 2000 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 at the first measurement occasion, this study contributes to previous research by analysing the impact on anti-immigrant attitudes of different dimensions of membership in voluntary associations and volunteer work. The results showed that membership in voluntary associations and volunteer work over several years serve to decrease anti-immigrant attitudes among adolescents over time. In addition, volunteering over several years seems to have a somewhat stronger impact on anti-immigrant attitudes than do various aspects of membership in associations. Our study also shows that anti-immigrant attitudes become more firmly established with age and that membership in only certain types of voluntary associations relates to attitudes toward immigrants. In sum, this study contributes to previous research focusing on the role of civic engagement in the development of interpersonal attitudes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Social workers often experience higher levels of burnout compared with other healthcare professionals. The capacity to manage one’s own emotional reactions efficiently, frequently in complex care settings, is central to the role of social workers. This article highlights the complexity of emotions in social work research and practice by exploring the perspective of emotional intelligence. The article is both theoretical and empirical, based on reflections from a qualitative longitudinal study interviewing fathers with behavioural and criminal backgrounds, all in their 40 s. The analysis contains an exploration of the researcher position that illuminates the reflective, emotional aspects that took place within this interview process. Three overall themes emerged – first: Recognising emotional complexity; second: Reflecting on emotional themes; and third: Exploring my own prejudices and preconceptions. The findings apply to both theoretical and practical social work, addressing the need to understand emotions as a central part of critical reflection and reflexivity. The argument is that emotions have the potential to expand awareness of one’s own preconceptions, related to normative societal views. This form of analytical awareness entails identifying and paying attention to one’s own, sometimes embodied, emotional triggers. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Previous experiences with police can influence civilian perceptions of police, and in turn their expectations for future encounters. According to theories on intergroup contact, positive contact predicts positive attitudes toward the outgroup and unpleasant contact predicts negative attitudes. In the case of police-civilian encounters, pleasant interactions with the police are associated with favorable police attitudes among civilians, whereas unpleasant encounters are associated with negative attitudes. In four studies (N = 826) we assessed contact among police and civilians as related to civilian general perceptions of police and (novel to this research area) anticipated officer behavior in an imagined roadside encounter. Across studies and contact type, general perceptions mediated relationships between contact and anticipated behavior. These studies provide preliminary evidence of a process by which contact shapes general perceptions, in turn impacting anticipated police behavior. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Human between-group interactions are highly variable, ranging from violent to tolerant and affiliative. Tolerance between groups is linked to our unique capacity for large-scale cooperation and cumulative culture, but its evolutionary origins are understudied. In chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives, predominantly hostile between-group interactions impede cooperation and information flow across groups. In contrast, in our other closest living relative, the bonobo, tolerant between-group associations are observed. However, as these associations can be frequent and prolonged and involve social interactions that mirror those within groups, it is unclear whether these bonobos really do belong to separate groups. Alternatively, the bonobo grouping patterns may be homologous to observations from the large Ngogo chimpanzee community, where individuals form within-group neighborhoods despite sharing the same membership in the larger group. To characterize bonobo grouping patterns, we compare the social structure of the Kokolopori bonobos with the chimpanzee group of Ngogo. Using cluster analysis, we find temporally stable clusters only in bonobos. Despite the large spatial overlap and frequent interactions between the bonobo clusters, we identified significant association preference within but not between clusters and a unique space use of each cluster. Although bonobo associations are flexible (i.e., fission-fusion dynamics), cluster membership predicted the bonobo fission compositions and the spatial cohesion of individuals during encounters. These findings suggest the presence of a social system that combines clear in-group/out-group distinction and out-group tolerance in bonobos, offering a unique referential model for the evolution of tolerant between-group interactions in humans.

AB  - In the Western world, for deaf and hard-of-hearing children, hearing aids or cochlear implants are available to provide access to sound, with the overall goal of increasing their wellbeing. If and how this goal is achieved becomes increasingly multifarious when these children reach adolescence and young adulthood and start to participate in society in other ways. An approach to wellbeing that includes personal differences and the relative advantages and disadvantages that people have, is the capability approach, as developed by Nobel Prize laureate Amartya Sen. Capability is the set of real opportunities people have to do and be things they have reason to value. We interviewed 59 young people, aged 13 through 25, with cochlear implants (37) or hearing aids (22) to capture their capability. We found that their hearing devices enabled them to actively participate in a predominantly hearing society, with few differences between cochlear implant and hearing aid recipients. They did, however, report challenges associated with prejudices and expectations, and with feeling poorly understood, all of which appeared to impact their capability. Through the lens of capability, alleged differences between hearing aid and cochlear implant recipients began to fade. We discuss the implications for initiatives focused on the long-term support young recipients of hearing devices to meet their specific requirements over time.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to highlight the planning, process and results of drawing on engaged pedagogy to humanize Blackness in world language (WL) teacher education. The activities were designed to center lived experiences, augment self-reflection and model instructional differentiation for WL preservice teachers (PSTs). Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research paper uses a self-study in teacher education practices (S-STEP) method. It explores how tailored resources, peer and self-assessments and a responsive environment can increase awareness of antiBlackness in instruction and curricula among WL PSTs during a semester-long methods course. Findings: Findings suggest that centering Blackness in WL methods initiates an awareness of antiBlack racism in WL pedagogy through opportunities for self-reflection and accountability through assessment. To varying degrees, participants demonstrated shifts in their understanding and valuing of Blackness in WL instruction as facilitated through a differentiated environment in which PSTs had access both to the instructor and to one another’s critical feedback. Originality/value: Linguicism through antiBlack linguistic racism, native speakerism, idealized whiteness and other constructs has been demonstrated to decrease Black and minoritized participation in language teaching. What has yet to be addressed is this same pushout from an inclusive Black diasporic approach to WL teacher preparation. This study highlights nationalism, ableism, accentism, racism, anti-immigrant sentiments and racial stereotypes as different entry points to understanding antiBlackness within WL teacher preparation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aims to understand pre-service teachers’ perceptions about mentor teachers’ mentoring practices and their relevance to the level of their teaching self-efficacy. A survey was conducted with a sample of 210 pre-service teachers in the 3rd and 4th year of a 4-year bachelor program for elementary teacher education at the University of Prishtina. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 pre-service teachers who reported their highest levels of mentoring experience were with mentor teachers’ personal attributes, whilst the lowest level of experience was with feedback provision. Furthermore, they reported their lowest levels of self-efficacy beliefs were in the classroom management domain. Results showed that a lack of close mentoring relationships combined with a lack of institutional (faculty) support and commitment to student professional development had a negative impact on pre-service teachers' perceptions of their experiences. Findings indicate that the quality of mentoring may be enhanced when mentors display attributes such as hospitality, openness to collaboration, non-prejudicial approaches, space for engagement, and encouragement to take initiatives. More information about system requirements, more feedback, more support, and closer rapport with mentors can contribute to higher teaching self-efficacy for pre-service teachers. © 2022, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc..

AB  - Regime change often exacerbates ethnic conflict. This article examines the curious case of Myanmar, where a 2021 military coup was met, on the surface, with broad-based resistance across a divided society. An important question that therefore arises is whether, below the surface, this unity also took a more positive form of national solidarity. Were deep ethnic cleavages intensified or alleviated by the 2021 coup? This question bears theoretical relevance for the study of ethnic conflict and has social relevance for a nation marked by a long history of civil war and a recent experience of genocide against Rohingya Muslims. The article engages in a systematic examination of 180 social media posts uploaded in Burmese by key opinion leaders both before and after the coup. A qualitative analysis of major positive and negative themes indicates a shift in attitudes. The quantitative analysis shows that ethnic relations, measured by a change in themes, ratings and virality, improved significantly in the immediate aftermath of Myanmar's 2021 coup.

AB  - Background: The job placement of persons with disability is often threatened by prejudices and stereotypes; even when they are employed, they have less qualified and less paid jobs. The aim of this study was to investigate the self-perceived employability in a sample of workers with disability, hypothesizing to find a good level of self-determination and positive meaning of work. Materials and Methods: Ten semi-structured interviews have been conducted, applying a mix-method to the data analysis through qualitative interpretation and quantitative content analysis. Results confirmed what recent literature shows about the need for job inclusiveness for persons with disability and also underlined a profound sense of satisfaction related to the job, strong identity, and empowerment derived from the job involvement. Conclusion: Practical implications are related to the job design procedure inspired by diversity management, in order to pay attention to every single diversity and ensure equity and inclusion.

AB  - In this short essay, the focus is on social and political aspects of forced migration. It is argued that policies designed to restrict access to developed countries have, rather like the American “prohibition”, produced a thriving criminal market for smugglers, in this case of people. Making travel more difficult increases both their profits and the sophistication of their methods. Provision of targeted, properly controlled, support for refugees in countries neighbouring conflict zones might help to reduce the pressure on travel to Europe and could be both more successful and more humanitarian. For those who do reach developed countries, there is scope to improve the legal decision-making process. Psychological input should include scientific investigation of legal assumptions, and the provision of relevant expert literature reviews, for example concerning modern knowledge of memory. Trust is the first casualty of repressive violence, and mistrust among opposition groups is probably one of the key mechanisms of its success. We need to make sure that we do not provide further grounds for this sort of reaction. Although there is no brave or new world ahead, we must continue to confront ignorance and prejudice, as we seek to avoid more humanitarian disasters. It is now just over thirty years since we published a potential framework for under-standing how survivors of organised state violence react to complex and severe trauma (Turner & Gorst-Unsworth, 1990).We argued that no single psychological process underpins the reactions to this experience, and therefore, there can be no unitary torture syndrome, but rather a series of understandable psychological pathways activated to varying degrees by different experiences, leading to diversity of emotional response, with implications for recovery and treatment. We also asked family doctors about health needs of refugees (Ramsay & Turner, 1993), and it is wonderful to see how the evidence on treatment options has developed since then, especially in recent years. In this paper, looking back over the last thirty years, in celebration of the anniversary of Torture journal, I will focus on political, legal and forensic aspects of forced migration. © 2022, International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims.

AB  - Objective:There is very little in-depth qualitative research regarding youth experiences with medical use of prescription opioids and this is concerning as some youth are shown to be at risk for future nonmedical opioid use, addiction, and overdose as a result of medical use of opioids in adolescence. We sought to understand and characterize youth experiences with prescription opioids, such that researchers and healthcare professionals can improve both opioid and pain-related treatment and intervention programs for young people.Methods:We recruited participants through postering and television advertisements from the Emergency, Orthopedics, Dental, and Oncology/Hematology departments at a local children's hospital. We performed 3 focus groups, 5 in-depth interviews and one youth summit (n = 11 youth) for a total of 25 youth who had experience with prescription opioids. The results were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.Results:The participants were heterogeneous and were youth who had been prescribed opioids due to surgery for scoliosis, cancer, brain surgery, dialysis, and other acute injuries. Youth simultaneously emphasized the positive (eg, to improve physiological functioning and to cope with mental (emotional) struggles related to their conditions in some instances) and negative effects of opioids (eg, adverse side effects and concerns about whether opioid use was related to other psychological struggles). The experience of ambivalence coincided with youth experience of intersecting stigma(s) related to their physiological conditions and their use of opioids. Youth discussed several solutions for how to improve youth-provider interactions in the context of these experiences and perceptions.Conclusion:Youth encounter a dearth of nuanced information about opioids during illness experiences and recovery and the experience of opioid-related ambivalence may be compounded by the everyday struggles associated with their conditions including intersecting prejudicial attitudes and stigmatization. Consistent with an interdisciplinary approach to prescription opioid use and pain rehabilitation, service providers could consider engaging in nuanced, empathetic, and empowering discussions with youth and provide alternatives or adjuncts to opioids for pain management. © 2022 Academy of Pelvic Health Physical Therapy, APTA.

AB  - Familial dysautonomia (Riley–Day syndrome) is a rare but fatal autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy caused by a point mutation in I-κ-B kinase complex-associated protein gene. The disease, which affects primarily people of Ashkenazi Jewish origin, prejudices the development of primary sensory neurons determining the depletion of autonomic and sensory neurons. In this study, we report a 5-year-old girl with familial dysautonomia, and how her different psychiatric aspects may lead to genetic vulnerability. Obviously, the gene, the reason for this syndrome, and overreactions to different kinds of emotions, maybe a risk factor for having any mood disorders. From another perspective, this “genetic vulnerability” may be protective or related to the syndromes that affect social communication like autism. © 2022, AVES. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article we reflect on our engagement with a broad spectrum of dress-and textile-related artefacts housed within the Cornell Fashion + Textile Collection and Department of Anthropology Collections at Cornell University. In recent years, fashion critics and scholars have begun to address the biases and prejudices that continue to inform the collection and display of fashion within museums and academic institutions. In addition to museums of art, design, anthropology and history, universities have contributed to and influenced the public’s perceptions of fashion as an embodied material practice and a social phenomenon through the development and circulation of fashion-and dress-related teaching collections. Drawing upon our experiences co-curating a digital fashion exhibition about the development of two ethnological dress collections on Cornell’s campus, we discuss the opportunities and challenges that we faced working with these objects in a university setting. Our objective is to contextualize the formation of these collections and raise questions and critiques about the ways in which university dress collections have perpetuated – and continue to perpetuate – forms of discrimination like sexism, homophobia, transphobia, sizeism, classism, ageism and racism amidst an ongoing colonial context. We suggest possible steps for decentring the colonial gaze through digital curation. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Background: Stigma discrimination against people who meet the criteria for mental disorders is frequent in Colombian adolescents; however, there is no valid and reliable instrument for measurement. The study aimed to establish the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale psychometric performance among Colombian adolescents. Methods: A validation study was carried out with 350 students aged between 10 and 17, 53.7% of whom were girls. The authors estimated frequencies for reported behaviors and measured internal consistency and confirmatory factor analysis for intended behaviors. The Reported and Intended Behavior Scale has 2 sub-scales—reported and intended behaviors, with 4 items each. Results: The reported behavior sub-scale ranged from 10.0% to 24.9%, whereas the intended behavior sub-scale presented a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) and a McDonald omega of 0.88. For the confirmatory factor analysis, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin was 0.81, Bartlett chi-squared, was 771.1 (df = 6, P =.001), and Eigen value was 2.95 that explained 73.9% of the total variance. For the goodness-of-fit tests, chi-squared was 21.9 (df = 2, P =.001), root mean square error of approximation was 0.17 (90% CI: 0.11-0.24), Comparative Fit Index was 0.97, Tucker–Lewis Index was 0.92, and standardized root mean square residual was 0.03. Conclusions: The Reported and Intended Behavior Scale can measure reported behaviors, and the intended behavior sub-scale shows high internal consistency. However, the dimensionality of the intended behavior sub-scale presents modest goodness-of-fit indexes. These findings need replications. © 2022, AVES. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the everyday Otherness experienced by Southeast Asian marriage-migrant women in South Korea. South Korea is increasingly ethnically diverse due to the dramatic rise in international marriages between foreign women and Korean men, most of which are facilitated by marriage brokers. Yet little research has been conducted on marriage-migrants' experiences of communicating with local Koreans. Drawing on data collected through in-depth interviews with five participants from Cambodia and Vietnam, this study focuses on specific factors that cause conflicts between these women and local Koreans in various social contexts, including the household, workplaces, and wider communities, and how the women respond to such conflicts and manage challenging interactions. The participants' narratives demonstrate the tensions and conflicts they encounter, which can be divided into three categories: the imposition of Korean ways of living, negative stereotyping, and language use. The women describe being perceived as deviating from Korean society's cultural and linguistic norms and facing pressure to conform to these norms, which sometimes conflict with their own sense of identity. In addition, they experience marginalization through Othering and negative stereotyping in their interactions with Koreans and struggle to develop a sense of belonging to the host society. The results of this study provide implications for second language programs designed for marriage-migrants, which have the potential to enable marriage-migrants to achieve sustainable development in their second language learning and to support their development of multilingual and multicultural identities. © 2022 Mi Yung Park, published by Sciendo.

AB  - Over the past decade, public awareness of transgender people has rapidly increased. Yet people who do not conform to the expectations of their assigned gender often face social prejudice and structural marginalization. Within this context, an increasing number of education researchers have shown interest in taking up questions related to transgender communities. Although there is great potential for education researchers to play a useful role in cultivating trans-competent educational environments, this heightened engagement raises new challenges. How can education researchers design methodologies that avoid reinforcing the structures and epistemologies that have done harm to trans people? This article places that question in historical context through an overview of the relationship between transgender people and social science research over the last century, and the emergence of transgender studies as a response to that history. Then, the article presents a consideration of the role of education research in bridging tensions between the fields of social science and transgender studies. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Theory and research in social, evolutionary, and political psychology indicates that subjective feelings of threat and exposure to objectively threatening circumstances—including pandemic diseases—may contribute to increased affinities for political conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism, and prejudice against out-group members. We investigated these possibilities in the context of Italy, which was the first Western country to be severely affected by the spread of COVID-19. Early on in the pandemic, from March 3–8, 2020, we surveyed 757 Italian adults ranging in age from 18 to 78 years. Results revealed that antipathy toward immigrants and sexual minorities was predicted by (male) sex, COVID-19 anxiety, RWA, and political distrust. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety magnified the effect of RWA on disliking of immigrants and sexual minorities (but not obese or disabled people). Contrary to prediction, political trust failed to attenuate the effects of COVID-19 anxiety or RWA on out-group antipathy. Implications for the theories of right-wing authoritarianism and political ideology as motivated social cognition, as well as the state of contemporary Italian politics are discussed.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine how prejudice and attitude toward people with severe mental illness, formed through exposure to the mass media, affect discriminatory behavior toward them. Methods Between September and November 2019, demographic data were collected using an online survey of 622 adults residing in South Korea. The scales used in this study were taken from the 2008 survey by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Structural equation modeling was performed for a comparative analysis of the direct and indirect effects. Results Virtual experience through mass media exposure had a statistically significant effect on prejudice against people with severe mental illness. Direct experience had a positive influence on reducing prejudice and discriminatory behavior. The direct effects of prejudice on discriminatory behavior were significant. In terms of indirect effects, the full mediating effect of prejudice was significant for the virtual experience through the mass media-prejudice-discriminatory behavior path, and the partial mediating effect of prejudice was significant on the direct experience-prejudice-discrimination behavior path. Conclusion This study recommends more careful reporting of mental illness in the media, promoting anti-stigmatization programs that provide opportunities for direct contact between the public and people with severe mental illness. © 2022.

AB  - This data brief introduces the Friendship and Identity in School (FIS) dataset. The FIS data are school-based longitudinal social network data, which have become increasingly important in recent years. Including information on 2,500 adolescents in nine secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the FIS data have four important key features that make them uniquely suited for studying the co-evolution of friendship networks and group identities or other time-varying individual characteristics. Specifically, the data include (i) fine-grained multidimensional measures of youth' ethnic, national, and religious identities, (ii) comparatively large social networks that span multiple classrooms, (iii) up to six waves over four and a half years, and (iv) an ethnoreligiously diverse sample. Besides friendship and identity, the data include other network dimensions such as romantic relations or dislike as well as repeated measurements of various individual attributes ranging from perceived discrimination over intergroup attitudes and religion to leisure time activities and students' perceptions of parents' identities and attitudes. In combination, the FIS data provide rich longitudinal information that allows researchers to study the development, change, and interplay of youth' group identities and friendship networks as well as broader questions concerning intergroup relations, network formation, and peer influence. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper analyzes the ethics of social science research (SSR) employing big data. We begin by highlighting the research gap found on the intersection between big data ethics, SSR and research ethics. We then discuss three aspects of big data SSR which make it warrant special attention from a research ethics angle: (1) the interpretative character of both SSR and big data, (2) complexities of anticipating and managing risks in publication and reuse of big data SSR, and (3) the paucity of regulatory oversight and ethical recommendations on protecting individual subjects as well as societies when conducting big data SSR. Against this backdrop, we propose using David Resnik’s research ethics framework to analyze some of the most pressing ethical issues of big data SSR. Focusing on the principles of honesty, carefulness, openness, efficiency, respect for subjects, and social responsibility, we discuss three clusters of ethical issues: those related to methodological biases and personal prejudices, those connected to risks arising from data availability and reuse, and those leading to individual and social harms. Finally, we advance considerations to observe in developing future ethical guidelines about big data SSR. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston’s poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the ‘threatening other’. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - If we pay attention to biblical prophets, we can hear in their messages a calling to seek out the liberation of the downtrodden and oppressed. Despite the common tendency to interpret biblical prophets as predictors of the future, their focus was not on the future but their present social and political environments. That means their messages are not straightforward treatises on theology. They are not universalized “truths”. They are messages that call us to be attentive to those who are downtrodden. Their prophetic critique can be read as a call to recognize the humanity in others and to be willing to enter into relational dialogue with them. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Racialized names carry both penalties and premiums in social life. Prior research on implicit associations shows that racialized names tend to activate feelings of racial bias, such that people are more positively inclined toward White-sounding names than they are toward Black- and Hispanic-sounding names. But to what extent do racialized names continue to matter when they do not belong to people? In this article, we use an original data set collected over six months at a high-volume shelter where dogs are frequently given racialized names (N = 1,636). We also conducted a survey with a crowdsourced sample to gauge the racial perceptions of each dog’s name. We combine these data sets to examine how racial perceptions of names are associated with time to adoption, a meaningful outcome that captures people’s willingness to welcome a dog into their family. We find that as dogs’ names are increasingly perceived as White, people adopt them faster. Conversely, as dogs’ names are increasingly perceived as nonhuman (e.g., Fluffy), people adopt them slower. Perceptions of Black names are likewise tied to slower times to adoption, with this effect being concentrated among pit bulls, a breed that is stereotyped as dangerous and racialized as Black. These findings demonstrate the remarkable durability of racialized names. These names shape people’s behavior and their impressions of others even when they are attached to animals—not just humans. © American Sociological Association 2022.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Social determinants of health are rooted in structural racism. The healthcare community has long recognized the existence of significant race- and ethnicity-related health disparities. Yet pervasive disparities persist despite ongoing calls for institutions and healthcare professionals to promote health equity by addressing bias, discrimination, and social determinants of health. All PAs must take responsibility for the various ways in which we may unwittingly reinforce racism in our profession, and must shift our focus from treating the effects of racism to preventing them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals' "cultural prejudices" toward individuals' cultural beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions affect the care they provide. Their awareness of their bias is closely associated with the quality of healthcare provided. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess nurses' perceptions regarding providing care to Syrian refugee patients using metaphors and to evaluate their views based on these metaphors. METHODS: The participants in this qualitative study consisted of 80 nurses who worked in Level 1 and Level 2 health institutions. Data were collected using an interview form prepared by the researchers. The form included descriptive characteristics of the nurses and two expressions used to determine the nurses' opinions on providing care for Syrian refugee patients. The nurses were given an incomplete sentence, which was "Providing care for a Syrian refugee patient…because…," and were asked to complete the blanks. The data were analyzed using the content analysis method. RESULTS: On the basis of "providing care for Syrian refugee patients," four categories of metaphors were determined: occupational awareness, health promotion, a difficult process/resistance, and providing service in vain. The participants generated 50 metaphors, with "humanity," "a baby/little child," and "a barrier" as the three most used metaphors, belonging to the "occupational awareness" and "a difficult process/resistance" categories, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The metaphors of nurses regarding giving care to Syrian refugee patients were mostly concentrated in the categories of "occupational awareness" and "a difficult process/resistance." Metaphors generated by the nurses offer a powerful research tool to reveal, understand, and explain nurses' personal perceptions and to develop and support nursing care accordingly. In addition, the subject of transcultural nursing should be discussed more extensively in nursing education programs. Understanding the social context of refugees is very important during the nursing care process. Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Research on political homophily has almost exclusively focused on adults, and little is known about whether political homophily is present early in life when political attitudes are forming and friendship networks are rapidly changing. We examined political homophily using a social network approach with rural middle school students (N = 213; mean age = 12.5 years; 57% female) from a remote U.S. community. Preregistered analyses indicated that early adolescents were more likely to spend time with people who shared similar political attitudes and values. These effects were most consistent for right-wing authoritarianism, patriotism, and anti-immigration attitudes. Our results show that political homophily is evident at an early age when young people are forming their political beliefs and making decisions about their friendships, suggesting that peer political-attitude socialization may emerge early in life. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Though professional damages in respect of young personal injury victims are recognized in principle by the Dintilhac group, and confirmed by the Court of Cassation in terms of full compensation for damages suffered, the assessment of such professional damages remains difficult, and the source of myriad legal disputes. Assessment of lost future earnings requires a specific approach: As regards the benchmark salary, judges base this on the average or median salary in France, taking into account the social and family environment which may represent a loss of opportunity. The jurisprudence recognizes that the permanent incapacity of the victim entitles them to lifetime compensation, mostly in the form of an annuity. However, while the civil judge considers that the payment of an allowance for disabled adults (AAH) or an educational allowance for disabled children (AEEH) does not interfere with the calculation of lost professional earnings, the administrative judge takes the opposite stance. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Although White Americans increasingly express egalitarian views, how they express egalitarianism may reveal inegalitarian tendencies and sow mistrust with Black Americans. In the present experiments, Black perceivers inferred likability and trustworthiness and accurately inferred underlying racial attitudes and motivations from White writers’ declarations that they are nonprejudiced and egalitarian (Experiments 1 and 2). White writers believed that their egalitarianism seemed more inoffensive and indicative of allyship than was perceived by Black Americans (Experiment 1a). Linguistic analysis revealed that, when inferring racial attitudes and motivations, Black perceivers accurately attended to language emphasizing humanization, support for equal opportunity, personal responsibility, and the idea that equality already exists (Experiment 1b). We found causal evidence that these linguistic cues informed Black Americans’ perceptions of White egalitarians (Experiment 2). Suggesting societal costs of these perceptions, White egalitarians’ underlying racial beliefs negatively predicted Black participants’ actual trust and cooperation in an economic game (Experiment 3). Our experiments (N = 1,335 adults) showed that White Americans’ insistence that they are egalitarian itself perpetuates mistrust with Black Americans. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers continues to increase, schools continue to become a vital center for children to develop positive intergroup attitudes. Teacher-led activities can become useful tools in sustainable prejudice reduction. A field intervention incorporated normative in-group influence with imagined intergroup contact to reduce children's anti-refugee bias. Ten primary school classes (N = 269, Mage = 10.69 years) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (a) class norm-framed imagined contact (n = 88), (b) family norm-framed imagined contact (n = 49), (c) religious in-group norm-framed imagined contact (n = 51), or (d) standard (n = 80) imagined contact. Teachers facilitated a series of four imagined contact activities over 4 weeks, with anti-refugee bias measured at baseline and 2 weeks after the final activity. Imagined contact framed in the class context was associated with significantly lower post-intervention contact intentions bias as compared to standard imagined contact. There were no significant effects of family or religion norm framed imagined contact conditions. Findings are discussed in relation to the feasibility of teacher-led school-based interventions and the importance of a supportive normative context in the classroom for anti-refugee bias. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - With over 400 harmful immigration policy changes in the past 4 years, Latinx adolescents and families nationwide are developing within a context of extreme anti-immigrant sentiment (Dismantling and reconstructing the U.S. immigration system: A catalog of changes under the Trump presidency, Migration Policy Institute, 2020). This paper introduces the Multitiered Model of Oppression and Discrimination (MMOD), a conceptual model for understanding the impacts of multiple levels of discrimination on the well-being and development of Latinx immigrant adolescents. Interpersonal discrimination (Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 2010, 32, 259), community-held stereotypes (Social Psychology of Education, 2001, 5, 201), institutional policies (Children and Youth Services Review, 2018, 87, 192), and structural practices (Journal of Criminal Justice, 2020, 66, 1) can negatively impact well-being and development among these adolescents. Culturally sustaining interventions, civic engagement and mobilization, and policies targeting inequitable policies and practices will provide healing and an avenue for liberation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Encounters with racial discrimination occur from various sources and contexts for Latinx youth. From a historical context, Latinx have long experienced anti-immigrant sentiment and have been treated as perpetual foreigners. This study centers the voices of U.S.-born Latinx youth and explores their experiences of discrimination in 83 in-depth interviews (15–25 years, (Formula presented.) age = 21.27, SD = 2.10; 58% Female). Through retrospective accounts, we identified four themes across narratives: assumed (illegal) immigrant, assumed unintelligent, assumed criminal, assumed inferior. Overt and subtle discrimination occurred across contexts and from multiple sources including peers, store employees, and strangers. The findings have implications for understanding Latinx youth make meaning of past experiences of discrimination and how those experiences are interpreted later in life. © 2022 Society for Research on Adolescence.

AB  - Does hearing about or witnessing someone else experience discrimination harm individuals’ mental health? Using data from the Nashville Stress and Health Study, we answer this question by examining how vicarious discrimination impacts depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and anger among black Americans. We also test whether mastery and self-esteem moderate the association between vicarious discrimination and each mental health outcome. Findings indicate experiencing vicarious discrimination via a family member has a similar impact on mental health to personally experiencing discrimination. While experiencing vicarious discrimination via a close friend also increased mental health problems, it appeared to be less harmful than personally experiencing discrimination. Moreover, self-esteem moderated the association between vicarious discrimination via a family member and via a close friend and mental health, while mastery did not. This study provides new insights into ways vicarious discrimination impacts health as well as the role that psychosocial resources play in shaping this relationship. © American Sociological Association 2022.

AB  - Group-living primates exhibit variable reactions to intergroup encounters (or IGEs), reflecting species-specific strategies and individual motivations. In chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), dominating in IGEs provides fitness benefits. Less is known about responses to IGEs in bonobos (Pan paniscus) despite their equal relevance for understanding the origins of human intergroup relations. We observed the Bompusa West (WBp) bonobo community at LuiKotale during a 2-month shift in ranging resulting in frequent IGEs with the smaller Bompusa East (EBp) community. We tested whether incursions provided ecological benefits, and whether responses to IGEs were consistent with inter-community dominance or tolerance. We measured fruit availability and collected activity scans from 26 mature WBp community members when in their core ranging area, during incursions into the EBp ranging area, and during IGEs. We collected data on sexual interactions and aggression with in-group and out-group members during 19 independent IGEs. During their shift in ranging, fruit availability was greater in the EBp ranging area, and WBp bonobos consumed more fruit during incursions than when in their core ranging area. Coalitionary intergroup aggression occurred during nine IGEs, and outcomes were consistent with imbalances in fighting power, in that larger WBp parties supplanted smaller EBp parties from the immediate area. However, communities reformed associations following 70% of coalitionary conflicts, and prolonged IGEs facilitated out-group sexual interactions and female transfers. The WBp community shift in ranging was likely motivated by ecological factors and responses to increased IGEs reflected a mixture of competitive and tolerant strategies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of a school-based program designed to reduce implicit prejudice towards migrants in fifth-grade school children. The program used empathy and perspective taking and direct and indirect contact as strategies to reduce ethnic prejudice. Multiple activities were used, including drawings by migrant children as instruments to promote inclusive behaviors. One hundred and five students were divided into two groups (control, experimental), and the children in each completed the Child-IAT (Implicit Association Test) before and after the program, to measure their implicit prejudice. Only the experimental group participated in the program. The results showed a significant reduction in the implicit prejudice in the experimental group after the educational program, but not in the control group. The results are discussed considering the practical implications of such a school program. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Racial equality requires coalitions and solidarity across racial groups, but there continues to be racially colorblind and anti-Black attitudes within the Asian American community, a diverse community consisting of individuals with ancestral origins in East, Southeast, and South Asia. However, there is limited research on the factors that contribute to the development of these attitudes among Asian Americans. Parents could potentially play an important role in perpetuating or challenging the colorblind and anti-Black messages that pervade U.S. society. Thus, the current study investigates how 309 Asian American adolescents’ (M age = 16.8; SD = 1.15; 50.5% female) perceptions of parents’ racial socialization messages about race and racism relate to the youth’s racial attitudes. Latent profiles of youth’s perceptions of mothers’ and fathers’ racial socialization messages and their associations with colorblind racial attitudes and anti-Black attitudes were examined. For mothers, three socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant, Race Hesitant, and Race Embracing; for fathers, two socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant and Race Embracing. Adolescents with Race Embracing mothers reported less anti-Black attitudes compared to those who had Race Hesitant mothers. For fathers, there were no differences among the profiles and anti-Black attitudes. However, surprisingly, adolescents with Race Embracing fathers were more likely to have colorblind racial attitudes compared to those with Race Avoidant fathers. The findings highlight the importance of racial socialization in the development of Asian American adolescents’ racial attitudes to continue fighting for interracial solidarity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The ascent of populism has been linked with economic and cultural disruptions of modernization. From this perspective, it could be implied that factors such as psychological insecurity and uncertainty are key in making voters gravitate toward the populist narrative. The present research aimed at highlighting the psychological determinants that uncertainties deriving from modernization processes may activate in populist voters. Specifically, we focused on immigration in Italy, investigating whether and how support for different populist parties relates to development of negative attitudes toward immigrants. Two samples of Italian adults (total N = 1655), who voted in the Italian general elections of March 4, 2018 took part in the research. Multigroup path analysis showed that assumption of anti-immigration stances through the joint mediating role of Dangerous World Belief and Right-Wing Authoritarianism was shared by different groups of populist voters. However, different populist voters differed in the strength of the path passing through Competitive Jungle World Belief and Social Dominance Orientation. Results underline the relevance of social worldviews and ideological attitudes in shaping the attitudes of the Italian populist electorate. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In 2014 approximately 14.4% of Americans ages 18 to 24 had some type of disability. Compared to their peers without disabilities, disabled emerging adults typically have more difficulty dating and finding romantic and sexual partners. One way that they may escape disability stigma and smaller dating pools is through online dating. However, little is known about their experiences seeking romantic and sexual relationships online, and even less is known about the experiences of emerging adults with disabilities who identify with sexual orientations and have gender identities that are not heterosexual or cisgender. In the present study 27 LGBTQ+ emerging adults with various disabilities, genders, and sexual orientations completed 47 item online surveys before COVID in which they described their experiences with online dating and starting and sustaining romantic relationships. Results from qualitative data analyses suggest that rather than being neutral spaces that exist separately from stigma and social prejudice, dating apps and web sites typically perpetuate normative ideas of ableism, sexuality, and gender and stimulate questions of timing of disability disclosure. Despite challenges, however, online dating also offers opportunities to interact with multiple interested daters and appears to offer LGBTQ+ emerging adults with disabilities an often beneficial though sometimes vexing venue for relationship development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The media plays a vital role in addressing the issues of society through audiovisual means that contribute to the transmission of media messages. Drama contributes to implement positive values or negative attitudes in people's minds towards various societal issues. The negative stereotypes shaped by drama about persons with disabilities (PWDs) have attracted the attention of the researchers. Therefore, Arabic drama is required to present a true portrait of PWDs that reflects their reality without exaggeration or discrimination. It is also required to re-correct the stereotyped image that has been formed in society towards PWDs. Aims: This literature research was conducted to review and analyze research and theses that presented PWDs in Arabic drama. The research sought to reveal the stereotypical behavior of PWDs in Arabic drama, categories of disability, and drama genres that presented PWDs. Methods and procedures: This research included 17 peer-reviewed research and thesis obtained from Arab and international databases from 2002 to 2022. The content analysis card was used to achieve the aims of this research. Outcomes and results: The findings of the literature review indicated that the majority of Arab dramas presented negative stereotypes of PWDs. The results also showed that intellectual disability, visual impairment, and physical disabilities were the most dominant in Arabic movies and television series. Conclusions and implications: Arabic drama and media were unable to present accurate representations of PWDs. They appeared in a distorted and satirical way in movies and television series. Perhaps, these negative stereotypes emerged from the prevailing popular cultures in the Arab countries that produce these movies and series. It is thus necessary to remove these stereotypes expressed in drama to enhance awareness and societal inclusion in the Arab culture and countries. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The present study tested whether cardiac vagal activity—which is known to play a vital role in social cognition and engagement—predicted the impact of faces of other ethnicity on selective attention under load. Based on the neurovisceral integration theory, we hypothesized that participants with higher resting heart rate variability (HRV) would exhibit better task performance of a target detection task in trials with face distractors of other ethnicity than participants with lower resting HRV, when cognitive resources were scarce under high load. Caucasian participants were instructed to detect a target letter among letter strings superimposed on Black or White male distractor faces under high and low perceptual load. Consistent with the prediction, under high load, HRV was positively correlated with accuracy in trials with Black distractor faces, but not in trials with White distractor faces. The current research demonstrated that individual differences in cardiac vagal tone predicted successful inhibition of an ethnicity-related distractor with limited cognitive resources, which allowed for completing goal-directed behavior more successfully. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper focuses on the identity creation processes of Deaf people in Malaysian society using an intersectionality approach to issues of identity, disability, and Deaf studies. Deaf people belong to a marginalized community and typically experience stereotyped, prejudiced, and stigmatized treatment from the hearing community, which has a serious impact on their social and personal identity development. Without sufficient information about the process of identity creation for Deaf people, the hearing community cannot reduce inequality nor can it increase social integration and stability for the Deaf community. There is a paucity of research about this identity creation process in Malaysia, and few studies have used identity-related theories and Deaf studies to examine the issue. This study uses a constructivist point of view, employing an interpretive phenomenological epistemology in order to construct insightful accounts of participants’ personal and interpersonal experience in mainstream society. The data was analyzed using methods associated with grounded theory and constant comparative analysis in order to reveal the extent to which they identify themselves, that is linguistic minority or PWD. The findings suggest that, on the one hand, mainstream society categorizes Deaf people as Persons with Disabilities rather than as a linguistic minority; on the other hand, without realizing it, Deaf people typically accept society's evaluation by identifying with it and playing the expected roles of PWD. © 2022

AB  - After a civil war, community support for the reintegration of ex-combatants is crucial for peace-building. Using a crowdfunding campaign to promote trainees’ business ideas, we investigate whether university students discriminate against ex-combatants in Colombia. Our results show that there is no discrimination against ex-combatants in terms of donations compared with other trainees, but there is a substantial degree of prejudice and skepticism. This finding suggests that the reintegration of ex-combatants might be affected by the NIMBY phenomena. Although willing to economically support the peace process, individuals are skeptical towards personal encounters with ex-combatants. This suggest that to achieve sustainable peace, policies should focus on decreasing stigmatization towards ex-combatants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Scholarship in American politics finds whites’ racial resentment and status threat predict their vote choice. However, research in social identity indicates that such variables should negatively correlate with participation, attenuating resentful whites’ political power. We resolve this contradiction by studying these variables interactively, using data from the 2012, 2016, and 2020 American National Election Studies. Our primary independent variables are racial resentment and a measure of relative discrimination that captures whites’ perceptions of inequality relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Both constituent variables are negatively associated with participation. Interactively, they are positively associated with political participation. These relationships persist when we predict voter turnout, an index measuring non-electoral participation, and an index measuring civic engagement. In 2012, our interaction term moderates the negative impact of racial resentment in relative discrimination. In elections contested by Donald Trump, our interaction term has a positive substantive effect. Our findings advance scholarship on white political behavior. First, they identify a relationship between whites’ racial attitudes and participation, advancing a research program that primarily examines vote choice. Second, they clarify the relationship between different white racial attitudes. Next, they detail the conditional relationship between whites’ prejudice and politics and how it has changed over time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present research applied the social identity approach to examine how the perceived legitimacy of weight-based discrimination among ingroup members influences their experience of their higher-weight identity and their well-being, and the conditions under which this occurs. Specifically, we investigated whether portraying weight-based discrimination as legitimate, as opposed to illegitimate, influenced higher-weight individuals’ group identification, intentions to engage in collective action on behalf of their group, and their body satisfaction and self-esteem. The moderating role of group boundary permeability and the mediating role of group identification were also examined. North American adults with a self-reported BMI of or above 30 (N = 327) were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: weight-based discrimination that was portrayed as legitimate or illegitimate by other ingroup members. Results revealed that portraying weight-based discrimination as being perceived as legitimate (versus illegitimate) among ingroup members significantly reduced group identification, but only among those who perceived their group's boundaries to be more permeable. For this particular group, reduced identification predicted, in turn, lower collective action intentions, body satisfaction, and self-esteem. This study highlights the damaging effect of legitimized discrimination for ingroup identification and the downstream consequences for collective action and well-being. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Western culture is a decidedly anti-fat culture. Thus fat people are subjected to weight stigma and confront discrimination in virtually every facet of their lives. As a result, fat people often develop a self-concept that includes the stigmatized social identity. Weight stigma is also a traumatic experience that disrupts fat people's embodiment by diminishing feelings of attunement to and appreciation for their bodies. Therefore, healing from the trauma of weight stigma may involve developing a more positive fat identity through a process of fat embodiment. Fat embodiment may improve fat people's well-being by bolstering the integrity of the self, supporting efforts to resist public stigma and heal internalized stigma. In our analysis of embodied approaches to resistance and healing, we draw on social and clinical psychology and the works of public fat scholars and activists. We describe methods of fat embodiment like embracing bodily needs, engaging with fat-positive perspectives, connecting with fat community, and embracing desire and sensual pleasure. Ultimately, we conclude that transforming a negative fat identity into a positive identity through fat embodiment can support the pursuit of justice for fat bodies, connect fat people to their bodily needs and sensations, and support increased self-care and bodily fulfillment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: To interview healthcare providers who serve adolescent populations to learn their perspectives on the factors that influence the continuum of sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth's pregnancy expaeriences, including decision-making about sex, relationships, and pregnancy. Methods: As part of the SexuaL Orientation, Gender Identity, and Pregnancy Experiences (SLOPE) Study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 U.S.-based healthcare providers who had experience providing care for both SGM youth and pregnant youth. Interview questions examined providers’ experiences caring for this population, including their perceptions of the risk and protective factors influencing SGM youth's pregnancy prevention, avoidance, and decision-making processes. Audio-recorded interview data were analyzed using immersion/crystallization and thematic analysis methods. Results: Three themes were identified from the healthcare providers’ transcripts1) Cultural norms about adolescent pregnancy and sexuality, 2) Interpersonal relationships and family support, 3) Sex education, sexual and reproductive healthcare access, and sexual health equity. Conclusion: In conjunction with sexual health education and healthcare access, healthcare providers described many social contexts—like peers, family, and communities—that interact with each other and with adolescent development to shape pre-conception practices and pregnancy decision-making processes. Future research, practice, and sexual health messaging about adolescent pregnancy would benefit from acknowledging the complex interplay among social identities and positions, structural prejudice, and the nuanced diversity in community and interpersonal factors—including those in sexual healthcare settings, like provider-patient communication and sex education delivery—that shape SGM youth's dating and sexuality experiences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The threat of COVID-19 has triggered nationalism, prejudice and support for anti-democratic political systems around the world. Authoritarianism—an individual's orientation toward social conformity and individual autonomy—shapes interpretations of and responses to threat. We drew on theories of authoritarianism and threat to propose that authoritarians and libertarians will interpret the threat of COVID-19 in distinct ways. An online survey of 368 Scottish nationals was administered via the Prolific platform. Original measures of realistic and symbolic threat from COVID-19 were included, along with an established measure of the authoritarian predisposition. Linear regression analyses showed that COVID-19 was perceived primarily as a realistic threat to physical and material well-being; however, authoritarians were more likely than others to interpret the novel coronavirus as a symbolic threat to their prevailing values. Our findings contribute to understanding the psychology of pandemic-era attitudes and behaviours and provide insight into possible political consequences of the coronavirus threat. The results also demonstrate how considering authoritarians' subjective construal of threats can resolve questions in the authoritarianism and threat literature and advance theory. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: To develop a conceptual framework to understand and define the impact of DSD diagnosis and management from the perspective of parents of recently diagnosed children. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of children diagnosed with 46 XX, 46 XY, or chromosomal DSD including complete or partial androgen insensitivity, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or 5-alpha reductase deficiency. Analysis was completed using content analysis with an inductive approach by three coders. Results: Parents of 6 patients agreed to be interviewed, consistent with saturation points for prior similar studies; a total of 16 recurring themes were identified which were further grouped by similarity and categorized into 1 of 3 meta-themes: a) personal impact (effect of diagnosis on parents psyche, happiness, gender/sexual identity, anatomic function, mental health), b) family impact (relationships with parents/siblings, parental guilt); and c) societal impact (bullying, need for secrecy, future desirability, societal openness to DSD individuals). Conclusions: Personal, family, and societal concerns amongst parents following a DSD diagnosis have significant potential psychosocial impacts for both parents as well children. The nexus between these categories provides a framework for approaching diagnosis and management of DSD and has implications for patients, families, and clinicians. Improved resource allocation, education, and clinical tools conceived through this framework may considerably alleviate potent psychosocial stressors for parents of children born with DSD. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - South Africa hosts some of the busiest maritime ports which are gateway ports to several landlocked countries in the region. Road transportation is the main modality for moving goods between seaports and hinterland within South Africa and beyond to at least six landlocked countries in the region. However, the high rate of violent crime against freight trucks and vans has for many years been a major known risk to the road freight transport industry. Traditionally, these crimes have been motivated by monetary proceeds from sales of stolen goods from hijacked vehicles or the vehicles themselves. Recently, however, influenced by anti-immigrant sentiments, similar attacks have been specifically targeting foreign drivers and trucks resulting in death, injury, and damage to vehicles and cargo. Previously considered an internal problem for South Africa as a matter arising from domestic social and economic challenges in that country, the emergence of attacks on foreign drivers and trucks have raised concerns about the future of South Africa as an economic powerhouse, its role as a transit country for landlocked countries, and about its relationship with regional neighbors. For the landlocked countries in the region, any instability in South Africa can have a serious impact on the logistics that sustain businesses and international trade. This exploratory study gives an overview of the increasingly complex issue of violent attacks against foreign nationals in South Africa with a focus on attacks targeting the road freight transport sector and the implications on regional integration efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: The study examined how clinicians described their patients in relation to their practices of contraceptive counseling. Study design: This qualitative study involved individual interviews with 15 clinicians working in obstetrics and gynecology in South Carolina about their approaches to contraceptive counseling. We analyzed the data using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches. Results: Clinicians attributed challenges of working with diverse patient populations to patients’ race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. Clinicians often interpreted patient concerns about or refusal to use effective contraceptive methods as a problem with patients themselves. When clinicians described patients in disparaging ways, they often focused on adolescent patients. Conclusion: Bias informed by structural inequalities and power relations influences how clinicians perceive their patients and approach counseling them about contraception. Such practices may limit patients’ informed decision-making and autonomy regarding initiating or continuing contraceptive use. Implications: Greater attention to redressing structural inequalities and power relations that inform provider bias in the context of contraceptive counseling is needed to ensure patients receive person-centered healthcare free from prejudice and discrimination. Fostering structural competency among clinicians may improve provider-patient interactions and support patients' reproductive autonomy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This qualitative study aims to learn about the stereotypes and experiences of 14-year-old students in Denizli, Turkey. Acquisitions of stereotypes in Turkey are included in Social Studies Curriculum at 6th and 7th grades (12–13 years old) in secondary school. For this reason, the study group was formed considering that a 14-year-old student had knowledge and experience related to stereotypes and that 12 students were volunteers. A semi-structured interview form was used to collect data. The data obtained from the interviews are organized in the form of codes, categories, and themes. Direct quotations are included to show the students' observations and experiences in detail. Based on the results of the research, the stereotypes obtained from the students' views were collected under the themes of "Stereotypes Based on Gender", "Stereotypes Based on Social Roles and Responsibilities", "Stereotypes Based on Personality Traits" and "Stereotypes Based on Socialization". When student views that support all these themes are examined, it becomes clear that stereotypes in a society strongly feed prejudices. However, it has been found that male and female students are negatively affected by strict gender roles in general, and separate definitions for men and women disturb students. According to the findings, it is seen that students approach stereotypes with a critical mindset. Furthermore, the students uncovered the stereotypes that exist in Turkish society and attempted to explain how they and society were affected by these stereotypes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Across the world, there is anecdotal evidence that transgender women tend to minimalize easily discernable identity cues to reduce the likelihood of facing anti-transgender prejudice and discrimination. Thus, we believe that an examination of whether variability in transgender women’s group identification (i.e., strong or weak transgender group identification) might influence important life outcomes (e.g., workplace mistreatment) certainly seems warranted. Moreover, in the Pacific Island of Fiji there is strong qualitative evidence of a pervasive pattern of anti-transgender prejudice. However, there has been minimal empirical examination of factors that might influence such prejudicial reactions. We explored (N = 294), in a case of transgender-related workplace mistreatment (i.e., unfair termination), whether victim group identification (i.e., strong vs. weak) would influence perceived victim culpability, endorsement of co-worker support (i.e., agreeing that the victim should receive co-worker support), and termination endorsement (i.e., support for the termination) among Fijian participants. We further examined whether transgender-related prejudice moderated these effects. At high levels of prejudice, there was greater negative responding (i.e., greater perceived culpability, less support endorsement, greater termination endorsement) towards the strongly identified victim relative to the weakly identified victim. Conversely, at low levels of prejudice, there was no impact of group identification level on perceived culpability. Unexpectedly, low prejudice individuals also reported a “favorability bias” (i.e., greater support endorsement, less termination endorsement) towards the strongly relative to the weakly identified victim. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study examined the role of racial attitudes in a diverse high school setting. Teachers and students were recruited from a public charter high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The final sample consisted of 19 students and 10 teachers who participated in face-to-face interviews regarding racial attitudes and racial bias in the academic setting. Three themes emerged among the teacher interviews: rejecting racial inequalities, contradicting thoughts and color-blind explanations, and racially conscious explanations. For the student interviews, two themes emerged: color-blind racial attitudes and witnessing/experiencing bias. These findings yield evidence that color-blind racial attitudes are prevalent in diverse schools among students and teachers, presenting a challenge to intervention efforts in schools aimed at promoting racial justice. © 2022 Society for Research on Adolescence.

AB  - The Isoko, like other peoples of Nigeria, played significant roles in the historical process and evolution of Nigeria and should be acknowledged as such. The paper teases out much more clearly—and, more importantly, the multiple stages of the British expansion into Isoko. That is, how does that multi-stage, multi-phase process affect how we think more broadly about British colonial expansion in Africa in the 19th century? The paper deposes that the Isoko as a people did not accept British rule until the “punitive expedition” to the area in 1911 brought the whole of the Isoko country under British control. This is done within the context of the military conquest and subjugation of the people, colonial prejudices, and the resulting social economic, and political changes. The paper deploying both primary and secondary data highlights the role played by the Isoko in resisting British penetration into and subjugation of their country between 1896 and 1911. The year 1896 marked the beginning of British formal contact with the Isoko when the first treaty was signed with Owe (Owhe), while 1911 was when the Isoko were conquered by the British and brought under British control. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The current cross-sectional study examined Greek teachers' attitudes towards marriage equality and beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex parent families. A total of 183 teachers participated in this study. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Convenience sampling through teachers' social networks was utilised. This study's data were collected using two standardised instruments, attitudes toward same-sex marriage and children's adjustment in same-sex families. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the associations between the variables of this research. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was utilised to analyze the relationship between predictor variables and the children's adjustment in same-sex families' instrument. A negative stance toward same-sex marriage was a significant predictor of negative attitudes towards children's adjustment in same-sex parent families. The role of personal and contextual factors in determining teachers' beliefs about same-sex parenting was partially supported. This study fills an important gap by examining attitudes towards same-sex parenting in a context that directly influences high school students. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Sexual and gender minority (SGM; i.e., non-heterosexual and transgender or gender-expansive, respectively) people experience physical health disparities attributed to greater exposure to minority stress (experiences of discrimination or victimization, anticipation of discrimination or victimization, concealment of SGM status, and internalization of stigma) and structural stigma. Purpose: To examine which components of minority stress and structural stigma have the strongest relationships with physical health among SGM people. Methods: Participants (5,299 SGM people, 1,902 gender minority individuals) were from The Population Research in Identity and Disparities for Equality (PRIDE) Study. Dominance analyses estimated effect sizes showing how important each component of minority stress and structural stigma was to physical health outcomes. Results: Among cisgender sexual minority women, transmasculine individuals, American Indian or Alaskan Native SGM individuals, Asian SGM individuals, and White SGM individuals a safe current environment for SGM people had the strongest relationship with physical health. For gender-expansive individuals and Black, African American, or African SGM individuals, the safety of the environment for SGM people in which they were raised had the strongest relationship with physical health. Among transfeminine individuals, victimization experiences had the strongest relationship with physical health. Among Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish individuals, accepting current environments had the strongest relationship with physical health. Among cisgender sexual minority men prejudice/discrimination experiences had the strongest relationship with physical health. Conclusion: Safe community environments had the strongest relationships with physical health among most groups of SGM people. Increasing safety and buffering the effects of unsafe communities are important for SGM health. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this article I maintain that when employers could free workers from the space constraint of the office without incurring unbearable economic losses, it is morally wrong not to grant workers the possibility to work remotely, as this violates the humanity formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative. The article therefore aims to contribute to the development of Kantian business ethics, taking into account a series of empirical evidence gathered in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. I firstly discuss the Kantian concept of meaningful work and explain why, due to a prejudice that existed with respect to remote work before the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of freedom from the office was not given normative relevance. I then introduce a Kantian argument in defence of remote work and proceed to discuss two objections. The first objection is that remote work may well foster productivity, but it creates problems in terms of innovation and training of new staff. The second objection is that remote work hinders rather than fosters meaningful work because it deprives employees of social relations and inhibits workplace identity. I conclude by explaining why neither objection undermines the normative argument that workers should be allowed to work remotely as long as the “bearable costs” clause is met. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia are mostly given care by their parents in Turkey. This brings the burden of caring for the parents and increases the risks of being exposed to violence within the surrounding environment for the patients with schizophrenia. This research aims at determining the violence facing patients with schizophrenia from their surrounding environment. The research sample consists of 36 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the criteria of DSM-IV receiving outpatient care. The data was collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews and analysed by thematic content analysis method. The research findings reveal both the violence victimization of patients and their expectations from their families as well as their surrounding environment. The findings demonstrate that almost all the research participants have been prone to verbal violence while the majority of them faced physical violence in their family life as well as social life. The patients mostly anticipate respect, recognition, and a decent living just as other members of society. The research shows that patients with schizophrenia expect their family and their surrounding environment to treat them just as the other members of society. For a decent living for those patients in the society, it is of vital importance to challenge existing prejudice against them while also supporting services for awareness-raising. Moreover, a set of services to strengthen the relations and to provide support to both the patient and the family within the society should be developed and generalized. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature India Private Limited.

AB  - The dominant theoretical approach to exploring ethnic and racial inequality in marketing and consumer research focuses on discrete acts of discrimination that stem from social psychological causes (e.g., prejudice, stereotypes, and negative racial attitudes). It holds limited explanatory power for meso- and macro-structural phenomena that also generate racialized outcomes. An implication is that ethnic and racial inequality can be portrayed as something imposed on market systems rather than a routine feature of their functioning. In response, I introduce and synthesize two variants of Racial Formation Theory (RFT) and propose it as a useful theoretical approach for addressing whether and how organizational and institutional actors in market systems engage in goal-directed action that allocates resources in ways that challenge (or reinforce) ethnic and racial oppression. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Donald Trump's campaign slogan to Make America Great Again captivated the imagination of millions of Americans by contextualizing disparate sources of social resentment as emblematic of a broader story of American decline. Employing a traditionalist civil religious jeremiad, Trump called for a reassertion of American exceptionalism, and extolled a romanticized golden age predating transformative social changes (e.g., sexuality, gender roles, racial equality). As such, his rhetoric legitimized the defense of white male privilege as a vital component of this restoration. While this use of civil religious themes emboldened those who harbor prejudicial views, it alienated others who interpret such rhetoric as an assault on the soul of the nation. Relying on a unique module within the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we demonstrate that adherence to the tenets of American civil religion significantly exacerbated the effects of symbolic racism and modern sexism on support for Trump.

AB  - Based on a field experiment conducted in Germany between October 2014 and October 2015, this article focuses on the disadvantages associated with the presence of a foreign accent in the early hiring process, when applicants call in response to a job advertisement to ask whether the position is still available. We examine whether a foreign accent influences employers’ behaviors via productivity considerations and/or whether foreign-accented speech is related to statistical discrimination or tastes among employers or customers that translate into differential treatment. To address these processes, we supplement our field-experimental data with information on job and firm characteristics from the texts of vacancy announcements and advertising companies’ homepages, on labor supply from the Federal Employment Agency, and on anti-immigrant attitudes from the German General Social Survey. Results suggest that while calling with a Turkish name did not result in a lower rate of positive replies, this rate was reduced for candidates who called with a Turkish accent. Turkish-accented applicants were told more often than the advertised position was already filled. Our findings suggest that the difference in response rates was not due to productivity considerations related to how well individuals understood foreign-accented speakers. Instead, results support the notion that the observed disadvantages were linked to discrimination based on employers’ ethnic tastes. While we found no indications pointing to the relevance of customer tastes or statistical discrimination, we cannot rule out these processes altogether. Our findings demonstrate that language cues can be more relevant than applicants’ names in shaping employers’ initial responses. They, thereby, highlight the need to consider multiple ethnic cues and different stages of the hiring process. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Tanzanian children with surgically correctable disabilities face challenges in accessing healthcare and cultural and societal stigma and prejudice. This paper provides insight into the staff perceptions from one rehabilitation center in Tanzania, The Plaster House, pertaining to disability, treatment, and change broadly for children with disabilities who receive treatments. Methods: This was a qualitative content analysis. As part of a program evaluation, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 staff members of The Plaster House, gaining perceptions about change for children with disabilities receiving treatments. The Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Matrix was utilized to organize the data into categories and form results. Results: Themes were identified and organized within the following categories in the CBR Matrix: health, rehabilitation, education, social roles, and empowerment. Each was associated with the child or family caregiver experience at The Plaster House. Conclusion: Findings provided rare insight from Tanzanian staff on the valuable social, emotional, and physical impacts of specialized treatment for children with disabilities and their parents. Transformational changes are possible for children with disabilities and their families despite poverty and limited access to services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether structural and individual forms of stigma are associated with neurodevelopment in children. Method: Stigma related to gender, race, and Latinx ethnicity was measured at the structural level using objective state-level indicators of social policies and prejudicial attitudes and at the individual level using self-reports of perceived discrimination. Respective associations of stigma with hippocampal volume and amygdala reactivity to threat were examined using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 11,534, mean age 9.9 years), the first multisite neuroimaging study that provided substantial variability in sociopolitical contexts and that included individual-level measures of stigma among youth. Results: In a preregistered analysis, Black (B = −58.26, p =.023) and Latinx (B = −40.10, p =.044) youths in higher (vs lower) structural stigma contexts were found to have smaller hippocampal volume, controlling for total intracranial volume, demographics, and family socioeconomic status. This association was also observed at a trend-level among girls (p =.082). The magnitude of the difference in hippocampal volume between high and low structural stigma states was equivalent to the predicted impact of a $20,000 difference in annual family income in this sample. As hypothesized, structural stigma was not associated with hippocampal volume in nonstigmatized youths, providing evidence of specificity. Perceived discrimination was unrelated to hippocampal volume in stigmatized groups. No associations between perceived discrimination or structural stigma and amygdala reactivity to threat were observed. Conclusion: This study provides novel evidence that an objective measure of structural stigma may be more strongly related to hippocampal volume than subjective perceptions of stigma, suggesting that contextual approaches to stigma could yield new insights into neurodevelopment among marginalized youth. © 2021 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

AB  - Objective: To examine whether anti-Black cultural racism moderates the efficacy of psychotherapy interventions among youth. Method: A subset of studies from a previous meta-analysis of 5 decades of youth psychotherapy randomized controlled trials was analyzed. Studies were published in English between 1963 and 2017 and identified through a systematic search. The 194 studies (N = 14,081 participants; age range, 2-19) across 34 states comprised 2,678 effect sizes (ESs) measuring mental health problems (eg, depression) targeted by interventions. Anti-Black cultural racism was operationalized using a composite index of 31 items measuring explicit racial attitudes (obtained from publicly available sources, eg, General Social Survey) aggregated to the state level and linked to the meta-analytic database. Analyses were conducted with samples of majority-Black (ie, ≥50% Black) (n = 36 studies) and majority-White (n = 158 studies) youth. Results: Two-level random-effects meta-regression analyses indicated that higher anti-Black cultural racism was associated with lower ESs for studies with majority-Black youth (β = −0.2, 95% CI [−0.35, −0.04], p =.02) but was unrelated to ESs for studies with majority-White youth (β = 0.0004, 95% CI [−0.03, 0.03], p =.98), controlling for relevant area-level covariates. In studies with majority-Black youth, mean ESs were significantly lower in states with the highest anti-Black cultural racism (>1 SD above the mean; Hedges’ g = 0.19) compared with states with the lowest racism (<1 SD below the mean; Hedges’ g = 0.60). Conclusion: Psychotherapies tested with samples of majority-Black youth were significantly less effective in states with higher (vs lower) levels of anti-Black cultural racism, suggesting that anti-Black cultural racism may be one contextual moderator of treatment effect heterogeneity. © 2021 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

AB  - Background: Culturally diverse schools contribute to adolescents’ intergroup relations. Complex and inclusive social identities are mechanisms that can explain the link between structural school cultural diversity (i.e., proportion of students of immigrant descent and the number of different ethnic groups) and positive intergroup relations. We expected that similar mechanisms might be at play linking cultural diversity approaches in schools with adolescents’ intergroup relations. Aim: We examined the link between two sub-dimensions of cultural diversity approaches (i.e., equal treatment; heritage and intercultural learning) and adolescents’ prosocial intentions and behaviour towards refugee youth. Then, we explored the mediating role of identity inclusiveness (i.e., perceived similarity of the self with others). Sample and methods: We sampled culturally diverse eighth grade adolescents from 54 classrooms in Berlin (N = 503, Mage = 13.76 years, 50.6% female). Surveys measured perceived cultural diversity norms, adolescents’ perceived identity inclusiveness with refugee youth, prosocial intentions to support refugee youth, and willingness to donate to a project for refugee youth. Results: Multilevel models revealed that adolescents’ perception of heritage and intercultural learning predicted adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, but not their willingness to donate. Equal treatment was not a significant predictor of adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, or their willingness to donate. Identity inclusiveness did not mediate the relation between cultural diversity approaches and prosocial intentions. However, identity inclusiveness did positively relate adolescents’ prosocial intentions and willingness to donate. Conclusions: We conclude that culturally diverse schools that engage in heritage and intercultural learning might help to promote positive relations between local and refugee youth in schools and society. Fostering inclusive identities may enhance local adolescent’s prosocial intention and behaviour. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The behavioral immune system (BIS) is an evolved psychological mechanism that motivates prophylactic avoidance of disease vectors by eliciting disgust. When felt toward social groups, disgust can dampen empathy and promote dehumanization. Therefore, we investigated whether the BIS facilitates the dehumanization of groups associated with disease by inspiring disgust toward them. An initial content analysis found that Nazi propaganda predominantly dehumanized Jews by portraying them as disease vectors or contaminants. This inspired three correlational studies supporting a Prophylactic Dehumanization Model in which the BIS predicted disgust toward disease-relevant outgroups, and this disgust in turn accounted for the dehumanization of these groups. In a final study, we found this process of prophylactic dehumanization had a downstream effect on increasing anti-immigrant attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, consistent with the evolutionary logic of a functionally flexible BIS, this effect only occurred when the threat of COVID-19 was salient. The implications of these results for the study of dehumanization and evolutionary theories of xenophobia are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Reciprocity is a foundational concept of cooperative societies with roles in face-to-face and anonymous transactions. In essence, we trust others, follow social norms, and abide by formal laws with the expectation that others will do the same. Absent some understanding that others will also play by the rules of the game, however, we may no longer feel compelled to abide by those rules ourselves. Numerous experimental studies infer that reciprocity plays just such a role. Curiously, however, we are unaware of any attempts to operationalize the concept in a direct way. We attempt to remedy this lacuna by introducing a series of original survey items that are geared toward tapping the belief in reciprocal respect for basic rights and liberties by a range of groups. Data from an internet-based panel reveal that the belief in rights reciprocity is not widespread, moves with the political context, and is shaped by a variety of dispositional measures. Reciprocity, as likely another dimension of threat, builds political tolerance—a relationship which we confirm with both panel and experimental evidence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Few public policies have been as consequential or divisive as affirmative action. Proponents have argued for the need for equity and the redress of past and present discrimination, whereas opponents enlist claims over individual liberty and merit. Scholars have examined support to affirmative action, asking to what extent citizens' support is shaped by their political ideology, interest, prejudice, or some combination thereof. Much work to date has focused on the United States, where disentangling theoretical explanations has proved challenging. We turn our attention to an understudied but important case: Brazil. Brazil has implemented a broad form of affirmative action for admission to federal universities that include consideration of the applicant's education, income, and race. Adopting both a conventional question and a list experiment embedded in a face-to-face survey among a nationally representative sample of adult Brazilians, we find that public support for affirmative action suffers from social desirability bias, and in our subsequent regression analysis, that attitudes about affirmative action are structured especially by individuals' interests. © 2021 International Society of Political Psychology.

AB  - Background: We aimed to study the association of suspected versus confirmed infection with the novel SARS-CoV2 virus with the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill children. Methods: Sequential point-prevalence study of children and young adults aged 7 days to 25 years admitted to intensive care units under investigation for SARS-CoV2 infection. AKI was staged in the first 14 days of enrollment using KDIGO creatinine-based staging. SARS-CoV2 positive (CONFIRMED) were compared to SUSPECTED (negative or unknown). Outcome data was censored at 28-days. Results: In 331 patients of both sexes, 179 (54.1%) were CONFIRMED, 4.2% (14) died. AKI occurred in 124 (37.5%) and severe AKI occurred in 63 (19.0%). Incidence of AKI in CONFIRMED was 74/179 (41.3%) versus 50/152 (32.9%) for SUSPECTED; severe AKI occurred in 35 (19.6%) of CONFIRMED and 28 (18.4%) of SUSPECTED. Mortality was 6.2% (n = 11) in CONFIRMED, but 9.5% (n = 7) in those CONFIRMED with AKI. On multivariable analysis, only Hispanic ethnicity (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.3–0.9) was associated with less AKI development among those CONFIRMED. Conclusions: AKI and severe AKI occur commonly in critically ill children with SARS-CoV2 infection, more than double the historical standard. Further investigation is needed during this continuing pandemic to describe and refine the understanding of pediatric AKI epidemiology and outcomes. Trial registration: NCT01987921. Impact: What is the key message of the article? AKI occurs in children exposed to the novel SARS-CoV2 virus at high prevalence (~40% with some form of AKI and 20% with severe AKI). What does it add to the existing literature? Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly in adult patients with SARS-CoV2 (COVID), very little data describes the epidemiology of AKI in children exposed to the virus. What is the impact? A pediatric vaccine is not available; thus, the pandemic is not over for children. Pediatricians will need to manage significant end-organ ramifications of the novel SARS-CoV2 virus including AKI. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Can specific policies support the economic integration of immigrants? Despite the crucial importance of this question, existing evidence is inconclusive. Using data from the European Social Survey, we estimate the effects of integration and anti-discrimination policies, alongside social expenditure and labor market regulation, on the labor market performance of 6,176 non-European immigrants across 23 European countries. We make three contributions: 1) we investigate the distinct role of discrete policy areas for labor market integration outcomes, 2) we allow for heterogeneous effects of policies on immigrants with different characteristics, and 3) we examine immigrants’ occupational attainment while accounting for their selection into employment. We find that immigrants’ employment chances are negatively associated with national levels of expenditure on welfare benefits but positively associated with policies facilitating immigrant access to social security. We also find that labor market rigidity is negatively associated with immigrants’ occupational attainment, but we find little evidence that policies aimed at supporting the transferability of immigrants’ qualifications promote their occupational success. Our results strongly suggest that anti-discrimination policies are important for immigrant economic integration. Yet while these policies are associated with greater occupational success for all female immigrants, they seem to be only positively associated with the occupational attainment of higher-skilled and non-Muslim immigrant men. As this article suggests, anti-discrimination policies can foster immigrants’ labor market success, yet these policies currently fail to reach those who face the strongest anti-immigrant sentiments — that is, unskilled male immigrants and Muslim immigrant men. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study examines ethnic stereotypes toward majority and minority people in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It contributes a more multidimensional perspective on ethnic stereotypes by exploring minority students’ perspectives on how their ethnic group stereotypes Kinh majority people and how they are being stereotyped by the Kinh. Status and solidarity are used as the theoretical lens to gain insights into different stereotype traits and the social meanings underlying the stereotypes. Interviews with eight students in a college in the Central Highlands, which were carried out in 2013, are the main data source. Findings reveal that the students highly appreciated Kinh people’s status-related traits and minority people’s solidarity-related traits. The stereotypes functioned as maintaining the social status quo – where the Kinh justified their position and advantages, while the minorities tended to accept the perceived social status hierarchies. Implications for diminishing negative stereotypes, improving minorities’ existing status, fostering trust-based cross-ethnic contact, and inspiring mutual respect among people of all ethnicities, are hence suggested. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Literature devoted to understanding the experiences of individuals who do not fit the cultural mold—those who belong to minority, stigmatized, or underrepresented groups—demonstrates that nonnormative status goes hand in hand with a range of negative outcomes. The current research considers a heretofore unstudied correlate of nonnormative status: existential isolation (the feeling of being alone in one’s subjective experience), which differs from feelings of interpersonal isolation (feeling alone with regard to the quantity or quality of one’s relationships). Normative, or mainstream, society may not acknowledge the experiences of those holding a nonnormative status, rendering such individuals at risk of developing heightened feelings of existential isolation. Across Studies 1a and 1b, we found consistently higher trait levels of existential isolation (but not interpersonal isolation) among people with a nonnormative group status than among their normative counterparts. This effect appeared whether we looked at nonnormativeness with regard to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, citizenship, native language, body weight, religious affiliation, or socioeconomic status. Study 2 highlights one correlate of the existential isolation that accompanies nonnormativeness: decreased certainty with respect to judgments of racism. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed, including addressing the correlational nature of this research and testing potential mechanisms to explain the link between nonnormative status and existential isolation. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Prejudice against or affirmation of gender/sex minorities is often framed in terms of beliefs about the ontology of gender/sex (i.e., what gender/sex is), or gender/sex diversity beliefs. We constructed the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs Scale (GSDB) to assess ontological beliefs about the nature of gender/sex, including essentialist and social constructionist beliefs, and validated the GSDB across a series of studies. In Study 1 (N = 304), we explored the factor structure of the GSDB and found evidence of associations with prejudice against transgender and/or nonbinary people. In Study 2 (N = 300), we assessed the stability of the factor structure of the GSDB and examined its criterion-related validity, including its relationship to feelings toward multiple gender/sex groups. In Studies 3a (N = 48) and 3b (N = 500), we established test–retest reliability. We conclude that gender/sex diversity beliefs are important for understanding contemporary attitudes about gender/sex, including prejudice against gender/sex minorities, and that the GSDB is a reliable and valid way to measure them. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - To date, research has primarily focused on the colorblind norms and behaviors of majority-White participants in majority-White contexts. Extending this work to more diverse samples and contexts, across four studies, we examine whether colorblind norms link to the colorblind behavior of racially diverse participants living in a racially diverse (i.e., heterogeneous) context. Findings suggest that participants living in a racially diverse context did not endorse colorblind beliefs (Study 1) and norms (Study 2), and instead behaved in race-conscious ways and overwhelmingly used race in a photo identification task. Furthermore, in Study 3, we find that colorblind norms are largely activated by the belief that talking about race is prejudiced. When participants were exposed to a social norm that linked talking about race to prejudice, colorblind behavior became more prevalent. Finally, in Study 4, we see that greater diversity of one’s context is correlated to less endorsement of colorblindness. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Research suggests that people attribute more negative traits to individuals with obesity than to non-obese individuals, and that females with obesity are seen more negatively than males. The theory also suggests that stereotypes are cognitive predecessors of prejudices. The aims of this research were to examine the latent structure underlying anti-fat stereotypical traits, differences in perceiving individuals with obesity and non-obese individuals, male and female individuals with obesity, as well as the role of anti-fat stereotypes in anti-fat prejudices. The sample consisted of 106 respondents (Male = 16; Female = 86; Mean age = 19.98), who graded stimuli photographs of male and female individuals (with obesity and average-weight) on series of anti-fat stereotypical traits on two occasions, and filled in Anti-fat prejudices questionnaire. The data were analyzed through EFA and CFA, ANOVA, and structural equation modeling (moderation). Four factors behind stereotypical traits were extracted: Positive social image, Perceived lack of self-care, Perceived persistence, and Antipathy. It has been shown that respondents gave stimuli photographs of individuals with obesity lower scores on Positive social image and Perceived persistence, and higher scores on Perceived lack of self-care and Antipathy. The same results were obtained for females within the subsample of individuals with obesity. Furthermore, it has been shown that certain anti-fat stereotypes (Positive social image, Perceived lack of self-care, and Perceived persistence) predict anti-fat prejudices, and that gender was a significant moderator of the effect of Perceived lack of self-care on anti-fat prejudices. We can conclude that individuals with obesity are indeed seen in a more negative light than non-obese individuals, and that this is more pronounced for females with obesity, which is in accordance with previous studies. Moreover, the results suggest the possible role of anti-fat stereotypes as cognitive predecessors of anti-fat prejudices, and that gender of individuals with obesity has an effect on this relationship. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Social identity exploration is a process whereby individuals actively seek information about their group membership and show efforts to understand its meaning. Developmental theory argues that exploration-based ingroup commitment is the basis for outgroup positivity. We tested this notion in relation to national identity and attitudes towards immigrants. The results of five experimental studies among German adolescents and early adults (N = 1,146; 16–25 years) and one internal meta-analysis suggest that the positive identification–prejudice link is weaker when participants are instructed to explore the meaning of their identity (Study 1). This is not mediated via self-uncertainty (Study 2), but via a reduction in intergroup threat (Study 3) and an increase in deprovincialization (Study 4). In addition, identity exploration enabled strong identifiers to oppose descriptive ingroup norms (Study 5). We conclude that identity exploration can contribute to a further understanding of the identification–prejudice link. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objectives: The concept of epistemic injustice was developed in 2007 by Miranda Fricker. It designates a specific category of prejudices, where the subject's capacity to produce knowledge is denied or undermined. Several authors have applied this concept to the field of health and argue that people with a medical condition are more vulnerable to epistemic injustices than healthy people. In psychiatry, some authors believe that patients are even more vulnerable to such injustices in clinical practice than patients of other specialties. Some others identify certain forms of epistemic injustice in the classifications of mental disorders, and postulate that it could lead to epistemic losses in classifications, diagnoses and care. In France, this concept is relatively unexplored in psychiatry. The aim of this paper is to identify and summarize the potential contributions of the concept in psychiatry, from the clinical practices to the definition of mental disorders. Materials and methods: First, we will define the main types of epistemic injustice described by Fricker. We will then see how these injustices can occur in the field of health. Finally, we will study why patients with a mental disorder are particularly affected by these injustices, the potential impact on psychiatric nosography and the ways to address these epistemic injustices. Results: There are two types of epistemic injustice. In testimonial injustices, a person's speech is unwittingly considered to be of little or no credibility by his interlocutor, because of negative prejudices against him or his community. Hermeneutic injustice occurs when a person fails to convey their experience, due to a lack of hermeneutical resources to interpret and communicate it. In healthcare, the credibility of the patient's testimony can be diminished by several factors and general prejudices. Additionally, there is a lack of interpretive resources to understand and share many aspects of the experience of illness. In addition to this, the epistemic privilege accorded to healthcare professionals, particularly physicians, leads to accentuating the epistemic imbalance. The type of doctor-patient relationship, and its evolution, also impact the respective epistemic positions. In psychiatry, patients are seen as more vulnerable to epistemic injustices. Crichton thus identifies three common factors to all mental disorders, including a general prejudice of irrationality and unreliability. In addition, each pathology has specific factors exposing patients to a weakening of their epistemic capacity. To correct these injustices, several tools have been proposed, such as including the study of epistemic injustice in physician's training or using a phenomenological toolbox. Anke Bueter also suggested the existence of a specific form of testimonial injustice in psychiatric classifications, known as “pre-emptive”, which excludes the possibility for ill people and their relatives to testify. However, taking these testimonies into account could act as a corrective mean in the construction of nosography. This nosography is indeed based, in psychiatry, on value judgments, due to the lack of objective data. Several authors, including Bueter, therefore call for a better integration of users in the revisions of classifications, to improve their validity. This could have implications for the clinic, research and its funding, and other issues such as stigmatization. However, how exactly the users’ point of view could be integrated still needs to be defined. Several proposals have been found in the literature. Conclusion: We consider that the concept of epistemic injustice is a useful tool towards a better articulation between experiential and medical knowledges. In clinical practice, if the clinician is trained in this concept, he will be able to identify situations at risk of epistemic injustice, attempt to neutralize this imbalance and thus carry out a more exhaustive clinical examination and more appropriate care for the patient. Regarding nosography, strengthening the epistemic position of users and integrating their knowledge could improve the validity of classifications. The question of the validity of psychiatric nosography is a problem that the scientific community has faced for a long time, and it therefore seems interesting to continue this reflection through the concept of Fricker. In both cases, it is necessary to continue developing tools to better define, analyze and integrate this experiential knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The human security of both migrants and refugees is at risk at several steps in the process of migration. This work considers that migrants’ human security is not automatically guaranteed once they reach a safe country in Europe either. This article explores how, with the evident will to bypass Italian anti-discriminatory law, derogatory legal instruments, such as law decrees, have been used to increasingly normalize the state of exception with indefinite detention and further extraordinary measures in the system of reception. The analysis of Italian laws, legislative decrees and reports in the field of migration proves that, in Italy, the state of exception has been normalized particularly from 2018 onwards through Salvini’s Security Decrees, to evidently both create additional insecurities for migrants and self-fulfill the initial prejudicial assumption that framed migration as a threat to the nation. The normalization of the exception does not stop at the borders but continues also throughout migrants’ stays, with the consequent increasing entanglement of citizens’ stereotypes and migrants’ discriminations, mainly through a self-fulfillment of prejudice, which further endanger the life of refugees, whose insecurity is left to persist across the entire Italian territory, when instead it should supposedly be a safe country for those in need of a shelter. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recommendations to routinely question patients about violence victimization have been around for many years; nonetheless, many patients suffering in the aftermath of violence go unnoticed in health care. The main aim of this study was to explore characteristics associated with being asked about experiences of violence in health care and thereby making visible victims that go unnoticed. In this study, we used cross-sectional survey data from 754 men (response rate 35%) and 749 women (response rate 38%) collected at random from the Swedish population, age 25–85. Questions were asked about experiences of emotional, physical, and sexual violence from both family, partner, and other perpetrators. Only 13.1% of those reporting some form of victimization reported ever being asked about experiences of violence in health care. Low subjective social status was associated with being asked questions (adj OR 2.23) but not with victimization, possibly indicating prejudice believes among providers concerning who can be a victim of violence. Other factors associated with increased odds of being asked questions were: being a woman (adj OR 2.09), young age (24–44 years, adj OR 6.90), having been treated for depression (adj OR 2.45) or depression and anxiety (adj OR 2.19) as well as reporting physical violence (adj OR 2.74) or polyvictimization (adj OR 2.85). The main finding of the study was that only few victims had been asked questions. For example, among those reporting ≥4 visits to a primary care physician during the past 12 months, 43% reported some form of victimization but only 6% had been asked questions. Our findings underline the importance of continuing to improve the health care response offered to victims of violence. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Adults perceive the youth of the present as being worse than from when they were young. This phenomenon has been shown to be a product of a memory bias, adults are unable to accurately recall what children were like in the past so they impose their current selves onto their memories. In two studies using American adults (N = 2,764), we seek to connect this finding to age, implicit theories of change, and extend the beliefs in the decline of the youth to new domains. Here we show as people age, they hold harsher beliefs about present children. Those who believe a trait does not change throughout the lifespan exhibit more forgiving attitudes toward the youth of today, believing they may not be in such decline on that trait. Finally, people who are low in a negative trait believe strongly that children are becoming more deficient in that particular trait (e.g., those who are not narcissistic believe the youth are becoming more narcissistic).

AB  - Purpose: The negative stereotypes concerning late-career workers are found to prevail and lead to negative circulation of narratives and actions between individuals and societies. Using the context of late-career entrepreneurs, the paper aims to find an alternative and a more positive narrative concerning late-career work by focusing on entrepreneurs and the narrative positioning related to them. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a narrative-positioning analysis, cycling through three levels of analysis and then returning to level two, in order to study our sample of seven narratives written by Finnish late-career entrepreneurs. The authors present in detail one story-telling narrative, by Matthew, and then layer the remaining six narratives to present themes, positioning and actions surrounding being a late-career entrepreneur. Findings: A more positive narrative circulation was found, which related to the master narrative of entrepreneurs as continuing “until the end” and taking care of themselves, their enterprises and different stakeholder groups even after exiting the enterprise into so-called “retirement.” The entrepreneurs were found to actively use this positive narrative to position themselves both in the story-telling world and in their local interactions. By positioning themselves as “never ending caretakers,” the entrepreneurs gave a strong account that their reasons to continue working centered on the factors social. Research limitations/implications: The research findings and analysis should be interpreted in the context of the Nordic countries and especially Finland. Practical implications: The results of this study can inform the ways in which these “never ending caretakers” can transition into retirement and adjust to life spent in retirement. Originality/value: In the study, entrepreneurs' written answers were analyzed with narrative-positioning analyses. An alternative story of people at work was found, and a more positive narrative circulation was constructed based on their narratives. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article considers electoral inter-group dynamics in Quebec, Canada, by focusing on what White voters expect from political candidates of color. While significant work has been done on the use of political heuristics such as race or gender-based framing by the media, we do not know as much about the way voters interpret and use these stereotypes in a political context. In this article, we consider voters' interpretation of race-based cues using qualitative evidence gathered in six focus groups. First, we explore the content of stereotypes typically associated with politicians of color in the province. Second, this article provides an assessment of some of the ways in which race-based stereotypes are used to understand politics and evaluate politicians of color. We find that race-based stereotypes contribute to defining expectations regarding politicians' behavior. While voters may consciously choose to favor politicians of color, the perception of social distance between a marginalized candidate and them can also lead to negative cross-ethnic attitudes.

AB  - Aims: This study investigated the perceptions of medical students regarding the barriers to pursuing a career in trauma and orthopaedics (T&O); and whether these perceptions were altered by attending an event promoting women in T&O. Methods: An event consisting of presentations and interactive sessions from two female T&O trainees was hosted online. Attendees completed pre and post-event questionnaires. Students were asked about their previous exposure to T&O, perceptions of gender imbalances in T&O and what barriers they perceived prevented women from entering T&O. Univariate analysis was performed to identify changes in perceptions following the event. Results: Pre-event questionnaires were completed by 102 people; and post-event by 52. Although 64/102 respondents were considering a career in T&O, 26/102 were dissuaded by perceived gender disparities. Perceptions of gender disparities were significantly higher in UK based attendees compared to other nationalities (p = 0.047). Attendees were more likely to want to pursue a career in T&O if they had been directly exposed at medical school (p = 0.044), but exposure did not alter perceptions of women in T&O. The most common perceived barrier was the orthopaedic stereotype followed by male dominated workplace culture, and lack of female role models. Pre and post-event responses did not differ significantly for any areas examined. Conclusion: There are significant concerns amongst medical students regarding gender based discrimination within T&O, and these perceptions were not altered by attending a one-off women in T&O event. Early exposure to T&O appears important to improve interest in orthopaedics, whereas negative stereotyping is a barrier. Copyright © 2022 Hull, Pestrin, Brennan, Hackney and Scott.

AB  - Purpose: The outcomes and quality of international development projects (IDPs) remain highly controversial, especially with perception of corruption by various stakeholders. This study aims to integrate findings from both social and administrative sciences to focus attention on the governance challenges involved in both business and public administration of such projects. It also asks to what extent Project Management (PM) methods can effectively be harmonized with broader anti-corruption initiative in both donor and receiving countries. Design/methodology/approach: Taking a transdisciplinary viewpoint, this study proposes a review and synthesis of the literature on the theoretical, methodological, and epistemological issues in researching corruption as a construct in PM as applied to IDPs. Findings: Some experts recognize the inefficacy of applying classical PM tools and processes. By contrasting the literature, this study concludes that an alternative approach to overcome the taboos and prejudice in studying corruption is to ask a different research question. As opposed to studying “who and why” about corruption occurrences (ex-post), given the challenge of unveiling its practices and motivations, PM researchers can to ask instead “where and how” it occurs and help understand methods to mitigate its effects on projects (ex-ante). Originality/value: A research agenda is proposed for the several disciplines and fields concerned with solving this phenomenon. To guide PM research on development projects, focusing on the “where and how” of corruption requires addressing how actors build their knowledge management capabilities and address the social and cultural challenges inherent to IDPs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: Weight bias, stigma, and discrimination are common among healthcare professionals. We aimed to evaluate whether an online education module affects weight bias and knowledge about obesity in a private medical center setting. Methods: An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted among all employees of a chain of private medical centers in Israel (n = 3,290). Employees who confirmed their consent to participate in the study were randomized into intervention or control (i.e., "no intervention") arms. The study intervention was an online 15-min educational module that included obesity, weight bias, stigma, and discrimination information. Questionnaires on Anti-Fat Attitudes (AFA), fat-phobia scale (F-scale), and beliefs about the causes of obesity were answered at baseline (i.e., right before the intervention), 7 days, and 30 days post-intervention. Results: A total of 506, 230, and 145 employees responded to the baseline, 7-day, and 30-day post-intervention questionnaires, respectively. Mean participant age was 43.3 ± 11.6 years, 84.6% were women, and 67.4% held an academic degree. Mean F-scale scores and percentage of participants with above-average fat-phobic attitudes (≥3.6) significantly decreased only within the intervention group over time (p ≤ 0.042). However, no significant differences between groups over time were observed for AFA scores or factors beliefs to cause obesity. Conclusions: A single exposure to an online education module on weight bias and knowledge about obesity may confer only a modest short-term improvement in medical center employees' fat-phobic attitudes toward people with obesity. Future studies should examine if reexposure to such intervention could impact weight bias, stigma, and discrimination among medical center staff in the long-term. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Awareness of the specific needs of LGBTQI cancer patients has led to calls for inclusivity, cultural competence, cultural safety and cultural humility in cancer care. Examination of oncology healthcare professionals’ (HCP) perspectives is central to identifying barriers and facilitators to inclusive LGBTQI cancer care. Study Aim: This study examined oncology HCPs perspectives in relation to LGBTQI cancer care, and the implications of HCP perspectives and practices for LGBTQI patients and their caregivers. Method: 357 oncology HCPs in nursing (40%), medical (24%), allied health (19%) and leadership (11%) positions took part in a survey; 48 HCPs completed an interview. 430 LGBTQI patients, representing a range of tumor types, sexual and gender identities, age and intersex status, and 132 carers completed a survey, and 104 LGBTQI patients and 31 carers undertook an interview. Data were analysed using thematic discourse analysis. Results: Three HCP subject positions – ways of thinking and behaving in relation to the self and LGBTQI patients – were identified:’Inclusive and reflective’ practitioners characterized LGBTQI patients as potentially vulnerable and offered inclusive care, drawing on an affirmative construction of LGBTQI health. This resulted in LGBTQI patients and their carers feeling safe and respected, willing to disclose sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) status, and satisfied with cancer care. ‘Egalitarian practitioners’ drew on discourses of ethical responsibility, positioning themselves as treating all patients the same, not seeing the relevance of SOGI information. This was associated with absence of LGBTQI-specific information, patient and carer anxiety about disclosure of SOGI, feelings of invisibility, and dissatisfaction with healthcare. ‘Anti-inclusive’ practitioners’ expressed open hostility and prejudice towards LGBTQI patients, reflecting a cultural discourse of homophobia and transphobia. This was associated with patient and carer distress, feelings of negative judgement, and exclusion of same-gender partners. Conclusion: Derogatory views and descriptions of LGBTQI patients, and cis-normative practices need to be challenged, to ensure that HCPs offer inclusive and affirmative care. Building HCP’s communicative competence to work with LGBTQI patients needs to become an essential part of basic training and ongoing professional development. Visible indicators of LGBTQI inclusivity are essential, alongside targeted resources and information for LGBTQI people. Copyright © 2022 Ussher, Power, Perz, Hawkey and Allison.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the attitude of medical students towards cultural diversity aiming to elucidate our current status in understanding cultural awareness and sensitivity. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A web-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 601 undergraduate health science students (medical and dental courses) at a health sciences university in eastern Nepal via various modes of social-media platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, Gmail, etc. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical students' attitude towards cultural diversity and its association with the sociodemographic profile of the students. RESULTS: A total of 601 students participated in the study, out of which, 64.2% were men with a sex ratio of 1.8:1 and a mean age of 22.3±1.9 years. More than two-thirds (77.2%) of the students had an excellent to good attitude towards cultural diversity. The proportion of students reporting 'excellent' attitude towards cultural diversity was higher among male students compared with female students (37.8% vs 20.5%) and students aged >22 years compared with younger students (37.1% vs 26.7%). Gender (p<0.001) and age (p=0.009) were significantly associated with the attitude towards cultural diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students, in general, are aware of the impacts of a cross-cultural society on the delivery of quality healthcare and also about the need to be aware of prejudices doctors may have towards certain cultures. Majority suggest the inclusion of concepts of multicultural awareness and sensitivity in the medical curriculum itself. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB  - Introduction: Praxis is a process of applying knowledge in nursing practice to advance emancipatory goals in society and in the world and to eliminate any injustice and discrimination in care. Praxis requires the coherent application of patterns of knowing in nursing practice; however, understanding nursing knowledge is complex and using experiential knowledge alone cannot help us achieve it. The aim of this study was to determine the factors involved in praxis in nursing practice. Methods: The method adopted was qualitative. The researcher interviewed 19 nurses and attended eight observation sessions in different hospital departments. The findings were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Findings from analyzing interviews and observations indicated that desirable and humanistic attributes and effective nurse-patient communication are facilitators of praxis. In contrast, prejudice, occupational barriers, negative thoughts, and discriminatory beliefs are barriers of praxis in nursing practice. Conclusion: If we consider praxis as the simultaneous application of all patterns of knowing alongside efforts to create social justice, factors that drive nurse performance toward social justice, facilitate praxis, and factors that contribute to varied degrees of discrimination and injustice, inhibit praxis. By identifying these factors, nurses may identify and eliminate social justice barriers to care. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - A relation is a mathematical tool for describing set relationships. Relationships are common in databases and scheduling applications. Science and engineering are designed to help humans make better decisions. To make these choices, we must first understand human expectations, the outcomes of various options, and the degree of confidence. With all of these data, partial orders will be generated. In several fields of engineering and computer science, partial order and lattice theory are now widely used. To mention a few, they are used in cloud computing (vector clocks, global predicate detection), concurrency theory (pomsets, occurrence nets), programming language semantics (fixed-point semantics), and data mining (concept analysis). Other theoretical disciplines benefit from them as well, such as combinatorics, number theory, and group theory. Partially ordered sets emerge naturally when dealing with multidimensional systems of qualitative ordinal variables in social science, especially to solve ranking, prioritising, and assessment concerns. As an alternative to standard techniques, partial order theory and partially ordered sets can be used to generate composite indicators for evaluating well-being, quality of life, and multidimensional poverty. They can be applied in multi-criteria analysis or for decision-making purposes in the study of individual and social desires, including in social choice theory. They’re also valuable in social network analysis, where they may be utilized to apply mathematics to explore network topologies and dynamics. The Hasse diagram method, for example, produces a partial order with multiple incomparabilities (lack of order) between pairs of items. This is a common problem in ranking studies, and it can often be avoided by combining object attributes that lead to a complete order. However, such a mix introduces subjectivity and prejudice into the rating process. This work discusses the notion of a f-prime radical of a partially ordered set with respect to ideal. In posets, we investigated the concept of f-primary ideals. It is investigated how to characterise f-primary ideals in relation to f-prime radicals. In addition, an ideal’s f-primary decomposition is constructed. © 2022 by author, all rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, I take a critical look at the presence of narcoculture in reggaeton using as a case study the music video of the remix of 'Somos de calle'. Specifically, I evaluate whether and to what extent reggaeton's narco-messages and narco-representations - when they converge with other variables - could potentially influence an individual's modes of thinking and behaviour. The study does not aim to provide a definitive answer to the debate surrounding this issue. More than anything, it strives to analyse the extent to which the claim that such influence may occur has scientific merit, in order to advocate further research on this matter. The article also discusses the highly politicized debate that has surrounded this topic in public discourse, and how this has seemingly affected its critical assessment in academia. For the analysis I rely particularly on social psychology literature concerning violent media content and in the areas of persuasion studies and prejudice studies, but I also consider literature from other fields, including criminology. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - With around 34,000 North Korean defectors having arrived in South Korea (as of June, 2021), perceptions toward them remain ambiguous and unbalanced. The dominant discourse about North Korean defectors centers on adaptation, and cultural difference is often identified as one of the most challenging obstacles. This article examines how a specific conceptualization of culture is utilized to alienate North Korean defectors, while securing the belief in a single ethnicity of all Koreans. As a result, North Korean defectors are rendered as cultural other in South Korean society. While cultural difference is often believed to be the basis of discrimination for North Korean defectors, this article argues that social prejudice and discrimination reproduce and reinforce the discourse about cultural difference of North Korean defectors. © 2022 The Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, Seoul National University.

AB  - Background: When the first COVID-19 cases were noticed in China, many racist comments against Chinese individuals spread. As there is a huge need to better comprehend why all of these targeted comments and opinions developed specifically at the start of the outbreak, we sought to carefully examine racism and advocacy efforts on Twitter in the first quarter of 2020 (January 15 to March 3, 2020). Objective: The first research question aimed to understand the main type of racism displayed on Twitter during the first quarter of 2020. The second research question focused on evaluating Twitter users’ positive and negative responses regarding racism toward Chinese individuals. Methods: Content analysis of tweets was utilized to address the two research questions. Using the NCapture browser link and NVivo software, tweets in English and Spanish were pulled from the Twitter data stream from January 15 to March 3, 2020. A total of 19,150 tweets were captured using the advanced Twitter search engine with the keywords and hashtags #nosoyunvirus, #imNotAVirus, #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan, #racism, “No soy un virus,” and “Racismo Coronavirus.” After cleaning the data, a total of 402 tweets were codified and analyzed. Results: The data confirmed clear sentiments of racism against Chinese individuals during the first quarter of 2020. The tweets displayed individual, cultural, and institutional racism. Individual racism was the most commonly reported form of racism, specifically displaying physical and verbal aggression. As a form of resistance, Twitter users created spaces for advocacy and activism. The hashtag “I am not a virus” helped to break stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination on Twitter. Conclusions: Advocacy efforts were enormous both inside and outside the Chinese community; an allyship sentiment was fostered by some white users, and an identification with the oppression experienced by the Chinese population was expressed in the Black and Muslim worldwide communities. Activism through social media manifested through art, food sharing, and community support. ©Amanda Lloret-Pineda, Yuelu He, Josep Maria Haro, Paula Cristóbal-Narváez.

AB  - Societal ideas and trends dictate media narratives and cinematic depictions which in turn influence people's beliefs and perceptions of the real world. Media portrayal of individuals and social institutions related to culture, education, government, religion, and family affect their function and evolution over time as people perceive and incorporate the representations from portrayals into their everyday lives. It is important to study media depictions of social structures so that they do not propagate or reinforce negative stereotypes, or discriminate against a particular section of the society. In this work, we examine media representation of different professions and provide computational insights into their incidence, and sentiment expressed, in entertainment media content. We create a searchable taxonomy of professional groups, synsets, and titles to facilitate their retrieval from short-context speaker-agnostic text passages like movie and television (TV) show subtitles. We leverage this taxonomy and relevant natural language processing models to create a corpus of professional mentions in media content, spanning more than 136,000 IMDb titles over seven decades (1950-2017). We analyze the frequency and sentiment trends of different occupations, study the effect of media attributes such as genre, country of production, and title type on these trends, and investigate whether the incidence of professions in media subtitles correlate with their real-world employment statistics. We observe increased media mentions over time of STEM, arts, sports, and entertainment occupations in the analyzed subtitles, and a decreased frequency of manual labor jobs and military occupations. The sentiment expressed toward lawyers, police, and doctors showed increasing negative trends over time, whereas the mentions about astronauts, musicians, singers, and engineers appear more favorably. We found that genre is a good predictor of the type of professions mentioned in movies and TV shows. Professions that employ more people showed increased media frequency. © 2022 Baruah et al.

AB  - Susan Sontag's discussion and depiction of illness, especially AIDS, in her writings can help us better understand the metaphoric mechanism of illness in the Chinese film Love for Life. As one of the leading metaphors attached to AIDS, plague brings discrimination and prejudice against AIDS patients, whether they are to blame or not. Moreover, due to demonization, AIDS patients suffer from social death even when they are still alive. Love for Life challenges the taboo subject in China and makes an appeal that the body should not be treated as the vehicle of metaphors and that we need to break the illness-health dichotomy so as to shake off the metaphors of illness. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Objective: The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the CRENCO project which was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic including intergenerational activities shared by students from primary and secondary education and users of two centers for older adults and a day hospital in Catalonia. The effectiveness was assessed in terms of well-being in older adults and on negative stereotypes about the elderly in primary and secondary students. Methods: Three interventions were carried out in which 32 older persons (9 users of centers for older adults and 23 of a day hospital), 99 primary students and 56 secondary students participated. Participants answered a questionnaire before and after the interventions. Through multilevel linear models for repeated measures, changes in feelings of loneliness, social support, anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-reported health and health-related quality of life were evaluated in older people. In primary and secondary students, changes in age stereotypes were evaluated. Results: Health-related quality of life and self-reported health improved statistically after the interventions in older persons. Users of the day hospital also reported an improvement in social support. Primary school students improved their age stereotypes; no statistically significant changes were detected in secondary students. Conclusion: The results of the present study contribute to underlining the importance of intergenerational programs such as the one proposed by CRENCO, capable of improving well-being and providing a more realistic vision of the older adults. Our results suggest that these programs should be implemented during childhood in order to prevent the proliferation of ageist stereotypes in later life stages. © 2022 SEGG

AB  - The development of anti-racist ideology in adolescence and emerging adulthood is informed by parent socialization, parenting style, and cross-race friendships. This study used longitudinal, multi-reporter survey data from White youth and their parents in Maryland to examine links between parents' racial attitudes when youth were in eleventh grade in 1996 (N = 453; 52% female; Mage = 17.12) and the youths' anti-racist ideology (acknowledgment of anti-Black discrimination and support for affirmative action) 1 year after high school in 1998. This study also examined whether these associations varied based on authoritative parenting and the number of cross-race friendships. Positive parent racial attitudes toward racially and ethnically minoritized populations predicted higher anti-racist ideology in the independent contexts of more cross-race friendships and low authoritative parenting. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Using the Andersen and Newman model, we explored the facilitators and barriers to the use of sexual and reproductive health (S&RH) services by in-school adolescents in Ghana. Thematic analysis of interviews revealed that parental support and a good peer network predispose adolescents to use S&RH services, while religious prejudice predisposes adolescents not to use S&RH services. Adolescent-friendly social clubs, S&RH corners, and well-trained health workers enable S&RH service use while parental disapproval, poor health workers’ attitudes, and inconvenience of health facilities inhibit S&RH service use. Adolescents’ perceptions of the severity of S&RH conditions create the need for S&RH care, while societal perception of sexual pleasure and perceived side effects of S&RH services are need-based barriers to the use of S&RH services. We recommend that adolescent-focused S&RH interventions should build the competence of health workers, promote religious and community tolerance, and strengthen family relationships that facilitate parent-child S&RH communication. © Meharry Medical College.

AB  - Background: Sexual minority women disproportionately engage in heavy drinking and shoulder the burden of alcohol dependence. Although several intensive interventions are being developed to meet the needs of treatment-seeking sexual minority women, there remains a lack of preventive interventions to reduce drinking and its consequences among women not yet motivated to reduce their alcohol consumption. Objective: We aimed to examine the feasibility and efficacy of reducing alcohol-related risks via personalized normative feedback (PNF) on alcohol use and coping delivered within LezParlay, a social media-inspired digital competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ)-identified sexual minority women. Methods: Feasibility was assessed by examining engagement with LezParlay outside the context of an incentivized research study, assessing the characteristics of the LBQ women taking part, and examining the competition's ability to derive risk-reducing actual norms as well as levels of acceptability and perceived benefits reported by participants. Intervention efficacy was examined by randomizing a subsample of 499 LBQ alcohol consumers (ie, drinkers) already taking part in the competition to receive sexual identity-specific PNF on alcohol use and coping, alcohol use only, or control topics over only 2 rounds of play. Changes in alcohol use and negative consequences were examined 2 and 4 months after the delivery of treatment PNF. Results: A total of 2667 diverse LBQ women played ≥1 round of LezParlay. The competition attracted large numbers of moderate and heavy drinkers; however, risk-reducing actual norms could still be derived from competition rounds and featured in PNF. Efficacy results revealed that drinkers who received PNF on alcohol use and both alcohol use and coping had similar reductions in their weekly drinks (P=.003; P<.001), peak drinks (P<.001; P<.001), and negative consequences (P<.001; P<.001) relative to those who received PNF on control topics at the 2-month follow-up. However, at the 4-month follow-up, reductions in alcohol consumption outcomes faded among those who received alcohol PNF only (weekly: P=.06; peak: P=.11), whereas they remained relatively robust among those who received PNF on both alcohol use and coping (weekly: P=.02; peak: P=.03). Finally, participants found the competition highly acceptable and psychologically beneficial as a whole. Conclusions: The LezParlay competition was found to be a feasible and efficacious means of reducing alcohol-related risks in this population. Our findings demonstrate the utility of correcting sexual identity-specific drinking and coping norms to reduce alcohol-related risks among LBQ women and suggest that this approach may also prove fruitful in other stigmatized health disparity populations. To engage these populations in the real world and expand the psychological benefits associated with PNF, our findings also point to packaging PNF within a broader, culturally tailored competition designed to challenge negative group stereotypes. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - A prerequisite to anti-racist socialization in families is acknowledging ethnic-racial (power) differences, also known as color-consciousness. In a sample of 138 White Dutch families from the urban Western region of the Netherlands with children aged 6–10 years (53% girls), observations and questionnaires on maternal color-consciousness and measures of children's attitudes toward Black and Middle-Eastern ethnic-racial outgroups were collected in 2018–2019. Variable-centered analyses showed that maternal color-conscious socialization practices were related to less negative child outgroup attitudes only. Person-centered analysis revealed a cluster of families with higher maternal color-consciousness and less prejudiced child attitudes, and a cluster with the opposite pattern. The mixed results emphasize the importance of multiple methods and approaches in advancing scholarship on anti-racism in the family context. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Same-sex parents face substantial stressors due to their sexual orientation, such as experiences of prejudice and prohibitive legal environments. This added stress is likely to lead to reduced physical and mental health in same-sex parents that, in turn, may translate into problematic behavioral outcomes in their children. To date, there are only a few nationally representative studies that investigate the well-being of children with same-sex parents. The current study takes a closer look at children’s behavioral outcomes, reported by a parent, using an adapted version of the emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, pro-social, and peer problems subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). We take advantage of unique data from the Netherlands based on a probability sample from population registers, whereby findings can be inferred to same-sex and different-sex parent households with parents between the ages of 30 and 65, and with children between the ages of 6 and 16 years (62 children with same-sex, and 72 children with different-sex parents). The findings obtained by coarsened exact matching suggest no significant disadvantages for children with same-sex parents compared to different-sex parents. We contextualize these findings in their wider cultural context, and recommend a renewed focus in future research away from deficit-driven comparisons. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This mixed-methods study investigated the relation among gender identity (i.e., self-perceived gender similarity to girls and boys; self-perceived parental and peer pressure to conform to gender norms) and stereotyping about weight (i.e., anti-fat stereotypes), weight change, and appearance in 83 girls ages 6–9 (Mage = 7.60 years, SD =.85; 65% White, 16% Mixed/Other, 11% Black, 8% Latina) in the U.S. Stereotypes about weight change were assessed with open-ended responses (i.e., qualitatively), and the rest of the constructs were assessed with closed-ended responses (i.e., quantitatively). There was a positive association between pressure from parents to conform to gender norms and appearance stereotypes, and between pressure from peers and negative stereotypes about the fat and thin figures. Girls who were more gender typical, or more similar to girls, were more likely to endorse appearance stereotypes. There was no significant relation among stereotypes about weight change and gender identity. Many girls deemed the fat figure as unattractive, physically restrained, unhealthy, and likely to be bullied and believed that the fat figure should change back to look like a thinner figure. Most girls were aware that exercising, eating healthy, and dietary restriction can lead to weight loss and that food consumption and lack of exercise can lead to weight gain. Findings suggest that certain aspects of weight (anti-fat) and appearance stereotypes are closely linked to gender identity in girls, whereas other aspects of weight stereotypes (e.g., stereotypes about weight change) are so pervasive that they are common in most girls, regardless of their gender identity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - From 2015 to 2018, the math gender gap decreased primarily due to a decline in boys' performances (OECD, 2015, 2016, 2018). However, there is ample evidence that girls continue to be negatively stereotyped in math. Using a longitudinal design, we examined whether prolonged exposure to a counter-stereotypical role model embodied by a female top math scorer may prevent other girls in the class from experiencing stereotype threat. Multilevel analyses were conducted among 1,043 6th graders nested in 46 math classes. There was a decline in math performance throughout the school year for all students, but being a girl had a buffering effect against this decline. The results failed to support the main effect hypothesis (H1) which anticipated that student gender and top math scorer gender would be associated with student math achievement when jointly considered. The results supported the cross-level interaction hypothesis (H2) which anticipated that the greatest benefits would emerge for girls exposed to a counter-stereotypical role model; that is, in a class whose top math scorer was a girl. These results offer new insights regarding the extent to which a counter-stereotypical role model embodied by the top math scorer may influence differences in math performances. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We argue that the (mis)treatment of Eastern European migrant workers during the pandemic revealed the existence of a two-tier EU citizenship, despite the political discourse of equality within the EU. We show that this two-tier citizenship system was generated by the combined effect of differentiated rights and of prejudicious practices applied to EE citizens. In terms of differentiated rights, we refer specifically to the implementation of transitional arrangements for up to 7 years following the Eastern enlargements in 2004 and 2007, which restricted access to the labour markets and welfare systems of the incumbent member states, de facto undermining the right to free movement for this group of EU citizens. In terms of prejudicious practices, we refer to the instances of exploitation, abuses, de-skilling, exclusion from public services and use of social rights that EE migrant workers have been well documented to experience. We show that the two-tier citizenship system reflects the unequal power relations between Member States and the internal political, economic and social hierarchy present within the European Union. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Political affiliation, racial attitudes, and opioid stigma influence public support for public health responses to address opioid use disorders (OUD). Prior studies suggest public perceptions of the opioid epidemic are less racialized and less politically polarized than were public perceptions of the crack cocaine epidemic. Analyzing a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample (n = 1161 U.S. adults) from the October 2020 AmeriSpeak survey, we explored how political affiliation, racial attitudes (as captured in the Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale [CoBRAS]), and OUD stigma were associated with respondents' expressed views regarding four critical domains. Respondents with unfavorable attitudes towards Black Americans were less likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living with OUD, and distributing naloxone for overdose prevention. Democratic Party affiliation was associated with greater support for all three of the above measures, and increased support for mandatory treatment, which may be seen as a substitute for more punitive interventions. Black respondents were also less likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living with OUD, and of distributing naloxone. Our finding suggest that negative attitudes towards African-Americans and political differences remain important factors of public opinion on responding to the OUD epidemic, even after controlling for opioid stigma. Our findings also suggest that culturally-competent dialogue within politically conservative and Black communities may be important to engage public support for evidence-informed treatment and prevention. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: Previous studies found that individuals who harbor hostile attitudes toward immigrants & refugees tend to vote for far right nationalist parties, and that the same individuals also tend to report worse health status. We sought to test these associations using the latest data from 21 EU countries, and also whether the associations were moderated by the share of unemployed people in each region and individuals’ labor situation. Methods: We analyzed the second release of the 2016 European Social Survey which includes different questions about attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, as well as a rich variety of socioeconomic variables. Multilevel Poisson regression models were developed, regressing fair/poor health on attitudes towards immigrants & refugees. Results: For each one point increase in favorable attitudes toward immigrants, the prevalence of fair/poor health was reduced by 2 percentage points (PR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.96–0.99). In analyses incorporating cross-level interactions, the association was not moderated by high background unemployment rates or individual labor market attachment. Conclusion: Positive attitudes toward immigrants are correlated with lower prevalence of fair/poor health in general, regardless of individuals’ labor situation and the objective economic situation. Fostering empathy toward immigrants and refugees may thus promote a healthier society, especially among more prejudiced individuals. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Transphobia is a result of the widespread lack of knowledge among the general population, together with prejudice based on irrational fear and hatred, of those who do not fit the dominant, socially established gender categories. Little is known about transgender-related knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among the Mexican population, due to the lack of reliable, valid Spanish-language instruments. This study presents a Spanish translation of the Transgender Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs (T-KAB) Scale and examines its psychometric properties for the Mexican population. A cohort of 501 adult subjects, 337 (67.3%) women and 161 (32.1%) men, drawn from the general population, answered the T-KAB in an anonymous online survey. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and internal consistency measure were used to determine whether its dimensions were reliable and valid for use in a Mexican Spanish language and cultural context. A CFA including the three original dimensions proposed and excluding one item from the T-KAB Scale showed appropriate goodness of fit indices (χ2(180) = 389.41; χ2/df = 2.16, RMSEA = 0.048, CI [0.042, 0.055]; CFI = 0.971; TLI = 0.966), with Cronbach’s alpha values over 0.85. The psychometric properties exhibited by the Spanish version of the T-KAB support its use for the assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding transgender people in the Mexican cultural context. This instrument offers researchers a brief, reliable, valid, and easy self-report measure to use in further studies in Spanish-speaking populations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Addressing racial bias in automatic speech recognition is an area of concern in fields associated with human-computer interaction. Research to date suggests that sociolinguistic variation, namely systematic sources of sociophonetic variation, has yet to be extensively exploited in acoustic model architectures. This paper reports a study that evaluates the performance of one ASR system for a multi-ethnic sample of speakers from the American Pacific Northwest (including Native American, African American, European American and ChicanX speakers). Using a sociophonetic approach to characterizing vocalic and consonantal variation, we ask which dialect features appear to be most challenging for our ASR system. We also ask which error types are particular to the four ethnic dialects sampled. Recordings of both conversational and read speech were coded for a common set of 18 sociophonetic variables with distinct phonetic profiles. Automatic transcription was achieved using CLOx, a custom-built ASR system created for sociolinguistic analysis. Normalized error frequency rates were compared across ethnic samples to evaluate CLOx performance. Nf error rates demonstrate clear differential performance in the ASR system, pointing to racial bias in system output. Specific predictions are made regarding approaches that might be taken to leverage sociophonetic knowledge to improve social dialect-recognition accuracy in ASR systems. © 2022

AB  - Given the salience and rise of anti-immigrant sentiments in the United States, Mexican immigrants who are not integrated into the American cultural system, are undocumented, or are men may be particularly susceptible to negative treatment. Moreover, people who are high in social dominance orientation (SDO) endorse social hierarchies and are more likely to perceive groups from a lower status less positively. Using a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design, we presented participants (N = 243) with a vignette describing a Mexican immigrant who differed on acculturation strategy (assimilated or separated), documentation status (documented or undocumented), and gender (woman or man). We then asked participants to answer questions about the Mexican immigrant and complete an SDO scale. Overall, participants had more negative perceptions of separated (vs. assimilated) and undocumented (vs. documented) Mexican immigrants, and they felt less positively about Mexican immigrant women (vs. men). Participants with high SDO felt more negatively about separated (vs. assimilated) Mexican immigrants. Additionally, participants perceived the separated (vs. assimilated) Mexican immigrant as being more representative of Mexican immigrants as a group, but they identified more with the assimilated (vs. separated) Mexican immigrant. We also assessed participants’ attitudes toward Mexican immigrants in general and found that they perceived greater competitiveness toward undocumented (vs. documented) Mexican immigrants. These findings provide important insight into factors that impact U.S. perceptions of Mexican immigrants—a starting point to better understand and improve relations between the U.S. public and Mexican immigrants. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the need for social distancing created challenges for accessing and providing health services. Telemedicine enables prompt evaluation of patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury, even at a distance, without prejudice to the prognosis. The present study aimed to verify the validity of range of motion, muscle strength, sensitivity, and Tinel sign tele-assessment in adults with traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI). Methods: A cross-sectional study of twenty-one men and women with TBPI admitted for treatment at a Rehabilitation Hospital Network was conducted. The participants were assessed for range of motion, muscle strength, sensitivity, and Tinel sign at two moments: in-person assessment (IPA) and tele-assessment (TA). Results: The TA muscle strength tests presented significant and excellent correlations with the IPA (the intra-rater intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC ranged between 0.79 and 1.00 depending on the muscle tested). The agreement between the TA and IPA range of motion tests ranged from substantial to moderate (weighted kappa coefficient of 0.47–0.76 (p < 0.05) depending on the joint), and the kappa coefficient did not indicate a statistically significant agreement in the range of motion tests of supination, wrist flexors, shoulder flexors, and shoulder external rotators. The agreement between the IPA andTA sensitivity tests of all innervations ranged from substantial to almost perfect (weighted kappa coefficient 0.61–0.83, p < 0.05) except for the C5 innervation, where the kappa coefficient did not indicate a statistically significant agreement. The IPA versus TA Tinel sign test showed a moderate agreement (weighted kappa coefficient of 0.57, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that muscle strength tele-assessment is valid in adults with TBPI and presented a strong agreement for many components of TA range of motion, sensitivity, and Tinel sign tests. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Social vulnerability is significant in differential disaster impacts and outcomes and has been shown to influence the pace and progression of post-disaster recovery processes. Various disaster assistance programs - designed to support individual survivors, states, local governments, non-governmental entities, and businesses - may be distributing funds inequitably because they are not accounting for social vulnerabilities. One such program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Individuals and Households Program (IHP) program supports homeowners and renters for rental, repair, replacement, and permanent housing construction of disaster-damaged houses as well as providing other needs assistance to disaster victims with disaster-related non-housing expenses. To date, limited exploration connecting underlying social vulnerabilities and distribution of federal disaster assistance funds has provided only an incomplete understanding of the connections between underlying socio-economic conditions and often inequitable federal recovery assistance distribution. We analyzed county-level IHP assistance provided to homeowners between 2010 and 2018 and explored the relationships between fund distribution and social vulnerability indicators while controlling for total damages. Employing ordinary least squares regression analysis, we assessed links between Total Assistance, Housing Repair/Replace Assistance and Other Needs Assistance against social vulnerability variables from the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) framework. Results highlight specific social vulnerability variables influencing FEMA's distribution of disaster recovery assistance with race/ethnicity-related variables as the most frequent (regularly negative) influence on recovery fund receipt. Findings suggest that disaster assistance receipt is linked to underlying social vulnerability. As such, greater attention to and inclusion of social vulnerabilities would lead to more equitable distribution of disaster recovery funds. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Fisher et al have published a thought-provoking article exploring the complex relationship between universal health coverage (UHC) and equity. This commentary builds on two of the lessons they highlight: the importance of ideas in determining how exactly UHC advances equity, and the political difficulties of addressing the commercial determinants of health. I argue that equity in UHC can be advanced through interventions that address popular prejudices against public health systems, greater emphasis on structural and commercial drivers of ill-health in health professionals’ training, and by ensuring meaningful public participation in decision-making about the institutionalisation and management of UHC. These strategies are important for ensuring that the political, power-laden nature of concepts such as “universality,” “health” and “care” are explicitly acknowledged and publicly debated – rather than continuing the current trend of allowing technocrats to reduce UHC to a matter of efficiently and expeditiously financing curative healthcare services. © 2022 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Across group-living taxa, males act aggressively towards outgroup males because they represent a threat to reproduction with ingroup females. This intergroup aggression can entail agonistic coalition formation between group members, is typically associated with higher testosterone levels and prevents extended associations between members of different groups. However, in a few species, including humans, groups can interact peacefully, allowing the exchange of resources and information. To better understand how social relationships are manifested between groups and the involvement of males in these relationships, we investigated behavioural and endocrine correlates of male strategies during intergroup encounters in bonobos, Pan paniscus. We found that, despite overt intergroup aggression, males rarely engaged in coalitionary attacks against outgroup individuals and their testosterone levels did not rise during intergroup encounters. Also, males sacrificed the time available to affiliate with ingroup individuals and actively affiliated with outgroup individuals, especially outgroup males. The paucity of cooperative group defence and high levels of intergroup affiliation suggest that male bonobos play a role in maintaining tolerant intergroup relationships. We discuss how our findings relate to the establishment of male–male social relationships beyond the group level in other species. © 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

We tested contexts in which counterstereotypical cues of low socioeconomic status (SES) and White targets lead to more positive evaluations. In study 1, participants judged a low-SES candidate in a job hiring scenario as warmer and more competent than a high-SES candidate. A follow-up study found that trait words related to work ethic were salient in the hiring context, and particularly associated with this low-SES candidate. Study 2 orthogonally manipulated both income and perceptions of work ethic, with the work ethic manipulation impacting participant evaluations of both low- and high-income targets. Study 3 investigated a scenario in which no information on work ethic was provided. In study 4, a counterstereotypical low-income target (described as goal-oriented and studious) was evaluated as more hardworking than the average low-income person, average person on welfare, and average homeless person. Together, these results demonstrate that it is possible for a subtype of the “hardworking poor” to override more general stereotypes of low-SES targets as lazy or incompetent. This research suggests that interpersonal judgments based on SES are highly sensitive to work ethic cues. Additionally, we highlight the need for future research to further investigate experimental manipulations of social class and constructs related to work ethic, including dispositional and situational attributions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper explores the connection between offence and morality in segments of an hour-long life-story interview with two Latin American migrants in London, in which the participants recount interpersonal conflictive moments with co-ethnics. It shows that causing and taking offence is largely about the translocalisation of values to a new space where social and moral orders become unstable as the organisation of the social group is contingent on new socioeconomic realities. This, in turn, may generate conflicting understandings of what constitutes “right” or “wrong” ways of acting. It maintains that in order to understand the valence and reverberations of the offensive actions reported and gauge whose moral grounds can be legitimately validated and by whom, the wider relational context in which the offender and offended parties’ relationship is embedded and the place which it occupies within societal structures should be considered. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the overall increase in older adults’ internet use, the digital divide within older Americans remains substantial, particularly for those in rural areas and with racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. The current study examines how one’s residential area and racial/ethnicity relate to internet access, both singularly and in concert. Data were from the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. The sample consisted of 17,372 Americans aged 50 and above. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the direct effects of residence and race/ethnicity and their interaction effects on internet use. The odds of internet use were significantly lower for older adults living in suburban and rural residences as well as for Black and Hispanic individuals. Furthermore, rural living reduced the probability of using the internet more for Blacks than Whites. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to narrow the digital divide, with particular attention required for older Blacks in rural communities. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Impression formation can be biased by group stereotypes. Experiments on impression formation in the hiring context in which applicants' sexual orientation was manipulated have yielded mixed findings: positive, negative, or no stereotyping and discrimination of lesbian or gay applicants. However, impressions of individuals depend on more than their sexual orientation. The present research targets the question of whether adding individualizing information about an applicant can lead to assimilation to group stereotypes and thus negative impressions. To present individualizing information, we drew on social-network profiles for their practical relevance in contemporary application processes. Specifically, we tested whether private information concerning the romantic relationship of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual applicant leads to the application of negative stereotypes. In the role of a personnel manager, participants evaluated social-network profiles and application material. Participants rated one fictitious applicant on agency, communion, and hireability. In Experiment 1 (N = 316), male and female applicants differed in sexual orientation and were additionally depicted alone or being kissed by their partner. In Experiment 2 (N = 419), focusing on male applicants, we hypothesized that negative stereotypes are activated if gay or bisexual, but not heterosexual men live in a non-normative relationship form (polyamory vs. control: monoamory). Different from expectations, adding individualizing information did not lead to more negative impressions of gay, lesbian, or bisexual applicants. We discuss the implications of these positive impressions for social-psychological theories. © 2022 The Authors. Journal of Applied Social Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Confrontation is an important mechanism to reduce racial prejudice. Yet, little research has examined White adults’ intended confrontation within the context of discriminatory policies that pose barriers to Black Americans seeking employment. Moreover, less research has investigated reactions to zero-sum and negative-sum anti-Black institutional discrimination. The present study investigated the effects of an antiracism educational exercise on White adults’ intended confrontation of zero-sum and negative-sum institutional discrimination. Participants aged 20–85 years (n = 195; Mage = 54.16) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) antiracism education with writing reflection, (2) antiracism education alone, or (3) a control condition. Participants then reported how they would respond in situations that described zero-sum (i.e., new hire recruitment exclusively from predominantly White institutions) and negative-sum anti-Black institutional discrimination (i.e., hairstyle discrimination). Participants in the antiracism education alone condition intended to confront more assertively in both scenarios compared to participants in the control condition. Across conditions, participants were more likely to intend to confront, and intended to confront more assertively, in the zero-sum discrimination scenario than the negative-sum discrimination scenario. We conclude that a brief antiracism education exercise may hold promise for increasing White adults’ assertive confrontation of institutional discrimination, but the effects may be contingent on whether a reflective writing task is included and the characteristics of the discriminatory policy. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Brazil is a continental country with a history of massive immigration waves from around the world. Consequently, the Brazilian population is rich in ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity, but suffers from tremendous socioeconomic inequality. Brazil has a documented history of categorizing individuals with culturally specific behaviors as mentally ill, which has led to psychiatric institutionalization for reasons that were more social than clinical. To address this, a “network for psychosocial care” was created in Brazil, that included mental health clinics and community services distributed throughout the country. This generates local support for mental health rehabilitation, integrating psychiatric care, family support and education/work opportunities. These clinics and community services are tailored to provide care for each specific area, and are more attuned to regional culture, values and neighborhood infrastructure. Here we review existing reports about the Brazilian experience, including advances in public policy on mental health, and challenges posed by the large diversity to the psychosocial rehabilitation. In addition, we show how new digital technologies in general, and computational speech analysis in particular, can contribute to unbiased assessments, resulting in decreased stigma and more effective diagnosis of the mental diseases, with methods that are free of gender, ethnic, or socioeconomic biases. © 2022

AB  - Even when people hold little prejudice themselves, expectations about how members of other groups perceive them may negatively influence interracial relations. In four pre-registered experiments, each using a full intergroup design with Black and White participants, we show that people infer negative meta-attitudes from out-group members whose appearance is phenotypically prototypical, which in turn leads to less favorable orientations toward intergroup contact, independent of personal attitudes. In Experiment 1, Black Americans, but not White Americans, perceived that more phenotypically prototypical out-group members held less favorable meta-attitudes, and this explained less favorable contact orientations. In Experiment 2, this pattern emerged for both groups of participants and was particularly pronounced among individuals higher in stigma consciousness. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 with representative samples and demonstrated that the effect of phenotypic prototypicality was more pronounced among participants reporting greater previous rejection by the out-group. With few exceptions, participants in the experiments also perceived phenotypically prototypical in-group members as having less positive meta-attitudes and participants showed less favorable contact orientations toward these in-group targets. An internal meta-analysis supported the robustness of the findings in the first three experiments. In Experiment 4, direct evidence for the causal effect of the mediator meta-attitudes on orientations toward contact with in- and out-group members was obtained. In all studies, effects held controlling for participants' general intergroup attitudes and experiences, demonstrating the unique role of meta-attitudes in shaping intergroup relations. We discuss our results in light of previous research, highlight social implications, and suggest future directions. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The presidency of Donald Trump represented a relatively unique event in modern American history, whereby a sitting US president made numerous controversial remarks about minoritized groups yet nonetheless maintained substantial public support. Trump’s comments constituted a departure from the egalitarian norms that had long characterized American political discourse. Here, we examine the potential effects of Trump’s rhetoric on Americans’ attitudes, predicting that these high-profile norm violations may have reshaped the personal prejudices of the American people. In 13 studies including over 10,000 participants, we tested how Americans’ prejudice changed following the political ascension of Donald Trump. We found that explicit racial and religious prejudice significantly increased amongst Trump’s supporters, whereas individuals opposed to Trump exhibited decreases in prejudice. Further, changing social norms appear to explain these changes in prejudice. These results suggest that Trump’s presidency coincided with a substantial change in the topography of prejudice in the United States. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between an individual's human capital and that of their parents’ ethnic group in former British and French colonies in Africa. Using pooled cross-sectional data from eight African countries, four former French colonies (Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Madagascar, Niger) and four former British colonies (Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda), we find large effects of parental ethnicity on individuals’ human capital. Our results show that colonial origin may be important in understanding intergenerational mobility in African countries via its effect on ethnic relations. Ethnic capital has a persistent effect. This effect, which could be attributed to differences in administration styles adopted during the colonial period, is higher in former British than former French colonies. Birth cohort regression analysis further shows that the ethnic effect has declined across cohorts in former British colonies while remaining comparatively static in former French colonies. Our results are robust to the use of different estimation techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research adds to the emergent literature on intersectionality and public administration through examining how transgender women of color (trans WOC) are interacting with U.S. social welfare offices. It is our contention that trans WOC, facing a compounded set of negative stereotypes derived from racial and gender identities, will be more likely than other transgender identifying persons to: (1) avoid seeking out public welfare benefits and (2) be more likely to report experiencing discriminatory treatment in social welfare offices. Using data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey we uncover evidence that trans WOC are more likely to avoid social welfare offices and face discrimination in social welfare offices. Scholars and administrators of social welfare programs, including Social Security related benefits, should be aware of the potential for public benefit avoidance and administrative discrimination directed toward historically marginalized groups and prioritize social equity considerations among clients facing compounded intersectional barriers. © 2022 by The American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - Gendered racism can impact how Black teen girls perceive themselves in relation to the world and influence their behaviors. This form of discrimination tends to manifest in stereotypes that promote the victimization and mistreatment of Black teen girls. This qualitative study, using Black feminist thought through a Black Girlhood lens as a guiding framework, aims to understand how Black teen girls are affected by gendered-racist stereotypes and how these stereotypes impact sexual decision making among this group. Using a sample of (N = 27) Black teen girls, three major themes arose: (1) experiencing the effects of racist-sexist stereotypes, (2) feeling powerless and invisible due to stereotypes, and (3) navigating the pressure to have sex due to stereotypes. Implications for this study include incorporating elements of Black Feminist Thought through a Black girlhood lens within prevention programing while also providing Black teen girls with the tools to challenge negative stereotypes with support from adult allies in school and family settings. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma towards alcohol use disorders is prevalent in India and can lead to social exclusion and hamper treatment access and outcomes. Family members of individuals with dependent drinking are often their primary caregivers and play a key role in decisions around help-seeking, treatment and recovery. The nature and role of stigma in caregiving, and the consequent burden on family caregivers of those with dependent drinking, has not been qualitatively studied in India. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with: (i) men with probable alcohol dependence (n = 11); (ii) family caregivers (n = 12); and (iii) doctors with experience of treating alcohol dependence (n = 13) in community settings in Goa. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Two primary themes were identified from the data: (i) stigma in the form of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination; and (ii) the impact of this stigma on caregiving decisions and the mental health of caregivers. Discussion and Conclusions: We found that stigma functioned as a barrier to a proper course of treatment and care, as well as a detrimental factor for caregiver's mental health and caregiving decision-making. Stigma towards dependent drinking in the forms of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination is prevalent within homes, workplaces and health systems and might exacerbate the caregiving burden among female family caregivers. Policies, educational programs and campaigns aimed at preventing stigma in these forms would likely enable access to more inclusive and appropriate health services, benefit the health of family caregivers and improve the treatment outcomes of drinkers. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - For years, HIV activists in Canada have expressed serious concerns about the stigmatizing and sensational way that HIV criminalization is portrayed in the mainstream press. Discourse analyses of the content of news stories about HIV criminalization confirm that news reports of HIV criminal cases rely on sensational language and reproduce negative stereotypes of people living with HIV. This paper contributes to social justice scholarship in the area by building upon studies of news content to uncover how news reports of HIV criminalization are produced in the first place. Through institutional ethnographic interviews with journalists who produce news stories about HIV criminalization, this study brings into view that conditions of convergence journalism make it exceedingly difficult for reporters to disrupt the genre of crime stories about HIV criminalization in which stigmatizing discourses proliferate. © 2022 Canadian Sociological Association/La Société canadienne de sociologie.

AB  - Objectives: Functional movement disorders (FMD) refer to a heterogeneous group of manifestations incongruent with known neurological diseases. Functional neuroimaging studies in FMD indicate the overlap between cerebral regions in which abnormal activation occurs and those considered crucial for theory of mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states. The aim of this study was to explore whether FMD might be related to ToM disorders to the extent that they reduce the ability to make inferences about the mental states underlying motor behaviour during social interaction. Materials & Methods: Eighteen subjects with FMD and 28 matched healthy controls (HC) were given a ToM battery. The severity of FMD was rated by the Simplified-FMD Rating Scale (S-FMDRS). Dissociative symptoms were evaluated by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II). Results: FMD scored worse than the HC in most ToM tasks: second-order False Beliefs (p =.005), Faux-Pas Recognition Test (p <.001) and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (p =.020); control questions elicited normal scores. The DES-II indicated dissociative-borderline psychopathology and negatively correlated with accuracy on the second-order False Belief (Spearman's rho = −.444; p =.032); the positive correlation between DES-II and severity of motor symptoms (S-FMDRS) approached significance (Spearman's rho test =.392; p =.054). ToM disorders were not correlated with S-FMDRS, due to the typical variability in FMD over time with regard to the severity of symptoms and the district of body involved. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that FMD are related to ToM deficits, and future studies are needed to define the specific nature of this relationship. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In the September 2020 issue of Perspectives, Scott et al. argued that there is insufficient empirical work on White parents’ racial-socialization strategies to support generalizations about the topic and, therefore, that journalists’ recommendation that White parents discuss race and racism with their children represents a case of speculation without evidence. Although we strongly support Scott et al.’s call for additional, rigorous research on racial socialization in White families, we argue that their critique of popular-press pieces was unwarranted. Specifically, we argue that, although definitive tests of the effects of specific White parental racial-socialization strategies are lacking, the recommendation for parents to discuss race and racism with their children is both appropriate and empirically grounded. We describe research on racial socialization, intergroup contact, and cognitive development that is consistent with recommendations from developmental scientists reported in the popular press. Furthermore, we argue that parents may be the ideal socializers of racial attitudes. We conclude with a discussion of the broad context concerning media reports of findings from psychological science. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objective: Decreased childhood vaccination can lead to local outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. In a pilot study from our group, 72% of parents of newborns reported initiating their vaccine decision-making for that child prior to conception. Since a sound understanding of the timing of parental vaccine decision-making is needed to direct educational efforts, we surveyed a national cohort of first-time parents to extend our preliminary findings. Methods: From March 2019 to March 2020, first-time parents of newborns in mother-baby units of the Better Outcomes through Research for Newborns (BORN) network completed the Vaccine Preference Development Survey (VPDS). The VPDS measures intent to vaccinate, timing of vaccine decision-making, and sources of influence. Univariate and multivariate analyses explored associations between intent to vaccinate and timing of vaccine decision-making with demographic variables. Results: Twenty-three sites provided surveys through site-specific nonrandom systemic sampling; 91% (1393/1524) of surveys were used in the analysis. Most parents planned to fully vaccinate (1191/1380, 86.3%) and started vaccine decision-making prior to conception (850/1378, 61.7%). Maternal age, race and ethnicity, relationship status, and education were all significantly associated with planning to fully vaccinate and preconception decision-making (P <.001). Preconception decision-making correlated strongly with intent to fully vaccinate (P <.001). Parents influenced by personal education, medical professionals, and family/friends were more likely to endorse preconception decision-making; those strongly influenced by internet/social media were less likely to allow all vaccines or start decision-making prior to conception. Conclusions: Vaccine decision-making occurs preconception for most new parents. Initiating vaccine discussions during the birth hospitalization may be too late. © 2021 Academic Pediatric Association

AB  - Popular press articles have advocated for parent–child conversations about race and racism to prevent children from developing racial biases, yet empirical investigations of the impact of racial socialization in White U.S. families are scarce. In an article published in Perspectives on Psychological Science in 2020, Scott et al. warned that, given the lack of empirical evidence, parents might actually do more harm than good by talking to their children about race. In this comment, we draw upon the literature on (a) racial socialization, (b) parenting and parent–child discourse, and (c) the role of nonverbal communication in parental socialization to inform our understanding of parents’ ability to engage in race-related conversations in the absence of empirical guidance. We also highlight emerging evidence of the potential benefits of these conversations (even if parents are uncomfortable). In sum, the wealth of existing literature suggests that parents can successfully navigate challenging conversations with their children—which tends to result in better outcomes for children than avoiding those conversations. Thus, although we support Scott et al.’s call for researchers to develop more empirical research, we part with the authors’ assertion that researchers need to wait for more sufficient evidence before providing recommendations to White parents—we believe that the time for White families to begin talking about race and racism is now. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The goal of the present research was to assess whether children's first interaction with a single outgroup member can significantly impact their general attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole. In two preregistered studies, 5- to 6-year-old Chinese children (total N = 147) encountered a Black adult from another country for the very first time, and they played a game together. General attitudes toward the outgroup were assessed using both implicit and explicit measures. In both studies, the interaction resulted in less negative explicit attitudes toward Black people, but more negative implicit attitudes. The results demonstrate for the first time that one encounter with a single outgroup member can impact children's general attitudes toward that group, and that it can have differential effects on implicit and explicit attitudes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The present study aimed to replicate Kessler and McKenna’s (1978) ethnomethodological study that investigated how an individual attributes gender to a person. By administering figures depicted on overlays (Overlay Study), Kessler and McKenna found that the penis more than the vulva and the male sexual characteristics more than the female ones were significantly more salient in the gender attribution process. From all this, their adage is: “See someone as female only when you cannot see them as male.” Taking as a model Kessler and McKenna’s Overlay Study, we administered to 592 adults 120 new digital stimuli elaborated on realistic frontal images of human nudes to verify if the previously obtained results would be confirmed by using more realistic images. We found that the participants attributed male gender 86% of the time when the penis was shown, but only attributed female gender 67% of the time when the vulva was shown. All findings had strong statistical significance, confirming the findings of the Overlay Study that the penis makes the difference in gender recognition. Beyond an ethnomethodological approach, we have interpreted and discussed our results from the outlook of evolutionary and cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, concluding that the cultural stereotypes and prejudices that affect gender attribution might not just be a mere cultural product, but rather the consequence of evolved cognitive biases. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Social biases may influence providers’ judgments related to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and patients’ consequent PrEP access. US primary and HIV care providers (n = 370) completed an experimental survey. Each provider reviewed one fictitious medical record of a patient seeking PrEP. Records varied by patient race (Black or White) and risk behavior (man who has sex with men [MSM], has sex with women [MSW], or injects drugs [MID]). Providers reported clinical judgments and completed measures of prejudice. Minimal evidence of racially biased judgments emerged. Providers expressing low-to-moderate sexual prejudice judged the MSM as more likely than the MSW to adhere to PrEP, which was associated with greater PrEP prescribing intention; sexual prejudice was negatively associated with anticipated MSM adherence. Providers judged the MID to be at higher risk, less likely to adhere, less safety-conscious, and less responsible than both the MSM and MSW; adverse adherence and responsibility judgments were associated with lower prescribing intention. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study explores the mechanisms of racial discrimination in U.S. independent filmmaking. To answer this question, I combine the theoretical toolkits on Hollywood discrimination and Bourdieu’s theory of cultural production. I employ in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 30 U.S.-based independent filmmakers of color, and observations of public discussions at film festivals in the greater Los Angeles area. I find that despite independent film’s inclusive and non-commercial discourses, many of the mechanisms of racial exclusion that underlie Hollywood’s lack of diversity also exist in independent film: the economic uncertainty of creative labor, racialized market logics, the economic stigmatization of artists of color, and the reliance on closed social networks for career advancement. Furthermore, I also find that non-commercial factors in the field of independent film also constrain the ability for filmmakers of color to make art reflective of their experiences, form mutually beneficial collaborations with other artists of color, or invest their time in projects that are culturally innovative. These findings suggest that even at the margins of mainstream cultural production, mechanisms of racialization can still operate where racial prejudice and racialized economics outweigh artistic independence. © 2021 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - Among the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, South Korea shows the worst female earnings disadvantage. Women's career disruption associated with marriage and childbearing is said to be the primary factor behind the huge female disadvantage in Korea. Recent studies, however, demonstrated that substantial female disadvantage appears prior to women's career disruption, even net of human capital covariates. In this study, we examine whether taste-based gender discrimination is a source of female earnings disadvantage. We use sex ratios of births across regions during the 1990s as a proxy of prejudice against women in current labor markets. Our empirical results show that female earnings disadvantages among 2009–2017 college graduates are larger in the regions where sex ratios of 1990–1999 newborns were higher. Our results are robust to the control of an extensive set of human capital variables, including concrete college names, detailed fields of study, high school types, and more. Depending on models, one-fourth to one-third of female earnings disadvantage is attributable to prejudice against women. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 2021

AB  - In a cross-cultural study, we investigated the link between explicit attitudes towards the hijab and implicit measures of cultural and religious bias during the recognition of emotions. Participants tested in Austria (N = 71) and in Turkey (N = 70) reported their attitude towards the hijab, and categorised in a mousetracker task happy and sad faces of women, shown with five levels of intensity, and framed either by a hijab or by an oval-shaped mask. The two samples did not differ in their explicit attitudes towards the hijab. However, negative attitude towards the hijab predicted greater sadness attribution to happy faces with the hijab in Austrian participants. Unrelated to their explicit attitudes, Turkish participants attributed more sadness to happy faces with than without the hijab. Results suggest that the sight of the hijab activated, in both Austrian and Turkish participants, implicit biases resulting in associations with sadness and negative emotions. © Experimental Psychology Society 2021.

AB  - In recent years, LGBT issues have received substantial media attention and engendered heated public debate in Ghana. This paper analyzes the prejudiced construction of LGBT issues in the Ghanaian news media and how this contributes to a discriminatory discourse that demeans LGBT people and puts them at the periphery of Ghanaian society. The study employs a critical discourse analysis framework and a dataset of 385 articles, comprising news reports, op-ed pieces, and editorials. The analysis reveals that news content on LGBT issues is biased and inflammatory, and it frames LGBT people as expendables and undesirables. This is realized by exploiting three discourses, or forms of othering, that culminate into the (re)production and naturalization of moral panic: a discourse of amorality/immorality and societal destruction, a discourse of alienization, and a discourse of medicalization or pathologization. The paper concludes with a call for a more balanced and ethically/socially responsible news reporting, especially since LGBT issues in Ghana hold implications for national cohesion and security. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The success of populist radical right parties (PRRPs) in Europe has, in part, been attributed to growing immigration, but previous findings have found an inconsistent relationship between immigration and voting for PRRPs. We address previous inconsistencies by suggesting a time-focused perspective on intergroup relations. We disentangle short-term from longer term immigration trends and argue that a recent increase in immigration should predict PRRP support. With time, however, citizens will adapt to these demographic changes and voting for PRRPs could decline. We drew on official immigration records and representative data from the European Social Survey, capturing the voting behavior of 75,874 individuals from 15 European countries between 2002 and 2014. We found that a recent increase in immigration predicted more PRRP voting, and this relationship was strengthened under conditions of higher economic strain and inequality. In contrast, sustained immigration in the longer term was not related with PRRP votes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Movement synchrony is an essential feature of rituals and collective displays around the world. Previous studies have shown that synchronous movements increase observers’ perceived group entitativity and fighting capacity in agonistic contexts; however, little is known about the developmental roots of synchrony-dominant attributions. In this study, adult participants (Exp 1), 5- to 6-year-old children (Exp 2) and 7- to 8-year-old children (Exp 3) predicted outcomes of zero-sum conflicts between two groups of animated agents after each group exhibited either synchronised or non-synchronised movements. Predictions were made for conflicts between two individual members from different groups (individual-conflict condition) and between all members of the two groups (group-conflict condition). Results showed that none of the participant groups showed a synchrony-dominant preference in the individual-conflict condition. In the group-conflict condition, most adult participants expected the groups exhibiting synchronised movements to be socially dominant. Although 5- to 6-year-old children did not show more biased expectations than can be accounted for by chance, adult-like synchrony-dominant preference was found in 7- to 8-year-old children. Moreover, justifications of the synchrony-dominant expectation in both adults and 7- to 8-year-old children showed that this expectation was driven by the perceived entitativity of the synchronous group. These findings show that the expectation of group dominance based on synchronous movements is strongly developed in school-age children, explaining the developmental origins of intergroup attitudes as well as the cognitive mechanisms children employ when making judgments in intergroup contexts. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Immigration has historically been of low salience in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, the region has consistently higher levels of ethnocentrism than the rest of Europe. Scholars argue that the East's limited politicization of immigration is due to its status as a region of emigration and the presence of ethnic minority ‘others’. I argue that this is changing. The politicization of the European refugee crisis by domestic elites has begun to refocus the sociocultural dimension on the immigration issue. Using structural equation models, I compare European Values Study data from 2008 and 2017 across 10 East European EU member states. I find evidence that traditionalist attitudes are more strongly related to anti-immigration attitudes since the crisis, particularly for those who are interested in politics. Further, immigration attitudes are polarizing across the GAL-TAN dimension and by education. Hence, immigration is bolstering a pre-existing, socially structured divide around both nationalist and traditionalist values. © 2021 European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Social psychology suggests that racism, as captured by explicit prejudice and racial discrimination, is perceived negatively in the United States. However, considering the hierarchy-enhancing nature of racism, it may be that negative perceptions of racism are attenuated among perceivers high in anti-egalitarian sentiment. The reported studies support this, suggesting that racist candidates were tolerated more and had relatively greater hireability ratings as a function of perceivers’ social dominance orientation (SDO; Studies 1–4). Candidate race did not impact these evaluations—only the hierarchy relevance of their actions did (i.e., whether the candidate’s behavior was hierarchy enhancing or had no clear implication for the hierarchy; Study 2). Furthermore, anti-racist candidates (e.g., those displaying hierarchy-attenuating behavior) were tolerated less and had lower hireability ratings as a function of perceivers’ SDO (Study 3). Finally, the perceived intentionality of the candidate’s actions affected tolerance toward them as a function of SDO. This suggests hierarchy relevance impacts evaluative outcomes. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Melanoma-screening examinations support early diagnosis, yet there is a national shortage of dermatologists and most at-risk patients lack access to dermatologic care. Primary care physicians (PCPs) in the United States often bridge these access gaps, and thus, play a critical role in the early detection of melanoma. However, most PCPs do not offer skin examinations. We conducted a systematic review and searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 1946 to July 2019 to identify barriers for skin screening by providers, patients, and health systems following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Of 650 abstracts initially identified, 111 publications were included for full-text review and 48 studies met the inclusion criteria. Lack of dermatologic training (89.4%), time constraints (70%), and competing comorbidities (51%) are the most common barriers reported by PCPs. Low perceived risk (69%), long delays in appointment (46%), and lack of knowledge about melanoma (34.8%) are most frequently reported patient barriers. Qualitative reported barriers for health system are lack of public awareness, social prejudice leading to tanning booth usage, public surveillance programs requiring intensive resources, and widespread ABCD evaluation causing delays in seeking medical attention for melanomas. Numerous barriers remain that prevent the implementation of skin screening practices in clinical practice. A multi-faceted combination of efforts is essential for the execution of acceptable and effective skin cancer-screening practices, thus, increasing early diagnosis and lowering mortality rates and burden of disease for melanoma. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) is a widely researched construct that indexes a preference for hierarchical intergroup relations. However, it remains unclear whether this preference (a) motivates people to seek out occupations that enhance hierarchical relations between groups (i.e., occupational assortment), (b) develops as a result of working within hierarchy-enhancing occupations (i.e., occupational socialization), or (c) both. One reason for this gap is that the large-scale longitudinal data required to simultaneously model assortment and socialization processes are scarce. In this study, we analyzed data from two waves of longitudinal data (spaced either 1, 3, or 5 years apart) from a nationwide sample of adults (N = 3,452–4,412) who were already working in either hierarchy-enhancing occupations (e.g., law enforcement) or hierarchy-attenuating occupations (e.g., social work). Results showed that SDO predicted an increased probability of working in a hierarchy-enhancing occupation 3 and 5 years later. Working in a hierarchy-enhancing occupation was also positively associated with SDO after 1 and 5 years. These patterns generally suggest that occupations both shape, and are shaped by, intergroup beliefs. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study presents the results of the evaluation of Friendship Project-Greek version (FP-GR), a school based multicultural and anti-racist program aiming to develop intercultural skills and positive intergroup relationships, as well as familiarize and sensitize children with refugees’ life circumstances and difficulties. The aim of the study was to adapt FP in the Greek context and evaluate its longitudinal effectiveness in Greek students. The sample of the present research consisted of 314 children aged 9–12 years from six elementary schools in Athens and Crete, Greece. Students were randomly assigned to condition (intervention or control group) and the effectiveness of the program was examined through three measurements (before, at the end of the intervention and 3 months later). Data analyses (Repeated measures ANCOVA’s, Confirmatory Factor Analyses) were conducted using SPSS 25 and Mplusv.8.0. Results showed that FP-GR influenced participants’ general attitudes towards refugees, affected their xenophobic and intolerant attitudes but did not seem to have any significant impact on participants’ altruism. These results provide initial evidence that the FP-GR is an effective school-based prejudice-reduction program that promotes inclusive education for refugee-background elementary school children. Suggestions for the improvement of specific elements of FP-GR are also provided. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the last 60 years, the proportion of white Americans expressing anti-black prejudice in face-to-face survey interviews has declined dramatically. To test whether social desirability pressures affect the expression of anti-black prejudice, we analyzed a within-subjects experiment in the 2008 American National Election Study in which white respondents first reported their endorsement of stereotypes of blacks confidentially via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) and weeks or months later orally during second interviews. Shifting to ACASI led to a small but significant increase in negative views of blacks. Unexpectedly, shifting to ACASI also led to a similarly large increase in negative views of whites. Furthermore, the ACASI reports had no more predictive validity than did the oral reports. This evidence suggests that social desirability pressures do not seriously compromise oral reports of racial stereotypes in face-to-face interviews. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Conceptually, “group-focused enmity” (GFE, long-term project in Germany, duration: 2002–2011) consists of several different attitudes that constitute a syndrome of group-focused enmity. These attitudes are empirically related to each other and share a common core which is the ideology of inequality. But is GFE really a one-dimensional homogeneous ideology? Over the years there have been considerable doubts about this fundamental assumption. We have two central theoretical argumentations for explicating and revising the concept of GFE. The first is based on the social psychological literature regarding differences between ideologies, attitudes, stereotypes and social prejudices. The second arises from one of the basic conceptual ideas of the GFE project, which states that depending on the respective societies different specific groups become targets of devaluation and discrimination. Therefore, we propose a revised version of the GFE syndrome as a two-dimensional concept: an ideology of inequality (generalized attitudes) and social prejudice (specific attitudes). The measurement models are strictly empirically tested using data from the GFE panel (waves 2006, 2008) as well as the representative GFE-surveys (cross-sections 2003, 2011) conducted in Germany. To test for discriminant and external validity, we have also included social dominance orientation (SDO). Additionally, within this framework, the methodological focus of the study is to test for several forms of measurement invariance in the context of higher-order factor models considering the issue of multidimensionality of latent variables. Our empirical results support the idea that GFE is a bi-dimensional concept consisting of an ideology of inequality and social prejudice. Moreover, SDO is demonstrated to be empirically distinct from both dimensions and correlates more strongly with the ideology of inequality in comparison to social prejudice. Additionally, the bi-dimensional GFE conceptualization proves to be at least metric invariant both between and within individuals. The impact of our proposed conceptualization and empirical findings will be discussed in the context of international research on ideologies, attitudes and prejudices. The dealing questions are why different explanatory factors have different effects on prejudicial and ideological attitudes and why there are different forms and manifestations of social prejudice in different societies over time.

AB  - This study investigates how ageism is displayed among Japanese women in their mid-twenties when they talk about their experiences with COVID-19. Ageism, which is discrimination, stereotypes and prejudice based on people’s age, was reinforced by the outbreak of the disease. This study gathered data through virtual conversations recorded during the second wave of COVID-19 cases that hit Japan in August 2020. The conversation is examined using discourse analy-sis, focusing on how the participants position themselves and others through the narration of their personal experience. The analysis shows how participants co-construct the image of elderly people as others who are vulnerable to the virus but ignorant of their own risks. This image is created as the participants estab-lish rapport-oriented interactions with friends that they align with as young and healthy citizens who are responsible for preventing the spread of the virus. @ 2022, equinox publishing.

AB  - We don't yet have adequate theories of what the human mind is representing when it represents a social group. Worse still, many people think we do. This mistaken belief is a consequence of the state of play: Until now, researchers have relied on their own intuitions to link up the concept social group on the one hand and the results of particular studies or models on the other. While necessary, this reliance on intuition has been purchased at a considerable cost. When looked at soberly, existing theories of social groups are either (i) literal, but not remotely adequate (such as models built atop economic games), or (ii) simply metaphorical (typically a subsumption or containment metaphor). Intuition is filling in the gaps of an explicit theory. This paper presents a computational theory of what, literally, a group representation is in the context of conflict: It is the assignment of agents to specific roles within a small number of triadic interaction types. This mental definition of a group paves the way for a computational theory of social groups - in that it provides a theory of what exactly the information-processing problem of representing and reasoning about a group is. For psychologists, this paper offers a different way to conceptualize and study groups, and suggests that a non-tautological definition of a social group is possible. For cognitive scientists, this paper provides a computational benchmark against which natural and artificial intelligences can be held. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - What explains ageism towards older people? Several answers exist in the literature, but it is still unclear whether the ageism people express has been altered by motivational forces (i.e. factors which carry or enact motivation, leading to action or thought) or whether an original, primal ageism can be expressed directly. Investigating populations of young adults (45 and younger), this article suggests that value systems are sources of internal and external motivational forces which work to either suppress or to justify both subtle and blatant forms of ageism. It was hypothesised that, at the individual level, values precede any threat perception and negative stereotypical beliefs associated with older people, leading to forms of ageism which match the motivational goals of a person's values. It was further expected that, at the cultural level, values represent the climate in which people express ageist beliefs. It was found that self-transcendence values can bypass the negative effects of threat perception and negative stereotypes, resulting in less-negative forms of ageism. A sample comprising a clear majority of hierarchical, non-Western cultures showed that self-enhancement values also contributed motivational strength for the suppression of blatant ageism. A practical implication of these findings is the possibility of further developing existing strategies of combating ageism by working to effect appropriate long-term changes in the values of young adults.

AB  - Most research on attitudes towards immigrants and immigration problematically conflates the documented and the undocumented. Previous studies also largely ignore the autonomous role of population density. Based on data drawn from two nationally representative surveys, this paper focuses on contemporary American attitudes towards undocumented immigration and immigrants. Contra the dominant view, we find that education and income have no effect. More important, population density, measured at the county level, significantly predicts favorable attitudes, controlling for factors often erroneously conflated with density: race, income, education, political affiliation, age, gender, and interaction with immigrants. In fact, interaction tends to decrease favorable attitudes. We explain these findings by proposing a novel account of cosmopolitanism, using favorable attitudes towards undocumented immigrants and immigration as an empirical indicator. Those who live in places with higher density are more used to see and be seen in everyday life by countless people with whom they share the same spaces without necessarily interacting with them. As a result, they are more likely to consider all them, including undocumented immigrants, in a superficial yet egalitarian way as generalized others to be ignored. It is this tolerance based on general indifference that is the basis of cosmopolitanism. ©

AB  - Discriminatory behavior is often assumed to partly be a result of implicit or unconscious biases. However, to my knowledge, no published experimental studies exist on the presence of such attitudes among public officials such as teachers or police officers and the related effects on real-life client discrimination. This study attempts to fill this research gap by combining a field experiment that captures ethnic discrimination among principals with an implicit attitude test (IAT) capturing their implicit attitudes toward Arab parents. The results suggest that Swedish elementary school principals have a moderately negative implicit bias toward Arabs according to the IAT. However, their implicit associations do not appear to drive the differential treatment of clients to a significant degree. Hence, implicit biases as captured by the IAT may possibly not be the most significant drivers of ethnic discrimination today among public officials. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives To explore perceived sociocultural factors that may influence suicidality from key informants residing in coastal Kenya. Design We used an exploratory qualitative study design. Setting Mombasa and Kilifi Counties of Coastal Kenya. Participants 25 key informants including community leaders, professionals and community members directly and indirectly affected by suicidality. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with purposively selected key informants to collect data on sociocultural perspectives of suicide. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes using both inductive and deductive processes. Results Four key themes were identified from the inductive content analysis of 25 in-depth interviews as being important for understanding cultural perspectives related to suicidality: (1) the stigma of suicidal behaviour, with suicidal victims perceived as weak or crazy, and suicidal act as evil and illegal; (2) the attribution of supernatural causality to suicide, for example, due to sorcery or inherited curses; (3) the convoluted pathway to care, specifically, delayed access to biomedical care and preference for informal healers; and (4) gender and age differences influencing suicide motivation, method of suicide and care seeking behaviour for suicidality. Conclusions This study provides an in depth understanding of cultural factors attributed to suicide in this rural community that may engender stigma, discrimination and poor access to mental healthcare in this community. We recommend multipronged and multilevel suicide prevention interventions targeted at changing stigmatising attitudes, beliefs and behaviours, and improving access to mental healthcare in the community. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - The notion of multiculturalism is explored in Chetan Bhagat's "Two States: The Story of My Marriage" in this research. The book examines the impact of intra-cultural and inter-cultural patterns in our social fabric, focusing on the cultural collision of two states and the issues that both the older and younger generations experience in a multicultural environment. Each culture has its own history, language, and heritage, but Multiculturalism brings their disparate perspectives together. The main premise in the story promoting Multiculturalism is comparable to the Salad Bowl Theory, which refers to a society with a blend of many cultures and heritages as if they were various ingredients create a salad with distinct tastes everyone lives in a homogenous community, but they each have their own distinct cultural background. In India, a country noted for its "Unity in Diversity," such parallels may be noticed. This multicultural society allows individuals of all cultures to work together, understand each other, and respect each other. It also leads to prejudice and cultural conflicts, which leads to discrimination. Chetan Bhagat's two states represent the prejudice and discrimination that exists across civilizations. The virtues and vices that exist in communities are depicted in this work. © 2022 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - In this article, I explore my academic privileges through using the autoethnographic method while working in an alternative school and with interns hired for an agricultural internship. Academic privilege is contextualized as those factors in an education setting that benefit some and not all; with consideration of various personal and social factors including, but not limited to, skin color, aspects of identity, economic disparity, resource availability, social relationships, social settings, etcetera. Data collection involved observations within the school and when working with the interns. There were also informal conversations. The observations and informal conversations were documented as field notes to use for personal audio recordings. The personal audio recordings were transcribed and thematically coded. The three themes were: (1) At the Alternative School, (2) Criminalization and Prejudice, and (3) Future Opportunities for The Interns. This article allows the reader to journey with me to a place of introspection, reflexivity, and contemplation. Copyright 2022: Eric Hogan and Nova Southeastern University.

AB  - Consumerism favours the culture of the disposable, excessive extroversion, and superficiality. Data manipulation, the shadow of information technology, harms individual and collective lives. In a world filled with prejudice, intolerance, violence and social inequality, nature is neglected putting our survival at risk. The lack of appreciation for subjectivity and self-knowledge and the demand for greater performance foster physical and emotional problems expressed through anxiety, depression, anguish and burnout. It is thus urgent to develop a pattern of consciousness that allows us to overcome polarization and cope with the opposites by the means of dialogue and an appreciation of the dialectical and symmetrical relationship between the polarities. Carlos Byington, in his symbolic psychology, named this the archetypal pattern of alterity, and considered it the basis of solidarity, respect for difference, democracy and sustainability. © 2022, The Society of Analytical Psychology.

AB  - The large number of refugees and host countries’ citizens’ reactions regarding their admission have been major global issues. Thus, psychological interventions to foster intergroup relations in the asylum context are desirable. In three experiments with general population samples (N = 986), we adapted a paradoxical thinking intervention to the intergroup context of Germans and refugees, thus testing its effectiveness in an early stage of conflict. Participants in the paradoxical condition, compared to two control conditions, showed lower levels of conflict-related concerns (Experiment 1), higher levels of openness to alternative information (Experiment 1, 3) and higher willingness to compromise (Experiment 2). In addition, the intervention was still successful when the sender of the paradoxical questions belonged to a political outgroup (Experiment 3). A mini-meta-analysis corroborated significant effects across experiments (for openness and willingness to compromise). Ideas for future research and the intervention's practical use are discussed (e.g., in social media). © 2022 The Authors. European Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - I describe “spiritual” addiction as a felt compulsion to seek surrogates in the absence of that spirit of unconditional love underlying core personality change. We awaken to a “real” world akin to a prison in which all sides seem morally compromised, so any choice seems to necessitate sacrificing our conscientious relationship to the truth. Thus, spiritual addiction runs deeper than physical and psychological addictions to include socially accepted “addictions” to all we associate with “success”—including our morality and religion. All that we seek may be grounded in a collectively imbibed prejudice toward truth itself. If so, such a prejudice, underlying spiritual addiction, compromises our will, reason, feelings, actions, and character—including all of our relationships. It underlies the reality of a collective moral crisis which, we show, is more deeply a religious crisis tempting us to doubt the reality and attainability of that unconditional love that provides a foundation for hope. To overcome the prejudice underlying spiritual addiction, we show how unconditional love can be realized by placing conscientiousness in the foreground of concern as we are guided by the most reliable moral and spiritual witnesses in our history distinct from any religious group claiming to speak in their name. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Assessing student mathematical knowledge is an important factor in the mathematics learning process because students obtain important feedback to improve their knowledge and learning. Despite the importance of student assessment, several researchers have shown that student grades comprise noncognitive and metacognitive factors and teachers' prejudices and beliefs. One method to obtain a more objective view of student mathematical knowledge is through standardized assessments. In this paper, we analyze two methods of assessing student mathematical knowledge by considering their written and oral grades and achievements on the Italian National Assessment of Knowledge (INVALSI). The final grade was produced using the fuzzy logic inference system. It was tested on a sample of 2279 Grade 13 Italian high school students, who had both an oral and written grade in mathematics and who took the INVALSI assessment in the school year 2020–2021. Both tested fuzzy-logic-based assessment methods lowered the mean grades. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This research focuses on community development and ways in which community members can express their opinions and maintain well-being. However, in many contexts, these voices have been enfeebled through top-down approaches, lack of a concrete scenario, and attention to community problems, all of which are frequently associated with prejudices based on social status, education, or gender. For the first time within an urban context, the Ban Bu/Wat Suwannaram community in Bangkok, Thailand, has been given the opportunity to voice their opinions about the community, the direction it should take, and the overall improvement to be made, without the constriction of external authorities. This study applies design thinking, which despite being one of the major trends in business over the last couple of decades, is not generally used to address social issues. Since design thinking requires data collection and the creation of a model/prototype, two complementary procedures are employed. Firstly, the community is studied through observation and interviews, which helped creating a SWOT analysis to identify its potential and facilitate an informal discussion with members of the local community on the situation before urbanisation loosened community ties. After this initial stage, a prototype for various areas of community development is discussed in a community workshop to enable participants to offer their opinions on how the community could develop further. The results reveal the aspirations of the local community towards improving social and environmental issues. © 2022 by the authors.Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The term political extremism is commonly used to refer to political attitudes considered to be outside the ideological mainstream. This study leverages computational content analysis of big data to longitudinally examine (1970–2019) the prevalence of terms denoting far-right and far-left political extremism in more than 30 million written news and opinion articles from 54 news media outlets popular in the United States and the United Kingdom. We find that the usage of terms denoting right and left political extremism has been increasing across news media outlets in both countries. This trend is particularly stark for far-right-denoting terms, which have been growing in prevalence since at least 2008. Most U.S. and U.K. news media outlets tend to use far-right-denoting terms substantially more often than they use far-left-denoting terms. The rising prevalence in news media of terms denoting political extremism is strongly correlated with similar growing usage of terms denoting prejudice and social justice discourse. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing diversity and the anticipation of its resulting cultural change is raising vociferous protestations among White Americans. Here, we explore moderation and mediation of its intergroup implications. Among a nationally representative sample of White Americans, Study 1 (n = 2,257) revealed that living in a region that experienced a greater (vs. lesser) increase in racial diversity in recent years was associated with more anti-immigrant attitudes, but only among those who were highly White-identified. In an experiment, Study 2 (n = 420, White Americans) revealed that collective nostalgia (i.e., longing for the ingroup’s past) mediated the relation between anticipated cultural change resulting from shifting demographics and anti-immigrant attitudes, but only for those who were highly White-identified. Thus, anti-immigrant sentiment among White Americans in response to changing demographics and culture is seen primarily among those personally invested in their White racial identity, an effect partly explained by a longing for bygone days. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Scholarship, including seminal research on prejudice, identifies adolescence as a critical period for the development of attitudes. Yet most sociological research on prejudice, especially in the form of anti-immigrant sentiment, focuses on the relationship between contemporaneous social conditions and attitudes towards out-groups while neglecting the demographic context during one's impressionable years. Therefore, we design research to investigate the relationship among temporally distal and temporally proximal sub-national contexts and native-born attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. To do this, we merge geocoded data from the General Social Survey (1994-2016) with a unique US state-level dataset (1900-2015). Results from multilevel models reveal that immigrant presence during adolescence is a more consistent predictor of attitudes towards immigration and immigrants in adulthood. Thus, while the majority of sociological research on anti-immigrant sentiment asks if societal conditions matter, our results suggest that a more important question is when the context matters. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Individuals who subscribe to a color-blind racial ideology may not be aware of differences or differential treatment based on race which may be related to racial inequality in the delivery of oral health care. The purpose of this study was to determine color-blind racial attitudes in a convenience sample of clinical dental hygienists.Methods: A convenience sample of practicing dental hygienists recruited through social media via snowball sampling was invited to participate in this cross-sectional survey study. The Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS), a valid and reliable measuring instrument, was used to determine unawareness of racial attitudes and stereotyping. Three subscales (Racial Privilege, Institutional Discrimination, and Blatant Racial Issues) were measured by the survey. Descriptive statistics and separate one-way between-subjects ANOVA were used to analyze the data.Results: Two-hundred and thirty-three (n = 233) dental hygienists in clinical practice completed the survey. ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in overall CoBRAS scores when comparing age groups and ethnicities. Participants aged 18-29 had significantly lower overall CoBRAS scores compared to participants aged 60 and over (x = 49.41, x = 59.17, respectively; p = .019). African American participants scored significantly lower on overall CoBRAS scores compared only to those in the Other ethnicity category (x = 42.27, x = 62.08, respectively; p = .029).Conclusion: Participants possessed moderate levels of color-blindness, suggesting unawareness of racism and a need to understand the implications of racism as a means of promoting equity and improve oral health care delivery. Findings emphasize a need for more research examining color-blind ideology and how it affects oral health care delivery to diverse patient populations.

AB  - Background: The new reality of cybersuicide raises challenges to ideologies about the traditional form of suicide that does not involve the internet (offline suicide), which may lead to changes in audience’s attitudes. However, knowledge on whether stigmatizing attitudes differ between cybersuicides and offline suicides remains limited. Objective: This study aims to consider livestreamed suicide as a typical representative of cybersuicide and use social media data (Sina Weibo) to investigate the differences in stigmatizing attitudes across cybersuicides and offline suicides in terms of attitude types and linguistic characteristics. Methods: A total of 4393 cybersuicide-related and 2843 offline suicide-related Weibo posts were collected and analyzed. First, human coders were recruited and trained to perform a content analysis on the collected posts to determine whether each of them reflected stigma. Second, a text analysis tool was used to automatically extract a number of psycholinguistic features from each post. Subsequently, based on the selected features, a series of classification models were constructed for different purposes: differentiating the general stigma of cybersuicide from that of offline suicide and differentiating the negative stereotypes of cybersuicide from that of offline suicide. Results: In terms of attitude types, cybersuicide was observed to carry more stigma than offline suicide (χ21=179.8; P&lt;.001). Between cybersuicides and offline suicides, there were significant differences in the proportion of posts associated with five different negative stereotypes, including stupid and shallow (χ21=28.9; P&lt;.001), false representation (χ21=144.4; P&lt;.001), weak and pathetic (χ21=20.4; P&lt;.001), glorified and normalized (χ21=177.6; P&lt;.001), and immoral (χ21=11.8; P=.001). Similar results were also found for different genders and regions. In terms of linguistic characteristics, the F-measure values of the classification models ranged from 0.81 to 0.85. Conclusions: The way people perceive cybersuicide differs from how they perceive offline suicide. The results of this study have implications for reducing the stigma against suicide. © Ang Li, Dongdong Jiao, Tingshao Zhu.

AB  - In Homo Ludens Johan Huizinga defined play as a free activity outside "ordinary"life, viewed as "not serious", "connected with no material interest"or possible "profit", "proceed[ing] within its own proper boundaries"by "fixed rules", and fostering groups shrouded in "secrecy stress[ing]"their separateness "by disguise or other means"(1949: 13). He audaciously argued that human culture originated in play and to some extent remains play. His analysis illuminates how Dickinson approached aspects of culture like language, religion, war, law, politics, love, education, and art. Nourished by affluent gentry privileges and prejudices, Dickinson's detached playfulness strikes some as socially irresponsible. Does defending her seriousness validate Huizinga's claim that "solitary play is productive of culture only in a limited degree"(1949: 47), or should we challenge Huizinga here? Did her privately circulated works have any impact on culture, and if so, how? Strategies of withdrawal, inconclusiveness, and depersonalization ultimately turned her playful poetry into high culture. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The past few years have witnessed the development of prejudiced attitudes in some places in Europe. Biases alike are often considered a consequence of increased migratory movements to the continent and have also been connected to a more general crisis of the European Union political project. However, societies have diversely responded to migration even in countries presenting similar economic performances and immigrant inflows. Akin different reactions have raised some important questions: is prejudice connected to a broader European crisis and what does the latter consist of? This article responds to these research questions through a multilevel analysis of 24 European countries, and shows that the percentages of migrant population alone are not associated to anti-migrant sentiments. Such a situation has instead been the case only in those countries that have concurrently experienced cuts to the two key public sectors of education and health care, which constituted the pillars of the European Welfare State and one of the cores of the European Union’s political project. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Fusing social psychological theory on the BIAS map and attributions with cross-cultural theory on organizational tightness–looseness, we examine the interactive effects of active/passive facilitation/harm by organizational members and perceptions of organizational tightness on employee job attitudes. Study hypotheses were tested using a sample of bank employees located across 26 branches of a large bank in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (N = 324). Using a norm–behavior alignment perspective, we hypothesized that (supportive) active facilitation behaviors would be more strongly related to employee attitudes in tight versus loose perceived organizational cultures, whereas (negative) passive facilitation, active harm, and passive harm behaviors would be less strongly related to employee attitudes in tight versus loose perceived organizational cultures. Results provided overall support for these expectations. The present findings have implications for the mitigation of the effects of unfair discrimination on employee attitudes in organizational contexts, theorized associations between cultural T–L and unfair discrimination, and the generalizability of cultural T–L theory to developing country contexts that are typified by collectivistic and tight societal cultures. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - To determine whether children will exclude or punish a peer who creates an unfair advantage in an intergroup team context, four- to ten-year-old participants (N = 120, Mage = 6.87) were assigned a team membership and evaluated unintentional and intentional unfair advantages created by a character. Children were more likely to endorse punishment and exclusion responses when reasoning about an opponent than a teammate. This difference between groups was not observed when in-group and out-group members reasoned about punishing a character who intentionally created an unfair advantage. Older children were less likely to endorse exclusion than younger participants. Further, older children and in-group members utilized punishment more frequently than exclusion. Taken together this demonstrates that the group identity and the age of the child influences the ways in which children endorse responses to transgressions. These findings increase our understanding regarding children's conceptions of fairness responses to transgressions in intergroup contexts. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, I suggest that one of the ways in which problems of exclusion from deliberation and uptake within deliberation can be ameliorated is to develop a more robust account of the deliberative virtues that socially privileged speakers/hearers ought to cultivate. Specifically, privileged speakers/hearers ought to cultivate the virtue of actively facilitating equitable and inclusive deliberative exchanges (which includes a cluster of virtues, including the practice of silence and of listening) and the deliberative virtue of training their ‘testimonial sensibility’ to correct for prejudicial judgments about other speakers. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background and Objectives: In gerontological research and practice, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) older people and how their experiences differ from their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. However, LGBTQ older adults themselves are not a homogenous group. Moreover, as the immigrant populations in industrialized nations age, the number of LGBTQ older adults from ethnic minority backgrounds will only grow. This systematic review hence investigates the experiences of LGBTQ ethnic minority older adults. Research Design and Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we conducted a systematic search in 5 databases for English peer-reviewed studies. The retrieved articles were coded and analyzed inductively using an intersectional framework to tease out the varying influences of ethnicity, age, gender, and sexual identity on the LGBTQ ethnic minority older adults' experiences. Results: A total of 30 articles across 21 studies (13 qualitative, 7 quantitative, and 1 mixed-methods) were identified. Six key themes emerged from the studies: stigma and discrimination; isolation, support and belonging; interactions with services and institutions; self-acceptance, resilience, and agency; mental health and well-being; and uncertain futures. Discussion and Implications: The experiences of LGBTQ ethnic minority older adults echo those of LGBTQ ethnic majority older adults when they are shaped by gender and sexual identity factors. Nevertheless, significant differences in experiences - both positive and negative - emerge when cultural and ethnicity-related factors come to the fore. These findings emphasize the need for intersectional aging policies and services that go beyond catering for LGBTQ older adults to include the diversity within this subpopulation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to carry out a critical analysis on Corporate Social Responsibility projects developed by Brazilian companies considering the perceptions of experienced professionals. Brazil is an emerging economy and this study can contribute to improving projects of Corporate Social Responsibility developed by companies in emerging countries. Using this information, a SWOT matrix was structured. The research strategies used were bibliographic research (to establish the theoretical foundation) and semi-structured interviews with 18 experienced professionals on Corporate Social Responsibility projects. Data analysis was performed using a content analysis approach and the findings were used to structure the SWOT matrix. Despite some “Strengths” practices mentioned by professionals, many “Weaknesses” were highlighted regarding Corporate Social Responsibility projects developed by Brazilian companies and they may be improved to obtain better results. Interesting “Opportunities” were mentioned, for example, new business possibilities when companies are recognized as socially responsible. Return of branding and marketing due to sustainable positioning of companies are other possible opportunities to be explored. Finally, related to “Threats”, professionals mentioned aspects that may lead to devaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility practices in the Brazilian context, such as prejudices and political polarization. Despite the exploratory nature of the study, the information presented here can greatly contribute to the expansion of debates on Corporate Social Responsibility practices developed by Brazilian companies. It may be used to address public policies and motivate future studies aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Researchers can use the findings presented here as a starting point to develop studies on Corporate Social Responsibility issues. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - This article critically examines the argument that language testing for citizenship is necessary in order to ensure that naturalized citizens have sufficient language proficiency to participate in democratic life. First, we contend that as they are currently designed, language tests are normally unsuitable to assess the ability of would-be citizens to participate in the complex linguistic interactions that characterize democratic life. We further claim that if language tests were redesigned in order to meet this challenge, this would unjustly exclude (or exacerbate the exclusion of) many categories of migrants from citizenship, especially humanitarian entrants and adults with low-level literacy skills. Finally, we argue that language tests and language skills may be unnecessary for political participation, if institutions and social norms are in place which enable speakers of different languages to participate in political life effectively and without fear of prejudice. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper, I explain the kinematics of non-ideal metalinguistic disagreement. This occurs when one speaker has greater control in the joint activity of pairing contents with words in a context. I argue that some forms of non-ideal metalinguistic disagreement are deeply worrying, namely those that involves certain power imbalances. In such cases, a speaker possesses illegitimate control in metalinguistic disagreement owing to the operation of identity prejudice. I call this metalinguistic injustice. The wrong involves restricting a speaker from participating in the processes that determine the epistemic/linguistic resources of a conversation, and/or undermining a speaker's ability to affect metalinguistic outcomes. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - A prevailing theme in White nationalist rhetoric is nostalgia for a time when Whites dominated American culture and had unchallenged status. The present research examines a form of collective nostalgia called racial nostalgia and its association with negative intergroup attitudes and extreme ideologies (White nationalism). In Studies 1 and 2, racial nostalgia was associated with higher racial identity, anti-immigrant attitudes, and White nationalism. Study 2 revealed that racial nostalgia was related to extreme ideologies, in part, through perceptions that immigrants and racial minorities posed realistic/symbolic threats. Study 3 manipulated nostalgia using a writing prompt (“America’s racial past” vs. “games of America’s past”) and an identity prime (prime vs. no prime). Racial nostalgia was higher in the racial prompt versus the games prompt condition, regardless of identity prime. Furthermore, there were significant indirect effects of the nostalgia manipulation on support for anti-immigrant policies and endorsement of White nationalism through increased racial nostalgia and its association with perceived threats. These findings show that racial nostalgia can be a maladaptive form of collective nostalgia linked to a sense of loss and threat, and can make people sympathetic to extreme racial ideologies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Anti-immigrant attitudes are associated with many social problems and reduction of negative attitudes toward immigrants is one of many actions which can assist in preventing these problems, promote better relations within society, and subsequently, create a better quality of life. School is one of the environments that provide opportunity to reduce anti-immigrant attitudes by implementing curriculums that require teachers to encourage discussions on the issue of immigrants and immigration. Previous research has shown that political discussions have positive effect on development of anti-immigrant attitudes. However, there has been little research on classroom political discussions. Using Czech High School Survey panel data (N = 902; 53 classrooms) that include information from adolescents and their civics teachers, this study examines the role of classroom political discussions on the development of adolescents’ anti-immigrant attitudes. The results show that adolescents experiencing classroom political discussions more often have lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes than adolescents that are exposed to discussions less frequently. Furthermore, adolescents from classrooms that discussed immigration during their civics classes also report less negative anti-immigrant attitudes. Additionally, moderation analyses reveal that more frequent political discussions reduce anti-immigrant attitudes for those who experienced on average longer political discussions and those that discussed immigration during their civics classes. These findings support the argument for enforcing school discussions on various political topics because as results of this article suggest, classroom discussions have positive impact on how adolescents view immigrants if discussed frequently and thoroughly and may in turn reduce the negative consequences associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. © 2021 The Author.

AB  - “Be careful what you wish for”: This adage guides both how this project came to life, and how the topic covered in this review continues to unfold. What began as talks between two friends on shared interests in military history led to a 4-year discussion about how our science curriculum does little to introduce our students to societal and ethical impacts of the science they are taught. What emerged was a curricular idea centered on how “good intentions” of some were developed and twisted by others to result in disastrous consequences of state-sanctioned eugenics. In this article, we take the reader (as we did our students) through the long and soiled history of eugenic thought, from its genesis to the present. Though our focus is on European and American eugenics, we will show how the interfaces and interactions between science and society have evolved over time but have remained ever constant. Four critical 'case studies' will also be employed here for deep, thoughtful exploration on a particular eugenic issue. The goal of the review, as it is with our course, is not to paint humanity with a single evil brush. Instead, our ambition is to introduce our students/readers to the potential for harm through the misapplication and misappropriation of science and scientific technology, and to provide them with the tools to ask the appropriate questions of their scientists, physicians, and politicians. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy.

AB  - Exposure to role models has been recommended as a way to attract and retain students in Information Systems (IS) programs. One way to accomplish this exposure in IS classrooms is with career panels of alumni professionals who offer a realistic perspective of various IS-related roles and can frankly answer questions from students. For this study, we developed a comprehensive survey instrument based on published literature in order to examine the perceptions and attitudes of business students pre- and post- exposure to career panels and to validate that career panels indeed positively influence student perceptions and attitudes about IS. Female role models have also been espoused as a way to mitigate negative stereotypes, such as the IS field being a masculine domain or that a desirable work-life balance is difficult to achieve. Our experimental design varied the gender mix of professionals between all-male, all-female, and mixed panels. We found that perceptions affect attitudes, and attitudes, in turn, influence intention to study IS. We also found that these role models positively influence perceptions of IS and that mixed panels influence perceptions more than all-female and all-male panels. In addition, we found that female students do not respond differently than male students to all-female panels. © 2021 Decision Sciences Institute.

AB  - This questionnaire-based observational study was conducted in July 2020 with the aim of understanding the ethical and social issues faced by health care providers (HCPs) registered with the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine in intensive care units (ICUs) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. There were 200 questionnaire respondents, and we analyzed the responses of 189 members who had been involved in COVID-19 treatment in ICUs. The ethical and social issues that HCPs recognized during the pandemic were difficulties in the decision-making process with patients’ families, limitations of life-sustaining treatment, lack of palliative care, and inadequate mental support for patients’ families and HCPs. Regarding decision-making on issues of clinical ethics during the pandemic, more than half of the respondents thought they had failed to provide sufficient palliative care to patients and responded that they experienced moral distress. The free-text responses on moral distress revealed issues such as unusual treatment and care, restricted visits, challenging situations for HCPs, and psychological burden. Additionally, 38.1% of respondents experienced episodes of social prejudice or discrimination and 4.7% experienced a shortage of medical resources. Our study result shows that the moral distress of HCPs was caused by difficulties in patient-centered decision-making and insufficient medical care to patients and their families. These were caused mainly by a lack of communication due to the stronger implementation of infection control measures. We believe that it is important to address ethical and social issues during a pandemic in order to provide appropriate medical care and prevent burnout among HCPs. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Two studies examined whether men’s perception of the declining value of traditional masculinity activates social status, realistic, and symbolic threat, and in turn motivates opposition to feminist social movements. In Study 1, men’s perception that their ingroup is losing value across several social spheres was associated with social status and realistic threat, both of which were associated with opposition to feminist movements. Study 2, an experiment, presented men with public opinion data showing a 30-year decline in the degree to which Americans value traditional masculinity or no decline. Information about the declining value of masculinity activated status threat, which motivated less support for feminist movements. Among men who highly identified as masculine, this same information reduced support for feminist movements through symbolic threat. In sum, perceived decline in the social value of traditional masculinity creates status anxiety about the ingroup’s future and motivates compensatory reactions against gender equality. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In recent years, several high-profile individuals were sanctioned (e.g., fired) when photos of them dressed in blackface surfaced. Yet, every weekend during sports seasons, fans dress in redface to support teams with Native mascots. Given the observed discrepancy, five studies examined whether and why the perceived acceptability of these two racialized representations differs. Across varying methods and designs, we found that redface was perceived as more acceptable than blackface. The differential acceptability was explained by the extent to which people believe that Native (vs. Black) Peoples: 1) largely do not exist within contemporary social contexts (i.e., social erasure) and 2) experience less racism. The results suggest that eliminating racialized representations requires understanding the role that sociocultural factors play in sustaining discrimination and prejudice. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this short article, we provide an update and extension of Thomas C. Wilson’s study, “Whites’ Opposition to Affirmative Action: Rejection of Group-based Preferences as well as Rejection of Blacks.” Wilson drew on data from the 1996 General Social Survey (GSS) to revisit a long-standing debate in the racial attitudes literature concerning whether anti-black prejudice (e.g., “new racism”) or ostensibly race-neutral opposition to group-based policies generally (i.e., “principled objections”) is the primary determinant of whites’ opposition to affirmative action in the form of “preferential hiring and promotion for blacks.” We analyze data from the 2000–2018 GSS to replicate and extend key aspects of Wilson’s work. As in the prior study, we find mixed support for the new racism and principled objections perspectives, providing an important update on white Americans’ beliefs about affirmative action for the twenty-first century. © The Southern Sociological Society 2021.

AB  - It is often assumed that, in Western societies, Christian values are embedded in national identities, yet, the association between religious identities and prejudice has seldom been studied in parallel to national identity. According to both the social identity theory approach and integrated threat theory, group identification is important for perceiving threats and expressing corresponding attitudes. Nevertheless, their independent roles on intergroup outcomes have often been ignored, although they are two of the most salient and important identities when considering support for religious minority rights. We address this gap in research by looking at the associations of religious identity with support for religious minority rights in general and Muslims in particular in parallel to national identity through diversity threat. This study was conducted among the members of majority groups in four Western countries: Australia, Finland, Germany, and Norway (N = 1,532), all of which are characterised as traditionally Christian. We found that a higher religious identification was associated with greater support for religious minority rights in general and for those of Muslims in particular, while national identification had no direct association with support for either groups’ religious rights. However, both group identifications were also associated with heightened perceived diversity threat, which in turn, predicted reluctance to support religious minority rights. This demonstrates the dual role that religious identities may play in intergroup relations. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Three experiments test whether considering a stereotypically lower status group’s social gains leads White Americans to expect political solidarity among stereotypically higher status groups. Information about Hispanic population growth (vs. current demographics) led White Americans to expect relative losses to both White and Asian Americans’ statuses (Study 1). Making growing Hispanic political power (vs. control information) salient led Whites to report that Asian Americans and White Americans would support one another’s policy positions more (Studies 2 and 3). Importantly, presenting information that Asian Americans oppose (vs. support) the racial status quo reduced Whites’ perceptions of a White–Asian status-based coalition in response to growing Hispanic power (Study 3), suggesting that disrupting beliefs that Asian Americans will maintain the racial hierarchy reduces expectations of a White–Asian coalition in response to Hispanic growth. This work highlights the utility of moving beyond dyadic conceptualizations of intergroup relations to understand how one group’s gains can shift coalitional expectations in diverse social hierarchies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: The attitudes of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccines ensure that health services are able to run without interruption and potentially have a role in the messaging about vaccination that they convey to the public. Hence, healthcare workers’ attitudes ultimately have a significant role in controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: The study used the phenomenological approach. The sample consisted of 36 healthcare workers who were employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online using focus group interviews. A total of four focus group interviews were conducted. Findings: Following analysis of the data, the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey toward the COVID-19 vaccine were divided into three themes: “influencing factors,” “priority group” and “trust.”. Conclusions: Vaccination was found to create negative emotions among some of the healthcare workers. Their opinions about the COVID-19 vaccines were affected by the negative emotions and burnout they experienced during the pandemic. In addition, they saw the vaccination process as impacted by contraindications and uncertainty about the duration of the protection, the balance of the benefits and harm of the vaccines, and by vaccine myths and prejudices about the country where the vaccine was developed. Healthcare professionals expressed the need for trust to be established in the whole vaccination process. They suggested that different vaccine options should be offered, that the appointment and process notification system for vaccination should be improved, that evidence-based information about vaccines should be provided and that a safe environment should be created. Practice Implications: Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by careful attention to the application of vaccination programs, correct and effective use of social media, transparent, and precise management of political processes, and the provision of evidence-based information about the vaccines. © 2021 NANDA International, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Stigmatization toward chronic digestive diseases is well documented. Patients perceive others hold negative stereotypes toward their disease and may internalize these beliefs as true. Because of this, stigmatization is associated with poor outcomes across disease-related and psychosocial domains. No study to date evaluates stigmatization toward patients living with gastroparesis (GP), a poorly understood disease affecting gastric motility. We aimed to gain deep understanding of stigma in patients living with gastroparesis. Methods: Patients with GP were recruited from two university-based gastroenterology practices as well as patient advocacy support groups. Participants underwent a semi-structured qualitative interview about their experiences with stigma related to their GP diagnosis, which were audio-recorded and transcribed to text for analysis using a grounded theory approach. Major themes with representative quotations were documented. Results: Twenty-three patients participated. The majority were White, female, with idiopathic GP under the care of a gastroenterologist. All patients reported stigma related to GP. Seven major themes were found: stigma from healthcare providers, stigma within interpersonal relationships, GP as an invisible disease, blame, unsolicited suggestions on how to manage disease, disclosure, and stigma resistance. Conclusions: This is the first study to describe stigma experiences in patients with GP. The results suggest patients experience considerable stigmatization toward their condition from multiple sources. Patients also demonstrated resistance to negative beliefs, which can serve as a protective factor for the negative effects of disease stigma. Clinicians should be aware of stigma in GP patients, including their own potential internal biases and behaviors. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Implicit bias, unconscious beliefs based upon stereotypes and prejudices, has emerged as a useful way to understand and explain issues of discrimination, particularly involving race. The influence of implicit bias has been explored in various academic disciplines and numerous contexts, including education. Despite the burgeoning research literature, there is limited research on the role implicit bias plays within the classroom. The goal of this special issue is to broaden and challenge the current thinking on teacher implicit bias and attitudes as well as their influence on students. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method was developed and validated in relevant concentration ranges for the simultaneous measurement of l-lysine (Lys, L) and its Nε- and Nα-methylated (M), Nε- and Nα-acetylated (Ac), Nε-carboxymethylated (CM) and Nε-carboxyethylated (CE) metabolites in human urine. Analyzed Lys metabolites were the post-translational modification (PTM) products Nε-mono-, di- and trimethyllsine, Nε-MML, Nε-DML, Nε-TML, respectively, Nα-ML, Nε-AcL, Nα-AcL, and its advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) Nε-CML, Nε-CM-[2,4,4-2H3]Lys (d3-CML), Nε-CEL and furosine. AGEs of arginine (Arg) and cysteine (Cys) were also analyzed. De novo synthesized trideutero-methyl esters (R-COOCD3) from unlabelled amino acids and derivatives were used as internal standards. Native urine samples (10 µL aliquots) were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Analytes were esterified using 2 M HCl in methanol (60 min, 80 °C) and subsequently amidated by pentafluoropropionic anhydride in ethyl acetate (30 min, 65 °C). The generated methyl ester-pentafluoropropionyl (Me-PFP) derivatives were reconstituted in borate buffer and extracted immediately with toluene. GC–MS analyses were performed by split-less injection of 1-µL aliquots, oven-programmed separation and negative-ion chemical ionization (NICI). Mass spectra were generated in the scan mode (range, m/z 50–1000). Quantification was performed in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode using a dwell time of 50 or 100 ms for each ion. The GC–MS method was suitable for the measurement of Lys and all of its metabolites, except for the quaternary ammonium cation Nε-TML. The Me-PFP derivatives of Lys, Arg and Cys and its metabolites eluted in the retention time window of 9 to 14 min. The derivatization of Nε-CML, d3-CML and Nε-CEL was accompanied by partial Nε-decarboxylation and formation of the Me-PFP Lys derivative. The lowest derivatization yield was observed for Nε-DML, indicating a major role of the Nε-DML group in Lys derivatization. The GC–MS method enables precise (relative standard deviation, RSD &lt; 20%) and accurate (bias, &lt; ± 20%) simultaneous measurement of 33 analytes in human urine in relevant concentration ranges. We used the method to measure the urinary excretion rates of Lys and its PTM metabolites and AGEs in healthy black (n = 39) and white (n = 41) boys of the Arterial Stiffness in Offspring Study (ASOS). No remarkable differences were found indicating no ethnic-related differences in PTM metabolites and AGEs except for Nε-monomethyllysine and S-(2-carboxymethylcysteine). © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The racial demographic shift occurring in many Western countries provides a unique context to study the reactions of a high-power group (White people) to the potential loss of their privileged position in society. Three experiments (N = 77, N = 302, N = 555) conducted in Canada, the US, and the UK showed that White people who are reminded about the ongoing demographic changes and who see race relations as a zero-sum game whereby any gains by minorities must come at the expense of the majority, experience stronger collective angst and, to a lesser extent, fear (but not anger). In turn, collective angst, but not the other negative group-based emotions, fuels their motivation to protect the existing intergroup hierarchy by withdrawing support for progressive social movements and increases anti-immigration sentiments. Downregulating the existential threat experienced by White majorities in the face of a racial demographic shift may be one way to reduce acrimonious behavioral intentions aimed at preserving their place in the social hierarchy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The study integrates social-psychological and educational research to examine the relations between preservice teachers’ race-related perceptions of Black students and the instructional approaches they endorse. Based on survey and race Implicit Association Test data from preservice teachers (N = 258; White = 82%) in the United States, we predicted that the association between motivation to be unprejudiced and motivation to appear unprejudiced would predict endorsement of culturally and motivationally supportive instructional practices via implicit and explicit biases about Black students. Path analyses revealed significant mediated associations among motivation to be unprejudiced and endorsed instructional approaches and practices via explicit bias, contingent on the motivation to appear unprejudiced. Furthermore, it is troubling to note that White preservice teachers, in contrast to their ethnic minority counterparts, displayed significant implicit preference for White over Black students. Implications of these findings for preparing a culturally responsive and motivational supportive teaching task-force are discussed. © 2021

AB  - Background: Many women internalize negative attitudes regarding body shape and size because of the societal standards for women’s ideal body shapes and sizes. Internalized weight stigma is related to poorer physical and psychological health. A growing body of research has documented the links between other forms of internalized stigma (e.g., HIV-stigma) and poor sleep quality; however, little research examines the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep or the mechanisms that explain this relationship. Internalized weight stigma may be associated with poor sleep through increases in psychological distress. This study hypothesized that the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep would be mediated by higher levels of depression and anxiety. Methods: About 257 women were recruited via social media, word of mouth, and an undergraduate participant pool. Participants completed an online survey assessing various aspects of weight stigma and health through self-report questionnaires. Most women were non-Hispanic White (86.8%) and had a mean age of 31.40. Results: The indirect effects of internalized weight stigma on poorer global sleep quality and daily disturbances through depression and anxiety were significant. In contrast, depressive symptoms but not anxiety explained the links between internalized weight stigma and perceived sleep quality and neither depressive symptoms nor anxiety explained the link between internalized weight stigma and sleep efficiency. Conclusions: Internalized weight stigma is linked to poorer sleep quality, and these links may be explained by psychological well-being. Understanding the mechanisms by which internalized weight stigma is associated with sleep quality can inform the psychological interventions employed. © 2021, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - Although projecting one’s own characteristics onto another person is pervasive, “counter-projection,” or seeing the opposite of oneself in others is also sometimes found, with implications for intergroup conflict. After a focused review of previous studies finding counter-projection (often unexpectedly), we map conditions for counter-projection to an individual out-group member. Counter-projection requires identified antagonistic groups, is moderated by in-group identity, and is moderated by which information is assessed in the target person. Using political groups defined by support for former U.S. President Trump, across our Initial Experiment (N = 725) and Confirmatory Experiment (N = 618), we found counter-projection to individual political out-group targets for moral beliefs, personality traits, and everyday likes (e.g., preference for dogs vs. cats). Counter-projection was increased by in-group identification and overlapped considerably with “oppositional” out-group stereotypes, but we also found counter-projection independent of out-group stereotypes (degree of overlap with stereotyping depended on the information being projected). © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This study investigated whether anti-immigrant sentiment leading up to the 2016 election increased risk of major depression among older U.S. immigrants. Drawing data from the Health and Retirement Study, we tested whether there was a disproportionate increase in major depression among U.S. immigrants than non-immigrants from 2014 to 2016 using a Difference in Difference approach. Older immigrants had a higher relative change in major depression from 2014 to 2016 than non-immigrants (RRR 1.35; 95% CI 1.06, 1.73). This relationship was driven by associations among those who are White (RRR 2.07; 95% CI 1.26, 3.41) or Hispanic (RRR 1.55; 95% CI 0.99, 2.40). Anti-immigrant sentiment leading up to the 2016 election was associated with an increase in major depression among older U.S. immigrants. Findings may help identify high-risk groups in future election years and inform treatment strategies for major depression that consider the influence of sociopolitical factors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the homophobia levels of parents of students who receive nursing education and the factors affecting their homophobia levels. Design and Methods: The study was carried out as a descriptive and cross-sectional study on the 375 parents of nursing students. Findings: There was statistically significant difference between the case when parents know that there is a homosexual individual in their immediate environment and the mean The Hudson and Ricketts Homophobia Scale (HRHS) score, as well as between the case when parents know that a friend of theirs is homosexual and the mean HRHS score (p < 0.05). Practice Implications: It should be taken into account that parents' prejudices against homosexuals may also affect the way their children view homosexuals. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Weight stigmatization is related to emotional and psychological distress including low self-esteem, body image dissatisfaction, depression, and anxiety; all linked with suboptimal breastfeeding outcomes. This qualitative descriptive study explored postpartum individuals’ recalled experiences of weight stigma during interactions with perinatal healthcare professionals and its perceived influence on their breastfeeding experiences. Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with (n= 18) participants. Three themes emerged: (1) “Size Doesn’t Matter: They Looked Beyond the Scale,” (2) “My Self-Confidence and Desire to Breastfeed is More Important than Weight,” and (3) “I Was on My Own”—Limited Social Support not Weight Stigma Influenced Breastfeeding. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In addition to recognizing a commemorative space and geography that serve to legitimize a particular racial identity, streetscapes in the U.S. named after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., (MLK) are also a stereotyped space that is presupposed as marginalized. The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether stereotyped MLK neighborhoods differ from the lived spaces. To achieve this objective, the paper relies on two indexes of segregation: namely dissimilarity and interaction indices, the racial composition, and the socioeconomic characteristics of MLK neighborhoods in the 48 contiguous states. Both dissimilarity and interaction indices implied higher segregation in the South and Midwest. The higher proportion of the African American population relative to Whites and other races in the MLK neighborhoods, except in California, confirms that the MLK streetscapes are racially concentrated spaces. Further, analysis of socioeconomic variables does resonate with the stereotype of MLK neighborhoods as marginalized spaces. To demystify the stereotype and to reconstruct the identity of African Americans and their lived and experienced spaces, this paper draws upon studies of the broader process of racialization, critical toponymy, and stereotype theories. Based on this exploratory approach, the paper concludes that though the characteristics of MLK neighborhoods reflect their marginalized status, this status is itself the result of a broader process of racialization. This process has distributed resources unequally among racial groups, forming and buttressing negative stereotypes about African Americans while also stigmatizing their living spaces, which are all too often susceptible to a policy of benign (or not-so-benign) neglect, property devaluation, and industrial pollution. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The recent focus on the controversial deaths of minorities at the hands of police officers has led to increased attention on racial bias among the law enforcement community. However, this focus does not extend to criminal justice students. Instead, research examining undergraduates’ racial attitudes focuses on the general student body. In addition to reviewing literature related to criminal justice students’ attitudes toward a variety of criminal justice and social issues, the current study used multiple regression analyses to examine racial and gender differences in a Southwestern University’s criminal justice students’ perceptions of and sensitivity to racism. Findings from the study indicate that male criminal justice students in the sample and White criminal justice students are more likely to have lower perceptions of racism than their female and non-White counterparts, respectively. Additionally, findings for criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism suggest that White male criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism only statistically significantly differs from non-White females with White males more likely to be less sensitive than non-White females. Furthermore, the current research provides a benchmark for research related to criminal justice students’ perceptions of racism and discriminatory practices and their attitudes toward minorities. Results, study implications, recommendations, and future research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The current study examined how ingroup and outgroup Theory of Mind (ToM) predicts children’s and adolescents’ reasoning for their acceptability judgments of intergroup bullying of Syrian refugee peers and group support of intergroup bullying. Participants included 587 Turkish middle (n = 372, Mage = 12.19, SD = 1.01; 208 girls) and high school (n = 215, Mage = 14.81, SD = 0.97; 142 girls) students. Participants read a bias-based bullying story with a Syrian refugee peer targeted by an ingroup Turkish peer. Then, participants rated the acceptability of bullying and group support of bullying and were presented with a reasoning question (Why?) after each acceptability question (bullying and group support of bullying). Reasoning codes included Fairness, Refugee Status/War, Prejudice and Discrimination, Harm, Prescriptive Norms, Group Functioning, and Relationship with the Bully. Participants’ ingroup and outgroup ToM abilities (measured using the Strange Stories) were evaluated as predictors of reasoning. Results documented that middle school students were more likely to attribute mental states to their ingroup members compared to outgroup members while high school students’ ToM performance did not differ across contexts. Further, the more unacceptable participants judged bullying to be, the more they reasoned about the bullying by referencing fairness, refugee status, discrimination, and harm. Results also documented that ingroup and outgroup ToM were positively related to attribution to fairness and participants’ usage of multiple reasoning judgments while only outgroup ToM was a significant predictor of reasoning around refugee status/war, discrimination, and prejudice. The findings provide implications for intervention programs that tackle intergroup bullying by examining bystanders’ social cognitive skills in a specific context.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is important for health. However, there is little evidence on how weight stigma, time spent on sedentary activities (including smartphone, social media, online learning), time spent on outdoor activity, and nomophobia associate with PA among Chinese individuals with consideration of gender. The present study examined the aforementioned associations in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Methods: University students (N = 3,135; 1,798 females, 1,337 males) with a mean age of 19.65 years (SD = 2.38) years completed an online survey from November to December, 2021. The online survey assessed weight stigma (using the Perceived Weight Stigma Scale and Weight Bias Internalization Scale), PA (using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form), time spent on different activities (using self-designed items for time on smartphone, outdoor activity, social media, and online learning), and nomophobia (using the Nomophobia Questionnaire). Parallel mediation models were constructed (dependent variable: PA; mediators: perceived weight stigma, weight-related self-stigma, time spent on smartphone, time spent on outdoor activity, time spent on social media, and time spent online learning; independent variable: nomophobia) and evaluated using Hayes' Process Macro Model 4 (IBM SPSS 20.0). Results: Weight-related self-stigma (β = −0.06; p = 0.03), time spent on outdoor activity (β = 0.21; p < 0.001), time spent on social media (β = 0.07; p = 0.02), time spent on online learning (β = 0.06; p = 0.03), and nomophobia (β = −0.07; p = 0.01) were all significant factors explaining the PA among female participants. Perceived weight stigma (β = −0.07; p = 0.01), time spent on outdoor activity (β = 0.27; p < 0.001), and time spent on online learning (β = 0.10; p = 0.002) were all significant factors explaining PA among male participants. Conclusion: Chinese healthcare providers should design programs on weight stigma reduction and outdoor activity improvement to enhance PA among university students.

AB  - Focusing on one of the most studied dimensions of Social Psychology, i.e., intergroup relations, this study analyzes its discursive accomplishment in a specific group-based intervention, i.e., the talk and work of an Italian group home, i.e., a small alternative care facility hosting a group of out-of-home children. Particularly, we focused on the fictionally called “Nuns’ Home,” a group home previously investigated for its ethnocentric bias, and its intergroup relations with “inside” and “outside” groups, such as schools, biological families, and social services. By combining a qualitative and quantitative approach in analyzing one audio-recorded ethnographic interview with the whole team of professionals, we aimed at accounting for the multitude of internal and external stakeholders that participants refer to, analyzing the discursive accomplishment of ingroup and outgroup in talk-in-interaction and investigating ingroup bias and group qualification. To do so, we detected social categorization markers and qualifying devices that participants rely on when referring to groups. Results show that, among the numerous groups recognized, participants co-construct intergroup relations and ingroup bias implying negative assessment over external groups. Being different from traditional laboratory studies illustrating substantial contraposition between ingroup and outgroup, our qualitative analysis reveals the multitude of groups by which the ingroup is formed and their internal fragmentation. To conclude, we discussed the implications of qualitatively studying intergroup relations in group homes and indicated future lines of research. Copyright © 2022 Saglietti and Marino.

AB  - As national and international health agencies rushed to respond to the global spread of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as COVID-19), one challenge these organizations faced was the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus. Troublingly, much of the misinformation was couched in racialized language, particularly regarding the source of the virus and responsibility for its spread, fostering the development of related conspiracy theories. Media coverage of these conspiracy theories, particularly early on in the pandemic, had negative impacts on individuals' engagement in protective behaviors and concern with the spread of COVID-19. From extant work, racial resentment and white identity have been shown to be deeply woven into the fabric of contemporary American politics, affecting perceptions of public opinion even after accounting for social and political identities. While racial attitudes have been less studied in relation to conspiracy theory belief, we expect racial resentment and white identity to affect compliance with public health behaviors and COVID-19 conspiracy theory belief. Using observational and experimental survey data (N = 1,045), quota-sampled through Lucid Theorem (LT) in the spring of 2020, we demonstrate that framing the virus in racialized language alters endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, contingent upon levels of racial resentment and white identity and find that higher levels of conspiracy theory belief decreased compliance with preventative measures.

AB  - Perspective-taking (PT) is an important ability to imagine the world from another’s point of view. Prior studies have shown that younger adults are more likely to consider the opinions of age-based in-group members relative to out-group members. However, the cause of this priority is still unknown. We conducted three independent studies to explore the effect of intergenerational contact on younger adults’ PT toward older adults and the possible roles of stereotyping and intergroup anxiety. A total of 192 college students completed the Perspective taking Scale in Study 1 after being primed with age-based intergroup relationships. The results indicated that younger adults found it more difficult to take the perspective of older adults than that of their peers. 200 college students completed the Prior Contact Scale, Intergroup Anxiety Scale, Negative Stereotype Scale, and PT Scale in Study 2. The results demonstrated that intergenerational contact improved PT toward older adults by disrupting negative stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety moderated this mediating relationship. A total of 215 college students completed the PT Scale in the context of imagining intergenerational contact in Study 3. Interestingly, imagined contact effectively increased younger adults’ ability to take older adults’ perspectives. The present research verifies that contact is important for influencing younger adults’ emotional (intergroup anxiety) and attitudinal (stereotyping) factors that are critical to improving younger adults’ ability to take older people’s perspectives. This is of great significance for developing harmonious intergenerational relationships. Copyright © 2022 Long, Jiang, Wang, Zhou and You.

AB  - The world’s population is currently aging, and the issue of ageism has become serious worldwide, including in Japan. Negative attitudes toward older adults can have undesirable effects on the mental and physical health of this group. We focused on the effects of contact experience with older adults and germ aversion, or the degree of aversion to infection, on negative attitudes toward older adults. Additionally, we included a moderating variable; youth identity, or the sense of belonging with younger rather than older age groups. An online survey was conducted with Japanese participants (N = 603). We conducted multiple regression analyses and the results showed that the interaction effect between youth identity and contact experience on negative attitudes toward older adults was significant. The findings suggest that contact experience may help in reducing negative attitudes toward older adults among people with low youth identity. The interaction effect between youth identity and germ aversion, however, was not significant. Academic research on the effects of some psychological interventions (e.g., intergenerational social exchange) should pay particular attention to the role of youth identity. Future directions for empirical studies are also discussed. Copyright © 2022 Shimizu, Hashimoto and Karasawa.

AB  - The studies presented here apply the concept of entitativity in order to understand how belonging to a particular geographical area – neighborhood - can determine the way others organize information and form impressions about area’s residents. In order to achieve this objective, three studies were carried out. The first study aims to verify if a neighborhood varies in terms of perceived entitativity, and identify the physical and social characteristics of the neighborhoods that are more strongly associated with the perception of entitativity. The Study 2 and 3 used an experimental paradigm to explore how people’s perceptions of neighborhoods’ entitativity influenced their impressions of residents. To activate stereotypes, Study 2 used the name of real neighborhoods, and Study 3 employed only a set of pictures of unknown neighborhoods. The results show that the neighborhoods vary significantly with the regard to the perception of entitativity, and a set of physical attributes of place were strongly related with entitativity. The results showed that, independent of stimuli, the neighborhoods perceived as highly entitative, the supposed residents were subject to more extreme and quicker trait judgments, supported by greater confidence on the part of perceivers. Study 3 also reported that in highly entitative neighborhoods, the perceivers transferred more traits from the group to individual members. These results provide strong evidence that physical structure of neighborhoods imply different entitatity judgments that influences the way in which residents are perceived.

AB  - Social media facilitates the sharing of ideas, thoughts and information about older people and later life through online networks and communities in contemporary society. Social media content about older people has become important for understanding media representations of older people, but it has not been sufficiently studied. Recent studies suggest that older people are predominantly represented as a disempowered, vulnerable and homogeneous group on social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Because local authorities in many countries have begun using Facebook to reach out to and interact with citizens, they are seen as a significant producer of media content about older people and later life. The purpose of this study is to examine the ways in which Swedish local authorities have visually portrayed older people in their use of Facebook compared with other age groups. This research performed a visual content analysis of 1,000 Facebook posts posted by 33 Swedish local authorities, employing ten analytical aspects to describe and interpret the signs, activities and contexts associated with older people and other age groups (infants, children, adolescents and adults). The study found that the representations of older people on the Facebook pages of local authorities appeared to be not very diverse; specifically, older people (including those in residential care homes) were mainly portrayed as remaining socially engaged and moderately physically capable. This media representation destabilised the prevalent negative stereotypes of older people as being out of touch and dependent; however, it collided with the reality of older individuals with care needs. Additionally, this study argues that older people are represented as inferior to the young in terms of physical and technological competence, based on the connotations of the signs. Given that local authorities have progressively incorporated social media into their daily work, it is expected that this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the ways in which local authorities produce (non-)stereotypical representations of older people on social media.

AB  - Stigma toward opioid addiction is a barrier to reversing the opioid epidemic. This study examined stigma, preferred consequences, and attributions of the cause(s) of addiction based on responses to a character portrayed as recently laid off and addicted to opioids. This study employed a 2 (race: Black vs. White) × 2 (status: janitor vs. computer scientist) × 2 (source of opioids: from a doctor vs. on the street) vignette between-subjects experimental design in an online survey. Equal numbers of political conservatives and liberals (n = 513) were recruited. The sample was mostly White with equal proportions of males and females. Stigma was measured with four scales and two items, and causal attributions and preferred consequences were each measured with three scales. Stigma was greater toward the janitor than the computer scientist and toward obtaining opioids on the street versus from a doctor. Respondent political conservatism predicted greater stigma including social distance (b =.29, p <.001). Bad character attributions predicted greater stigma including more negative feelings (b =.23, p <.001). Attributing addiction to being laid off predicted less stigma such as negative stereotypes (b = −.11, p <.001) and support for economic relief (b =.24, p <.001), whereas attributing it to biology predicted negative stereotypes (b =.07, p <.001). Political conservatism and attributing addiction to bad character predict stigma and unwillingness to help people with opioid addiction, whereas attributing it to being laid off and struggling financially predicts the opposite. © 2022.

AB  - The following article inquires how introducing the gender category, feminism theories, and intersectionality into social sciences education, especially regarding historical thinking development, could be key for the construction of a more critical and egalitarian future. The main research problem is knowing how the use of the gender category is included, or not, in the development of historical thinking in pre-service teacher beliefs and how it could condition them when they work on historical and social problems in the classroom. The main objective is to analyze the historical thinking development in pre-service Spanish teacher students and their capacity for constructing critical discourses with a gender perspective. Pre-service teachers of five Spanish universities (of the Primary and Secondary Education Degree) were asked about a report from a digital newspaper version that forces them to use historical thinking and to consider gender stereotypes and prejudices. Their responses were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that pre-service teachers are not able to identify their own gender roles and prejudiced attitudes when they attempt to explain a social problem and they propose solutions, even when they could verify that there was another manner to understand this report. Hence, this research highlights the relevance of implementing feminism, intersectionality, and gender category for historical thinking development since these future teachers need to work around democratic culture competences. By contrast, not including this perspective will lead to them still maintaining historical thinking and democracy configured on hegemonic, heteropatriarchal, sexist, and Eurocentric cultural models.

AB  - The present research investigated the effects of a diversity training intervention on robot-related attitudes to test whether this could help to manage the diversity inherent in hybrid human-robot teams in the work context. Previous research in the human-human context has shown that stereotypes and prejudice, i.e., negative attitudes, may impair productivity and job satisfaction in teams high in diversity (e.g., regarding age, gender, or ethnicity). Relatedly, in hybrid human-robot teams, robots likely represent an “outgroup” to their human co-workers. The latter may have stereotypes towards robots and may hold negative attitudes towards them. Both aspects might have detrimental effects on subjective and objective performance in human-robot interactions (HRI). In an experiment, we tested the effect of an economic and easy to apply diversity training intervention for use in the work context: The so-called enlightenment approach. This approach utilizes perspective-taking to reduce prejudice and discrimination in human-human contexts. We adapted this intervention to the HRI context and explored its impact on participants’ implicit and explicit robot-related attitudes. However, contrary to our predictions, taking the perspective of a robot resulted in more negative robot-related attitudes, whereas actively suppressing stereotypes about social robots and their characteristics produced positive effects on robot attitudes. Therefore, we recommend considering potential pre-existing aversions against taking the perspective of a robot when designing interventions to improve human-robot collaboration at the workplace. Instead, it might be useful to provide information about existing stereotypes and their consequences, thereby making people aware of their potential biases against social robots.

AB  - Purpose: In Australia, as in many other countries, refugees are over-represented in the ranks of the unemployed, under-employed and precariously employed and often become frustrated in their attempts to secure work. Despite the construction industry being a major potential source of employment for refugees, there has been a surprising lack of research into their experiences of securing work in the industry. Addressing this gap and also the general lack of voice for refugees in construction research, the aim of this paper is to explore the barriers refugees face in securing employment in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports a survey of refugees who have worked or attempted to seek work in the Australian construction industry. Findings: Results show that the main barriers to securing employment in construction are: lack of local work experience; employer discrimination; employer failure to recognise previous qualifications, skills and experience and employers not understanding the challenges they face. Government employment agencies and systems are also perceived to be of limited value and overly complex, in contrast to the activities of not-for-profit support agencies. Research limitations/implications: While the research is limited to Australia, the findings contribute an important and missing refugee dimension to the emerging body of research on construction social procurement. They also contribute unique sector-specific insights into the broader debate about refugee resettlement and employment. Further research is needed in other national contexts. Practical implications: Recommendations are made to address the barriers to employment identified including: initiatives to provide refugees with work experience in the industry; education to break-down negative stereotypes of refugees among employers; greater support for not-for-profits supporting refugees and reform of government and employment agency systems and procedures. Social implications: By enhancing understanding of the barriers to employment for refugees in construction and proposing solutions to reduce those barriers, this research contributes new insights into a growing global challenge of how we better integrate growing numbers of refugees into harmonious and prosperous societies. Originality/value: The findings are important in facilitating the smoother integration of refugees into society. Beyond the moral imperative, there are significant social, cultural and economic benefits which successful refugee integration brings to host countries and industries like construction which in many countries are now being required to employ refugees in their workforce as a condition of public sector contracts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The present research offers insights into the generational stereotypical beliefs that different generations of nurses hold about the own and the other generations and the implications on the work floor. Design/methodology/approach: This cross-sectional, exploratory study employs a cognitive mapping approach known as the repertory grid. The sample consisted of 15 Generation Y, 15 Generation X and 15 Baby Boomer nurses. Findings: Beliefs of nurses about their own and the other generations direct social categorization and generational stereotypes of the in-group and out groups. These stereotypes mold nurses' beliefs and attitudes towards their coworkers and are enacted leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. Especially Generation Y and Baby Boomer nurses are negatively stereotyped and have their ways to deal with these negative stereotypes. Practical implications: Nurses and their managers who hold generational stereotypes may unknowingly create cliques within an organization and adopt behaviors and expectations based on generational (self-) stereotypes. The author offers noteworthy insights for fostering intergenerational synergies amongst nurses, which are important since the level of interdependent relations amongst nurses required to provide care. Originality/value: The present study moves away from the research about the typical characteristics of nurses across the generational workforce. Instead, mental models about how different generations of nurses construe their coworkers belonging to different generations including their own generation are drawn. Employing the repertory grid technique (RGT), an established method for uncovering people's personal and collective belief systems, the present study shows how generational stereotyping and self-stereotyping among nurses belonging to varying generational cohorts occurs and debates its implications. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Eminent theorists of empathy, such as Robert Vischer, Edward Titchener, Theodor Lipps, Vernon Lee and WilhelmWorringer, inclined to relate visual stimulation to the empathic response. Dealing with the heartrending accounts experienced by the Indian social reformer B R Ambedkar as an untouchable in his childhood narrated in his autobiographical notes, Srividya Natarajan and Stephen Anand’s graphic novel Bhimayana delineates the difficulties of combating caste prejudice and bigotry endured by Ambedkar in particular and Dalits in India in general, with coeval accounts of the evil social custom of untouchability and marginalization. As vision is a prime empathic sense, it is a subtle and acute job on the part of the author to enable a reader to share feelings through the art and mechanism of narration which is known as “narrative empathy.” The present paper attempts to explore how through the subtle use of visual imagery and metaphors, and emotionally evocative narrative technique, Bhimayana recounts the comprehensive struggle against caste repression executed by home-grown scourges, and how it evokes cognitive and affective empathy in its readers, leading them to enhance their finer feelings through the unraveling of its visual language. © 2022 IUP.

AB  - The Brian Ho lawsuit in the 1990s, brought about by several school children of Chinese descent in the San Francisco United School District against the school district, state defendants, and the San Francisco NAACP, signified a shift in the understanding of education equality that spotlighted divergent views, motivations, and actions concerning race-conscious education policies among Chinese San Franciscans. This article examines the intra-community dynamics and conflicts in Chinese San Franciscans' pursuit of education rights and racial equality in the 1980s and 1990s by reconstructing their various claims to education equality. These divergent yet analogous struggles for equal educational opportunities reflected varied racial attitudes and conceptions of Chinese American racial identity. What these disparate racial perceptions and identity conceptions embodied fundamentally was a range of arguments for racial inclusion and equality. The contrast and contradictions between these distinct views persisted, reemerging in Chinese Americans' continued apprehension of their racial identity in the wake of the renewed debate about racebased education policies that was juxtaposed with the rising racial hatred toward Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 University of Illinois Press.

AB  - Why would heterosexual men downplay their compassion for masculine (vs. feminine) gay victims of hate crime? Two social identity-inspired explanations provide contrasting answers to this question. The reactive distinctiveness thesis (RD) assumes that heterosexual men would downplay their compassion more, when cued to a gay victim's masculinity than to their femininity, provided evaluative concerns are strong. In contrast, the feminization-threat thesis (FT) assumes that compassion downplays would be more visible when heterosexual men are cued to a gay victim's femininity (not to the victim's masculinity), provided evaluative concerns are strong too. Consistent with RD, three experiments (Ntotal = 1,475) revealed that heterosexual men who read news about (gay) victims at a hate crime scene downplayed their compassion to a greater degree when cued to the masculinity rather than to the femininity of such targets (Studies 1–3). Meanwhile FT's prediction received partial support when considering feminine (vs. masculine) heterosexual victims, rather than homosexual victims (Study 3). © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Although recent global developments suggest progress toward LGBT+ equality, institutional structures perpetuating differential treatment based on sexual orientation and gender identity persist. The present research employed a mixed-method campus climate study of LGBT+ and cis-heterosexual students sampled from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines and the UK. Phase 1 reports a large-scale survey assessing relationships among students’ social attitudes toward LGBT+, campus climate perceptions and experiences of harassment, well-being, academic persistence, and social identity belonging within the university (LGBT+ = 877; cis-heterosexual = 2107). Phase 2 reports focus groups and interviews with 35 LGBT+ students, further exploring their campus climate experiences. Triangulated results highlight the role of social identity belonging in creating positive LGBT+ campus climates.

AB  - Racial essentialism—the belief that socially constructed racial categories reflect “inherent” biological differences—exacerbates learners’ racial prejudice and diminishes their empathy. Essentialism hinders health professions education programs’ capacity to generate a health care work force that motivates ethics and equity in health care and research. This article suggests how health professions educators and institutions should reform pedagogy on race, when clinically relevant, to emphasize racism as the root cause of health inequity. Publishers of research also have key roles in reform and should enforce appropriate and just references to race in journals and health professions education content. © 2022 American Medical Association.

AB  - This study analyses the issues that refugees and asylum seekers face in Austria and the effects of their concentration in Vienna. We present an assessment of main difficulties and root causes for asylum seekers in Vienna. Data was collected via personal interviews and also supported by regional and European statistics. In total, 12 interviews with municipality representatives, NGOs, and migrants were conducted. Firstly, our study showed, that the asylum seekers face difficulties integrating into the Austrian labor market. Most refugee children do not have access to the compulsory education. It is argued that a more inclusive policy would improve the labor market efficiency in Austria. The anti-immigrant sentiment in Vienna played a crucial role in creating difficulties faced by migrants in the process of integration. Those who have been granted asylum in Vienna are not interested in moving to another country. This tendency is driven by the following factors: They consider Austria a safe country; they have already learned the language; they are overall satisfied. © 2022 Transnational Press London Ltd.

AB  - Poverty-related stressors have been found to impact parenting behaviors which can result in adverse outcomes for children. The current qualitative study focused on understanding the challenges of caregivers (N = 70) living in poverty. The sample was diverse and included mothers, fathers, and grandparents raising grandchildren. Stories of caregivers were gathered to improve the understanding of families living in poverty in an effort to work towards changing how our world supports families that are vulnerable. Results indicate that families experiencing poverty and related risk factors experience challenges in the realm of child safety, education, and racism/prejudice. Families also discussed ways to improve their environment which included increased financial resources, increased access to high-quality healthcare and childcare, and positive environmental change. Note that the current study outlines the complexity of parenting in poverty and that associated challenges are intertwined. Recommendations are made to address systemic barriers at the individual and community level in an effort to better support caregivers experiencing adversity and parenting in the 21st century. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This article investigates the local economic cost of hosting refugees. Using administrative data in France, we show that the opening of small housing centers for refugees decreases the economic activity in hosting municipalities. We demonstrate that this downturn is related to a decline in the population by around 2% due to fewer people moving to hosting municipalities. We show that this avoidance behavior of natives results from prejudices, and is unlikely to be driven by a labor market supply shock from the arrival of refugees. We also estimate the aggregate cost of hosting refugees. © 2021 The Author(s) (2021). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global human health threats, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, necessitate coordinated responses at multiple levels. Public health professionals and other experts broadly agree about actions needed to address such threats, but implementation of this advice is stymied by systemic factors such as prejudice, resource deficits, and high inequality. In these cases, crises like epidemics may be viewed as opportunities to spark structural changes that will improve future prevention efforts. However, crises can also weaken governance and reinforce systemic failures. In this paper, we use the concept of the governance treadmill to demonstrate cross-level dynamics that help or hinder the alignment of capacities toward prevention during public health crises. We find that variation in capacities and responses across local, national, and international levels contributes to the complex evolution of global and local health governance. Where capacities are misaligned, effective local prevention of global pandemic impacts tends to be elusive in the short term, and multiple cycles of crisis and response may be required before capacities align toward healthy governance. We demonstrate that this transition requires broader societal adaptation, particularly towards social justice and participatory democracy. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Positive cross-group contact with disadvantaged group members can reduce prejudice, and, under certain conditions, increase solidarity-based action intentions among advantaged group members. In the present work, we distinguish between positive contact (friendly, cooperative) versus politicized contact (where group-based injustice is discussed) as well as between benevolent helping offered to the disadvantaged group versus costly solidarity-based actions. We predict that positive contact is related to benevolent helping, whereas politicized contact is related to willingness to engage in costly solidarity-based activism. In two studies (N = 257, N = 329), results support these hypotheses: for nonmigrants in Germany and the United Kingdom, positive contact with migrants, mediated by empathy, positive emotions, and movement identification, was a better predictor of benevolent helping, whereas politicized contact with migrants, mediated by anger and/or movement identification was a better predictor of endorsement of costly solidarity-based activism. © 2022 Cises.

AB  - Participation in collective action is known to be driven by two appraisals of a social situation: Beliefs that the situation is unfair (injustice appraisal) and beliefs that a group can change the situation (collective efficacy appraisal). Anger has been repeatedly found to mediate the relationship between injustice appraisals and collective action. Recent work suggests that the emotion of being moved mediates the relationship between efficacy appraisals and collective action. Building on this prior work, the present research applies kama muta theory to further investigate the relationship between efficacy appraisals and collective action. Kama muta is a positive emotion that is evoked by a sudden intensification of communal sharing, and largely overlaps with the English concept being moved. We investigated its relationship with collective action in both advantaged and disadvantaged racial groups in the context of the Black Lives Matter Movement (BLM) in Spring of 2020. In one pilot study (N = 78) and one main study (N = 215), we confirmed that anger toward the system of racial inequalities mediated between injustice and collective action intentions, and that kama muta toward the movement mediated between collective efficacy and collective action intentions. Both mediations were found for both Black and White participants. We also observed additional unpredicted paths from anger to kama muta and from efficacy to anger. Together, this provides evidence for the pivotal role of emotions in collective action intentions, but also points out that appraisals need to be better understood.

AB  - This essay offers a significant reconceptualization of Jane Austen's influence on political novelists of the mid-nineteenth century by examining Elizabeth Gaskell's extensive use of Pride and Prejudice (1813) in her novel North and South (1855). At a moment when the political dimensions of Austen's fictions were fading to obscurity, Gaskell drew on Austen's portrayal of domestic relationships to underscore their relevance to “public” problems. On this view, the Austenian courtship plot does not contain political anxieties so much as animate them, with the logic of complementary coupling providing a formal and thematic model for the dialectical engagements necessary for navigating social conflict. At the same time, Gaskell uses Austenian motifs to dramatize the “marriageability” of different generic frameworks during a time of regional fragmentation while also envisioning Austen as a parental figure whose legacy called for continuing negotiation. © 2022 by University of Washington

AB  - Taiwanese students who graduated from Polish medical schools (P-IMGs) accounted for the second-largest group of international medical graduates in Taiwan. In 2009, domestic medical students in Taiwan staged mass demonstrations against P-IMG’s exemption from the qualifying test before the licensing exam. Although medical circles in Taiwan might still hold prejudices against P-IMGs, little is known about their career development. This study will analyze P-IMGs’ choices of specialties and training sites from 2000 to 2020 using data from the membership section of the Taiwan Medical Journal, the monthly official publication of the Taiwan Medical Association. Of 372 P-IMGs, 34.2% chose internal medicine and 17.1% surgery. Although academic medical centers offered 76% of all available trainee positions in a year, only 49.3% of P-IMGs received training there. By contrast, 20.9% of P-IMGs were trained at nonmetropolitan hospitals that altogether accounted for only 5.8% of trainee positions. In conclusion, P-IMGs had their residency training at less favorable specialties and sites. Their long-term career development deserves further study. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Following the Digital Revolution, we are witnessing an increase in the number of manip-ulated sources of information. For this reason, virtual environments can be a breeding ground for the proliferation of prejudices and stereotypes, resulting from the spread of racial fallacious news, known as ‘racial hoaxes’. Adolescents may be more susceptible due to the tense and complicated relationship between their experience with digital platforms and the development of their relatively limited critical thinking. In this landscape, in order to explore the features of disinformation in ad-olescence, the research involved 41 Italian adolescents between 13 and 16 years old, balanced by gender and school education. The teenagers took part in the focus group discussions on the topic of online information preferences, fake news and racial hoaxes, which were analyzed by means of content analysis. The answers given by participants show a so‐called adolescents’ perception of ‘misin-formation invulnerability’ that can influence their credulity in fake news, since they are aware of fake news but they are not so able to recognize or remember it. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Individuals tend to dehumanize the outgroup. In this paper, we explore whether the activation of attachment security can attenuate dehumanization. Two studies were performed. In Study 1, attachment security was primed by showing pictures that depicted relationships with attachment figures; the outgroup was the homeless and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and non-uniquely human emotions to this group. In Study 2, the sense of interpersonal security was activated by inviting participants to relive a recent interaction that left them with a feeling of safety and warmth. Outgroup members were the Roma, and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and human nature traits to them. In Study 2, the mediation effect of intergroup emotions was investigated. In both studies, outgroup humanization effects were highlighted. In Study 2, these effects were mediated by increased empathy toward the outgroup. Interestingly, the positive impact of security activation was not moderated by chronic attachment orientations. Findings suggest strategies that can be used to improve intergroup relations in specific contexts and in society at large. © 2022 Capozza et al.

AB  - Purpose: Biased perceptions of individuals who are not part of one's in-groups tend to be negative and habitual. Because health care professionals are no less susceptible to biases than are others, the adverse impact of biases on marginalized populations in health care warrants continued attention and amelioration. Method: Two characters, a Syrian refugee with limited English proficiency and a black pregnant woman with a history of opioid use disorder, were developed for an online training simulation that includes an interactive life course experience focused on social determinants of health, and a clinical encounter in a community health center utilizing virtual reality immersion. Pre- and post-survey data were obtained from 158 health professionals who completed the simulation. Results: Post-simulation data indicated increased feelings of compassion toward the patient and decreased expectations about how difficult future encounters with the patient would be. With respect to attribution, after the simulation participants were less inclined to view the patient as primarily responsible for their situation, suggesting less impact of the fundamental attribution error. Conclusion: This training simulation aimed to utilize components of evidence-based prejudice habit breaking interventions, such as learning more about an individual's life experience to help minimize filling in gaps with stereotyped assumptions. Although training simulations cannot fully replicate or replace the advantages that come with real-world experience, they can heighten awareness in the increase of increasing the cultural sensitivity of clinicians in health care professions for improving health equity. © Paul J.

AB  - Counter-empathy significantly affects people's social lives. Previous evidence indicates that the degree of counter-empathy can be either strong or weak. Strong counter-empathy easily occurs when empathizers are prejudiced against the targets of empathy (e.g. prejudice against outgroup members) and activates brain regions that are opposite to those activated by empathy. Weak counter-empathy may have different neural processing paths from strong ones, but its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we used an unfair distribution paradigm, which can reduce participants' prejudice against persons empathized with, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural mechanisms underlying counter-empathy. Here, empathy and counter-empathy shared a common neural mechanism, induced by unfair distribution, in the right middle temporal gyrus. Counter-empathy activated distinct brain regions that differed from those of empathic responses in different situations. The functions of these brain regions, which included the middle frontal, middle temporal and left medial superior gyri, were similar and mostly related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing. Here, we propose a process model of counter-empathy, involving two processing paths according to whether or not prejudice exists. This study has theoretical significance and broadens our understanding of the cognitive neural mechanisms underlying empathy and counter-empathy. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to describe the racial discrimination from white people against black people that was formerly a slave by analyzing Langston Hughes' poems; I, Too, To the Black Beloved, The White Ones, and My Beloved. Presentation of racial discrimination can be seen from the act of prejudice, insulting, words used, and the act of suppression to the black people. These poems represent the poet's feeling of social phenomena that happened. The data were analyzed utilizing the new historicism theory, enriched by historical text, sociocultural, and political information during slavery. This study is a qualitative descriptive method using the new historicism approach to explain the racial discrimination experienced in Langston Hughes' poems. The result showed that Langston Hughes reflects the phenomena of racial discrimination through his poems, such as slave, victim, nigger, torture, darker brother, and not beautiful in his poems. Langston Hughes in his poetry concludes that black discrimination is treated badly; they eat in the kitchen, they are not beautiful, children's happiness is tarnished, and racial discrimination is inhumane. © 2022 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - The 26/11 Mumbai attacks in India severely impacted the already strained Indo–Pak political relations and fuelled prejudice against the common people of Pakistan. Since the attacks, Indian people have found various expressions of collective memory and ways to commemorate the incident. While these serve as a remembrance of the attack, it also reinforces negative attitudes towards Pakistan and its people, hindering any prospects of peace and reconciliation. This article describes a peace education through art initiative implemented in a high school in Mumbai. It draws from a synergy of theoretical concepts in peace, reconciliation and conflict transformation for its curricular framework that has three inquiry processes: Examine–Envision–Envisage. This article describes the implementation and outcomes of the initiative that support the value of an integrated peace-and reconciliation-focused art education pedagogy aimed at promoting reconciliation in relation to ongoing/intractable conflicts. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of addressing negative emotions inherent in ongoing conflicts and how empathy might contribute towards reducing prejudice towards the ‘Other’. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Incidents of prejudice and discrimination in K–12 schools have increased over the past decade around the world, including the United States. In 2018, more than two-thirds of the 2,776 U.S. educators surveyed reported witnessing a hate or bias incident in their school. Children and adolescents who experience prejudice, social exclusion, and discrimination are subject to compromised well-being and low academic achievement. Few educators feel prepared to incorporate this topic into the education curriculum. Given the long-term harm related to experiencing social exclusion and discrimination, school districts need to create positive school environments and directly address prejudice and bias. Several factors are currently undermining progress in this area. First, national debates in the United States and other countries have politicized the topic of creating fair and just school environments. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted children's and adolescents’ education by halting academic progress which has particularly negatively affected students from marginalized and ethnic/racial minority backgrounds. Third, teachers have experienced significant stress during COVID-19 with an increase in anxiety around virtual instruction and communication with parents. Three strategies recommended to address these converging problems include creating inclusive and nondiscriminatory policies for schools, promoting opportunities for intergroup contact and mutual respect, and implementing evidence-based, developmentally appropriate education programs. It is anticipated that these strategies will help to reduce prejudice, increase ethnic and racial identity (ERI), and promote equity, fairness, and justice in school environments. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Social injustices toward minority groups are pervasive around the world, and further exacerbated by global threats such as COVID-19 and climate change. Prosocial tendencies, such as empathy, moral reasoning, and helping behaviors directed only toward members of one's own social groups, discriminate against outgroups, and can perpetuate an unjust status quo. Yet, recent meta-analyses point to effective intervention programs that can foster prosocial responses across group lines. Developmental science has identified evidence-based interventions, policies, and programs to foster inclusive prosocial tendencies (toward both in-group and out-group members) to redress social injustices and inequities, and ultimately, lead to more just and peaceful societies. The recent developmental science informs five policy principles (e.g., developmental science, resilience, culture, collaboration, and sustainability) that can advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around inclusion and peace. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Ageism refers to stereotyping (how we think), prejudice (how we feel), and discrimination (how we act) against people based on their age. It is a serious public health issue that can negatively impact older people’s health and quality of life. The present protocol has several goals: (1) adapt the Ambivalent Ageism Scale for the general Portuguese population and healthcare professionals; (2) assess the factorial invariance of the questionnaire between general population vs. healthcare professionals; (3) evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in the general population and evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in healthcare professionals; (4) compare the levels of ageism between groups and the invariance between groups regarding the explanatory model of predictors of ageism. This quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study will be developed in partnership with several Healthcare Professional Boards/Associations, National Geriatrics and Gerontology Associations, and the Universities of the Third Age Network Association. The web-based survey will be conducted on a convenience sample recruited via various social media and institutional channels. The survey consists of three questionnaires: (1) Demographic data; (2) Ambivalent Ageism Scale; (3) Palmore-Neri and Cachioni questionnaire. The methodology of this study will include translation, pilot testing, semantic adjustment, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and multigroup analysis of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale. Data will be treated using International Business Machines Corporation (IBM®) Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Descriptive analysis will be conducted to assess the level of ageism in the study sample. The ageism levels between the two groups will be compared using the t-student test, and two Structural Equation Modeling will be developed to evaluate the predictors of ageism. Assessing ageism is necessary to allow healthcare professionals and policymakers to design and implement strategies to solve or reduce this issue. Findings from this study will generate knowledge relevant to healthcare and medical courses along with anti-ageism education for the Portuguese population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Multi-cluster R&D teams have the potential to generate breakthrough inventions because they can tap into the distinct knowledge of the different geographic hot spots in which team members are located. Having access to a variety of knowledge offers these teams great recombinatorial potential. To succeed, however, the geographically dispersed members must share and integrate the different local knowledge pools available to them. We argue that the density of intra-team co-patenting ties shapes intra-team knowledge sharing and integration and hence the extent teams benefit from the knowledge they can access. Whereas greater density of intra-cluster team ties (within a given location) hinders sharing and integration of locally tapped knowledge across locations, greater density of inter-cluster ties (across cluster locations) facilitates it. Our empirical analysis of 834 multi-cluster nanotechnology R&D teams shows that the technological distance (the difference in knowledge) between clusters in which inventors are located has an inverted-U relationship with the likelihood of the team generating a breakthrough. Further, we find that the density of multi-cluster team intra- vs. inter-cluster ties influences the effect of technological distance on the likelihood of breakthrough invention. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article presents findings collected in 2016–2017 from a multi-method ethnographic study of Shirebrook, Derbyshire in the English East Midlands, examining the narratives used by the local authority (LA) and local residents that construct immigration as a social problem. In doing so, it contributes to the literature on race and migration by extending analysis beyond metropolitan localities with long histories of multi-ethnic settlement, to consider a relatively small, peripheral former colliery town. The paper demonstrates how migration is framed as a social problem by central government funding streams with consequences for localities, and the influence this has on local narratives of social change. The construction of immigration as a social problem is rooted in the constraints of austerity and longer-term processes of deindustrialization and economic restructuring, with representations and understandings of place being constitutive of anti-immigrant sentiment. This article deepens our understanding of responses to immigration in the UK, and has broader implications for understanding the relationship between place, state polices and local narratives. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - To address sexism, people must first recognize it. In this research, we identified a barrier that makes sexism hard to recognize: rudeness toward men. We found that observers judge a sexist perpetrator as less sexist if he is rude toward men. This occurs because rudeness toward men creates the illusion of gender blindness. We documented this phenomenon in five preregistered studies consisting of online adult participants and adult students from professional schools (total N = 4,663). These attributions are problematic because sexism and rudeness are not mutually exclusive. Men who hold sexist beliefs about women can be—and often are—rude toward other men. These attributions also discourage observers from holding perpetrators accountable for gender bias. Thus, rudeness toward men gives sexist perpetrators plausible deniability. It protects them and prevents the first perceptual step necessary to address sexism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The current study investigated how media exposure to a distant outgroup – asylum seekers in the European Union (EUAS) – may be associated with the transference of geographically distant foreign threats via Israeli media to Israeli local minorities. The study was based on an online survey of 1039 Israeli Jews. We found positive associations between frequency of exposure to negative EUAS media content and physical and symbolic threats domesticated from foreign outgroups to the local ground. Frequent exposure to negative EUAS media content was associated with worse attitudes toward asylum seekers in Israel. Thus, the media framing of remote groups and events can have important, long-lasting local consequences, including, most obviously, social and political implications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives. To report findings from qualitative research that describe sources of hesitancy and barriers to vaccine uptake among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) populations. Methods. In March 2021, we conducted focus groups with members of the Los Angeles, California LGBTQIA community to identify barriers to becoming vaccinated. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 32 individuals in 5 focus groups. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes. Results. Historical and ongoing medical trauma, including misgendering, and perceived emotional violence emerged as significant barriers to LGBTQIA individuals becoming vaccinated. Fear of violence was found to be a major barrier among transgender individuals, whereas fear of an unwelcoming vaccination site was a barrier for seniors. Finally, surviving was a higher priority than becoming vaccinated. Conclusions. Participants reported vaccine hesitancy and barriers that are unique to the life experiences of LGBTQIA individuals; these include medical trauma, violence, stigma, and discrimination. Our findings highlight the need to include LGBTQIA leaders and trusted individuals in the development of vaccination education and the delivery of vaccination services.

AB  - Physical inactivity is a common health problem in female college students, and factors such as weight self-stigma and smartphone addiction may negatively impact physical activity in this population. The aim of the current study was to investigate the associations between these variables and identify the moderating effects of smartphone addiction between weight stigma and physical activity. Using a cross-sectional study, information on the level of physical activity in the past week, weight-related self-stigma, and smartphone addiction, as well as demographics, were collected via an online survey from 391 female college students in Taiwan. Participants in two groups of moderate to high and low physical activity were compared using a zero-order bivariate correlation in terms of independent variables. A moderated mediation model using Model 14 in the Hayes’ PROCESS macro with 1000 bootstrapping resamples was applied to assess moderation effects. There were significant differences in terms of weight status, smartphone addiction, and weight stigma between active and inactive groups (p < 0.001). All independent variables except for age were positively correlated (0.14 < r < 0.45). Multivariate regression models indicated that weight status was associated with weight stigma (odds ratio [OR] = 9.13, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 6.90, 11.35). Weight status (OR = 0.47, p = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.93), weight stigma (OR = 0.96, p = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.922, 0.997), and smartphone addiction (OR = 0.11, p = 0.003; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.47) were associated with physical activity. The moderating role of smartphone addiction on the association between weight stigma and physical activity was also identified (OR = 1.05, p = 0.049; 95% CI = 1.0001, 1.1004). The moderating effect of smartphone addiction on the association between weight stigma and physical activity suggests that designing interventions to address the negative impacts of both weight stigma and smartphone addiction may help to improve physical activity in female college students. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - (1) Background: homeless people are characterized by serious social vulnerability and difficulty in accessing health services worldwide. In Brazil, this population is supported by the Street Clinic teams who are challenged to establish intersectoral networks to expand access and promote unique and humanized care from the perspective of harm reduction. The study aimed to analyze the practices of professionals working at the Street Clinic in a city in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil, to tackle the vulnerabilities of the homeless population and expand access to the health care network. (2) Methods: a qualitative study was conducted with a social approach in which we interviewed eight workers from the Street Clinic. Data were analyzed using the thematic content analysis tool. (3) Results: three nuclei of meaning were built: stigma and prejudice as the main barriers to accessing services, harm reduction as a humanized care practice and valuing autonomy, and Street Clinic as a gateway to the health system and main interlocutor with other services. (4) Conclusions: the articulation with network services is marked by contradictory relationships, of conflict and trust, signaling the need for greater investment in educational qualifications and working conditions for professionals at all levels of care to expand access to health care. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - While public service professionals may rely on stereotypes and social categories in exercising who gets what, when and how in clientelist citizen-state interactions, it remains unclear whether negative judgments similarly pervade in settings where citizens help produce–rather than consume–public services. We propose that service professionals judge volunteers as incompetent based on (1) a lack of the skills necessary to solve specific tasks, and/or (2) negative stereotypes toward volunteers as a means of shielding the privileged position of the profession or safeguarding the quality of services. Using an experiment among 817 nursing home professionals, negative judgments of volunteer competence were invoked simply by priming professionals to think of citizens volunteering in service production. The effect, however, is not conditional on the type of task (complementary vs. core) solved by volunteers, suggesting that judgments of competence mainly stem from stereotypes of volunteer (in)competence in assisting with service production. © 2022 by The American Society for Public Administration

AB  - Recent scholarship on the social history of health and medicine in colonial India has moved beyond enclavist or hegemonic aspects of imperial medicine and has rather focused on the role of Indian intermediaries and the fractured nature of colonial hegemony. Drawing inspiration from this scholarship, the article highlights the significance of the Indian subordinates in the lock hospital system in the nineteenth century Madras Presidency. This study focuses on a class of Indian subordinates called the “gomastah”, who were employed to detect clandestine prostitution in Madras to control the spread of venereal disease. It also underlines the role of other native and non-native subordinates such as Dhais, Chowdranies and Matrons, the ways in which they became indispensable for the smoother operation of the Contagious Diseases Act and the lock hospitals on a day-to-day basis. By emphasising how Indian subordinates were able to bring in caste biases within colonial governmentality, adding another layer to the colonial prejudices and xenophobia against the native population, it underlines the fact that there was not a one-way appropriation or facilitation of the coloniser’s knowledge or biases by the colonised intermediaries. Rather, it argues for an interaction between them, and highlights the complexities of caste hierarchies and prejudice within the everyday colonial governmentality. Moreover, the article focuses on the consequent chaos and inherent power struggle between different factions of colonial staff. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Due to the centrality of race and racism in social, economic, and political life, coupled with the racially privileged position of White people, the assessment of White racial attitudes is an ongoing concern. There is a great deal of survey-based, quantitative work that demonstrates a compelling case of White attitudinal polarization—a grouping of authoritarian, racist attitudes versus another alliance of progressive, antiracist attitudes—an increasingly racialized culture war. However, other studies, largely qualitative and open-ended, demonstrate the heterogeneous, shifting, and hypocritical nature of White discourse about race. To resolve this paradox, I refrain from the assumption that White racial “attitudes” are essentially bifurcated, while I also refuse the contention that White people produce spontaneous narratives whole-cloth. Rather, I argue that with sustained attention to time, context, and triangulation, we can better understand how and why White people speak of People of Color in positive ways one moment and negative the next, marshaling both to defend, rationalize, or improve their racialized subject position. I argue that these contradictions are—a la Schrodinger €’s famous thought experiment—“superposition strategies.” Both racist and antiracist attitudes are simultaneously alive and dead in the same individual or group. Contradictory White discourse helps maintain a sense of self-efficacy and coherent White racial identity within conflictual and politically supercharged social situations, as well as within racially unequal social structures. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - William Randolph Hearst became editor and proprietor of the San Francisco Examiner in 1887, and by 1935, he had assembled a media empire consisting of nearly 30 major newspapers, 13 magazines, 8 radio stations, 3 news wires, and 2 motion picture companies. Most scholarship about Hearst has focused on his newspapers; less studied have been the magazines he acquired early in the 20th century. This monograph examines immigrant representations in Hearst magazines published between 1905 and 1945, focusing on how magazine fiction, nonfiction, and “fact-fiction” articles presented immigrants and immigration as social and political issues. Like Hearst himself, the publications favored immigrants from Germany and the Scandinavian countries of northern Europe and tended to disfavor those from China and Japan and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. According to the magazines, immigrants from the Far East and Mexico were “undesirables” who threatened society by, allegedly, importing, selling, and using hazardous drugs. Newspaper advertisements, news articles, and editorials extended these portrayals to wider audiences. Hearst also applied cross-media promotion to motion pictures, with writers converting fiction from his magazines into screenplays for Cosmopolitan Productions and MGM. The monograph contains examples of how magazine content and iconic covers have informed contemporary films and television series. In recent years, stylized representations have glamorized lifestyles but have also perpetuated cultural stereotypes that may contribute to anti-immigrant attitudes. © 2022 AEJMC.

AB  - Attitudes toward immigration have attracted much scholarly interest and fuelled extensive empirical research in recent years. Many different hypotheses have been proposed to explain individual and contextual differences in attitudes towards immigration. However, it has become difficult to align all of the evidence that the literature has produced so far. The present article contributes to the systematization of political science empirical research on public attitudes toward immigration in the last decade. Using a simplified combined-tests technique, this paper identifies the micro- as well as macro-level factors that are consistently linked to attitudes toward immigration. It reports findings from a meta-analysis of the determinants of general attitudes toward immigration in published articles in thirty highly ranked peer-reviewed political science journals for the years 2009–2019. The results warrant a summary of factors affecting attitudes to immigration in a systematic, measurable and rigorous manner. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) face significant stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system. Method: Using pretest-posttest non–equivalent groups design, the Health Care Provider HIV/AIDs Stigma Scale was administered to two cohorts of nursing students (N = 32) to evaluate effects of a virtual patient simulation of caring for a patient with HIV. Results: No statistically significant effects were found. Clinical significance was noted in the treatment group, which demonstrated greater decreases in total score means and in discrimination and prejudice subscale means. Conclusions: Findings suggest participation in a virtual simulation of a patient living with HIV can positively impact nursing students’ attitudes. © 2021

AB  - When presented with evidence of their advantages, the privileged often either deny that their social system has accorded them any gains or that social inequity exists altogether. In this research, we draw on two literatures related to self-perception—multiple social categorization and self-image threat—to propose factors that may increase the racial privilege perceptions of White men, a group often in positions of power in the workplace. Across ten studies (N = 5,124) in a workplace context, we find that White men who self-report (Studies 1c, 2a-d, 3) or recall (Studies 1a-b, 4) experience(s) of disadvantage based on a social category (e.g., physical disability) perceive greater White privilege than those without exposure to such disadvantage. Additionally, we find mixed evidence that greater self-reported success at work corresponds to increased perceptions of privilege for White men who have experienced social category-based disadvantage. We discuss these findings, their implications, and future directions. © 2021

AB  - Black men are generally stereotyped as physically formidable and threatening. Across 3 studies, we investigate whether this threat stereotyping is diluted when Black men are obese. We competitively tested two hypotheses investigating whether obese Black men are seen as less racially stereotypical overall, or as uniquely less threatening (but still racially stereotypic more broadly). In Study 1, perceivers were less likely to list threat as a stereotype of obese Black men than weight-unspecified Black men. In Study 2, obese Black men were subject to reduced threat stereotypes, but were still subject to other stereotypes about Black men. Finally, in Study 3 this threat-specific dilution led perceivers to anticipate feeling less threatened by obese Black men, and believe police use-of-force is less justified toward obese Black men, relative to average-weight Black men (Study 3). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the well-established stereotype of Black men as threatening is not applied equally across weight. Instead, contradicting stereotypes of obese individuals as physically and psychologically incapable of threat dilutes the Black-threat stereotype. However, obese Black men are still subject to harmful race-based stereotypes unrelated to threat. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We currently seem to witness an increase of right-wing populism, anti-immigration sentiments, and a general hostility towards 'others' in increasingly diverse and complex societies. Based on literature in social, political and psychological sciences, we hypothesize that plurality resistance predicts negative intergroup relations by increasing stereotypes. Using data of a recent, large-scale, and representative survey (N = 2304; 55% females; MAge = 55,19 years), we examined, across different models, whether plurality resistance is associated with anti-Muslim attitudes, mediated via general and gendered Muslim stereotypes. Structural equation models provided evidence for the hypothesized main effect, which was partly mediated by stereotypes, while multigroup mediational models confirmed the robustness of the present findings. Results highlight the usefulness of plurality resistance that contributes to the explanation of negative intergroup relations as well as the important role of stereotypes as cognitive short-cuts for diversity-overwhelmed individuals in order to simplify and, thus, deal with the complexities of contemporary societies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years the percentage of Latin American immigrants in Argentina has grown all over the country. However, due to the economic crisis that the country is going through, the State offers economic support to the entire population, even to Latin American immigrants living in Argentina. Therefore, prejudiced attitudes towards these minority groups have increased. The aim of this study was to explore differences according to prejudice levels and country regions in the belief that Latin American immigrants who receive some kind of economic support do not really need it. Second, if the acceptance of granting economic support to immigrants can be explained by a theoretical model that includes conservative and self-enhancement values, right wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and prejudice towards them. Participants were 1570 non-immigrants adults (between 18 and 75 years old, Mage = 38.37; SD = 15.65), 55.1% female, grouped according to their region of residence (largest urban centers, smaller cities and border areas). Results of a path model indicate that values and ideological attitudes seem to underlie prejudice towards Latin American immigrants. Moreover, differences in the levels of prejudice according to the region where participants live, were found. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Following the signing of peace agreements, post-accord societies often remain deeply divided across group lines. There is a need to identify antecedents of youth’s support for peace and establish more constructive intergroup relations. This article explored the effect of out-group trust, intergroup forgiveness, and social identity on support for the peace process among youth from the historic majority and minority communities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The sample comprised 667 adolescents (49% male; M = 15.74, SD = 1.99 years old) across two time points. The results from the structural equation model suggested that out-group trust was related to intergroup forgiveness over time, while forgiveness related to later support for the peace process. Strength of in-group social identity differentially moderated how out-group trust and intergroup forgiveness related to later support for peace among youth from the conflict-related groups (i.e., Protestants and Catholics). Implications for consolidating peace in Northern Ireland are discussed, which may be relevant to other settings affected by intergroup conflict. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The article describes the results of teachers using a critical language lens to analyze linguistic stereotypes in TV series, movies, cartoons, and social media posts. I share the key questions teachers asked about language use in texts as well as the results of their analysis. Based in a cultural modeling pedagogy (Lee, 2007), teachers examined the texts of their everyday lives and increased their Critical Language Awareness. They identified linguistic tropes in nostalgic movies and TV shows, and uncovered patterns of associations between kinds of language use and kinds of people. Teachers emphasized the value of the activity for deepening their linguistic awareness and increasing a desire to disrupt linguistic prejudice. They developed multiple options for bringing a critical language lens to their own classrooms and students. © 2022 International Literacy Association.

AB  - Objective: To review the evidence of felt and enacted stigma and attitudes toward persons living with epilepsy, and their determining factors. Methods: Thirteen databases were searched (1985–2019). Abstracts were reviewed in duplicate and data were independently extracted using a standardized form. Studies were characterized using descriptive analysis by whether they addressed “felt” or “enacted” stigma and “attitudes” toward persons living with epilepsy. Results: Of 4234 abstracts, 132 met eligibility criteria and addressed either felt or enacted stigma and 210 attitudes toward epilepsy. Stigma frequency ranged broadly between regions. Factors associated with enacted stigma included low level of knowledge about epilepsy, lower educational level, lower socioeconomic status, rural areas living, and religious grouping. Negative stereotypes were often internalized by persons with epilepsy, who saw themselves as having an “undesirable difference” and so anticipated being treated differently. Felt stigma was associated with increased risk of psychological difficulties and impaired quality of life. Felt stigma was linked to higher seizure frequency, recency of seizures, younger age at epilepsy onset or longer duration, lower educational level, poorer knowledge about epilepsy, and younger age. An important finding was the potential contribution of epilepsy terminology to the production of stigma. Negative attitudes toward those with epilepsy were described in 100% of included studies, and originated in any population group (students, teachers, healthcare professionals, general public, and those living with epilepsy). Better attitudes were generally noted in those of younger age or higher educational status. Significance: Whatever the specific beliefs about epilepsy, implications for felt and enacted stigma show considerable commonality worldwide. Although some studies show improvement in attitudes toward those living with epilepsy over time, much work remains to be done to improve attitudes and understand the true occurrence of discrimination against persons with epilepsy. © 2022 International League Against Epilepsy

AB  - Oliver C. Cox was one of the most important and accomplished US-based sociologists, labor historians, and socialist thinkers of the twentieth century. He produced a series of classic works on racial prejudice and race relations and the foundations and development of capitalism. Despite some recent interest in his work, likely due to the renewed interest in the concept of racial capitalism, in-depth analysis of Cox’s work remains underdeveloped. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, the paper shows that the development of racial prejudice was, for Cox, not only an invention of capitalism as a particular moment in history, but it was also always undergirded by the requirements of capitalist political economy. Second, I show the dynamics that Cox believed were required to establish the conditions for racially prejudiced working-class subjects. Part of capital’s ideological alibi was, for Cox, the development and sedimentation of working-class racial antagonism. Yet, Cox showed that racial antagonism among the working class was inherently contradictory and counter to working-class interests and was traceable to the social, political, and economic apparatus of the elite class. Because the elite class necessarily relies upon the exploitation of the labor supply, it likewise relies upon racial antagonism to maintain labor quiescence. The work of the social scientist, then, is to explain such asocial phenomena in materialist terms, thereby redirecting working-class energy toward solidarity and the horizon of socialist revolution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Although the importance of investigating the development of weight bias in young children has been documented, little research has examined potential impacts of children's participation in such research. The purpose of the current study was to assess whether participation in research measuring beliefs about body size may engender changes in the development of weight beliefs in young children. Eighty children (44 boys, 36 girls), ages 3–5 (M = 3.73, SD =0.69) participated in tasks assessing weight bias beliefs and perception of their own body size at two time periods (two weeks apart). Participants’ responses at Time 2 were also compared to data collected from a similar sample who completed the measures only once. Results demonstrated main effects of gender (girls reporting greater weight bias) and age (older children reporting greater weight bias)) across time points that are consistent with prior research. Importantly, there was no change in participants’ responses from Time 1 to Time 2 and no significant differences between Time 2 data and data collected from participants who only completed the measures at one time period, suggesting that participation in such research may not pose undue risks to young children. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Persistent social exclusion can detrimentally impact marginalized individuals' psychological well-being. However, little is known about the social factors that could moderate the psychological cost of social exclusion in persistently excluded social groups. Focusing on asylum-seekers, refugees, and voluntary economic immigrants, we tested if intergroup social connections with the majority national group (i.e., the host population) and other immigrants moderated the short- and long-term social exclusion impact. In Study 1 (N = 277), we found that the quantity and quality of connections with the national people reduced the immediate emotional burden of experimental exposure to social exclusion, whereas connections with other immigrants aggravated it. Study 2 (N = 112) consisted in a six-month longitudinal study investigating the influence of intergroup social relationships on the long-term psychological harm of social exclusion in asylum-seekers and refugees. Results showed that in participants who developed more frequent and close connections with people from the national group over time, social exclusion yielded a less detrimental long-term psychological impact. Oppositely, for immigrants who established increasing connections with other migrants, social exclusion led to more adverse psychological repercussions over time. The research provided replicated and complementary evidence highlighting that immigrants' intergroup connections can influence the short and long-term consequences of persistent exclusion, emphasizing the benefits of bridging connections with the national group and the risks of segregation within immigrants' niches. © 2021

AB  - Social psychology’s search for ways to address intergroup inequality has grappled with two approaches that have been considered incompatible: (a) the prejudice reduction approach, that argues that changing individual negative attitudes will undermine the basis for discrimination and lead to intergroup harmony; and (b) the collective action approach, that argues that social protest and activism can improve the position of disadvantaged groups. The problem is that efforts toward prejudice reduction may serve to suppress genuine efforts to change. We propose the Achieving Multicultural Integration of Groups Across Society (AMIGAS) model, in which a multicultural commitment is proposed as a driver of both improved intergroup evaluations and promotion of collective action for reduced inequality, especially in contexts where there are conditions for a respectful intercultural dialogue. The AMIGAS model is a theoretical advance in the field of intergroup relations and a basis for implementing effective egalitarian policies and practices. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The current study explored parental racial socialization and racial regard as moderators of the effects of cultural racism on depression symptoms among Black adolescents (N = 604, Mage = 15.44). When adolescents reported lower private regard and lower cultural pride messages or higher public regard and lower alertness to discrimination messages, the negative effects of cultural racism on depression symptoms were exacerbated. When adolescents reported higher private regard and more cultural pride messages, the negative effects of cultural racism on depression symptoms were attenuated. Findings suggest that racial messages transmitted to Black adolescents combined with their own racial attitudes can alter the effect of cultural racism on depression symptoms. © 2021 Society for Research on Adolescence

AB  - Neonatal follow-up studies traditionally report on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes as a metric of success of neonatal intensive care. Research endpoints are also typically deficit-based, assessing whether disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment, deafness or blindness, are present or not. These historical approaches have resulted in neonatal follow-up programs that narrowly focus on the early identification of neurodevelopmental problems, possibly to the detriment of other outcomes that matter to parents. This focus on neurodevelopmental disability may also contribute to the negative stereotypes associated with extreme preterm birth. In this article, we discuss parental perspectives regarding important long-term outcomes. We examine limitations with current definitions of outcomes and propose a strength-based approach to generate meaningful findings both for clinicians and families. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Universalism is a principle according to which a rule or a standard should be applied in social situations in the same way irrespective of the social attributes of those who are affected by this rule/standard. This normative claim collides with the fundamental mechanisms of social cognition, which underlie social biases, prejudice, and discrimination. Social biases are the main source of violation from the universalism principle across various domains of human life: evaluations, judgments, decision-making, problem-solving, social interaction, among others. Whereas normative universalism is a moral principle, the present study asks how it can be realised in practice. The study identifies three broad classes of such strategies. The first one targets individuals' cognitive and psychological traits, which give rise to social biases and include intergroup contact, social cognitive strategy, reappraisal, motivational strategy, and bias control. The second class targets the situation and includes three strategies: disengagement, randomisation, and counterbalancing biases by aggregation. The third class includes two strategies, which rely on technological solutions: automation and neural administration. The study describes the core idea and main problems of each strategy and discusses how the choice of a strategy depends on the context and the task, which requires a universal solution. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Recently, social identity approach has been giving stimulating insights in leadership in sport, considering social identification as a consequence regarding leadership processes. Nonetheless, social identity theory fundamentally posits social identification as a subjacent parameter of cognitions implied in the frame of interpersonal and intergroup relations. The current study aimed to enrich the existing literature by investigating athletes’ team identification as a predictor of the perception of coach-created climate. French male rugby union players (N = 248) completed an online survey measuring the multidimensionality of their social identification to the team, and their perception of the coach-created climate in terms of empowering and disempowering motivational climate. Using Group Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling, the analyses revealed that the perception of the climate as empowering was driven by high scores on ingroup ties, especially when teammates’ ingroup ties scores were low. Team's ingroup affect and cognitive centrality resulted in lower perception levels of the empowering climate. Neither player's ingroup ties nor cognitive centrality predicted the perception of the climate as empowering, and when player's ingroup affect fitted into the group, his perception of a disempowering motivational climate decreased when ingroup affect score was high. The results are mainly discussed to the light of intergroup permeability by underlying the importance of considering social identification as a predictor of the perception of coach-athletes’ relationship. Some practical applications are put forward along with future directions for research on coach-athletes’ relationship. Especially, this study points out the importance of considering the social identity approach of leadership as a transactional relationship encapsulated in a mutual influence between the ingroup member social identification and that of the team as a whole. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Weight stigma among sexual minority men predicts negative health outcomes; however, existing research is cross-sectional. Therefore, we longitudinally examined the presence, strength, and direction of relationships between weight stigma and health outcomes in a multi-national cohort of 2953 sexual minority men (Mage = 37.70, SDage = 13.70). Participants reported their Body Mass Index (BMI), experiences of weight discrimination, internalized weight bias, and psychological quality of life at three time-points over 12 months (~August 2019–20). Analyses revealed feedback loops of internalized weight bias with BMI and psychological quality of life: over time, increases in internalized weight bias were associated with small BMI increases (β = 0.07) and small decreases in psychological quality of life (β = 0.12). Reciprocally, increases in BMI and decreases in psychological quality of life were associated with increases in internalized weight bias (βs = 0.18). Experiences of weight discrimination were not longitudinally predictive and were associated with higher BMI (β = 0.29), greater internalized weight bias (β = 0.29), and lower psychological quality of life (β = 0.26) between-persons/cross-sectionally only. Weight stigma is longitudinally and reciprocally associated with reduced psychological wellbeing and weight gain among sexual minority men. Internalized weight bias is a particularly promising intervention target. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examined the temporal sequence of the relationship between social media use and body dissatisfaction in adults. A representative sample of adults (19–92 years old; M = 52.83, SD = 13.43; 62.02% women, 37.98% men) completed measures of social media use, body dissatisfaction, age, gender, BMI, and demographic variables in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (N = 6258) in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. In the full sample, higher social media use was significantly associated with higher body dissatisfaction one year later, as was higher body dissatisfaction with higher social media use one year later after controlling for body dissatisfaction/social media use (T-1), gender, age, BMI, ethnicity, relationships status, and SES. Effects were small. The prospective pathway from social media use to body dissatisfaction was significant in all age groups but the reverse relationship was only significant in the middle aged and older groups. Both pathway directions were significant in women but only the pathway from body dissatisfaction to social media use was significant in men. The research has limitations and replication is required. However, findings suggest raising awareness about how to use social media positively across the broad community, not merely in adolescents, may be worthwhile. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Armed conflicts frequently fuel tensions between groups. The “cognitive perspective” of group identification offers a possible explanation, but is tacit on exact causal pathways. We predict that indiscriminate violence by armed actors induces fear of future attacks which in turn leads to prejudice, enhanced in-group cohesion, and calls for segregation. Selective violence does not have these effects. Relying on panel surveys conducted in Nairobi and Mombasa during the violent Kenyan elections in the Summer of 2017, we find evidence for the predicted effects among Christians in 2-way Fixed Effects estimation and an endorsement experiment. © 2021

AB  - Hydrogeochemical and Health Risk Assessments of trace elements are integral to groundwater resource assessment, utilization, and human health. Investigation of groundwater chemistry and trace elemental impact on local inhabitants were attempted in Shanmuganadhi basin, Tamilnadu, India. About 60 groundwater samples were collected during the pre-monsoon period and analyzed for hydrochemical composition, including major and trace elements (Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu Pb, Mn, and As) to isolate chemical characteristics and human health risk assessment. Groundwater geochemistry is prejudiced by geochemical reactions uniting cation exchange, dissolution and precipitation, adsorption, and anthropogenic contributions. About thirty-two percent of groundwater samples recorded higher F−(&gt;1.5 mg/L) than the prescribed limit suggests sources from rock weathering and silicate dissolution. Nitrates (&gt;45.0 mg/L) suggest sources from agricultural influences. Water types indicate alkalis (Na+ + K+) dominating alkali earth (Ca2+ - Mg2+) and strong acids (Cl− and SO42−) looming weak acid (CO32− and HCO3−) irrespective of water samples. The geochemical stability diagram suggests precipitation of silica, carbonate, and magnesium and dissolution of sulphate minerals along the groundwater flow path. Significant correlation between major ions and trace elements (Pb, Mn, Ni, and Cu) suggests origin from rock weathering, human impacts, and cultivation practices. Non-carcinogenic human risk for trace elements was higher in children compared with adults via ingestion and dermal exposure. The carcinogenic result suggests that Cr in CHK (7.1 × 10−2) and HBG (4.3 × 10−2) have the most excellent chance of cancer risk. The environmental risk category attempted using Comprehensive risk factor (CRI) suggests Pb (3.2-CHK, 2.6-HBG) with potential cancer risk. The comprehensive evaluation index recommends environmental damage between mild to moderate, indicating continuous exposure of traceable elements might result in cancer cause to the inhabitants. The study suggests water quality seems to be prejudiced by various geological and anthropogenic causes and endorses counteractive measures and proper execution of existing laws to protect groundwater resources in the study area. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Concerns have been raised about weakening social cohesion in French society against the backdrop of economic slowdown over the last decade. To understand how economic conditions are associated with social cohesion, this study analyzes the correlations between individual and macroeconomic indicators and social cohesion attitudes as well as their cross-level interaction. The results from pooled OLS regressions with year fixed effects using French European Social Survey data (2008–2018) show that individual economic strain is associated with lower social trust and with higher egalitarian and anti-immigrant attitudes. Cross-level interaction results suggest that strained individuals can have stronger egalitarian and anti-immigrant propensities under a macroeconomic downturn. As a result, larger variations in public attitudes can occur, which could pose a risk to the value consensus and social order. The results of this study suggest potential negative consequences of micro- and macroeconomic hardship for various dimensions of social cohesion and suggest the need for a comprehensive policy strategy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Through the proposed frame of ‘everyday intimacies’, this article explores the entanglements of race and gender in inter-ethnic relationships. ‘Everyday intimacies’ brings together the minority experiences of everyday racism, the state practices and policies of multiculturalism, and their inflections in intimate relationships of marriage, friendship, and dating. This approach demonstrates not just how the state regulates people’s intimate life through policies of marriage and family, but also how other indirect processes of multicultural governance mediate intimate life. Drawing on biographical narratives of mainly Indian women from in-depth life story interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, the article brings the literature on intimacies in conversation with the scholarship on race and ethnic relations in Singapore. Through a focus on intimacy, the article illustrates how tacit knowledge and embodied effects of everyday racism relate to larger trends of intermarriages, rising singlehood among Indian women and possibilities of co-ethnic friendships and solidarities. In doing so, the article presents novel insight into race and gender relations in Singapore. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Weight bias has deleterious consequences on individuals considered overweight and has similarities with forms of prejudice linked to social dominance orientation (SDO). Feminism can counter oppression that women are subject to notably through weight bias and SDO, but no studies have focused directly on these variables among men, as feminist identity is linked to less endorsement of certain beliefs in SDO and weight bias. The purpose of the present study is to explore the associations between feminist identification and beliefs, SDO, and weight bias among men from Quebec. Participants were divided into four feminist identification groups. Results indicate that feminist identification in men is linked to lower levels of SDO and less dislike toward people considered overweight. Also, feminism seems to predict prejudice toward others, but not toward oneself whereas SDO-D seems to be a good predictor of the belief that weight is controllable. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - For group discussions about fraught racial topics between Black and White Americans to be beneficial, conversation participants must view the person who facilitates as effective at communicating both the perspectives of Black and White Americans. We identify a biracial advantage in this domain. In three studies (total N = 710), we tested how a facilitator’s race affects their perceived effectiveness in communicating with both Black and White Americans. Both Black and White participants expected Black and White monoracial facilitators to more effectively engage with racial in-group than racial out-group members. However, they expected biracial facilitators to be equally effective in communicating with both Black and White groups. Both Black and White participants also expected biracial facilitators to use productive learning strategies (perspective taking, showing empathy) more than White facilitators, and either more than or equally to Black facilitators, suggesting one reason why people expect biracial facilitators to perform well in these moments. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Negative stereotypes about only children (OC) have caused widespread concern. However, relatively little is known about the accuracy of these stereotypes, especially regarding altruistic behaviors. In Study 1 (N = 337), participants rated the altruism of OC and non-only children (NOC) on three measurements on the basis of the participants’ perceptions. Results revealed that participants rated OC as less altruistic, and the stereotype primarily came from NOC raters. Results of Study 2 (N = 391) did not reveal any difference between OC and NOC in altruism. In Study 3 (N = 99), a social discounting task was applied to further investigate whether OC and NOC displayed different degrees of altruistic behavior toward various social distances. No differences were found among individuals at close or distant social distances. Ultimately, this research indicates that the negative stereotype regarding the altruistic behavior of OC is an incorrect prejudice. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objectives: Stigma has been found to be associated with lower self-esteem, which increases the risk of difficulties across life domains including vulnerability to mental health problems. There are no previous studies of interventions for people experiencing low self-esteem in the context of different stigmatized characteristics. This study evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of an intervention targeting low self-esteem in stigmatized people aged 16–24 years. Design: An uncontrolled study with repeated measures. Method: People with a range of stigmatized characteristics, who had low self-esteem and associated impaired daily functioning, were recruited from the general population. The individual six-session cognitive behavioural intervention had modules chosen according to participants’ formulations. The CBT included compassion-focussed therapy methods and was informed by stigma research. Feasibility was assessed in relation to recruitment, retention, and protocol adherence. Acceptability was assessed through participant feedback. Questionnaires assessing self-esteem, functioning impairments, depression, anxiety, self-criticism, self-compassion, and responses to prejudice and discrimination were administered at baseline, pre-, mid-, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up. Results: Forty-four people completed screening; 73% were eligible. Of these, 78% consented and 69% (N = 22) started the intervention. Eighteen (82%) participants completed, and four dropped out. Follow-up measures were completed by all treatment completers. Treatment completers reported the intervention was useful, improved their self-esteem and coping, and would recommend it. Ratings of usefulness and frequency of use of intervention components were high at post-treatment and follow-up. Conclusions: The intervention was feasible and highly acceptable to treatment completers. This suggests the intervention warrants investigation in a randomized-controlled trial. Practitioner points: Young people with low self-esteem whom have been negatively affected by stigma may wish to access support and be willing to engage in psychological interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy may be helpful for young people with low self-esteem who have experienced stigma, prejudice, or discrimination. Cognitive behavioural techniques such as self-compassionate thought records and behavioural experiments were considered acceptable and helpful by young people whose self-esteem has been affected by stigma. Addressing responses to stigma in therapy, such as rumination, avoidance, and perfectionism, appears to be feasible and acceptable. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The common practice of making fun of aging and older people demonstrates that ageism towards older people is socially acceptable. It is so accepted that even those of us who are aging or have moved into the ‘third act’ believe and fear the negative stereotypes that growing old is linked with physical and mental deterioration, dependence, and less social value. Ageism is evident in work places, family relationships, when older people purchase goods and services, in health and social institutions and extends throughout professions that work with older people. Objectives: We explore how nurses—the largest group of healthcare professions— may be inadvertently perpetuating negative perceptions about older people in nursing practice, nursing education, and through common misconceptions about what gerontological nursing means. Methods: This is discussion paper using the literature. Results: We suggest that nursing education is well situated to diminish negative perspectives of ageing by incorporating theories of life-course and harmonious aging into the holistic perspective of individuals that nursing is well known for. Conclusions: Greater understanding about the diversity of ageing and the context that have influenced older persons could encourage nurses to treat them holistically with dignity, which would ultimately improve older people’s experiences. Improving older persons’ experiences is like paying it forward, as we all are ageing and if we are to have a different experience when we are old, it is necessary to diminish stereotypes about ageing, and work towards inclusion of older people in social and healthcare institutions. Implications for practice: It is important for nurses, particularly those in nursing education, to support the incorporation of a life course and harmonious view of aging in which the social, political, and environmental context of individuals are viewed as part of the difference of ageing. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sexual minority men living in Africa, where many countries criminalize same-sex behavior, are vulnerable to HIV and experience significant barriers to HIV care. Sexual prejudice in healthcare settings is a key contributor to these barriers. Building on social psychological models of prejudice and interpersonal contact at the clinic, we examined the associations between healthcare workers’ sexual prejudice and their comfort to provide care to MSM, and assessed the moderating role of workers’ prior interpersonal contact with MSM. A cross-sectional survey of 147 healthcare workers varying in level of training and expertise working in HIV care organizations was conducted in western Kenya. Sexual prejudice was negatively associated with comfort to provide care to MSM. Prior interpersonal contact with MSM moderated the association between sexual prejudice and comfort to provide care to MSM among nurses/counselors, such that those with low prior contact and high sexual prejudice were the most uncomfortable providing care to MSM. Interventions are needed to address sexual prejudice and encourage positive forms of interpersonal contact with MSM, especially with nurses and counselors who might have more and varied patient interactions, to improve access to the continuum of HIV prevention and care for MSM in Kenya. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Little is known about weight stigma among people living with HIV (PLWH). This study examined whether levels of perceived weight stigma experiences and internalization, assessed retrospectively and naturalistically, differed among adults with obesity based on HIV status. 50 PLWH (BMI = 35 kg/m2) and 51 adults without HIV (BMI = 36 kg/m2) completed retrospective assessments of lifetime perceived weight stigma experiences/internalization. Next, participants were invited to complete an optional 2-week Ecological Momentary Assessment study. 28 PLWH and 39 adults without HIV completed five momentary assessments of perceived weight stigma experiences/internalization daily. In covariate-adjusted models, PLWH reported 1.2–2.8 times lower frequency of lifetime and momentary perceived weight stigma experiences than adults without HIV, but levels of retrospectively- and naturalistically-assessed internalized weight stigma did not differ between groups. Findings suggest that HIV status may buffer against perceptions of weight stigma events, but not internalized weight stigma, highlighting weight stigma as an important area for future research in PLWH. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - What mitigates the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants? Addressing this question, we explored how national identification, endorsing binding moral foundations and the perception of threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants in Malta. It was hypothesized that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more prone to identify with being Maltese and more probable to endorse binding moral foundations and perceive high threat from migrants, leading to a more prejudiced attitude towards migrants living in Malta. Two hundred and twenty-two individuals participated in this quantitative study. Results from this study showed that national identification, binding moral foundations and perceived threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants. The implications of the findings for theories about how need for cognitive closure contributes to increased prejudiced attitude in native population is discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The cardio-respiratory function is compromised in children recovering from burns, particularly, those who sustain a burn injury across the chest, which leads to further prejudicial effects on physical and psychosocial health. This study endeavored to explore the efficacy of 12 weeks of graded aerobic exercise (GAEx) on the cardiorespiratory capacity and physical and psychosocial functioning in children with burn sequelae of the chest. Methods: Thirty-six burn-injured children aged 10–18 years (%TBSA: 24.2 ± 4.9, and 38.8 ± 12.9 months since injury) were randomly assigned to GAEx group (n = 18; undergone a 12-week intensity- and time-graded aerobic exercise program plus standard rehabilitation) or control group (n = 18; received the standard rehabilitation only). The cardio-respiratory fitness [marked by the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), minute ventilation (VE), ventilatory equivalent of inhaled oxygen (VEq/VO2), oxygen pulse (O2P), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximum heart rate (HRmax), and the heart rate recovery at one minute (HRR1)] and physical and psychosocial functioning were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: Children in the GAEx group showed significant increases in VO2peak (P = 0.013), VE (P = 0.026), O2P (P = 0.034), HRmax (P = 0.035), and HRR1 (P = 0.04) and declines in VEq/VO2 (P = 0.009) and RER (P = 0.011) as compared to the control group. Additionally, the GAEx group reported higher physical (P = 0.029) and psychosocial (P = 0.012) functioning. Conclusion: Twelve weeks of GAEx has salutary effects on cardio-respiratory capacity and physical and psychosocial functioning in children with burn sequelae of the chest. These findings suggest that adding GAEx as a complementary therapy to the long-term rehabilitation protocol for this patient population is worthwhile. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI

AB  - This ethnographic study explores the co-influences between urban spaces and ethnic hierarchies in the pop-cultural creations of Russian-speaking immigrants of Generation 1.5 in Israel. The theoretical analysis draws on the concepts of orientalism, ethnicity and spatiality in the context of migration. The findings suggest that physical place influences intergroup/ethnic relations that in turn reshape the symbolic meaning of urban spaces. Young immigrant ethnic entrepreneurs have invented the new cultural trope of Mizrahi or Mediterranean Russianness, expressed in various venues of pop culture, in which they are involved as cultural producers: video clips, festivals, music and dance performances. It is a symbolic expression of Hitmazrehut — the Easternization process experienced by them in Israel’s geographic and social periphery. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Inter-ethnic research has been dominated by studies on majority–minority relations. The limited studies on relations among ethnic minority groups are usually restricted to a focus on attitudes and the cognitive domain, with little attention to actual behaviours. As Canada becomes increasingly diverse, it calls for a greater need in examining the interpersonal relationships among ethnic minority groups. A study originally designed to look at intra-group dynamics generated results that led the authors to decentre the dominant majority–minority view and explore inter-ethnic engagements. This report examines the subjective sense-making, actual performance, and management of inter-ethnic relations from Chinese Canadians’ perspectives. Data from individual interviews and focus groups with thirty-five Chinese Canadians show a multidimensional picture: factors such as participants’ needs, circumstances, characteristics, and capacities play a more significant role in shaping relationship development and maintenance. Results also reveal the complex and contingent nature of the sense-making and management of inter-ethnic relationships. These findings call for a more holistic view of individuals’ experiences that include cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study examined Israeli public perceptions of institutional child sexual abuse (CSA) in the Malka Leifer case. Leifer is a Jewish ultra-Orthodox former Melbourne school principal who is wanted in Australia on CSA charges, after fleeing to Israel. Based on a qualitative analysis of 2,451 reader comments retrieved from four Israeli news websites and six public Facebook pages, the findings indicated diverse attitudes toward the alleged perpetrator, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, state authorities, and victims. All parties involved were criticized, but less so the victims. Criticisms included sociopolitical and gender stereotypes, and demonic attributions. Positive comments were directed at all involved, even the alleged perpetrator, and especially the victims. The results demonstrate the need to better understand CSA portrayals in cyberspace, as they affect both public and policymaker attitudes, and the importance of fighting prejudicial discourse about the ultra-Orthodox community, especially in light of its changing attitudes regarding CSA. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In 1967, the University of Maryland’s School of Library and Information Services created a public library in Prince George’s County, Maryland, named the High John Experiment, to give Librarianship and Information Science students experience serving disadvantaged communities and to discover new methods to better serve these communities. From the creation of High John to the present day, University of Maryland publications and unaffiliated works credit High John as a groundbreaking experiment that propelled interests in diversity and inclusion in public libraries. High John’s creators published a 73 paged report for the United States’ Office of Education, accompanied by published articles, that confirms a violation of ethics toward the community High John served. The community was not involved in the implementation or planning of the library and many of the services and materials the library offered were based on prejudiced assumptions instead of community input or research. Although High John garnered supporters, the validity and ethicality behind High John’s intent and methods were called into question during the experiment. The controversy led to debates within the field that resulted in conversations about Librarianship and Information Science pedagogy and appropriate methods in outreach and community engagement for disadvantaged communities. Now that the passionately fueled debates on High John have ceased, the experiment is a distant memory. Although this experiment led to debates about diversity, inclusion, and equity in information access within the United States, this experiment is relevant to information readers on a global scale. Because Librarianship and Information Science has a history rooted in elitism and oppression worldwide, High John warrants further exposure and examination from a diverse pool of contemporary perspectives. Through the application of modern community outreach and engagement practices, this article builds on a critical historical analysis of the experiment and argues High John failed in its mission and violated the community’s trust that it purported to serve. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: As diverse communities continue to be targets of racism and anti-immigrant sentiments permeate current political discourse, the need to prepare a teaching force that understands immigrant children and their families continues to be a critical priority. Purpose: This study explored the ways in which one digital storytelling project that required 20 clinical hours working with English learners (ELs) engaged preservice teachers in learning about immigrant issues. Methodology/Approach: Data in the form of critical reflections, digital storytelling video transcripts, and archival data were collected from undergraduate teacher education candidates over three semesters. Narrative data from participants were analyzed using thematic narrative analysis. Findings/Conclusions: The findings of the study are organized into themes that included enriching experience, transformed attitudes, and stories of resilience. The results showed the ways that preservice teachers’ dispositions about immigration were challenged and how much their understanding of the experiences of ELs was deepened through the experience. Implications: This study offers insight for teacher education programs and shows how experiential pedagogical tools such as digital storytelling and authentic clinical experiences can challenge existing and problematic beliefs and assumptions, helping to build a cadre of teacher advocates of immigrant children. © The Authors 2021.

AB  - Introduction: Sexual prejudice negatively affects the quality of life and life chances of those involved. Manual workers are consistently found to be less accepting of homosexuality in studies of sexual conformism. This can be seen as an application of Lipset’s ‘working class conformism’. Our core hypothesis is that this lower tolerance is rooted in working-class experiences. Counter-arguments are that that social class does not matter in contemporary society and that the relationship is spurious, with education as the true cause. Methods: We test the central hypothesis with European survey data. First, we regress sexual prejudice on time trends and class with repeated cross-sections from the European Social Survey, ranging from 2002 to 2016. As an extra check, this is also applied to the European Values Study, going back to 1981. Further, we test the spuriousness argument with a matching design, testing whether stratification accounts for the lag. Results: The time series shows a stable lag between working-class members and others against the general trend of decreasing sexual prejudice. The matching design provides evidence that working-class membership in itself is a factor behind differences in sexual prejudice. Conclusions: Contrary to ‘death of class’ conjectures, working-class membership is related to sexual prejudice. This contribution shows that this gap is due to experiences of belonging to the working class and not solely to educational differences. Policy Implications: Occupational experiences, especially in low-skill manual labour, have social effects in areas such as sexual prejudice. Improving the quality of work thus facilitates a more inclusive society for sexual minorities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and aim: Psychiatric disorders and antidepressant usage rates have increased over the years. However, prejudice, self, and public stigma continue to impede patients from receiving appropriate treatment, especially in traditional societies. In this study, the views of first and sixth-year medical students were examined. We aimed to show the potential effect of public information and 6 years of medical education on knowledge and awareness. Method: Our target population was first and sixth-year medical students at the Faculty of Medicine at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey, during the semester 2018–2019. For measurement, widely used scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered. In addition, scales formed specifically by our research team: Sociodemographic information form and Depression and Antidepressant Awareness and Knowledge Scale were used. Results: Compared to first-year participants, sixth-year participants had significantly less stigmatizing views on individual statements. The overall stigma score of sixth-year participants was significantly lower (p <.05) than first-year participants. Linear Regression Analysis showed that the only predictor of overall stigma score was the depression score (p <.05, beta = −0.36), which acted as a negative predictor. Discussion: Sixth-year participants had higher rates of diagnosed psychiatric illness and psychiatric drug usage. Interestingly, the score was not a predictor of the overall stigma score. However, in the responses to individual statements, we observed an overall increase in knowledge and decreased stigma among the sixth-year participants compared to first-year participants. The effects of medical education on knowledge are significant overall. On the other hand, the level of knowledge and beliefs of our first-year participants, which are similar to the public, show a worrisome situation indicating that broader public education efforts are needed. Our study shows an encouraging perspective, indicating that public awareness campaigns can be very effective in increasing knowledge and decreasing misconceptions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine weight stigma experiences during medical visits as related to provider-patient relationship factors and adherence among individuals with hypothyroidism. A total of 362 participants recruited via social media participated in an online survey. Regression and mediation analyses indicated that weight stigma was negatively associated with adherence; this relationship was mediated by decreased trust in provider, less perceived provider empathy, and lower provider-patient depth-of-relationship. Structural equation modeling with BMI controlled revealed that weight stigma is associated with worsened provider-patient relationship and adherence. Findings suggest the importance of eliminating weight stigma experiences for patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The ‘securitisation’ of migration is argued to rest on a process of framing migrants as a threat to key values, principally identity. Yet, the socially constructed nature of ‘identity’ implies the potential for dual usage: support and contestation of the security frame. Using the UK as an illustrative case, this overlooked dynamic is explored through mixed-methods, incorporating elite political and religious discourse (2005–2015) and original public attitudinal survey evidence. The discourse analysis reveals that the preservation of an imperilled British identity (‘tolerance’) is a frame invoked, in different ways and by different actors, to either support or contest the securitisation of migration. Similarly, British citizens who deeply value the preservation of ‘Britishness’ have diverse, positive and negative views on migration, challenging the notion that identity as a referent object is deterministically linked to anti-immigration attitudes. The innovative concept of ‘counter-securitisation’ is utilised and developed, unpicking these nuances and their implications. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Transgender (trans) women are at higher risk of sexual violence than cisgender women, with trans women of color reported to be at highest risk. This study examined subjective experiences of sexual violence for 31 trans women of color living in Australia, average age 29 (range 18–54), through in-depth interviews. An additional photovoice activity and follow-up interviews were completed by 19 women. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis and feminist intersectionality theory, identifying the following themes. The first theme, “‘A sexually tinged violation of boundaries’: Defining sexual violence,” examined women’s definition of sexual violence, including staring and verbal abuse, nonconsensual touching and sexual assault, in both public and private contexts. The second theme, “‘Crossing people’s boundaries’: Sexual harassment in the public domain,” examined the frequent sexual harassment women experienced in their daily lives. This included the subtheme, “A hostile gaze: Public staring and ‘weird looks’” and “Mockery and transphobic abuse: Verbal abuse is sexual violence.” The third theme, “‘Crossing bodily boundaries’: Experiences of sexual assault,” included the subthemes “‘Unwanted sexual touch’: Groping and forced sex by strangers,” “Danger in relationships: Sexual assault and manipulation,” “Sexual violence in the context of sex work,” and “‘We’re turned into something we’re not’: Fetishization and the sexual other.” The poor health outcomes experienced by many trans women are closely associated with their exposure to sexual violence and the social inequities and transphobia to which they are subjected. Trans women of color may experience additional prejudice and discrimination due to the intersection of gender, sexuality, race, and social class. Our research suggests that understanding these intersectionalities is integral in understanding the sexual violence experiences of trans women of color. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Turkish-origin migrants on average show lower academic performance than Germans. This achievement gap cannot be fully explained by socio-economic differences between the groups. Negative competence stereotypes about Turkish-origin students predict the causal attributions that German preservice teachers make for migrants’ academic underperformance. Specifically, the more strongly preservice teachers endorse negative competence stereotypes, the more likely they are to attribute academic underperformance of Turkish-origin migrants to the migrants themselves and less to the educational system. Stereotype threat theory posits that the activation of stereotypes in test situations can reduce the performance of members of the negatively stereotyped group. Based on this theory, we propose that negative stereotypes provide a social-psychological explanation for the academic underperformance of Turkish-origin migrants compared to Germans. A series of six experiments conducted within a research project funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research investigated stereotype threat effects for Turkish-origin migrants. Two new moderator variables were identified: implicit theory of intelligence and vertical collectivism. A meta-analysis of the six studies showed a small, non-significant mean effect for stereotype threat main effects, but a significant medium-sized mean effect for moderated stereotype threat effects. Limitations and practical implications of stereotype threat effects in educational settings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Importance: Transphobia and stigma remain barriers to seeking mental health care for gender-diverse adolescents. Objective: To examine the utility of brief social contact-based video interventions of transgender protagonists with depression to reduce transphobia and depression-related stigma and increase treatment-seeking intentions among adolescents in the general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: During August 2021, a total of 1437 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 video-based conditions in a 2:2:1:1 ratio: (1) transgender adolescent girls, (2) transgender adolescent boys, (3) cisgender adolescent girls, or (4) cisgender adolescent boys. Interventions: In each of the approximately 110-second videos, an empowered presenter shared their personal story about coping with depression and reaching out for help. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the score on the Attitudes Toward Transgender Men and Women (ATTMW) scale. Secondary outcomes were (1) a "gender thermometer" rating for warmth in transgender perception, (2) the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) score, and (3) the General Health-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ) score. Results: Of the 1437 randomized participants, 1098 (76%) completed the postintervention assessment and passed all the validity tests (mean [SD] age, 16.9 [1.2] years; 481 [44%] male; 640 [58%] White). A significant change in attitudes toward transgender youth was found within the intervention group only (mean [SD] ATTMW scores: intervention group, 34.6 [23.1] at baseline to 32.8 [24.2] after intervention; P <.001; control group, 33.5 [23.4] at baseline to 32.4 [24.1] after intervention; P =.01). The mean (SD) total DSS scores decreased significantly across study groups (intervention: 1.3 [3.3]; control: 1.7 [3.3]; P <.001). A significant increase in intention to seek help from a parent was found in the intervention (mean [SD] GHSQ score, 0.2 [1.1]) and control (mean [SD] GHSQ score, 0.3 [1.2]) groups (P <.001), as was a decrease in those not wanting to seek help from anyone (mean [SD] GHSQ score: intervention, 0.2 [1.6], P =.009; control, 0.3 [1.2], P <.001) Secondary analyses revealed significant differences in baseline ATTMW scores and intervention effects between transgender and gender-diverse and cisgender participants and between lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (LGBQ) and straight participants (F = 36.7, P <.001) and heterosexual participants (F = 37.0, P <.001). A significant difference was also found in mean (SD) transgender warmth scores from baseline to after intervention between groups (2.6° [13.1°] in the intervention group vs 0.4° [8.3°] in the control group; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, brief social contact-based videos proved efficacious in reducing transphobia and depression-related stigma and in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among adolescents in the general population. By personifying, individualizing, and providing face and voice to the experience of transgender youth, other adolescents, especially those who are cisgender and/or of a heterosexual orientation, can gain empathetic insights into the lives of their often marginalized and stigmatized fellow youth.

AB  - Gender inequalities are still persistent despite the growing policy efforts to combat them. Sexism, which is an evaluative tendency leading to different treatment of people based on their sex and to denigration (hostile sexism) or enhancement (benevolent sexism) of certain dispositions as gendered attributes, plays a significant role in strengthening these social inequalities. As it happens with many other attitudes, sexism is mainly transmitted by influencing parental styles and socialization practices. This study focused on the association between parents' hostile and benevolent sexism toward women and their socialization values (specifically, conservation and self-transcendence), that are the values parents would like their children to endorse. We took both parents' and children's sex into account in the analyses. One-hundred-sixty-five Italian parental couples with young adult children participated in the study. Parents, both the mother and the father, individually filled in a self-report questionnaire composed of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Findings showed that mothers' benevolent sexism was positively related to their desire to transmit conservation values to their sons and daughters. This result was also found for fathers, but with a moderation effect of children's sex. Indeed, the positive relationship between fathers' benevolent sexism and conservation was stronger in the case of sons than of daughters. Moreover, fathers' benevolent sexism was positively associated with self-transcendence values. Finally, fathers' hostile sexism was positively associated with conservation and negatively with self-transcendence. Limitations of the study, future research developments, and practical implications of the results are discussed. Copyright © 2022 Barni, Fiorilli, Romano, Zagrean, Alfieri and Russo.

AB  - Ageism is a stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination against people, based on age. Ageism may impact the quality of life and the care of older people, a problem that can be greater when the older person is “frail.” However, few studies explored the role of frailty as a factor related to ageism. The aim of this study was to assess the association between perceived age discrimination (PAD), i.e., ageism, and multidimensional frailty in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults. We enrolled 1,337 community-dwelling subjects over-65 years that filled out a structured questionnaire to collect psycho-socio-economic and behavioral information. Multidimensional frailty was assessed by the SELFY-Multidimensional Prognostic Index Short-Form (SELFY-MPI-SF). PAD, over the past 5 years, was assessed based on explicit criteria. Overall, 83 out of 1,337 participants (6.2%) reported PAD. These subjects were older, more frequently women, with greater economic difficulties, lower level of cultural fruition, social network and psychological well-being, and a greater degree of frailty compared to their counterparts. After adjustment for age and gender, multidimensional frailty (SELFY-MPI-SF score) and negative affectivity were the two only “predictors” significantly associated with PAD (SELFY -MPI-SF, Odds Ratio: 1.19, 95%CI: 1.029–1.370; PANAS negative: Odds Ratio: 1.06, 95%CI: 1.033–1.099). In conclusion, self-reported frailty and negative affectivity are independently associated with PAD in community-dwelling older people. Interventions to prevent and treat frailty could be useful to reduce ageism and improve the well-being of the older people.

AB  - In recent years the international community has acknowledged the importance of gender perspectives in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), arguing that social constructs of gender lead to structural inequalities, prejudices and biases that articulate people's disaster vulnerabilities and capabilities in all disaster phases. Studies showed that especially women are prone to gender-based disaster risks, and it is the responsibility of national governments not only to identify these vulnerabilities but also to develop disaster education and preparedness strategies to address them. To better understand gender-based disaster vulnerability in Japan, this study identifies factors of disaster vulnerabilities of women within a complex set of social and community norms and values, stressing the impact of public discourses of gender. Then, this paper addresses the questions: “What are the disaster vulnerabilities of women in Japan?” and “What is the impact of discourses of gender on disaster vulnerabilities of women in disaster preparedness Japan?“. To address the first question, factors of vulnerability were identified through Grounded Theory based on data collected from participant observations and stakeholder interviews. Then, the impact of discourses around gender was extracted from the literature on gender and DRR using Critical Discourse Analysis. The study results show that the main factors of gendered disaster vulnerability are inadequate disaster education, a lack of protection measures, and cultural issues. Moreover, public discourses of gender are shown to not only shape these factors but to be deeply embedded in Japan's disaster preparedness strategies at large affecting both the quality and quantity of disaster information available. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent research contends that the behavioral immune system, operating largely outside conscious awareness, motivates individuals to exhibit higher levels of prejudice toward unfamiliar out-groups. This research finds that individual variance in disgust sensitivity correlates with support for political policies that facilitate the avoidance of out-groups. We were interested in developing less intrusive indicators of disgust sensitivity via olfactory measures (i.e., ratings of disgusting odors) and behavioral measures (e.g., willingness to touch disgusting objects) and studying the association between measures of disgust sensitivity and in-group bias among children and adults. We submitted a registered report to conduct this research and received an in-principle acceptance. Unfortunately, unforeseen events impaired our data collection, leaving us with a limited sample (nchildren = 32, nadults = 29) and reducing our ability to draw reliable conclusions from our results. In this essay, we describe our motivation and plan of research, the events that made completing the research impossible, and our preliminary results. In doing so, we hope to offer support for studying the effects of the behavioral immune system, even in ways that we did not originally plan. We conclude with a reflection on the value of registered reports for advancing science. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Purpose: As COVID-19 cases rose in the US, so too did instances of discrimination against Asians. The current research seeks to understand and document discrimination toward Asians in the US specifically linked to the global pandemic (study 1). The authors test hypotheses based in social categorization and intergroup contact theories, demonstrating perceived pandemic blame is a mechanism for discrimination (study 2). Design/methodology/approach: In study 1, the authors survey Asians living in the US regarding experiences and perceptions of COVID-19-related discrimination. In study 2, a two-time point survey examined whether participant perceptions of pandemic blame toward China predict discriminatory behavior toward Asians. Findings: Study 1 demonstrated that 22.5% of US-residing Asians report personally encountering pandemic-related discrimination. Study 2 indicated that COVID-19 blame attributions toward China predicted anticipated hiring bias and increased physical distancing of Asians at work, associated with higher levels of US identification. Research limitations/implications: The findings have theoretical implications for research on blame and stigmatization, as well as practical implications regarding bias mitigation. Originality/value: The present studies advance understanding of event-based blame as a driver of prejudice and discrimination at work and suggest organizations attend to bias mitigation in conjunction with uncertainty reduction communications in challenging times. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw on data from interviews with six Italian migrant service providers and media stories in Italy and Australia to weave a comparative snapshot of the plight of precarious migrant and refugee communities in these two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The article draws attention to prejudicial shortcomings towards vulnerable migrant communities enacted by the states of Italy and Australia in response to COVID-19. Findings: While the unequal ecology of the pandemic has flared up the need for the State to strengthen participation and inclusion policies, it has also provided opportunities to foreground the disadvantages vulnerable communities face that also demand policy attention and sustained funding. Governments in migrant-receiving countries like Australia and Italy need to articulate culturally sensitive and inclusive responses that foreground agencies give vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and refugees clear, supportive messages of solidarity leading to practical solutions. Originality/value: This paper relays preliminary data from the coalface (migrant service providers) and media as the pandemic evolved in the two countries, whose support mechanisms had never before been critically compared and evaluated through the lens of racial inequality in the face of a health and social crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) has often been referred to as an “empathy machine.” This is mostly because it can induce empathy through embodiment experiences in outgroup membership. However, the potential of intergroup contact with an outgroup avatar in VR to increase empathy is less studied. Even though intergroup contact literature suggests that less threatening and more prosocial emotions are the key to understanding why intergroup contact is a powerful mean to decrease prejudice, few studies have investigated the effect of intergroup contact on empathy in VR. In this study, we developed a between-participants design to investigate how VR can be used to create a positive intergroup contact with a member of a stigmatized outgroup (ethnic minority) and present the results of the effect of intergroup contact in VR on empathy. Sixty four participants experienced either positive contact (i.e., equal intergroup status, collaborative) with a black (experimenter-controlled) avatar (experimental condition) or no intergroup contact (i.e., ingroup contact with a white avatar; control condition), with situational empathy (personal distress and empathic interest) being measured through a self-report questionnaire up to a week before and right after the VR contact experience. The experiment showed that satisfying degrees of body ownership of participants’ own avatar and co-presence with the contacted avatar can be achieved in simple and universally accessible virtual environments such as AltspaceVR. The results indicated that while VR intergroup contact had no significant direct effect on empathy, exploratory analyses indicated that post-intervention empathic interest increased with stronger feelings of co-presence in the intergroup contact condition.

AB  - Although the notions of privilege and marginalization have become a common theme in research, the application of these concepts to extralocal teachers of English (ETEs; i.e., non-local, non-native, or native foreign English teachers who are not citizens of the national community in which they teach) in applied linguistics has been problematic. Much of this research has equated characteristics of marginalization with implicit bias and structural inequity, and privilege as immunity to such prejudice and discrimination, while other work has viewed these constructs as subjective feelings influencing foreign teacher identities. These problematic depictions of privilege and marginalization have resulted in a contradictory situation where an ETE may be simultaneously privileged and marginalized. Using an autoethnographic approach, this paper examines the first author’s experiences in developing their identity as a researcher while trying to critically resolve ethical dilemmas, potential criticisms, and feelings of academic inferiority and diffidence, which are seldom addressed in similar research undertakings. This article reports the learning journey of a developing researcher in creating a usable operationalization of the constructs of privilege and marginalization, with attention paid to the aspects of working contexts and social perceptions that emerged within the literature, and the influence of such factors on the self-image of ETEs in Thailand. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 4.0 International License.

AB  - The process of Jungian analysis is reviewed and considered as inexorably intertwined with our lives in society and with aspects of our social interactions that long for interpersonal and restorative justice. Various models are reviewed, including Fanon, Gambini, Kimbles, Levine, Saban – each with an eye toward Jung’s injunction that we must move beyond ‘knowledge’ toward ‘eating and digesting’, thereby metabolizing and shifting our way of living. Dissociated aspects of the analytic couple are discussed, both as represented by and articulating transgenerational issues, phantoms, and as presented in often neglected aspects of embodiment. Jeremy Harris’s Slave Play is offered as an amplification of ubiquitous and unacknowledged transgenerational presences in our analytic interactions. Clinical examples explore countertransference aspects that illustrate Jung’s challenge, such as an unwitting prejudice toward analysis as equalling transformation and integrating resolution, or toward analysis as leaving unexamined the presumptions of class structures and privilege. A personal dream is offered to illustrate a necessary reorientation of the analyst’s ego toward an attitude in which rebirth comes only in and through interaction with the collective. It is argued that only with such interaction, which manifests movement toward social justice, is there an efficacious analysis. © 2022, The Society of Analytical Psychology.

AB  - Valuing diversity and intergroup contact predict less prejudice and discrimination, yet their relationship deserves closer attention. There is some evidence that valuing diversity and intergroup contact are associated, but it has not been tested whether the established effects of contact come about through changes in valuing diversity. We address this in two studies (total N = 2835) that consider valuing diversity as a mediator of intergroup contact. They show that valuing diversity mediates the relationships of intergroup contact with prejudice, bystander intervention intentions, policy support and approach intentions. Our results increase the understanding of pathways from intergroup contact to intergroup relations and offer a lever that contact interventions can target. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations and various countries committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The 17 goals revolve around 3 main axes: eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring peace and prosperity for all people by 2030. These goals are integrated so that interventions in one area inevitably affect the others. Undoubtedly, this application involves developing competencies related to Prejudice, conflict resolution, and empowerment. Our research aims to analyse the knowledge and competency of university students undergoing specific training to facilitate the application of UNESCO’s objectives in their work performance, while incorporating human rights as a basis for all future actions. A total of 241 students from the University of Salamanca participated. The average age of the sample was 21.13 years; 76.8% were female, and 23.2% were male (22.41 ± 7.17 years old). The data collection protocol included questions related to knowledge of the Sustainable Development Goals and involving SDGs in their personal life and future profession, which were assessed using the empowerment Scale, the Conflictalk Scale, and the Subtle and Overt Bias Scale. Significant differences were found between SDGs knowledge and involvement with academic courses. There was a direct relationship between this knowledge and involvement with the control, esteem, and activism dimensions of the Empowerment Scale, cooperative from the Conflictalk Scale, and positive emotions had inverse relationships with threat–rejection, and traditional values from the prejudice scale. Our study found that students who are more engaged with the SDGs resolve conflicts cooperatively, foster community activism, and experience positive emotions, whereas students with aggressive conflict resolution are more Prejudiced. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Scholars have proposed that cumulative experiences of anti-fat bias and stigma contribute to detrimental physical activity experiences, as well as social and health inequities. The objective of this research was to explore how enacted weight stigma experiences are constructed and impact women's physical activity experiences long term. Eighteen women who identified as having had negative experiences related to their body weight, shape, or size in physical activity contexts participated in semistructured interviews. Using reflexive thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (a) norms of body belonging, (b) distancing from an active identity, (c) at war with the body, and (d) acts of resistance. These findings deepen understandings of how historical experiences of weight stigma can have longstanding consequences on physical activity cognitions, emotions, and behaviors. To equitably promote physical activity, it is imperative that movement spaces (e.g., fitness centers, sport organizations) both target anti-fat stigma and adopt weight-inclusive principles. © 2022 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Ageism refers to the stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination towards others or oneself due to age, and it is the most prevalent type of social disadvantage, even more so than those due to gender and race, with negative effects worldwide. Ageism is an evidently real social problem that needs to be addressed and fought. Our study has two main objectives: firstly, to study to what extent programmes, projects or actions have been developed to combat ageism around the world; and secondly, to what extent they have been evaluated via the positive outcomes registered by the participants. Two different information sources were used: (a) a literature review of ageism programmes or interventions; and (b) an online questionnaire sent to international and national institutions surveying their policies or programmes against ageism. Our results show a relatively high number of actions combating ageism but a lack of a systematic evaluation of the outcomes of those actions. In conclusion, first, it is necessary to develop programmes and actions combating ageism, and the evaluation of these programmes is urgently needed in order to identify strategies that truly and effectively tackle ageism. There is a need to urge institutions to perform external evaluations of their anti-ageism social policies and to encourage scientists to conduct randomized and controlled studies. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Given the training and experience of lawyers, we assumed that a study of lawyers’ willingness to disclose disability in the workplace would provide an example of the actions of a group knowledgeable about disability law. The current study accounts for the effect of visibility of disability, onset and type of disability, and whether the lawyer has made an accommodation request. We also investigate the role of other individual characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, race/ethnicity, age, and job-related characteristics, in willingness to disclose. Methods: We use data from the first phase of a longitudinal national survey of lawyers in the USA to estimate the odds of disclosing disability to co-workers, management, and clients using proportional odds models. Results: Lawyers with less visible disabilities, those with mental health disabilities, and those who work for smaller organizations have lower odds of disclosing to co-workers, management, and clients as compared to their counterparts. Attorneys who have requested accommodations are more willing to disclose as compared to those who have not, but only to co-workers and management. Women are less likely than men to disclose to management and clients. However, gender is not a significant determinant of disclosure to co-workers. Older attorneys are more likely to disclose to clients, whereas attorneys with children are less likely to disclose to co-workers. Lastly, lower perceived prejudice and the presence of co-workers with disabilities are associated with higher disclosure scores, but not for all groups. Conclusions: Individuals who acquired a disability at a relatively early point in life and those with more visible disabilities are more likely to disclose. However, such willingness is affected by the intersection of disability with other individual and firm-level characteristics. Implications for Cancer Survivors. The findings imply that those with less visible disabilities and with health conditions acquired later in life are less likely to disclose. The relevance of the findings is heightened by the altered work conditions and demands imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic for cancer survivors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: To analyze the impact and distribution of blood groups in different ethnicities and the extent of susceptibility to infection with COVID-19 in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 4,609 COVID-19 patients from five ethnic groups to assess the impact and distribution of different blood types and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. The study was carried out between November 2020 and June 2021 in the College of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University in collaboration with the General Directorate of Health Affairs, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Results: Blood group)A, B, and O(distributions in 2,617 COVID-19 patients with local control populations was done. Our study found that in both Saudi and non-Saudi populations, blood groups O and A were associated with higher infection rates, whereas blood group AB was associated with lower infection rates)p=0.0001(. COVID-19 seems to be associated with blood groups A, B, and AB)RR=3.23, 95% CI=2.702-3.821, p=0.0001(. COVID-19 risk was lower in people with O blood group)RR=0.783, 95% CI=0.733-0.836, p=0.0001(. South Asians had higher odds of COVID-19 infection when compared to Saudi cases and other ethnic groups)OR=1.12, 95 % CI: 1.074-1.24, p=0.04(. Conclusion: We emphasize that COVID-19 infection is not proportional among ethnically related blood groups. Notably, RhD-negative protect against COVID-19, whereas A and O blood types are more susceptible. Thus, when assessing COVID-19 prognosis and vaccination priority, blood groups A and O are critical. © 2022 Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stigma related to mental health and substance use (MHSU) is a wellestablished construct that describes how inequitable health outcomes can result from prejudice, discrimination, and marginalization. Although there is a body of literature on educational approaches to reduce stigma, antistigma education for MHSU has primarily focused on stigma at the social, interpersonal/ public, and personal (self-stigma) levels, with little attention to the problem of structural stigma. Structural stigma refers to how inequity is manifested through rules, policies, and procedures embedded within organizations and society at large. Structural stigma is also prominent within clinical learning environments and can be transmitted through role modeling, resulting in inequitable treatment of vulnerable patient populations. Addressing structural stigma through education, therefore, has the potential to improve equity and enhance care. A promising educational approach for addressing structural stigma is structural competency, which aims to enhance health professionals' ability to recognize and respond to social and structural determinants that produce or maintain health disparities. In this article, the authors propose a framework for addressing structural MHSU stigma in health professions education that has 4 key components and is rooted in structural humility: Recognizing structural forms of stigma; reflecting critically on one's own assumptions, values, and biases; reframing language away from stereotyping toward empathic terms; and responding with actions that actively dismantle structural MHSU stigma. The authors propose evidence-informed and practical suggestions on how structural competency may be applied within clinical learning environments to dismantle structural MHSU stigma in organizations and society at large. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Mixed-race African German and Vietnamese German children were born around 1921, when troops drawn from the French colonial empire occupied the Rhineland. These children were forcibly sterilized in 1937. Racial anthropologists had denounced them as "Rhineland Bastards," collected details on them, and persuaded the Nazi public health authorities to sterilize 385 of them. One of the adolescents later gave public interviews about his experiences. Apart from Hans Hauck, very few are known by name, and little is known about how their sterilization affected their lives. None of the 385 received compensation from the German state, either as victims of coerced sterilization or as victims of Nazi medical research. The concerned human geneticists went unprosecuted. © 2022 American Public Health Association Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Starting off by categorizing the specific means through which modernity manifests itself in the field of religion and utilizing an ethnography-based methodological strategy, the following paper documents the emergence of Zalmoxianism, a contemporary replica of the religion of the Dacians, which are considered the ancestors of Romanians; they used to inhabit areas around the Carpathians and the Lower Danube before the Roman Conquest (106 A.D.). While subscribing to the theoretical precepts meant to surpass the sociological prejudice according to which modernity exhausts a religiously transcendent view on the world, this paper closely analyzes the conceptual deconstruction of secularization as a total phenomenon while sat the same time isolating the social actor as a non-secularized segment. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - For many years, mental health has been hidden behind a veil of shame and prejudice. In 2017, studies claimed that 10.7% of the global population suffered from mental health disorders. Recently, people started seeking relaxing treatment through technology, which enhanced and ex-panded mental health care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the use of mental health forums, websites, and applications has increased by 95%. However, these solutions still have many limits, as existing mental health technologies are not meant for everyone. In this work, an up-to-date literature review on state-of-the-art of mental health and healthcare solutions is provided. Then, we focus on Arab-speaking patients and propose an intelligent tool for mental health intent recognition. The proposed system uses the concepts of intent recognition to make mental health diagnoses based on a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Experiments are conducted using a dataset collected at the Military Hospital of Tunis in Tunisia. Results show excellent performance of the proposed system (the accuracy is over 92%, the precision, recall, and F1 scores are over 94%) in mental health patient diagnosis for five aspects (depression, suicidality, panic disorder, social phobia, and adjustment disorder). In addition, the tool was tested and evaluated by medical staff at the Military Hospital of Tunis, who found it very interesting to help decision-making and prioritizing patient appointment scheduling, especially with a high number of treated patients every day. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Rationale: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth consume more alcohol than their heterosexual, cisgender peers. The experience of minority stress is theorized to explain these disparities. Research often neglects the day-to-day variability in minority stress that SGM youth encounter and whether alcohol use is associated with daily experiences of minority stress. Further, there is heterogeneity in alcohol use among SGM youth. Sex assigned at birth and gender identity could potentially explain this heterogeneity. Objective: Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether daily experiences of minority stress were associated with daily alcohol use among SGM youth and how these associations differed by sex assigned at birth and gender identity. Methods: A 14-day daily diary study was conducted among 393 Dutch SGM youth (M age = 18.36 SD = 2.65). Results: Results showed few significant associations between both mean levels of minority stress and daily experiences with minority stress with alcohol use. However, higher mean levels of prejudice events were associated with higher odds of daily alcohol use (OR = 7.01, 95% CI: 1.20–40.89). Daily experiences with identity concealment were associated with lower odds of daily alcohol use for males (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60–0.86), but not for females (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.93–1.32). Further, for cisgender youth, daily experiences with prejudice events were associated with higher odds of alcohol use (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.05–3.78), but this was not the case for gender minority youth (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.15–1.18). Conclusions: The findings showed few significant associations between minority stressors and alcohol use, but daily experiences of concealment and prejudice events were associated with daily alcohol use and these associations varied by sex assigned at birth and gender identity, respectively. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Problem: Prejudices can impair social participation of people with epilepsy. Methods: From 2019 to 2020, we invited people with epilepsy and their relatives across Germany to fill in a questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and thirty people with epilepsy (PWE, median age: 40 years; min./max.: 19/83; 66% female) and 103 relatives (REL, median age: 42 years; min./max. 23/70; 83% female) took part in the survey. 44% PWE and 40% REL said prejudices against PWE had not declined in recent years. Of PWE, 64% reported they had experienced prejudices themselves. In an open question with multiple answers possible, 71% of the PWE described concrete prejudices against PWE, 62% of the REL did so. The reported prejudices concerned symptoms of epilepsy (37% PWE; 23% REL), academic or occupational performance (47% PWE; 38% REL), social or family life (27% PWE, 29% REL), and other topics (7% PWE, 4% REL). Of PWE, 88% said all or almost all relatives knew about their condition, 74% stated this applied to all or almost all friends, and 48% told all or almost all colleagues about their epilepsy. Of PWE, 94% would want to know if a relative had epilepsy, 87% would like to know about a friend's epilepsy, 70% about a colleague's epilepsy. Fear of stigmatization was a reason for not always communicating the condition according to 20% PWE and 63% REL. None of PWE and 16% of REL named shame as a reason. Conclusion: People with epilepsy still experience prejudices and fear of stigmatization hinders an open communication about the condition. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This community-based action research study aimed to better understand the dialogical process underlying deep canvassing (Denizet-Lewis, 2016), a social justice intervention technique for engaging in nonconfrontational discussions designed to constructively challenge prejudicial attitudes. Previously, it has been suggested, but not demonstrated, that cognitive dissonance and perspective taking may serve as the mechanisms of change that facilitate shifts in the process of these dialogues. In the current study, 15 anti-racist deep canvassing conversations with White individuals were facilitated by White canvassers working with Showing Up for Racial Justice New York City. A dialogical approach was used to address the question of what intrapsychic and interpersonal processes occurred in these conversations on the topic of reparations. Themes included Interpersonal Agreement, Intervoice Dynamics, Authoring the Self and the Other, and Bringing in Personal Experience. We discuss the results and implications for future action research with prejudice reduction interventions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: It is crucial to determine the intercultural sensitivity of nursing students who will provide care to refugees in the future and to examine their perspectives, experiences, and views on providing care to refugees. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe nursing students' perspectives and caregiving experiences with refugees in Turkey. Design: This study was conducted with a phenomenological approach in a qualitative design. Settings, participants, methods: The sample of the study consisted of 10 intern nursing students with purposive sampling method in their last year of education at the bachelor level for nursing who had experience of caring for refugees and voluntary participation in this study. The data was collected through in-depth interviews conducted with a semi-structured interview form. MAXQDA program was used to code qualitative data. Results: 74 codes gathered under four themes with related subthemes as follows: a) Perspective on refugees with three subthemes: Health, social and economic perspective, b) Barriers in cultural care and two subthemes: Barriers on language and communication and problem-solving technique, c) Feelings and barriers in nursing care, d) Recommendations and five subthemes: society, refugees government, health services, and nursing education. Students expressed that language and communication were the most significant problems when they gave care to patients. They felt helpless, insufficient, and afraid of making mistakes in providing care due to communication barriers. Nursing students suggested that education is an essential factor to increasing awareness and break prejudice towards refugees. Conclusions: Language and communication were the greatest problems when students gave care to refugees patients. Language problems could be managed by using interpreters in hospitals to decrease cultural conflicts and provide equal healthcare. In order to increase students' cultural sensitivity and awareness, organizing training and integrating the concept of intercultural in nursing education into the curriculum could be suggested, and students should receive training to ensure they can provide culturally competent nursing care. © 2021

AB  - Internalized weight stigma (IWS) is independently associated with less intuitive eating (i.e., eating based on endogenous hunger/satiety cues) and higher Body Mass Index (BMI), and intuitive eating training is commonly conceptualized as protective against the effects of IWS on poor behavioral health. The 3-way relationship between IWS, intuitive eating, and BMI has yet to be examined, and it is unclear whether the link between IWS and BMI is buffered by high intuitive eating. This secondary preliminary analysis examined baseline data of stressed adults with poor diet (N = 75, 70% female, 64.1% White, 42.7% with overweight/obesity) in a parent clinical trial that tested the effects of yoga on diet and stress. Validated self-report surveys of IWS and intuitive eating were analyzed with objectively-assessed BMI. Moderated regression analyses using the SPSS PROCESS macro tested whether intuitive eating moderated the IWS-BMI link. The analysis revealed IWS was positively associated with BMI except among people with high intuitive eating. Results extend observational findings linking intuitive eating to lower BMI, and offer preliminary support for the hypothesis that this link may hold even among those with greater IWS. It's possible that individuals with lower BMI and greater IWS may gravitate more towards intuitive eating than those with greater BMI, and/or intuitive eating may be an important target for ameliorating the adverse association of IWS with behavioral and physical health indicators linked to BMI. Continued work is warranted in larger, more generalizable samples using causal and prospective designs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Family therapy practice in the UK, as elsewhere in the world, takes place within the context of structural and systemic racism. Hence the practice of family therapy has the potential to mirror racist and colonialist tropes found within society. There are low levels of satisfaction by people from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds to the level of sensitivity to culture and racism that takes place in therapy. This paper explores ways a systemic psychotherapy might be more sensitive to differences in race and culture. Drawing upon systemic and anthropological constructions of culture, suggestions are made for practice that is more questioning of the barely conscious or unconscious assumptions made by the therapist, which can then lead to open scrutiny of these assumptions. In doing so, I draw upon my own experiences, and those of my own family, of racism, of culture and of movement across cultures. Practitioner points Structural racism in society will find its way into the therapy room unless therapists are open to an examination of their own prejudices and often unconscious assumptions. Such an examination then opens the way to forms of practice that are more sensitive to differences of race and culture. A form of practice more sensitive to race and culture is proposed as a systemic response to racism, whilst keeping in mind the need for change at a social and political level. © 2021 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice

AB  - Produced water (PW) is the main waste produced by oil and gas industry, and its treatment represents an environmental and economical challenge for governments and the industry itself. Microbial fuel cells (MFC) emerge as an ecofriendly technology able to harvest energy and remove pollutants at the same time, however high internal resistance is a key problem limiting their operating performance and practical application. In this work, a novel continuous up-flow MFC was designed and fed solely using PW under different flowrates. Effects of the different flowrates (0 mL/s, 0.2 mL/s, 0.4 mL/s, and 0.6 mL/s) in power production performance and pollutants removal were analyzed. Our results demonstrated the removal efficiency of all the pollutants improved when flowrate incremented from 0 to 0.4 mL/s (COD: 96%, TDS: 22%, sulfates: 64%, TPH: 89%), but decreased when 0.6 mL/s was applied. The best power density of 227 mW/m2 was achieved in a flowrate of 0.4 mL/s. Similar to the pollutant's removal, the power density increased together with the increment of flowrate and decreased when 0.6 mL/s was used. The reason for the performance fluctuation was the decrement of internal resistance from 80 Ω (batch mode) to 20 Ω (0.4 mL/s), and then the sudden increment to 90 Ω for 0.6 mL/s. A flow simulation revealed that until 0.4 mL/s the flow was organized and helped protons to arrive in the membrane faster, but flowrate of 0.6 mL/s created turbulence which prejudiced the transportation of protons incrementing the internal resistance. Microbial community analysis of the biofilm found that Desulfuromonas, Desulfovibrio and Geoalkalibacter were dominant bacteria in charge of pollutant removal and electricity production. This study can be helpful in guiding the use of continuous-flow MFC for PW treatment, and to accelerate the practical application of MFC technology in oil industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: There are racial differences in COVID-19 vaccination rates, but social factors, such as lack of health insurance or food insecurity, may explain some of the racial disparities. Objective: To assess social factors, including insurance coverage, that may affect COVID-19 vaccination as of June–July 2021 and vaccine hesitancy among those not yet vaccinated, and how these may affect racial equity in vaccinations. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative survey data. Participants: Adults 18 to 64 participating in the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey for June 23 to July 5, 2021. Main Measures: Vaccination: receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy: among those not yet vaccinated, intent to definitely or probably not get vaccinated. Key Results: In unadjusted analyses, black adults were less likely to be vaccinated than other respondents, but, after social factors were included, including health insurance status, food sufficiency, income and education, and state-level political preferences, differences between black and white adults were no longer significant and Hispanics were more likely to be vaccinated (OR = 1.87, p <.001). Among those not yet vaccinated, black and Hispanic adults were vaccine hesitant than white adults (ORs =.37 and.45, respectively, both p <.001) and insurance status and food insufficiency were not significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. The percent of state voters for former President Trump in 2020 was significantly associated with lower vaccination rates and with increased vaccine hesitancy. Discussion: The results indicate that much of the gap in COVID vaccination rates for minority adults are due to social barriers, rather than differences in racial attitudes. Unvaccinated minority adults expressed less vaccine hesitancy than white adults. Social barriers like food insecurity and insurance coverage could have deterred prompt COVID-19 vaccinations. Reducing these problems might help increase vaccination rates. © 2021, Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - Our perception of someone's accent influences our expectations about what they might say or do. In this experiment, EEG data were recorded while participants listened to cliché sentences matching or not the stereotypes associated with the speaker's accent (upper-class Parisian accent or banlieue accent, a negatively connoted accent associated with youth from suburban areas; e.g. “I always listen to rap in my car” said with a banlieue accent (congruent) or an upper-class accent (incongruent)). Mismatches between social accent and stereotypical content triggered an event-related potential (ERP) known as the N400, albeit more anterior than the one observed for semantic violations, as well as a P3. These results are in line with other studies – conducted in particular with gender stereotypes – suggesting that stereotypes are stored in semantic categorical knowledge and that mismatches trigger integration difficulties and checking and updating mechanisms, and extend them to socially marked accents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Masculine Honor Beliefs comprise an ideology that it is acceptable for people (especially men) to defend their reputation through violent or aggressive measures. Previous research has shown that this ideology is associated with more disparagement of, and social distancing from, gay or effeminate men. However, little research has examined how men higher in masculine honor beliefs perceive their son coming out as gay, as well as how third-party observers perceive a father whose son comes out as gay. Across two studies (total N = 464) we examined the influence masculine honor beliefs had on a participants' levels of support or rejection toward their son coming out as gay in a hypothetical vignette scenario (Study 1) and how third-party observers perceived both the (hypothetical) father and son after the son came out (Study 2). Consistent with our hypotheses, higher levels of masculine honor beliefs were associated with more sexual prejudice, more negative perceptions of the sons who came out as gay in the vignettes (and their fathers), and stronger expectations for the father to reject the son's identity. Further, fathers experienced significantly greater negative self-directed affect highlighting the importance of studying masculinity as a factor of negative attitudes toward gay men. © 2021

AB  - Does the structure of a city influence how its residents feel about migrants? Jane Jacobs railed against modernist planners who sought to replace the complex fabric of cities with suburbanized designs that prioritized sunshine and greenery. She theorized that this design trend had resulted in few opportunities for neighbours to interact with each other. In today's diverse cities, neighbourly interaction may be one key to enhancing social cohesion. Intergroup contact has been shown to reduce prejudice, and recent studies have found that even “mere-exposure” may have a positive effect. Taken together, the work of urban theorists and contact theorists implies that residents of compact cities should be more likely to hold positive attitudes toward their neighbours—including migrants. Recent research, however, casts doubt on how well contact theory applies to the lived diversity of modern cities. This paper uses data from 22 European cities to identify a relationship between one's attitude toward migrants and the design of the city in which they live. It finds that, when controlling for individual- and city-level factors, residents of cities high in “continuous urban fabric” are more likely to agree that migrants are good for their city. © 2021 The Author

AB  - Are anti-prejudice norms against immigrants shared worldwide? Although previous studies found that prejudice against immigrants is considered socially undesirable, these studies were conducted exclusively in Western societies and we have little knowledge of the awareness of anti-prejudice norms against immigrants outside of these societies. We use the case of Japan, where people tend to believe that the society is ethnically homogeneous, expecting that this context-specific notion mitigates the awareness of anti-prejudice norms. We conducted two list experiments using online surveys and compared the answers to those of list experiments and direct questions about attitudes towards immigrants to reveal Japanese citizens’ perceptions of norms. The results show that Japanese citizens attempt to show more negative attitudes upon direct questions than in list experiments, indicating that it is normative to express prejudice against immigrants rather than suppressing it. These results suggest anti-prejudice norms against immigrants are context-dependent and not universally shared. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Unfair advantages can be created either intentionally (e.g., cheating) or unintentionally (e.g., unintended benefit). Little is known regarding how children evaluate different types of advantages in situations where group identity and group membership are made salient. To investigate how children's group identity influences their evaluations and attribution of intentions in intergroup contexts, children were presented with three hypothetical advantages (unintentionally unfair, intentionally unfair, and fair) in a competitive context created by either an in-group member or an out-group member. Children (N = 120) were 4–6 years of age (n = 59; Mage = 5.29 years) and 7–10 years of age (n = 61; Mage = 8.34 years), including 64 girls and 56 boys. Participants were 67% European American, 18% African American, 11% Asian American, and 4% Hispanic. All participants were assigned to one of two teams in a contest in order to create an in-group/out-group manipulation prior to their evaluation of the actions. Out-group members viewed unintentional unfair and fair advantages as less acceptable than in-group members, but in-group and out-group members were equally negative in their assessment of an intentional transgression. When reasoning about unintentional and intentional unfair advantages, older children referenced the intentions of the advantage creator to justify their decisions more than younger children, whereas younger children reasoned about the impact of the behavior on their team more than older children. These novel findings shed light on developmental and social factors influencing children's understanding of fairness and intentionality in everyday contexts. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cultural divides and prejudice complicate the processes of integration and acculturation of migrant families living in a foreign country. Evaluating the impact of such phenomenon can be crucial for social stability and policy making. In this context, the education system has a leading role in fostering and attaining social integration, in particular when it comes to younger sections of the migrant population. In this work, we propose a method for the construction of a quantitative indicator capturing social integration of second generation students in the Italian school system according to areas defined by nationality of the students and administrative region in which they attend school. The indicator, based on survey data, is estimated by means of a 2-step methodology. In the first step, we choose an individual qualitative variable capturing social integration at the unit level, and we compute a first direct estimate of the indicator as the proportion of highly integrated students in each area. Such variable is isolated following alternatively a proxy variable approach or a latent variable model approach. In the second step, we make use of two alternative small area models to improve the estimates, dealing with missing values, low sample size and high variability in smaller domains. At the end, the 2-step methodology results in 4 alternative versions of a synthetic indicator of social integration, that can be used to rank nationalities and administrative regions. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - We examined minority-status (non-Cypriot immigrant) and majority-status (Cypriot national) preadolescents’ bystander reactions to, and reasoning about, intergroup social exclusion (N = 367; Mage = 11.7 years; 50% Cypriot). Participants read one of three contexts where victim group identity was either non-Cypriot or Cypriot or a context where identity was not mentioned (i.e., control). Cypriot participants reported higher prosocial bystander responses when Cypriot victims were excluded compared with when non-Cypriot victims were excluded. Non-Cypriot participants reported equally high prosocial bystander responses for Cypriot and non-Cypriot victims, and both were higher than those for the control condition. When choosing to challenge social exclusion, non-Cypriot and Cypriot participants employed moral reasoning, focusing on concerns of welfare and equality. When choosing not to challenge the exclusion, Cypriot bystanders referenced personal choice (e.g., “I would not say anything; it is not my problem”) more when victim identity was salient. Non-Cypriot bystanders referenced personal choice only when not challenging exclusion in the control context. Cypriot participants with high levels of intergroup contact reported higher helping intentions toward non-Cypriot victims. These findings support and extend social reasoning developmental theory and highlight practical implications for tackling intergroup social exclusion in schools and maintaining positive intergroup relations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The label “Personality Disorder” continues to divide opinion. Challenges to the terminology of personality disorder led by people with lived experience and supported by critical practitioners and academics are tempered by acknowledgement of certain positive social consequences of obtaining a diagnosis. This study aims to engage service users and staff in a process of inquiry to better understand the complexities of views on the terminology of Personality Disorder. Design/methodology/approach: This study set out to qualitatively explore the views of a range of people with lived, occupational and dual lived experience/occupational expertise, relating to the diagnostic label of Personality Disorder, via participatory and critical group debate. The World Café approach is an innovative methodology for participatory inquiry into subjective views suited to exploring the contested subject matter. Findings: This study identified contrasting opinions towards the label of Personality Disorder and provides insight into the concerns described for both keeping and losing the label. Although many felt the words “personality” and “disorder” are not in themselves helpful, certain positive views were also revealed. Perspectives towards the label were influenced by the way in which diagnosis was explained and understood by patients and practitioners, alongside the extent to which service provision and evidence-based interventions were offered. Research limitations/implications: The findings have the potential to contribute to the ongoing critical debate regarding the value of the Personality Disorder construct in the provision of care and support. Specific emphasis upon the relational framing of care provision offers a means to ameliorate some of the negative impacts of terminology. Perspectives are influenced in the way the label is understood, hence, attention is required to enhance these processes in clinical practice. There is much more study required to overcome stigmatisation, prejudice, and lack of knowledge and understanding. Further research identifying means for challenging stigma and the factors contributing to positive clinical interactions are required. Originality/value: This study brings together a wide range of views and experiences of mental health professionals, individuals lived experiences and those who align to both lived and occupational expertise. A safe space was provided via the uniquely co-produced World Café research event to bring together discussion and debates from mixed perspectives makes this a novel study. The focus being on perspectives towards contested language, labelling and social impact adds to scholarship in this field. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has hit humanity globally. Besides its obvious threats to our physical health and economic stability, one can only speculate about the pandemic’s and its countermeasures’ psychosocial impacts. Here, we took advantage of a sample of healthy male participants who had completed psychosocial measures on mental health, environmental concern, and prejudice against asylum-seekers just before and during the nationwide lockdown in Germany in spring 2020. A follow-up assessment of 140 participants during the lockdown provided a unique opportunity to track psychosocial changes in a prospective longitudinal study design. In comparison to before the lockdown (1) mental health worsened, (2) environmental concern increased, and (3) prejudice against asylum-seekers decreased. Our study demonstrates psychosocial “side effects” of the pandemic that bring both challenges and opportunities for our society with regard to the handling of psychological reactions to this pandemic and further global crises, including climate change and mass migration. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Removing the vulnerability of a stereotype threat can weaken the stereotype’s negative influence. However, stereotype threats can be produced simply by reminding individuals of their stigmatized social identity. In this study, a typical explicit stereotype threat was compared with two types of reports on positive role models to determine whether the influence of stereotypes varied according to the type of report. In total, 178 college athletes were recruited and randomly assigned to the explicit threat group (EX group, n = 46), report on a special case group (RS group, n = 42), report on a general topic group (RG group, n = 46), or neutral report group (control, n = 44). The participants first read a short text with manipulated context. They then completed scales assessing career adaptability and optimism and were asked to choose whether to complete a scholastic test with high or low difficulty or not take the test at all. The career adaptability and optimism scores of the control group were higher than those of the RS and EX group. The career optimism scores of the RG group were higher than those of the EX group. Fewer participants opted for the difficult version of the scholastic text in the EX and RS groups; the majority of participants in these groups chose to not take any test. The results indicated the influence of negative stereotype threats and indicated that reading the news report on the special case did not have a positive and encouraging effect on the participants. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We propose a theoretical framework for when and why members of dominant groups experience threat and express intolerant attitudes in response to social change. Scholarship on symbolic threat suggests that the detection of intergroup differences in values and norms is sufficient to elicit negative intergroup attitudes. Building on this theory, we argue that the experience of threat is actually shaped by prospective beliefs about difference (i.e., expectations of whether outgroups will assimilate to ingroup norms over time or not). Across two studies and two accompanying pilots, we show how outgroup assimilation expectation shapes dominant groups’ experiences of threat, specifically as it relates to their ability to define the norms of their superordinate category (prototypicality threat). We observe that members of dominant groups are surprisingly tolerant of both social change and intergroup difference in the present, so long as they expect outgroup assimilation in the future. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This research aimed to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relations between social norms, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), outgroup-directed prejudice, and hostile behavioral intentions toward outgroups. Three correlational studies, conducted in two countries and three different intergroup contexts (n1 = 997; n2 = 1011; n3 = 1992), investigated the moderating role of social norms (both positive and negative) on the relation between RWA and expression of prejudice as well as behavioral intentions toward outgroups. We found that in the presence of positive (i.e., tolerant) social norms, the previously well-established positive relation between RWA and prejudice is reduced or even reversed, whereas in the presence of negative (i.e., intolerant) social norms, this relation is strengthened. Additionally, the lower (vs. higher) prejudice of high-RWA individuals in the presence of positive (vs. negative) social norms mediated the link between RWA and behavioral intentions toward outgroups. The present research constitutes the first comprehensive demonstration of authoritarians' potential to be less prejudiced in response to prevailing tolerant social norms. © 2021 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Purpose: Weight bias internalization (WBI) is associated with negative health consequences such as eating disorders and psychosocial problems in children. To date, it is unknown to what extent WBI considerably raises the risk of negative outcomes. Methods: Analyses are based on cross-sectional data of 1,061 children (9–13 years, M = 11, SD = 0.9; 52.1% female) who filled in the WBI scale (WBIS-C). First, ROC analyses were run to identify critical cut-off values of WBI (WBIS-C score) that identify those who are at higher risk for psychosocial problems or eating disorder symptoms (as reported by parents). Second, it was examined whether WBI is more sensitive than the relative weight status in that respect. Third, to confirm that the cut-off value is also accompanied by higher psychological strain, high- and low-risk groups were compared in terms of their self-reported depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and self-esteem. Results: WBIS-C scores ≥ 1.55 were associated with a higher risk of disturbed eating behavior; for psychosocial problems, no cut-off score reached adequate sensitivity and specificity. Compared to relative weight status, WBI was better suited to detect disturbed eating behavior. Children with a WBIS-C score ≥ 1.55 also reported higher scores for both depressive and anxious symptoms, higher body dissatisfaction, and lower self-esteem. Conclusion: The WBIS-C is suitable for identifying risk groups, and even low levels of WBI are accompanied by adverse mental health. Therefore, WBI is, beyond weight status, an important risk factor that should be considered in prevention and intervention. Level of evidence: Level III, cross-sectional analyses based on data taken from a well-designed, prospective cohort study. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The current study investigated associations among interpersonal, academic, financial, and ethnicity-related stressors and college students’ academic motivation and depressive symptoms, as well as the moderating role of positive sibling relationships on these associations. Participants included 171 Mexican-origin college students (80.7% female; M = 21.6 years). Data were collected using an online survey and analyzed with path analysis. Under conditions of more positive sibling relationships, there was a positive association between interpersonal stress and academic motivation, a negative association between ethnicity-related social stress and academic motivation, and a positive association between financial stress and depressive symptoms. Under conditions of less positive sibling relationships, there was a positive association between interpersonal stress and depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that sibling relationships may only be protective for certain types of stress. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Nadie es Perfecto (Nobody’s Perfect, or NEP) is a parenting skills workshop aimed at ‘sharing experiences and receiving guidance on everyday problems to strengthen child development’. This article explores this workshop in terms of its relationship with the daily lives of participants, based on one year of fieldwork focused on families with young children in a low-income neighbourhood in Santiago. While caregivers frame their parenting efforts as aiming to ‘hacer lo mejor posible’ (do their best) under difficult circumstances, our study found that facilitators take an anachronistic and homogenizing view of participants. Embracing a universalistic perspective of child development, they discourage participation and debate, focusing instead on providing concrete advice that limits the potential of the workshops. This article argues that by ignoring the different living situations of families in this socioeconomic context, NEP reproduces a prejudiced view of poor subjects that sees them as deficient and incapable of change. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Metadehumanization, the perception that members of an outgroup dehumanize your group, has been found to exacerbate intergroup conflict by inspiring reciprocal dehumanization of the offending outgroup. Moreover, metadehumanization is distinct from metaprejudice (i.e., the perception that an outgroup hates your group). Given the mutual animosity reported in public opinion polls toward the other side, we believed US–Russia relations would be a worthwhile context in which to extend this model. Therefore, we measured Americans’ levels of metadehumanization and metaprejudice of Russians to determine the association between these perceptions and their hostility toward Russians (Study 1). In this novel intergroup conflict, metadehumanization remained a consequential predictor of outgroup hostility over and above metaprejudice, suggesting that it can exacerbate a broader range of intergroup conflicts than those heretofore examined. Given these findings, we then sought to experimentally differentiate between metadehumanization and metaprejudice. In Study 2, we manipulated both metadehumanization and metaprejudice to (a) determine whether one or both cause greater outgroup hostility and (b) elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which they may produce this effect. Whereas metadehumanization produced greater hostility, metaprejudice did not. Moreover, although both metaperceptions inspired greater prejudice, only metadehumanization led to greater dehumanization. We conclude that metadehumanization may be a particularly potent fomenter of hostility because it inspires reciprocal dehumanization over and above more general negative bias. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - A growing body of research has shown that naturalized citizens’ attitudes towards immigration worsen following citizenship acquisition. Accordingly, these socially mobile individuals tend to distance themselves from their former immigrant ingroup. The present contribution explains such self–group distancing coping strategy in terms of an “ironic” procedural fairness effect. Study 1 (N = 566), a survey conducted among naturalized Swiss citizens, showed that fairness perceptions with respect to the naturalization process were indeed associated with stronger anti-immigration attitudes, and that this relationship was mediated by identification with the host nation. Next, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the causality of the hypothesized mediation model. In Study 2 (Experiment 1; N = 248), fairness of the admission procedure (accurate vs. inaccurate) increased identification with a desirable group. In Study 3 (Experiment 2; N = 141), administration of a national identity prime evoked stronger anti-immigration attitudes. Taken together, our findings highlight a somewhat “dark side” of procedural fairness. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - What is known on the subject: A serious mental illness influences sexual life and people affected have worries about their sexual health. People living with a serious mental illness can and want to participate in interventions related to sexual health. What the paper adds to existing knowledge: People who suffer a serious mental illness are interested in maintaining an active sex life. People who suffer a serious mental illness experience rejection when they open up and they lose intimate relationships or possibilities of meeting other people because of ignorance and prejudices surrounding mental health. What are the implications for practice: Mental health services must respond to this need, that is including sexual needs assessment among routine standard practices or training nurses on sexual education to allow them to advise patients and their families and friends. Health systems should promote awareness programmes and reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and sexuality. Abstract: Introduction: Sexuality-related nursing care is scarce and mainly focuses on biological issues. There is also a lack of knowledge about how serious mental illnesses affect sexuality. Aim: To explain how people with a serious mental illness perceive and experience their sexuality. Method: A meta-synthesis was conducted to integrate qualitative studies. Four databases were used to perform the search, focused in the last ten years. Nine articles were included, and their results analysed thematically. Results: Four categories were identified: "Pathologized sexuality," which explains how the disorder and treatment affect sexuality; "Not my sexuality anymore,” which describes feelings emerging from the perceived limitations and the role of self-acceptance; “Learning to manage intimate relationships,” which explains the desire to establish intimate personal relationships and define their meaning; and "Reconstructing my sexuality," which elucidates the influence of the environment on sexuality. Discussion: Sexuality is influenced by several factors, the main ones being: the clinical complications, the side effects of drug treatment, the social support, the relationship with the health sector and stigma. Implications for practice: Having a serious mental illness affects sexuality and can provoke suffering and social isolation. Mental health services should address this issue and carry out community interventions to reduce stigma. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Immigrants’ economic progress, on the one hand, serves as an indicator of successful integration and should serve to mitigate natives’ concerns about potential economic or welfare state–related burdens of immigration. On the other hand, the fact of immigrants improving their social status may also induce perceptions of competition and group-related relative deprivation. This study examines whether immigrants’ progress leads either to improved attitudes toward immigrants or to a greater perception of immigration-related threat. Specifically, I focus on how individuals’ egalitarian values and experiences in intergroup contact condition their responses to immigrants’ economic progress. Using data from the European Social Survey 2014, combined with country-level change scores in income gaps between natives and immigrants, I find that respondents who encountered negative experiences in intergroup contact respond to immigrants’ progress with increasing anti-immigrant sentiment. A survey experiment manipulating exposure to information about group-specific income trends mirrors this finding. The results have important implications for debates about immigrants’ integration and the economic motives underlying immigration-related attitudes. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Does hateful rhetoric appeal to supporters of President Trump? Prior studies link sexism, racism, Islamophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and intolerant forms of Christianity to supporting or voting for President Trump. We extend this literature by examining whether individuals who approve of President Trump’s job performance are more accepting of the hateful rhetoric and imagery they encounter online. We do so using online survey data (N = 465) of youth and young adults collected in December 2017. Building on previous theoretical explanations of participating in online hate that utilize routine activity theory and social learning–social structure theory, we argue that support for President Trump is a result of the “politics of status,” and support for the President thus represents an enthymeme. Our key finding is that agreement with online hate material is indeed positively associated with support for the President. Additionally, we find that one’s differential location in the social structure, online and off-line social bonds, and attitudes toward norm violations are associated with agreement with online extremist content. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - National stereotypes are inherently evaluative, often negatively, and potentially prejudicial. While research has examined stereotypes from an organisational perspective, this is overwhelmingly in experimental settings involving students (Landy, 2008); in other words not in workplaces, and not involving employees doing their jobs. Through a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of 53 authentic business meetings, this study finds that among certain communities, national stereotypes are used in workplace narratives, and argues that such narratives constitute a contextual, situated social practice. The novel methodology pinpoints and categorises all stereotypes in business-meeting narratives, before discussing what role they play in indexing the identities of the stereotyped and the stereotyping. Finally, evaluation, ideology and power are critically engaged with to explain their use or non-use, thus making a theoretical contribution to studies of evaluation, workplace narratives, and stereotyping in discourse. While ethically problematic, and potentially detrimental to business success, their use may be motivated by local workplace goals. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Background: Though sobriety in young people is on the rise, students who drink little or no alcohol may experience social exclusion at University, impacting well-being. We aim to understand the social experiences of United Kingdom (UK) undergraduate students who drink little or no alcohol. Methods: A mixed-methods study using semi-structured, one-to-one interviews and the 24-Item Social Provisions Scale and Flourishing Scale with 15 undergraduate students who drink little or no alcohol. Descriptive statistics are presented for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative. Results: Eight main themes and four subthemes were generated from thematic analysis summarised in two sections ‘views of drinkers from non-drinkers’ and ‘how peer pressure feels and how people deal with it.’ The initial transition to University represented a challenge, where participants struggled to find their ‘true’ friends. However, students generally had high levels of social provision, well-being and enjoyed close friendships with fewer casual acquaintances. All students experienced some kind of peer pressure (of a varying extremity) and developed coping strategies when in social situations involving alcohol. Fear of missing out on the ‘typical’ University experience heightened self-imposed expectations to drink. Despite participants acknowledging their counter-normative behaviour, some felt they were subject to stigmatisation by drinkers, doubting their non-drinker status, causing feelings of exclusion or being ‘boring.’ Their desire to ‘be like everyone else’ exposed some insight into the negative stereotypes of sobriety, including frustration behind alcohol’s status elevation. Conclusion: Students adopt strategies to minimise peer pressure and to fit in. Future research should interrogate drinkers’ perceptions of their sober peers to deepen understanding, better break down ‘us and them,’ and mitigate future expectations within the University drinking culture.

AB  - Covering faces with masks, due to mandatory pandemic safety regulations, we can no longer rely on the habitual daily-life information. This may be thought-provoking for healthy people, but particularly challenging for individuals with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Au fait research on reading covered faces reveals that: 1) wearing masks hampers facial affect recognition, though it leaves reliable inferring basic emotional expressions; 2) by buffering facial affect, masks lead to narrowing of emotional spectrum and dampen veridical evaluation of counterparts; 3) masks may affect perceived face attractiveness; 4) covered (either by masks or other veils) faces have a certain signal function introducing perceptual biases and prejudices; 5) reading covered faces is gender- and age-specific, being more challenging for males and more variable even in healthy aging; 6) the hampering effects of masks on social cognition occur over the globe; and 7) reading covered faces is likely to be supported by the large-scale assemblies of the neural circuits far beyond the social brain. Challenges and limitations of ongoing research and parallels to the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test are assessed. Clarification of how masks affect face reading in the real world, where we deal with dynamic faces and have entree to additional valuable social signals such as body language, as well as the specificity of neural networks underlying reading covered faces calls for further tailored research. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - One of the appeals of conspiracy theories in times of crises is that they provide someone to blame for what has happened. Thereby, they increase distrust, negative feelings, and hostility toward implicated actors, whether those are powerful social outgroups or one’s own government representatives. Two studies reported here examine associations of COVID-19 conspiracy theories with prejudice, support for violence, and other and negative social outcomes. In Study 1 (N = 501), the endorsement of the more specific conspiracy theories about the alleged role of China was associated with more prejudiced views of Chinese and Italian people. In Study 2 (N = 1024), lowered trust in government regulations and increased hostility associated with the COVID-19 and generic conspiracy beliefs were correlated with justification of and willingness to engage in non-compliance with regulations, violent attacks on 5G masts, and anti-government protests. Across both of the studies, higher exposure to news about COVID-19 was associated with lower endorsement of conspiracy theories, but also with increased feelings of anxiety and lack of control, which in turn were correlated with higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs endorsement. We highlight the potential social problems which are associated with the wide-spread endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Copyright © 2022 Šrol, Čavojová and Ballová Mikušková.

AB  - Objective: Subjective social status (SSS) refers to an individual’s perception of relative social rank. We tested associations between SSS and allostatic load, a multisystem index of physiological dysregulation, in a sample of women 1 year after the birth of a child. Method: Participants (n = 1,168) in the Community Child Health Network study were recruited in five sites across the United States shortly after the birth of a child. SSS was assessed at 6 months after birth using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status. Participants also reported household income and years of education completed. Biomarkers were assessed and allostatic load was calculated by assigning one point for each of 10 biomarkers above clinical cutoffs at a subsequent visit approximately 6 months later. Multiple linear regression analyses tested associations of SSS with allostatic load, adjusting for socioeconomic (SES) indicators of household income, years of education, and other covariates (race/ethnicity, relationship status, maternal age, and study site). We also tested interactions between each of the objective SES measures and SSS. Results: Higher SSS predicted lower subsequent allostatic load independent of household income, education, and other covariates. Associations between SSS and allostatic load were strongest at higher levels of income and education. Conclusions: Study findings demonstrate associations between perceptions of relative social standing and wear-and-tear on multiple physiological systems above and beyond indicators of objective SES, suggesting that psychosocial aspects of lower status may contribute to the gradient between social status and health.

AB  - The contact hypothesis has dominated work on prejudice reduction and is often described as one of the most successful theories within social psychology. The hypothesis has nevertheless been criticized for not being applicable in real life situations due to unobtainable conditions for direct contact. Several indirect contact suggestions have been developed to solve this “application challenge.” Here, we suggest a hybrid strategy of both direct and indirect contact. Based on the second-person method developed in social psychology and cognition, we suggest working with an engagement strategy as a hybrid hypothesis. We expand on this suggestion through an engagement-based intervention, where we implement the strategy in a theater performance and investigate the effects on prejudicial attitudes toward people with physical disabilities. Based on the results we reformulate our initial engagement strategy into the Enact (Engagement, Nuancing, and Attitude formation) hypothesis. To deal with the application challenge, this hybrid hypothesis posits two necessary conditions for prejudice reduction. Interventions should: (1) work with engagement to reduce prejudice, and (2) focus on the second-order level of attitudes formation. Here the aim of the prejudice reduction is not attitude correction, but instead the nuancing of attitudes. Copyright © 2022 Martiny, Scott-Fordsmand, Jensen, Juhl, Nielsen and Corneliussen.

AB  - This contribution is an investigation into the role of implicit (as opposed to explicit) biases in judicial rulings by examining the judgment of Chetty J in Mbena v Minister of Justice and Correctional Services 2015 4 All SA 361 (ECP). Implicit bias refers to prejudice on a visceral level, namely unconscious bias, of which the bearer, to wit the judicial officer, is unaware. I suggest that exploring implicit bias in judicial rulings in the context of South Africa's harsh stigmatising shaming culture driven by incarceration as its dominant sentencing regime, will introduce a valuable window in identifying, as well as possibly illuminating and eliminating, unjustified and harmful biases. In this contribution I specifically focus against the generalised bias against ex-offenders in South Africa's harsh stigmatising shaming culture (which I distinguish from integrative shaming cultures found in Japan, China and many African societies) which attitude perpetuates the marginalisation, stigmatisation and discrimination on offenders which exceed their court-sanctioned punishment. I attempt to outline the reasons as to why the isolation and elimination of social biases of this nature are important since, in the view of many criminologists but particularly John Braithwaite, stigma is counter-productive and criminogenic as it leads to enhanced recidivism rates. To this end, I analyse the salient features of the case within a broad social context (including a consideration of phenomena such as the prison-industrial complex on South African soil) which exceeds a narrow legal framework. My roadmap for the paper encompasses a consideration of the salient, albeit disputed, facts of the case with a view towards an alternative, if plausible reading based on the probabilities of the two sets of conflicting facts presented by the opposing parties. I highlight the significance of the judgment before recommendations for improved public policy formulation are proffered. © 2022, North-West Unversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sociocultural divide in Western Europe is increasingly focused on issues of national identity, namely immigration. It is commonly assumed that opponents of immigration also exhibit conservatism on other sociocultural issues. Yet recent research suggests that general social conservatism is declining in the region. Do immigration attitudes fit squarely into the sociocultural dimension? Using survey data from eleven West European countries, as well as a Dutch household panel from 2007-2019, this study finds that gender attitudes, a key sociocultural issue, are subject to change through both cohort and life cycle effects, while immigration attitudes are stable over the course of the panel and exhibit little variation across cohorts. Immigration attitudes also appear to be immune to period effects resulting from the 2015 refugee crisis. Further, those born during and after the 'post-materialist revolution' have weakened associations between these two attitudes, while older individuals' attitudes are strongly correlated. The combination of gender egalitarianism and anti-immigrant sentiment may become increasingly common as acceptance of the former spreads, while immigration remains a hotly contested issue.

AB  - Background: Prejudices against minorities can be understood as habitually negative evaluations that are kept in spite of evidence to the contrary. Therefore, individuals with strong prejudices might be dominated by habitual or “automatic” reactions at the expense of more controlled reactions. Computational theories suggest individual differences in the balance between habitual/model-free and deliberative/model-based decision-making. Methods: 127 subjects performed the two Step task and completed the blatant and subtle prejudice scale. Results: By using analyses of choices and reaction times in combination with computational modeling, subjects with stronger blatant prejudices showed a shift away from model-based control. There was no association between these decision-making processes and subtle prejudices. Conclusion: These results support the idea that blatant prejudices toward minorities are related to a relative dominance of habitual decision-making. This finding has important implications for developing interventions that target to change prejudices across societies.

AB  - This article investigates three explanations for electoral support for the far right - 'cultural backlash', 'economic grievances' and 'protest voting' - in a novel way. Our main contribution is that we contrast far-right voters with voters of centre-right parties, traditional left-wing parties and abstainers. Equally innovative is the comparison between mature and post-communist democracies. Using European Social Survey data (2014-16), we conclude that anti-immigration attitudes are most important in distinguishing far-right voters from all other groups. Yet, these differences are significantly smaller in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, far-right voters are not the so-called socioeconomic 'losers of globalization': this is only true when compared with centre-right voters. Concerning protest voting, distrust of supranational governance particularly enhances far-right voting. Overall, our study concludes that more fine-grained distinctions pay off and avoid misleading generalizations about 'European far-right voters' often presented in public debates.

AB  - E.M. Forster’s A Passage to India, hereafter (API), offers us an opportunity to realize the mentality of the white imperialist and the grotesque picture of the colonizer-colonized relationship; this picture implies multiple facets of racial vituperations, brutality, and prejudice perpetrated on Indians in the colonial period. In the novel, Forster explores the colonizers’ racist attitudes, and he brings out the racial and interracial conflicts as well as the cultural and ethnic traumas between the colonizer and the colonized. This study is primarily concerned with exploring the cultural clashes and the problematic, deformed interracial relationships, established between the Indians and the Anglo-Indians in a colonial context. The analytical approach and the Postcolonial Theory will be adopted throughout the paper as a framework. A postcolonial reading of the novel debunks the colonizer’s racist ideology and reveals various motifs of partitions, fences, interracial conflicts and gulfs. The article reveals that the different racial, cultural, and social backgrounds of the English and Indian communities create bitter differences and significant gaps that cannot be bridged. The study concludes that the ramifications of the interracial clashes and racial intolerance have a vehement impact on both the colonized and the colonizer alike; however, mutual and interracial love, respect, and understanding are robust solutions that can relatively open the ideological closure of racism, lessen the racial tensions and thus bring people of different racial backgrounds together. © 2022 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - Modern sports have increasingly acquired more social relevance, amplified as it is by the media and, especially, advertising, thereby making sports closer than ever to the average citizen. In 2015 the sports brand Reebok initiated a campaign to promote fitness by highlighting and valuing the human side of sports. The objective of this study is to analyze this campaign, assessing the existence of sexist prejudices, if any. Content analysis has been chosen as the method of study. A total of 439 images uploaded by Instagram users between January 2015 and May 2016 that were employed in Reebok’s campaign have been evaluated. The results indicate that photos of single, thin, and white women predominate. We can conclude that although the photos in Reebok’s campaign portray women in attitudes contrary to what sexist prejudices dictate–e.g. sweaty, tired–there is a clear adjustment to the canons of beauty that have traditionally been projected onto women. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Teen dating violence (TDV) refers to a wide range of partner-directed harmful behaviors among adolescents. Since it was first documented in the 1980s, there is a growing interest in TDV due to its potentially devastating mid- and long-term consequences. Aiming at the early detection of TDV onset with prevention purposes, research has focused on the detection of typologies of perpetrators and/or victims as well as on identifying risk and protective factors for its occurrence. Research with Spanish adolescents, however, is very limited. To fill this gap, we recruited a total of 2,319 adolescents from different regions in Spain, out of which, 1,079 reported having had a romantic partner during the last year. These filled out measures of TDV (perpetration and victimization), school aggression, hostile and benevolent sexism, empathy, assertiveness, psychological inflexibility (general measures), and psychological inflexibility with prejudice thoughts. A cluster analysis revealed that adolescents could be divided into two clusters as a function of their TDV profile: Cluster 1, including close to 76% of the sample (boys and girls), presented low TDV perpetration and victimization; Cluster 2, including 24% of the sample (boys and girls), presented higher TDV perpetration and victimization. Regression analyses revealed that, as compared to those in Cluster 1, adolescents in Cluster 2 were more likely to be older boys who scored high in benevolent sexism, overt and relational school aggression, and personal distress, and low in behavior regulation skills, perspective taking, and practical personal ability. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of evidence-based TDV prevention campaigns. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: Country-level structural stigma toward sexual minority individuals (i.e., discriminatory laws and policies and prejudicial attitudes) shows robust associations with sexual minority individuals’ mental health and individual-level stigma processes, such as identity concealment. Whether structural stigma is also associated with interpersonal-level stigma processes, such as victimization, is rarely studied. Whether the association between structural stigma and sexual minority individuals’ interpersonal mistreatment varies across gender, gender nonconformity, and socioeconomic status also remains to be determined. Methods: In 2012, sexual minority adults (n = 86,308) living in 28 European countries responded to questions assessing past-12-month victimization experiences (i.e., physical or sexual attack or threat of violence). Country-level structural stigma was objectively indexed as an aggregate of national laws, policies, and population attitudes negatively affecting sexual minority individuals Results: Country-level structural stigma was significantly associated with victimization (adjusted odds ratios [AOR]: 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.22; p =.004). However, this effect varied by gender, gender nonconformity, and socioeconomic status. For both sexual minority men and women, gender nonconformity and lower socioeconomic status were associated with increased risk of victimization. The strongest association between country-level stigma and victimization was found among gender nonconforming men with lower socioeconomic status (AOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.14–1.52; p <.001). Conclusions: A much larger proportion of sexual minorities living in higher stigma countries reports victimization than those living in lower stigma countries. At the same time, the association between country-level structural stigma and victimization is most heavily concentrated among gender nonconforming men with lower socioeconomic status. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The issue of re-establishing the contemporary Irish women playwrights to prominence has gained great attention. Women playwrights feel the need to combat systemic prejudice in the theatre industry, meaning that postfeminists in Ireland are very much present. Although often regarded as a synonym for third-wave feminism, postfeminism has its separate characteristics. One of them is that postfeminism defines equality differently than has been done previously. Equality should not look like androgyny, nor should it be strictly divided based on gender since such a division ignores the human elements of thought, intellect, emotion, and expression. Furthermore, ethical issues in literature have been identified and discussed worldwide for years, not excepting the contemporary Irish theatre. The aim of this paper is to show a notable step towards an increased emphasis on the issue of gender responsibility and solidarity, or lack thereof. The paper also deals with ethical implications and consequences of the ways in which these issues under- pin social interactions as well as family and gender relations that Marina Carr and Nancy Harris dramatize in their plays. © 2022 University of Osijek - Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the relationship among different evaluative reactions of the intergroup attitudes and contact in Spanish adolescents evaluating different ethnic minorities and in immigrant-background adolescents evaluating Spanish youth. This study was based on psychosocial models of great impact in the study of intergroup relations such as the Stereotype Content Model and the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes Map, and incorporated a new approach to the study of attitudes: psychological networks. In total, 1122 Spanish adolescents and 683 adolescents with an immigrant background (Moroccan, Romanian or Ecuadorian origin) participated in the study, aged from 12 to 19 years. They answered a questionnaire with measures of stereotype dimensions (morality, immorality, sociability and competence), emotions (positives and negative), behavioral tendencies (facilitation and harm) and contact (quantity and quality). The results show similar structural patterns in the six studied groups, with emotions acting as links between stereotypes and behavioral tendencies. Moreover, positive and negative stereotype dimensions appeared as independent dimensions that were part of different processes: sociability and morality, and competence to a lesser extent, were related to facilitation behaviors through positive emotions, while immorality was related to harm behaviors through negative emotions. This could indicate that, to achieve successful intergroup relations involving cooperation and the development of friendly relationships, it would be appropriate to intervene in parallel in these two pathways. Due to the centrality of positive emotions (and sociability and immorality) and, therefore, their capacity to affect the entire network, focusing interventions on these variables could be an appropriate strategy to achieve overall positive attitudes.

AB  - Opposition and stigmatization toward BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadomasochism) preferences or lifestyles only recently have begun to be documented. BDSM is stigmatized since vanilla sexuality (standard or conventional sexual practice) is considered the norm assuming BDSM practitioners as socially unacceptable, and BDSM as an unethical and unacceptable form of sex. This study examined women’s attitudes toward BDSM practices in the Greek socio-cultural context. An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted between October 12 and December 12, 2021, via an online survey. This study’s convenience sample consisted of female undergraduate students (N = 240) who were recruited from two universities in the northern part of Greece. A between-subjects, correlational design was employed. Bivariate correlation was generated to explore the associations between variables of interest. Next, a multiple regression model was employed to predict ASMS (Attitudes toward Sadomasochism Scale) from the other study measures, based on the significance of the associations. This study’s findings show that the more conservative participants (whether in political or religious terms) oppose BDSM practices. The current study adds to the limited literature that examines the attitudes of people toward BDSM intending to clarify the social-psychological and socio-cultural factors that shape prejudicial attitudes towards BDSM and enhance the efforts of advocacy groups to promote social justice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Sociological researches about tourism of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are growing in number. These studies are carried out mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries, although nowadays tour operators, travel agencies, cruise and airline companies have started to reserve more and more services and promotions to this group of travellers all around the world. To fill this gap, the paper presents the results of a research that involved 650 Italian LGBT Millennial travellers. Design/methodology/approach: Using the exploratory technique of multiple correspondence analysis, the research focussed on the study of decision-making processes, finding out the factors that drive young LGBT people to prefer one destination over the others, distinguishing motivations between pull and push factors. Findings: For Italian LGBT Millennials, tourism means more than just recreation. Tourism could also represent a strategy that gives them temporary escape from social prejudice and inequality, since tourist experiences provide an opportunity to re-build LGBT people' sexual identity and enjoy social freedom that LGBT people are deprived of whilst being at home. Originality/value: The analysis allowed to underline some differences. Even if LGBT people share the burden of being as a member of a sexual and gender minority, LGBT people attribute a slightly different meaning to tourism, considering distinct push and pull factors. © 2022, Salvatore Monaco.

AB  - Traditional moral evaluation relies on artificial and subjective evaluation by teachers, and there are subjective errors or prejudices. To achieve further objective evaluation, students' classroom performance can be identified, and the effectiveness of moral education can be evaluated based on student behavior. Since student classroom behavior is random and uncertain, in order to accurately evaluate its indicators, a large amount of student classroom behavior data must be used as the basis for analysis, while certain techniques are used to filter out valuable information from it. In this paper, an improved graph convolutional network algorithm is proposed to study students' behaviors in order to further improve the accuracy of moral education evaluation in universities. The technique of video recognition is used to achieve student behavior recognition, thus helping to improve the quality of moral education evaluation in colleges and universities. First, the multi-information flow data related to nodes and skeletons are fused to improve the computing speed by reducing the number of network parameters. Second, the spatiotemporal attention module based on nonlocal operations is constructed to focus on the most action discriminative nodes and improve the recognition accuracy by reducing redundant information. Then, the spatiotemporal feature extraction module is constructed to obtain the spatiotemporal association information of the nodes of interest. Finally, the action recognition is realized by the Softmax layer. The experimental results show that the algorithm of action recognition in this paper is more accurate and can better help moral evaluation. © 2022 Rui Zhu.

AB  - Stigma reduction research finds that brief interactions with a person with mental illness can reduce prejudiced attitudes. We examined whether this finding extends to real relationships over an extended period of time. First-year college roommate dyads, one of whom reported a mental illness diagnosis participated in a longitudinal study (N = 166 dyads across three American universities). Based on contact theory, we tested whether mental illness prejudice declines when: (a) the student with mental illness disclosed that information to their roommate; (b) the roommate perceived the disclosure; and (c) the roommate relationship was close. Registered analyses showed that student disclosure predicted roommate perception (β =.52, p <.001), but roommate perception of the disclosure did not significantly predict reduced prejudice from the start to the end of the academic year (β = −.13, p =.172). Relationship closeness did not moderate how likely roommates were to perceive students’ disclosures. Notably, overall levels of mental illness prejudice were very low in this American college sample, suggesting that the value of stigma interventions may depend on the context. Directions for future research and social policy implications are discussed. © 2022 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.

AB  - The current study examines how distant outgroups are portrayed in humanitarian appeals on a popular social media platform, YouTube. Social media is a growing platform for humanitarian organisations to spread messages about crises, as they can reach a wide audience in a quick and costless manner. Drawing from theories of visual framing and intergroup relations, this study analyses how organisations frame the outgroup beneficiaries in their online donation appeals. A quantitative content analysis was conducted to explore online humanitarian donation appeals, with a focus on the visual content used to portray outgroup beneficiaries. The study sampled 187 videos from 10 prominent humanitarian organisations’ YouTube channels. Findings indicate that while humanitarian organisations have largely moved away from an explicit rhetoric of frail, dying, and suffering subjects, subtle notions of helplessness are still prevalent. The narrative that outgroup beneficiaries are passive sufferers can hence be detrimental to intergroup relations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although Africa is the second highest source region of immigrants to Canada, very little research has been conducted on the postmigration experiences of African immigrant children. This paper explores the schooling experiences of African migrant children and their families in Alberta, Canada. We center the voices of African migrant children and their parents and illustrate the ways in which systemic racism in schools manifested in negative stereotypes about African people and curriculum marginalization impacts on children’s education. Further, we highlight the support mechanisms in schools and in African migrant families, such as tutoring and parent engagement in education, that help students to overcome the challenges they face and do well academically. © 2022, Canadian Ethnic Studies Association.

AB  - This research was carried out to examine the cultural literacy of preschool teachers who have students from different cultures in their classrooms. In the present study, a qualitative research method was used to examine teachers' cultural literacy in detail. The participants of the study are preschool teachers who work with children from different cultures. A semi-structured interview form for teachers was used as a data collection tool. Research findings show that preschool teachers have insufficient knowledge about the culture of their students from different cultures and they have prejudices against the culture. As a result, teachers' getting to know different cultures and not interacting with families from these cultures affected their creation of a culture-sensitive educational environment in their classrooms. Similarly, it is observed that teachers keep their educational expectations and goals regarding children from different cultures low on the basis of their prejudices. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: Muslims living in the United States (MLUS) report high mental health stigma. They also underutilize professional psychological help, despite experiencing rising Islamophobia and comparatively poorer mental health. In line with double stigma, we examined whether MLUS who perceived greater Islamophobia also experienced greater self-stigma of seeking help, and whether this was related to negative help-seeking attitudes. We also assessed therapist demographic and treatment modality preferences and explored how they related to risk factors for low help-seeking. Method: Utilizing a representative sample of 350 MLUS (50% women, 33% immigrants) acquired via a Qualtrics panel aggregate, we assessed a path model of help-seeking attitudes to determine the direct and indirect effects of perceived Islamophobia via self-stigma and psychological distress. Therapist and treatment preferences were examined via multiple regression models and analysis of variance (ANOVAs). Open-ended responses were coded through content analysis. Results: Perceived Islamophobia was associated with greater psychological distress and also indirectly related to negative help-seeking attitudes via greater self-stigma. Therapists of a similar background, therapy in a mosque-setting, group therapy, and imam collaboration were more appealing to MLUS who were at risk for low help-seeking. Conclusions: Among MLUS, perceived Islamophobia may present a dual risk—simultaneously increasing psychological distress and indirectly leading to negative attitudes toward help-seeking via higher self-stigma. Conversely, for MLUS at risk for low help-seeking, accessible community-based treatments and treatment with a Muslim or race/ethnicity-matched therapist may facilitate help-seeking behaviors. Future work may determine whether addressing double stigma within Muslim communities (e.g., Islamophobia and self-stigma) may improve psychological help-seeking © 2022.

AB  - India's Prevention of Atrocities Act (PoA), which aims to punish and prevent violence against Dalits (ex-untouchables) and Adivasis (tribals), represents one of the most ambitious hate crime laws in the world. However, concerns regarding its effectiveness in addressing historical oppression dominate Indian public debates. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork with Dalit atrocity survivors and police and judiciary in Rajasthan, this article proposes that current critiques of the PoA have neglected to address fundamental questions about the ideas of social transformation that underpin this unique law. This paper analyses how legal evidence regimes can obscure realities of hate. It further examines to what extent the institutional barriers facing atrocity complainants reflect deeper challenges, which haunt hate crime laws and legislative attempts to address inequality on a global level. Ultimately, the article reveals that for the PoA to be "effective," policymakers must first decide to whose definition of justice and success the act is accountable. © 2022 OpenEditions Journals

AB  - Secure forensic hospitals aim to reverse adversity and promote personal safety and mental health well-being for those admitted. These hospitals are also well-placed to make the case for the importance of inclusion and reintegration after a period of enforced community exclusion (through detention under the Mental Health Act). Given the operational and procedural security required for the therapeutic regimes in these settings, only essential visitors are typically given access. This makes it challenging to promote awareness and understanding about patients with forensic and mental health histories. In this study, the impact of a one-day visit to a high-security forensic hospital by psychology students (n = 123), which included face-to-face contact with patients, was studied for its potential to reduce negative attitudes about this population. A comparison group of students who did not attend a visit were also recruited (n = 135). The impact of entering and learning about the hospital, and a conversational exchange with current residents was associated with a significant reduction in negative stereotypes and fear and an increase in compassion and motivation to help. The findings support the use of contact-based educational visits to change negative attitudes and responses towards patients with forensic and mental health histories. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article examines the duality of the Black psychology movement in the United States as both a distinctly American and a postcolonial approach to mental health. The Westside Community Mental Health Center in San Francisco served as the organizational hub for the Association for Black Psychologists (ABPsi) in the 1970s. The Westside clinicians understood forensic psychology as a kind of preventative care as California, more so than any other state, was seduced by the eugenic dream of human improvement through therapeutic interventions in schools and prisons intended to correct the wayward deviant. Their community's mental wellbeing required dismantling the interlinked disciplinary apparatus which disproportionately surveyed, tracked, and confined young Black men. These psychologists mounted a legal challenge to the use of intelligence testing to sort Black children in schools, seeking to replace standardized tests with “dynamic assessments” inspired by Israeli psychologist Reuven Feuerstein's work with refugee children. They consulted on the voir dire process in the highly politicized Angela Davis trial to minimize the presence of racially prejudiced jurors. They offered expert testimony on the psychological damage of solitary confinement on behalf of prison activists. The Westside team artfully developed and deployed the psychological concept of “bias” in their confrontations with local manifestations of the American carceral state. In their theoretical writings, these psychologists reflected upon their historical positionality, understanding themselves as products of the decolonial moment. Bay Area encounters with Third World internationalism, the Black Panther Party (BPP), the Nation of Islam, and community-led substance abuse programs shaped clinical care at Westside and inspired the Afrocentric consciousness many came to espouse. ABPsi initially had a significant impact on the historically white American Psychological Association's training practices. However, the two organizations split over the IQ controversy at a moment when psychologists became increasingly enmeshed in the criminal justice system. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Medical students face many challenge in their academic path. The disclosure of their own sexual orientation may be problematic since it impacts negatively on their acceptance in the educational environmental and the course of their career. Mental health issues may also occur among medical students as consequences of their perceived homophobia as well as stigma after the coming out. Research shows that students’ attitude to the sexual orientation disclosure may vary across countries and cultures as well as students’ homophobic attitudes towards sexual minorities: the latter should be addressed since prejudice might affect the quality of medical care for LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) patients. We suggest that more education and training on LGBT + health issues is needed in the medical students’ core-curricula: this would improve the health care of sexual minorities and LGBT + students’ acceptance in the academic milieu. © 2022 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

AB  - The growing need for more stringent methods of safe blood transfusion has engendered blood banks in Brazil. The transfusion appears, then, as an alternative path for blood-related pathologies and their components. Followed by the enforcement of altruistic principles, blood donation has become resistant within society due to its myths and prejudices. Thus, the implementation of public policies became more evident in tracing the social profile of blood donors, and the public power started regulating, supervising and controlling the rational use of blood and blood products. This way, the indices of blood donation in the Unified Health S ystem (SUS) result from various means of interaction with both the potential donor and with the loyal donor, through digital media, school lectures, symposia, congresses and visual media. This process hitched the recruitment to the peculiarities of potential donors, mostly promoted by Health professionals. There is a need to gradually increase such measures to facilitate the donation process, adapting it to the reality of these people, to amplify the number of loyal donors. © 2022 Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - U.S.P..

AB  - Background: Little is known about the experiences of transgender and gender non-binary (TNB) physicians in medical residency training programs. Aim: To identify the self-reported experiences and needs of TNB individuals during medical residency in United States training programs. Methods: An online, anonymous survey of TNB current residents and recent graduates was designed. Results: A total of 26 respondents completed the survey. The most common reported gender identity was non-binary or gender queer (n = 11, 42.3%) and male or transgender man (n = 7, 26.9%). About half of participants (n = 14, 53.8%) had undergone gender affirming interventions prior to residency. Most participants (n = 19, 73.1%) did not know all the gender affirming healthcare benefits offered by their program. The majority (n = 21, 80.8%) also reported 2 hours or less of transgender-related didactics in residency. Respondents were most likely to disclose their gender identity to other residents (n = 19, 73.1%) and faculty (n = 19, 73.1%) and were least likely to disclose their identity to patients (n = 6, 23.1%). Most respondents (n = 15, 57.7%) stated that program faculty and staff communicated support for their gender identity. Most participants (n = 16, 61.5%) reported that they perceived transgender residents to be treated similarly to their non-transgender peers in their training program, while the remainder (n = 7, 26.9%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Nevertheless, approximately three-quarters of trainees (n = 22, 84.6%) self-reported microaggressions during their training program and non-binary and transfeminine trainees were more likely to report these experiences than transmasculine people. Nearly a quarter of transfeminine and non-binary participants reported macroaggressions, with none of the transmasculine respondents reporting these negative experiences. Most macroaggressions were from program faculty. Discussion: This study highlights that while most physicians in residency report support from their program for their TNB identity, TNB physicians still experience significant barriers and prejudices throughout training and more action is needed among program faculty for support of TNB trainees. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Previous research on the risk factors for the development of mental health disorders among Indigenous Peoples in the United States suggest that experiencing prejudice is correlated with the development of psychopathology. However, the relation between school-based prejudice, including microaggressions, and the development of depression remains unexamined. As such, the current study is an exploratory analysis among a small sample (N = 47) of age 18–25 Indigenous young adults from the American Northwest examining the predictive relation between their retrospective recall of school-based racial microaggressions as measured by the School-Based Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Subscale and their current levels of depressive symptoms in adulthood as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. There was a statistically significant predictive relation found between participant's retrospective recall of microaggressions and their current levels of depression as young adults. As such, the practice and policy implications for school-based professionals are discussed. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In a prospective cohort study of Latinx adolescents living in an agricultural county in California, we examined perceptions of federal immigration policy and its effects on community and individual wellbeing. From May to December 2017, 565 youth responded to an open-ended item integrated into ongoing surveys. Median age was 14 (range 13–16 years), 53% female, and 94% Latinx. About 12% were immigrants, 71% children of immigrant parents, and 52% had a parent employed in farm work. Most (78%) indicated they directly experienced or observed effects of current federal immigration policies. Adolescents described anti-immigrant sentiment as heightening discrimination, isolation, fear, and mental health changes. They also perceived constraints on future educational and employment opportunities. These findings suggest that the federal immigration policy environment can negatively impact the wellbeing of youth in Latinx communities and that immigration policy should be considered a social determinant of health. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study seeks to analyze and describe the voting behavior of female college students for a female candidate in Indonesia at Banjarmasin Mayoral Election in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, political campaigns were mainly switched to communication and information technology with a lack of mass gatherings and direct political campaigns due to Covid-19 health protocols. In a predominantly Muslim and highly patriarchal society, this is also the second time this province to have a female candidate for this position and the first time for this city. Amidst the negative stereotypes of a female candidate and the attacks from the opponents, this female candidate managed to gain second place. Disputes emerged, and the court decided to hold re-election in three sub-districts. The disputes and the campaign dynamics show how this society at large perceives a female candidate. This study elaborates on the possible affecting factors in voting behavior, i.e., religious interpretation, ethnicity, gender, the role of media, perceptions of voters related to candidate's age and programs, political party affiliation, the role of family, and peers. This research method combines quantitative and qualitative methods with the focus on the qualitative method which is based on interviews and literature analysis. This study collected the data based on online surveys and interviews of Lambung Mangkurat University students, Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia, where the election was held. The selection for college student respondents aims to focus on young, educated voters and control the variables of education, age, and socioeconomic factors of voters or the effects of social class, which are also often, considered affecting variables in voting behavior. Therefore the factors of education, age, and socio-economic variables are not the focus of analysis. Hence, this study may be transferable to analyze the voting behavior of young, educated, and no-income group which makes up a significant percentage of Indonesian voters. © 2022.

AB  - Objective: to know the experiences of family members of adolescents with gender incongruence. Method: this is a qualitative case study, supported by the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention Models theoretical-methodological framework. Data collection took place through semi-structured interviews, participant observation in family groups and document analysis, with eight family members. Data analysis was performed following the precepts of content analysis. Results: with family assessment, two categories emerged: “Challenges in the face of gender transition”, which highlighted the problems related to the expectations created at birth, new names, pronouns and gender fluidity and the fear of prejudice, and “Supporting aspects in the face of the possibility of gender transition”, which revealed family support as a strong point. Conclusion: knowing the experiences allowed us to understand the challenges that family members face when facing physical and emotional aspects of their children’s gender transition. It was noticed that the act of seeking help and offering support is important for a healthy transition. The findings provided a better understanding of family issues and provided suggestions on how nursing can develop care for this population © 2022. Revista da Escola de Enfermagem.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Conspiracy theories have recently come under the scrutiny of social psychology. While some theorists have treated them as a deficient way of thinking, others have considered them as a form of political rhetoric with important social implications. We focus on conspiracy theories in the context of online public deliberation on legislation allowing registration of self-defined gender in Greece. Employing the tools of Critical Discursive Psychology, we analyse comments posted on the Ministry of Justice's website created for public consultation about the law change. We focus on the mobilization of conspiracy theories by people who oppose Law 4491/2017 (“Legal Recognition of Gender Identity – National Mechanism for the Development, Monitoring and Evaluation of Action Plans on Children's Rights and Other Provisions”). These commentators often argued that powerful groups are behind the proposed legislation, aiming at decreasing Earth's population, disrupting moral order, and violating humanness. We demonstrate how these constructions helped participants to perform various tasks, such as delegitimizing the legislation while at the same time avoiding the stigma of prejudice, promoting far-right political practices, and rebutting accusations of political partisanship. The results are discussed in relation to conspiracy theories’ role in countering “gender ideology” and in promoting cisgenderism and heteronormativity. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to identify and analyze nurses' patterns of knowing and experiences with the preparation of families for disclosure to children living with HIV seropositivity. METHODS: thirteen pediatric nurses from Rio de Janeiro participated in the research using the sensitive creative method. Data were treated with Orlandi's discourse analysis and Carper's patterns of knowing. RESULTS: nurses' speeches revealed socioculturally constructed imaginary and ideological formations. The personal pattern of knowing, under the influence of negative media about the disease in the 1980s, generated stigma and prejudice. Empirical, esthetic, and ethical patterns were built on training and professional practice of the 1990s-2010s. They composed a context of (in)security about competence, to contribute to preparing families to disclose HIV to children. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: nurses' experience demonstrates knowledge to intervene and many challenges for their practical appropriation.

AB  - Opinion polls regularly show that the vast majority of French people have a positive perception of the efficacy and safety of using medicines, including vaccines. Distrust or hostility towards them is only the fact of a small minority of the population, but active and noisy on social networks and overvalued by the media and public authorities. However, the pandemic due to Covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2) has confirmed to what extent the perception of drug risk by the public is unstable, sometimes irrational, how many and complex the determinants of this perception are and what role as a public resonance, fears play out in the media. We can even implicitly see the general underlying tendency of our society, which is to grant primacy to risk to the detriment of profit in the assessment of a technological innovation. The risk tree often masking the forest of efficiency. This polarization of minds on risks, associated with an overestimation of low probabilities, testifies to the impregnation of our mores by the ideology of precaution. To which are added distorting factors such as naturalistic prejudice, cultural relativism and the planetary extension of social networks which instantly spread false information that is more viral and better remembered than the true ones, hampering communication based on science data. Promoting the correct perception of drug risk requires recalling both the benefits and the risks linked to action but also those linked to inaction; to clarify institutional messages by making them as factual as possible; to limit the number of public broadcasters to achieve greater consistency in their messages; to have the frankness to sometimes say that we do not know, medicine by nature being practiced in a context of uncertainty. The Academy calls for an ambitious educational policy for young people: training in critical thinking and the acquisition of the basics of drug risk should be introduced from middle school. The Academy also believes that the public is entitled to expect quality-controlled information from the media, away from rumors, by calling on indisputable experts and by favoring objective data over subjective testimonies based on personal experiences. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine
Des enquêtes d'opinion montrent régulièrement que, dans leur grande majorité, les Français ont une perception positive de l'efficacité et de la sécurité d'emploi des médicaments, y compris des vaccins. La défiance ou l'hostilité à leur égard ne sont le fait que d'une petite minorité de la population, mais active et bruyante sur les réseaux sociaux ainsi que dans les médias et surévaluée par les médias et les pouvoirs publics. Pourtant, la pandémie due au SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19) a confirmé combien la perception du risque médicamenteux par le public est instable, parfois peu rationnelle, combien sont nombreux et complexes les déterminants de cette perception et quel rôle de caisse de résonance des peurs du public ont pu jouer les médias. On peut y voir en filigrane la tendance générale de notre société qui est d'accorder la primauté au risque, au détriment du bénéfice, dans l'appréciation d'une innovation technologique. L'arbre du risque cache souvent la forêt de l'efficacité. Cette polarisation des esprits sur les risques, associée à une surestimation des faibles probabilités, témoigne de l'imprégnation de nos mœurs par l'idéologie de la précaution. A quoi s'ajoutent des facteurs de distorsion tels que le préjugé naturaliste, le relativisme culturel et l'extension planétaire des réseaux sociaux qui répandent dans l'instantanéité de fausses informations plus virales et mieux mémorisées que les vraies, entravant la communication fondée sur les données de la science. Favoriser la juste perception du risque médicamenteux impose de rappeler à la fois les bénéfices, les risques liés à l'action, mais aussi ceux liés à l'inaction; de tenir le plus grand compte de l’évolutivité des connaissances; de clarifier les messages institutionnels en les rendant les plus factuels possibles; de limiter le nombre des émetteurs publics en vue d'aboutir à une plus grande cohérence de leurs messages; d'avoir la franchise de dire parfois qu'on ne sait pas, la médecine s'exerçant par nature en contexte d'incertitude. L'Académie en appelle à une politique pédagogique ambitieuse auprès des jeunes: une formation à l'esprit critique et une acquisition des bases de la culture du risque médicamenteux devraient être instaurées dès le collège. Elle estime en outre que le public est en droit d'attendre des médias une information de qualité, prudente, contrôlée et indépendante des rumeurs, en faisant appel à des experts indiscutables et en privilégiant les données objectives par rapport aux témoignages subjectifs fondés sur des expériences individuelles. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that intergroup contact, psychology’s most-researched paradigm for reducing prejudice, has the “ironic” effect of reducing support for social change in disadvantaged groups.Weconducted a preregistered meta-analytic test of this effect across 98 studies with 140 samples of 213,085 disadvantagedgroup members. As predicted, intergroup contact was, on average, associatedwith less perceived injustice (r = −.07), collective action (r = −.06), and support for reparative policies (r = −.07). However, these associations were small, variable, and consistent with alternative explanations. Across outcomes, 25%–36% of studies found positive associations with intergroup contact. Moderator analyses explained about a third of the between-sample variance, showing that, at least for perceived injustice, associations with intergroup contact were most consistently negative in studies that measured direct, qualitatively positive contact among adults. Wealso found evidence for an alternative explanation for the apparent “ironic” effects of intergroup contact as, after controlling for the positive association of negative contact with support for social change, positive contact was no longer associated with any of the outcomes. We close by discussing the strengths and limitations of the available evidence and by highlighting open questions about the relationship between intergroup contact and support for social change in disadvantaged groups. © 2022.

AB  - Even though gender inequality is evident across life domains, women often justify the gender hierarchy. We examined whether the very closeness that heterosexual women share with their male romantic partners predicts their justification of gender inequality. We drew on intergroup-related research, showing that positive perceptions that minority groups develop within harmonious intergroup interactions, generalize to affect their views of group-based inequality. We expected that to the extent that women experience their romantic relationships positively, they will be more accepting of gender inequality within their homes, and these perceptions will generalize to predict justification of macro-level gender inequality. Five correlational and two experimental studies supported this prediction. The more women rated (or were primed with) their relationship as positive, the more they justified the gender social system. This was mediated by women’s perception of their housework division as fair, and was less pronounced among feminists. Implications regarding social change are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Word embeddings provide quantitative representations of word semantics and the associations between word meanings in text data, including in large repositories in media and social media archives. This article introduces social psychologists to word embedding research via a consideration of bias analysis, a topic of central concern in the discipline. We explain how word embeddings are constructed and how they can be used to measure bias along bipolar dimensions that are comparable to semantic differential scales. We review recent studies that show how familiar social biases can be detected in embeddings and how these change over time and in conjunction with real-world discriminatory practices. The evidence suggests that embeddings yield valid and reliable estimates of bias and that they can identify subtle biases that may not be communicated explicitly. We argue that word embedding research can extend scholarship on prejudice and stereotyping, providing measures of the bias environment of human thought and action. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In this article, I analyse non-Dalit teachers’ outlooks by positioning them within a culturally complex caste system, considering its influence on Dalits’ education. Nepalese society is ruled by a caste system, where non-Dalits–Brahmins and Kshatriya are considered pure and powerful, and Dalits are viewed as impure and powerless. This multi-dynamic caste system promotes social truths that are accompanied by educational prosperity for non-Dalits and deprivation for Dalits. This study involves six teachers in in-depth interviews, twenty-four students in focus group discussion, twenty-four students in video elicitation and a total of thirty-nine teachers and students in observation. The work of Amartya Sen, Pierre Bourdieu, Raewyn Connell, and Nepalese scholars are key to the theoretical framing of this research. The study found that non-Dalit teachers are not critically reflexive of their caste-based prejudiced attitude and dispositions, which eventually reproduces unjust school education. Instead of blaming teachers, the study concludes that professional development did not offer opportunities for teachers to be critically reflexive of their teaching habits. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As individuals who use their privilege to reduce prejudice, educate others about social justice, and actively stop discrimination, faculty allies can play a vital role in transforming universities to be more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. However, discrepancies persist in how faculty define privilege and communicate allyship. Drawing from standpoint theory, we examined discursive divergences in how 105 full-time faculty defined and experienced privilege and how they enacted allyship in the workplace. Participants tended to conceptualize privilege as a set of advantages and lack of structural barriers for people based on their group membership(s). Discursive differences emerged regarding the degree to which faculty participants perceived privilege to be un/earned and rooted in structural power, and some participants took ownership of their social privilege while others discursively elided it. When asked to identify specific ally actions, participants often described broad behaviors that aimed to help individuals in interpersonal contexts but did not address actions aimed at dismantling inequitable power structures, revising biased policies, and transforming toxic organizational cultures. Our findings highlight the need for trainings that clarify conceptualizations of privilege and help faculty translate their understanding of allyship into communicative actions that stop discrimination at interpersonal and institutional levels. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the well-documented harmful effects of Native-themed mascots, Native-themed mascots have many supporters who decry the politically correct efforts to remove these mascots. Although ostensibly unrelated to race/racism, we reasoned that invoking anti-PC attitudes allow prejudiced people to indirectly support Native-themed mascots while minimizing the appearance of being biased. Three studies (N = 587) found that anti-Native bias predicted anti-PC attitudes and, in turn, Native-themed mascot support. In Studies 2 and 3, participants varying in anti-PC attitudes considered a university changing their Native-themed mascot for PC or non-PC reasons. Anti-PC attitudes predicted opposition to changing Native-themed mascots in both conditions. However, the effect of anti-PC attitudes was stronger in the PC condition where social justice norms were salient. These results suggest that, for many, anti-PC attitudes reflect more than just opposition to political correctness and are used by prejudiced people to indirectly defend controversial mascots without appearing prejudiced. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Although there has been considerable research about attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, there has been little research into how people first come to be aware of minoritized sexual and gender minority (SGM) identities. This study sought to address this gap. A sample of sexual minority (n = 150) and heterosexual (n = 802) young adults (N = 952; Mage= 18.88 years, SD = 1.75; 949 were cisgender, three were transgender), primarily recruited from a large southern university, were asked retrospectively to recount their first exposure to or awareness of SGM identities. Responses between SGM and heterosexual participants were compared through a variety of analytical approaches, including analyzing themes about the source from which participants first recalled encountering these identities, and whether understanding about these identities came through a personal connection to someone with these identities. SGM participants reported encountering minoritized sexual identities a year earlier than did heterosexual participants, with both groups encountering these concepts in middle childhood, on average. SGM participants were more likely than heterosexual participants to report learning about minoritized gender identities from someone with a minoritized gender identity, while heterosexual participants more often reported learning about these identities from media or celebrities. Heterosexual (vs. SGM) participants were also more likely to imply that minoritized gender identities were adopted to be popular, rather than being authentic identities in themselves. Framed by developmental intergroup theory (DIT), we discuss implications of these findings, especially potential interrelationships with the development of prejudiced attitudes about SGM identities. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: HIV-stigma can influence engagement in care and viral suppression rates among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Understanding HIV-provider level stigma and its associated factors may aid in development of interventions to improve engagement in care. Methods: We assessed HIV-related stigma, provider knowledge, and practices and beliefs among healthcare providers using an online survey tool. Generalized linear modeling was used to determine factors associated with HIV-stigma score. Results: Among 436 participants, the mean age was 42.3 (SD 12.3), 70% female, 62% white, 65% physicians, and 44% worked at an academic center. The mean HIV Health Care Provider Stigma Scale (HPASS) score was 150.5 (SD 18.9, total = 180 [higher score = less stigma]) with factor subscale scores of 67.1 (SD 8.2, total = 78) prejudice, 51.3 (SD 9.7, total = 66) stereotyping, and 32.1 (SD 5, total = 36) discrimination. Female sex and comfort with talking about sex and drug use had 4.97 (95% CI 0.61, 9.32) and 1.99 (95% CI 0.88, 3.10) estimated higher HPASS scores. Disagreement/strong disagreement versus strong agreement with the statement that PLWH should be allowed to have babies and feeling responsible for talking about HIV prevention associated with −17.05 (95% CI −25.96, −8.15) and −2.16 (95% CI −3.43, −0.88) estimated lower HPASS scores. Conclusions: The modifiable factors we identified as associated with higher HIV related stigma may provide opportunities for education that may ameliorate these negative associations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - We examine stigma and how it operates, then develop a novel framework to classify the range of positions that are conceptually possible regarding how stigma ought to be handled from a public health perspective. In the case of weight stigma, the possible positions range from encouraging the intentional use of weight stigma as an obesity prevention and reduction strategy to arguing not only that this is harmful but that weight stigma, independent of obesity, needs to be actively challenged and reduced. Using weight stigma as an illustrative example, we draw on prior theoretical work on stigma mechanisms and intervention strategies to develop a framework for improving the understanding, evaluation, and planning of anti-stigma interventions. This framework has the potential to help public health actors to map out how protest, contact, education, and regulation strategies can be used to reduce direct discrimination, structural discrimination, and internalized stigma (self-stigma). © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Ethnicity-based discrimination remains a persistent concern across the globe. A recent yet disparate literature focused on the role of cultural dimensions and intercultural contact in forming negative intergroup attitudes; however, these variables have yet to be included in a single study, so their unique effects cannot be estimated. Furthermore, although it is well documented that intercultural contact may reduce out-group discrimination, its influence on in-group favouritism remains relatively unexplored. The present study examines whether social dominance orientation (power distance), uncertainty avoidance, individualism/collectivism, and intercultural contact can predict neo-racism and ethnocentrism. Results from an online survey on Slovenian sample (N = 164) demonstrated that social dominance orientation was the best predictor of neo-racism and ethnocentrism, followed by intercultural contact. Findings indicate the importance of cultural context in shaping and modifying negative attitudes and increasing social tolerance. The implications for culturally-informed practices for preventing/reducing discrimination are outlined. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The approaches we are using presently with social–emotional learning (SEL) curricula are not truly meeting the needs of our students. SEL programs have proven successful in many areas of mental and social wellbeing but fall short of their intended goals of promoting social warmth and human relationships. The literature suggests that minoritized students consistently report issues with perceptions of fit in the classroom environment, and these perceptions have known negative effects on academic and social outcomes. Current SEL curricula largely reflect White, middle class, American beliefs and values, perpetuating the negative social arrangements of disenfranchisement and marginalization. There is a significant need to reframe SEL curriculum development to remove this majority influence and encourage school stakeholders to challenge existing social inequities. SEL curricula have the potential to be key elements in creating more equitable school communities by more effectively addressing discrimination and prejudice through their frames of reference and the skills they help students and other stakeholders develop. Future research, actionable items and recommendations regarding how to adapt current SEL curricula are also discussed. Impact Statement Current social–emotional learning (SEL) continues to perpetuate systems of oppression and fails to meet the needs of our minoritized student populations (Black/indigenous/people of color, LGBTQ+, dis/abled, immigrant, etc.). The school psychologist is integral in helping to facilitate the shift in the focus of SEL from “fixing” the deficits of individual students to focusing on the social contexts and social systems that affect the entire classroom, school, and community in order to more effectively meet the needs of minoritized student populations. © 2022 National Association of School Psychologists.

AB  - The treatment of food with ionizing radiation carried out in conditions of good production practice is an efficient and widely applicable method of food processing. However, this procedure is not well accepted by the public and is often accompanied by a negative attitude of consumers regarding the consumption of such food. This is mainly due to their insufficient and incorrect information, as a result of which public opinion is burdened with numerous prejudices and dilemmas. In this paper, an assessment of the views and opinions of a group of respondents was made, in order to determine the level of information and readiness of consumers to buy and consume products treated with ionizing radiation. The research was conducted by surveying 92 respondents, most of them high school professors, employed in two high schools in Bitola (Macedonia). In order to have certain diversity, some of the respondents were students, employees in other school activities and several retirees. All of them belonged to 6 age categories. The survey was conducted with a previously prepared online survey questionnaire, with precisely prepared questions and possible answers. Three aspects were analyzed: (1) level of awareness of the respondents, (2) their previous opinions and attitudes and (3) their readiness to buy and consume a product/food treated with ionizing radiation. Standard descriptive statistical analyses (Microsoft Office Excel 2010, Data Analysis ToolPak and t-test) were used for results processing. Obtained results show insufficient information of the examined persons, wrong beliefs and opinions based on assumptions and personal conclusions made without scientific basis and evidence. In fact, only 8.7% said that they would buy such a product, as opposed to almost 40% who answered negatively. Also, 71.7% do not believe or agree that this type of food is better than food treated with preservatives. 41.3% think that such food is of lower quality, 47.8% believe that with this procedure loses vitamins in food, and even 75% are not sure if this food is carcinogenic. As a consequence, the reluctance of the respondents to accept this modern way of food processing is evident. In this regard, it can be concluded that carefully designed educational programs are needed, which, based on credible results of scientific research, would provide proper information to the public. Introducing the general public to the benefits of this procedure would certainly contribute to changing consumer attitudes. This, combined with quality marketing, would replace all existing dilemmas with safe and correct attitudes towards irradiated food. © 2022, Consulting and Training Center - KEY. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although Christianity has abundant literature against racism, the menace negatively affects human relationships in contemporary westernised societies. The near silence of most Christian denominations leads to one crucial question: how should Christians deal with racial prejudice in contemporary westernised societies? This article is a social criticism of racism from the perspective of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. As a Christian, Bonhoeffer struggled with the morality of racism, particularly regarding the experience of black people in the United States and Jews in Germany. His reflections and action against racial injustice are a robust framework that could inspire a positive Christian attitude in dealing with racism. This article describes the causes and remedies of racial injustice from his perspective. The central argument is that faithfulness to the communal social character is a significant way to deal with racism in contemporary westernised societies. Contribution: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s reflections and actions against racial injustice are a robust framework for dealing with racism. The central argument is that faithfulness to the communal social character is a significant way Christians can deal with racism in contemporary westernised societies. © 2022. The Authors.

AB  - Disgust specific to sexual stimuli has been thought to be an adaptation that serves purposes of pathogen-avoidance, partner selection and social dominance. While the link between disgust responses and homonegative and transnegative attitudes has been relatively established, it is not yet clear why. Literature using evolutionary psychology perspectives of these phenomena is scarce in areas with substantial LGBT-related violence like Colombia. This research aimed to study the interplay of predispositional (e.g. sociodemographic, reported contact), affective (e.g. disgust sensitivity) and cognitive (e.g. Right-Wing Authoritarian) variables in homonegative and transnegative attitudes of Colombian adults. Participants (N = 272) had a mean age of 26.38 (SD = 9.47), women comprised 72% of the sample and men 28%. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that increased sexual specific disgust sensitivity and greater RWA predicted stronger homonegativity and transnegativity. The relationship between sexual disgust and prejudice was partially mediated by RWA. Findings suggest that sexual disgust sensitivity adaptations in homonegativity and transnegativity may respond to selection pressures that differ from pathogen-avoidance perspectives, and that are associated with maintaining social hierarchy and social dominance. Anti-prejudice initiatives would benefit from targeting emotional responses of sexual disgust, especially within communities and institutions that have historically endorsed conservative and traditional values. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - When repairing a problem in their talk, speakers sometimes do more than simply correct an error, extending the self-correction segment to comment on, repeat, apologize, and/or reject the error. We call this “over-exposed self-correction.” In over-exposing the error, speakers may manage (and reflexively construct) a range of attributional troubles that it has raised. We discuss how over-exposed self-correction can be used to: (a) remediate errors that might suggest the speaker’s incompetence; and (b) redress errors that may be heard as revealing relational “evils” (implicating inadequate other-attentiveness) or societal “evils” (conveying problematic social attitudes and prejudices). The article thus shows how conversation analytic work on repair can provide a platform for studying the emergence and management of socially and relationally charged issues in interaction. The data come from a diverse corpus of talk-in-interaction in American, British, and Australian English. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate eating disorder risk and factors associated with obesity prejudice among university students. Methodology: This cross-sectional descriptive study was consisted of 1,449 university students in Turkey. Anthropometric measurements were self-reported and eating disorder and obesity prejudice symptoms were measured via validated scales. Results: Prevalence of students at low risk for eating disorder was 88.2%, while 60.3% of them were prone to obesity prejudice and 27% of them were obesity prejudiced. The mean eating disorder scores of the underweight and the normal weight group were significantly lower than the overweight group (p=0.003 and p=0.019, respectively). The difference between the mean obesity prejudice scores of the normal weight group and the overweight group was found to be significant (p=0.002). Moreover, in the multiple linear regression analysis, the overweight group had a significant association with obesity prejudice (p<0.001). Conclusions: The risk of eating disorder and obesity prejudice increases among overweight/ obese university students. Early prediction of eating disorder and obesity prejudice is crucial to prevent health problems such as obesity and related diseases among university students. © 2022 Asociacion Espanola de Dietistas-Nutricionistas.

AB  - Newcomers to a country can strongly benefit from having positive intergroup contact with host country residents. Often, however, such contact does not occur. Norms surrounding intergroup contact between newcomers and host country residents were explored over three studies. Correlational relationships among positive perceived contact norms, positive attitudes, and behavioural intentions supporting contact were demonstrated over multiple studies. Further, an experimental manipulation indicating higher (vs. lower and control) contact between host country residents and newcomers predicted behavioural intentions toward future intergroup contact through heightened intergroup contact norms and more positive attitudes toward newcomers. Implications of using norms as a means to impact intergroup relations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Scholars theorize racial apathy is one form contemporary white racial prejudice takes. Racial apathy signals not caring about racial inequality. Invoking intergroup contact theory, we hypothesize interracial contact would predict less racial apathy among whites. To test our hypothesis, we analyze survey data from white teenagers participating in the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR). We find interracial contact matters and its inclusion improves model fit over and above previously specified correlates. Specifically, interracial friendship and dating, and having a different race mentor predict the tendency to care about racial equality. Furthermore, any interracial contact and a count of interracial contact experiences across five settings, respectively, predict less racial apathy. We encourage scholars to investigate further the sociological significance of racial apathy and its correlates, including interracial contact. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Relatively little is known about how gender and sexual orientation intersect to predict young adults’ responses to unwanted romantic and sexual overtures from men and women suitors. To better understand these potential differences, and explore possible mechanisms that explain them, this pre-registered study used an online questionnaire to assess reactions to both hypothetical and recalled suitors among a sample of 855 cisgender heterosexual and gay young adults (18–35) from the United States. Results revealed that gay women and heterosexual men reported the most negative hypothetical reactions to men (versus women) suitors, while gay women, heterosexual men, and heterosexual women all recalled more negative reactions to men than women suitors. Gay men recalled relatively benign reactions to suitors of both genders. A desire to be seen as one’s true orientation was a mediating factor for both gay women’s and heterosexual men’s negative reactions to men suitors. These findings and their potential explanations highlight the complexity of how gender and sexual orientation intersect to shape responses to romantic and sexual overtures from men and women suitors. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The LGBT people face difficulties and barriers that hinder their access to health services. The lack of preparation and sensitivity of the professionals, in this context, are some of the elements that reiterate the health inequities and the vulnerability of these bodies. In order to understand this phenomenon, we interviewed 15 Primary Health Care workers and analyzed their speeches following the Foucauldian discourse analysis perspective. The results showed that although the professionals know the theme, they use discursive strategies, which veil their prejudices and resistance, making it difficult to recognize the possibilities of the agency in the transformation of this reality. The mobilization of categories related to sexual identities and rights in their discourses indicates displacements in the contemporary sexuality regime that should be considered in health education interventions. The implication of each one in the materialization of the differences that mark the sexual field proved to be, in this sense, fundamental to the discussion of care forms that are truly welcoming and do not reinforce the inequalities of bodies that challenge binarism and social heteronormativity. © 2022, Institute de Medicina Social da UERJ.

AB  - This article unveils the Qur’an’s perspectives on the erosion of phobia of other religions because of the negative stereotypes attached to Islam and Christianity to create greater peace in religious life globally. Furthermore, the Qur’an’s perspective on adult religious morality development is revealed by the at-tafsir al-maudhu’i method (a thematic interpretation). The study shows that adult religious morality development should integrate (1) religious morality (appreciation for faith differences), (2) national morality (love for the state and motherland) and (3) social morality (social integration) to build individual religious maturity to overcome Islamophobia and Christianophobia. Religious maturity renders humbleness, moral consistency, comprehensiveness and heuristic in every individual character. The results of this research are in accordance with Wallport’s opinion on religious maturity. Contribution: The main contribution of this study is to reveal the insights of the al-Qur’an regarding the solution to the problems of Islamophobia and Christonophobia caused by the stereotypes of Islam and Christianity. In addition to interpreting verses, this study is equipped with psychological studies in building everyone’s religious maturity so that they can think and act wisely in respecting differences in beliefs. This study is expected to minimise the problems of Islamophobia and Christianophobia from inside and outside the adherents of these religions. © 2022. The Author.

AB  - Racial discrimination takes many forms and so does opposition to it. In contrast to the dominant emphasis on institutional or state efforts to counter racism, we examine how members of racially minoritized groups resist racism in their everyday lives. Drawing on forty-one qualitative interviews with young, mainly Black, people in Norway, we identify five distinct ways in which they actively counter racism, as opposed to passively accepting or adapting to it. Participants resisted racism by ignoring, confronting, sharing experiences about, reporting and protesting it. Our analysis explicates the characteristics, potential outcomes and social function of such resistance to racism. The study contributes to the literature on everyday racism and antiracism by making it evident how those at the receiving end negotiate and actively oppose racist experiences. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Young children’s racial stereotyping is poorly understood even though stereotyping can influence individuals’ attitudes and behavior toward others. Here we present two preregistered studies (Total N = 257) examining White American children’s (4–8 years) application of six stereotypes (about being American, smart, wealthy, sporty, honest, and nice) when considering Asian, Black, and White children. We observed clear and consistent evidence for one cultural stereotype across the two studies: participants indicated that Asian and Black children were less American than White children. In a measure of racial attitudes, participants also preferred White children over Black and Asian children. Taken together, this research suggests that, in contrast to findings from previous work, White American children only consistently applied stereotypes about being American. Moreover, this research suggests that children’s cultural stereotypes might diverge from children’s attitudes early in development. These studies raise new questions about the emergence of racial stereotype application early in childhood–including how best to study it. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - I am writing about how whiteness works in the United States and Mexico, by looking at portraits by one photographer in Mexico, Yvonne Venegas and one photographer in the United States, Dana Lixenberg. I understand whiteness as something that goes beyond a skin tonality and that does something in the world. I analyze symbols and poses in portraiture to interpret how whiteness is performed and, also, how (through cultural, social and economic schemes of whiteness, by the photographer) the subject is called back into whiteness. I found that whiteness is performed similarly in both cultural contexts I examined, and although mestizaje in Mexico and slavery in the United States defined race relations in distinctive ways, whiteness must be studied as something that goes beyond a pigment and more in alignment with social and economic class perceptions. I propose study of pigmentocracy as an interlocking skin-color/class system in which skin tones are perceived based on social and cultural prejudices and linked to particular socioeconomic levels. In this system, perceptions of class and skin color work as self-reproducing and interdependent power apparatuses and dispositifs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A longitudinal field study tested the long-term effects (three years) of intergroup contact on both explicit and implicit outgroup attitudes. Participants were majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high-school students, who were tested at four waves from the beginning of their first year in high-school to the end of the third school year. Results revealed, first, a longitudinal association of quantity (but not quality) of contact with lower intergroup anxiety and more positive explicit attitudes, as well as bidirectional effects over time between explicit attitudes and intergroup anxiety, on the one hand, and quantity and quality of contact, on the other. Second, reduced intergroup anxiety mediated the association between quantity of contact and improved explicit attitudes over time. Third, the product of quantity and quality of contact longitudinally predicted more positive implicit outgroup attitudes over school years. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of findings. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the inherent interrelations between representation and identity processes concerning the 2015 migration crisis in Hungary, focusing on the emergence of polemic representations of refugees, the interrelations of these representations with different contents of group identity, and their manifestations in intergroup relations and possible collective actions. The exploratory study involved 126 participants, who completed an online questionnaire including items addressing the contents of refugee representations (feelings, beliefs, historical parallelisms) and of the identity (feelings, political orientations, religious views). The results revealed co-occurrences between identification and representation patterns related to intergroup relations: those who experienced significantly more negative feelings towards being Hungarian and demonstrated more empathy towards refugees were more likely to have a left-wing political orientation. However, right-wing participants experienced significantly more positive feelings towards the Hungarian ingroup such as pride, respect, freedom, engagement, and they drew parallels between the current refugee situation and the historical Turkish invasion of, and Gypsy migration in Hungary. They had negative feelings towards refugees such as fear and anger, which were associated with defensive attitudes endorsing social exclusion, deportation, and separation. These results suggest that polemic refugee representations have emerged in the Hungarian society, which are related to relevant identity contents. Since intergroup relations are defined by these representations, interventions aimed at improving intergroup relations should deal with both identity and representational processes simultaneously. © 2022.

AB  - Living with cultural, religious, and ideological diversity inevitably creates situations where people are confronted with beliefs, values, or practices that they disapprove of. In such situations, people may consider reasons to nevertheless tolerate what they disapprove of (i.e., forbearance tolerance), or reject these (i.e., intolerance). In the current review, we consider empirical research on the processes of intergroup tolerance and consider different manifestations of (in)tolerance. Then we discuss recent work on the dual process model of tolerance, which considers intuitive versus deliberative objections to cultural, religious, and ideological differences, and how these can be overridden to produce tolerance. We then review literature on the boundaries of tolerance including the role of moralization and moral values, before considering individual difference factors and situations of threat that can hamper intergroup tolerance. We conclude by considering five areas ripe for future exploration on the social psychology of intergroup tolerance and intolerance. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In this time of pandemic, people engage with diverse narratives of infographics to make sense of their experiences. Scholars agreed that comics are graphic mediums and cultural artefacts that significantly contribute to the visual community of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the comic artists in Malaysia, Ernest Ng, initially published his comics online and later converted them into three volumes of comic books entitled CovidBall Z Volume 1 (2020a), 2 (2020b) and 3 (2021). The objective of this paper is to undertake a content analysis of the portrayals of the various state machinery figures both from the government and opposition sides (i.e., ministers, politicians and government officers) in their roles in combating COVID-19. Additionally, the analysis wishes to uncover contemporary attitudes Ng uses such as symbolism, exaggeration and irony, among others, to convey his views on the current issue in obvious and subtle ways. In analysing the data, this study employed data analysis techniques in the form of descriptive content analysis. It was found that the social commentaries presented in Ng’s comics via the plot depict the existence of sexism, unfair treatment, and prejudice by several characters which lead to bully culture in the midst of the political metaphorical depiction of war and heroism among Malaysian state machinery figures. The images in his comics help people analyse, reflect on, and interpret our experiences by informing, providing meaning, and illustrating the COVID-19 outbreak narrative. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Pride events challenge hegemonic notions of sexuality and gender within places they are held. This is particularly the case in rural communities that are perceived, rightly or wrongly, as prejudices towards individuals with a diverse sexuality or gender identity. However, although academic literature has extensively explored Pride events within an urban context, limited attention has been paid to the rural context, and still little to those in their infancy. This article examines how stakeholders responded to the cancellation of a Pride event in the Australian rural township of Wagga Wagga due to COVID19. The pandemic, in this context, provided an opportunity to understand attitudes towards the event and its cancellation. Through this process, eight topics were identified as: council funding, cancellation as homophobic, last-minute cancellation, cancellation regretted, cancellation supported, organizers acknowledged, LGBTIQI+, and Pride event. Based on these findings, implications for the cancellation of social contentious events in response to such circumstances are identified. These implications suggest the need for a more considered approach to communicating about the cancellation to prevent allegations of prejudice and demonstrate the value of such events © 2022.

AB  - Though learning has become a core component of modern information processing, there is now ample evidence that it can lead to biased, unsafe, and prejudiced systems. The need to impose requirements on learning is therefore paramount, especially as it reaches critical applications in social, industrial, and medical domains. However, the non-convexity of most modern statistical problems is only exacerbated by the introduction of constraints. Whereas good unconstrained solutions can often be learned using empirical risk minimization, even obtaining a model that satisfies statistical constraints can be challenging. All the more so, a good one. In this paper, we overcome this issue by learning in the empirical dual domain, where constrained statistical learning problems become unconstrained and deterministic. We analyze the generalization properties of this approach by bounding the empirical duality gap&#x2014;i.e., the difference between our approximate, tractable solution and the solution of the original (non-convex) statistical problem&#x2014; and provide a practical constrained learning algorithm. These results establish a constrained counterpart to classical learning theory, enabling the explicit use of constraints in learning. We illustrate this theory and algorithm in rate-constrained learning applications arising in fairness and adversarial robustness. IEEE

AB  - False beliefs and negative myths about sexuality in old age lead to stereotypes and prejudices towards this group. These negative opinions germinate from a lack of knowledge about a subject. In an ageing society, education plays an important role, attending to the needs of these people throughout their lives and offering information that encourages optimistic attitudes towards this group and about a subject that seems to be frowned upon or forbidden in old age. To this end, this research aims to analyse the knowledge and attitudes that young people studying for the degree in Social Education and older people attending the training course of the experience classroom at the University of Huelva have towards sexuality in old age. The method used is descriptive-correlational and comparative-causal. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 304 subjects between 18 and 78 years of age. For data analysis, descriptive statistics, group comparisons and multiple linear regression model were used to identify factors that condition sexuality in old age. The results showed that the older population has more knowledge and a more conservative attitude towards sexuality in old age than the younger participants. Age, knowledge and educational qualifications are noted as conditioning factors of sexuality in old age. The research provides elements to be considered when drawing up educational-sexual initiatives to help improve certain attitudes and contribute to a more positive conception regarding the elderly. © 2022. by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved

We recruited 93 white undergraduate women for whom exposure to gendered microaggressions, color-blind racial attitudes, and political efficacy explained a significant proportion of variance in participants’ ratings of political activism on social media, although these predictors did not significantly explain a proportion of the variance in their in-person political activism (e.g., rally attendance). We discuss how these findings relate to the current literature, as well as implications and future directions. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The bullying of sexual and/or gender minority youth at school is a social violence issue that is ubiquitous in most countries. In line with evidence-based practice, teachers are consistently shown to be a critical component of success when addressing this issue; however, teachers’ preparedness to respond to sexual and/or gender motivated bullying is under researched. Utilizing components of the theory of planned behavior, a sample of 437 Australian teachers were investigated to determine whether knowledge, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward both sexual and/or gender minorities predicted teachers’ intentions to intervene when a sexual and/or gender minority student is bullied above and beyond sociodemographic factors associated with prejudice. Results of hierarchical linear regression demonstrated that teachers with more positive views of gender minorities and less traditional views related to gender ideologies were more likely to endorse higher intentions to intervene in sexual and/or gender minority motivated bullying. Findings suggested teachers’ attitudinal biases inform their professional practices when a sexual and/or gender minority student is bullied. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The paper analyses popular geographical imageries of the European migrant crisis. It focuses on visualities that shaped discussions about the event among Czech Facebook users with anti-immigration attitudes. The paper elaborates on the co-production of migrants’ visibility and visualities that depict them in certain ways. Visuality influences visibility and shapes what it means for people (who are represented by images) to be visible in certain ways when seen by another people (who observe and consume the images). Here, we analyse how cartographic visualizations and the practice of montage of images produce meanings and affects that make migrants either visible only as abusers of the Czech social welfare system (linking migrants in a racist way to the Roma minority) or visible only as dehumanized raging Muslim invaders that resemble more machine-like beings. These interpretations are explained with references to historical specificities of the Czech context. A user-made, film-like sci-fi video of the crisis is also analysed carefully to demonstrate its imaginary of a collapsing Western Europe, where raging invaders dominate. Presenting migrants’ visuality as invaders links these racist and Islamophobic attitudes to migrants’ visibility as enemies and targets to be killed, not pitiable human beings to be helped. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Infection by parasites, bacteria, and other microorganisms has been a powerful selection pressure faced by humans and other species. Consequently, avoiding pathogens has played an important role in human evolution and continues to play a role in contemporary social psychological processes. The current research tested the hypothesis that pathogen avoidance promotes intergroup prejudice. Whereas previous tests relied on existing cultural groups, which can conflate outgroup status with pre-existing group stereotypes about disease or geographic variability in pathogen prevalence, the current experiments assessed intergroup bias using a minimal group paradigm. Based on preliminary evidence (Study 1, N = 207, undergraduate students) that experimentally priming pathogen avoidance motivation promoted negativity toward a minimal outgroup, we conducted a Registered Report (Study 2, N = 1339 online participants) to replicate and extend those findings. Our primary hypothesis was that an experimental manipulation of pathogen threat (relative to two control conditions) would produce greater intergroup prejudice (negativity toward the nominal outgroup relative to the nominal ingroup). This hypothesis was not supported in the larger, registered second study. Exploratory analyses provided some evidence for interactions between experimental priming of pathogen threat and individual differences in pathogen disgust, but the interactive pattern differed across the two experiments. Findings call into question the hypothesis that, in the absence of cultural stereotypes, situationally activated pathogen avoidance promotes intergroup prejudice. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Jewish life in Muslim societies has historically been part of the broader public spheres and everyday experiences. Religious spheres and rituals, on the other hand, seem to signal separation: in short, Muslims go to their mosques, Jews to their synagogues. So, can a Jew find himself in a mosque? And what happens when he encounters Muslims there? This article explores narratives of Jewish experiences in two different Shi’ite surroundings: in Iran and Azerbaijan (in the south-east Caucasus). These experiences are analyzed through the prism of Jewish presence in mosques and Ashura rituals. By analyzing them within their specific contexts, this paper pursues two main goals: First, to demonstrate how Jews experienced Shi’ite religious spheres as part of their social and cultural surroundings. Second, attention to “the sacred of the other” sheds light on the complexity of intergroup relations between Jews and Shi’i Muslims. Stories on “the Jew in the Mosques” allow us a different angle to acknowledge the varied dynamics of Jewish experience in Azerbaijan and Iran from the beginning of the twentieth century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Our case study explored a Local Resilience Forum's (LRF) civil contingency response to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. We undertook 19 semistructured ethnographic longitudinal interviews, between March 25, 2020 and February 17, 2021, with a Director of a Civil Contingencies Unit and a Chief Fire Officer who both played key roles within their LRF. Within these interviews, we focused on their strategic level decision-making and how their relationship with national government impacted on local processes and outcomes. Using a form of grounded theory, our data describe the chronological evolution of an increasingly effective localized approach toward outbreak control and a growing resilience in dealing with concurrent emergency incidents. However, we also highlight how national government organizations imposed central control on aspects of the response in ways that undermined or misaligned with local preparedness. Thus, during emergencies, central governments can undermine the principle of subsidiarity and damage the ways in which LRFs can help scaffold local resilience. Our work contributes to the theoretical understanding of the social psychological factors that can shape the behaviour of responder agencies during a prolonged crisis. In particular, the implications of our analysis for advancing our conceptual understanding of strategic decision-making during emergencies are discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Many parents with learning disabilities find themselves locked in a struggle with child protection authorities to retain custody of their children. This struggle is one against deeply entrenched prejudices as well as social arrangements that often deprive parents of needed resources. This in-depth case study explores the contours of such a struggle, and the ‘tools' deployed by one couple to keep child protection at bay. The goal is first to give the parents a platform to tell their stories. The second is to help inform the knowledge base of parents, advocates and allied professionals. The third is to consider the impacts the developing disability rights environment is having upon these ongoing struggles. Method: This is a qualitative case study based on interview and document analysis and long-term involvement with a couple with learning disabilities. The material was coded according to the principles of grounded theory. Findings: Three key categories were identified. The first is ‘Lessons learned', referring to the knowledge and experience that the parents collected over a lifetime. The second is ‘Allies: The family', highlighting the importance of a strong family network. The third is ‘Secret weapons', a phrase used by the parents to denote a collection of advocates and professional supporters they strategically surrounded themselves with when needed. Conclusion: This story illustrates the parents' tactical skill and resourcefulness to retain custody of their children. We also document the addition of new tools the parents are able to make use of such as domestic disability and human rights protections that are in turn supported by international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, we also contend that families like theirs live in a state of fragility, and disruptions to their support can result in further child protection interventions. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: By embracing cultural diversity, human rights, and social justice – in its practice and knowledge production –, occupational therapy has been interested in discussing the theme of Africa, problematizing different contemporary social dynamics. Objective: To understand the trajectory, the construction of identity, and the demands of young African immigrant university students. Method: Qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews for data collection and thematic content analysis. Results: The first category, “Culture, identity, and daily life: crossing the Black Atlantic”, encompasses the perception of young people about otherness and cultural differences/identifications between Brazil and Africa in their daily lives. The second, “'A country of hunters?': prejudice, discrimination and colonial imaginary” dealt with reports of discrimination in everyday life and the imaginary about Africa in Brazil; The last category, “'The house belongs to the other': institutional support/helplessness and coping strategies”, discusses the conditions of reception and permanence of the African immigrant student at the university. Conclusion: The trajectory of African students goes through institutional care, and social and relational needs, which overlap in daily life, culture, and academic performance, emphasizing the experience of racial discrimination inside and outside the university that guides otherness in the construction of subjectivity of young people. The appreciation of African themes demonstrates a tendency of the profession to seek new epistems and decolonial theoretical-methodological constructions that produce other looks for human action in the tension of culture and power relations established by the modern world system. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

AB  - Lower vocabulary in German is repeatedly reported for students with Turkish migration background attending school in Germany. We investigated whether in students of Turkish descent (a) learning vocabulary is impaired when the teacher activates the negative stereotype that students with Turkish family language learn less well and (b) whether a Turkish-origin teacher, as an ingroup expert model, can mitigate negative effects of the activation of the stereotype. In an experimental study, Turkish- and German-origin students (N = 182) living in Germany worked individually on a tablet on a vocabulary learning task instructed by a teacher in a video tutorial who introduced herself with either a Turkish or German name. Before the task, the teacher either mentioned that students in general (no stereotype activation) or students who speak Turkish in their families (stereotype activation) often have difficulties acquiring new vocabulary. A multiple-group regression analysis showed that Turkish-origin students learned significantly more under stereotype activation with the Turkish-origin teacher than in all other conditions. Results suggest that students are particularly motivated to learn when the teacher represents their ingroup targeted by negative stereotypes and openly addresses potential difficulties students of the stigmatized ingroup may encounter. We discuss the findings in light of the literature on stereotype threat and on the role of ingroup expert models. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In January 1620, Sir George Calverley of Lea Hall, Cheshire, died intestate leaving behind him his widow, Lady Sidney Calverley, and five children. His eldest son, Hugh, aged six, was now a ward of court, the wardship falling to Prince Charles as Earl of Chester. Wardship was often problematic for widows regardless of their geographic location, but in counties where there was a particularly strong sense of community, kinship bonds and local rivalries could add an extra layer of anxiety and discord to their litigation. Lady Calverley confronted prejudice as widow, stepmother, and, being Welsh, as an outsider. Using court records and correspondence, this article examines the circumstances of Lady Calverley’s case and dissects how it unfolded through and beyond Prince Charles’s court of wards, an important but overlooked institution that to date has received no in-depth historical analysis. It illuminates the problems women faced in establishing themselves in close-knit communities, as well as how disadvantaged a widow could be in a patriarchal society despite the relative freedom she enjoyed as a feme sole. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In textbooks and other teaching material in the field of fine art education, the work of female artists is still not taken into account, despite today’s growing knowledge about them. Female artists are still treated superficially, which can lead to low perceptions among students regarding their contributions. In our study we examined the attitudes of 50 secondary school students with an average age of 15.6 years towards this topic. The research revealed the existence of gender stereotypes and prejudices among the abovementioned population, based on gleaning answers from questionnaires and fine art assignments. The fact that fewer female artists are studied in regular fine art classes compared to male artists spreads unnecessary stereotypes and prejudices regarding the inferiority of female artists. If artists of both sexes are treated equally in regular classes, this can be beneficial for both sexes. It also enables us to implement the content of gender equality in the school environment, which is in line with contemporary educational guidelines. © 2022, Pedagoska Obzorja d.o.o.

AB  - The stereotype of the Latin woman is commonly associated with sexuality. Brazilians seem to be particularly burdened by this stigma among Latin women worldwide. As immigrants, intersected by other matrices of oppression in addition to those of gender and race, for example, these women bear various marks remaining from Eurocentric coloniality that belittles and silences them (Mignolo, 2000/2003), a circumstance that is aggravated when the country of emigration is their coloniser. This article explores resorting to cyberspace as a forum for denunciation and feminist activism through a case study of the profile @brasileirasnaosecalam based on content analysis. The project appeared on the digital social network Instagram to anonymously report the harassment, discrimination and prejudice that Brazilian immigrant women suffer in Portugal, specifically for carrying their own nationality. Thus, through cyberactivism, which is also feminist activism, women are now experiencing a new cycle of political opportunities driven by the building and consolidation of ties among them around the globe, breaking down binarisms, including those between the first and the third world, in an appeal to cross-border articulation (Timeto, 2019). That shows the relevance of pursuing an ontological vision underpinned by a decolonial and intersectional feminist perspective that uses cyberfeminism as an ally to interconnect the digital and the real space. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

AB  - Research has proposed different models of how contact situations should be structured to maximize contact effects, focusing in particular on the role of categorization during contact. We conducted two experimental field interventions (Ns = 247 and 247) to test models that integrate different levels of categorization. Each of the tested models was contrasted against a no-intervention control condition. In both studies, we assessed effects shortly after the intervention (1 week later; i.e., posttest) and then after approximately 6 months (i.e., follow-up). In the first study, results generally supported the model where categorization precedes decategorization, showing effects on major dependent measures highlighted in research on intergroup contact: quantity and quality of contact, cross-group friendships, intergroup anxiety (marginal effect at follow-up), outgroup attitudes (only at follow-up). Evidence for follow-up effects for this model was, however, weaker in Study 2, where the delayed effects of the intervention emerged only indirectly, via changes in contact quality, outgroup attitudes, and approach behavioral intentions at posttest. Comparisons of the other two models (decategorization then categorization; and simultaneous categorization and decategorization) with the control condition (only in Study 1) provided weaker and inconsistent results. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Presence of gay men in mainstream media may have a positive impact on viewers’ attitude change. However, gay male characters are often stereotypically portrayed as feminine, and no research has yet explored audiences’ reactions to counter-stereotypical gay characters. Heterosexual Italian men (N = 158) were exposed to a clip portraying (i) a stereotypical feminine gay male character, (ii) a counter-stereotypical masculine gay male character, or (iii) a nature documentary. Compared to the other conditions, exposure to the counter-stereotypical gay character increased discrimination toward gay men, in the form of anti-gay jokes, the higher the level of participants’ prejudice against gay men. Results further demonstrated that this effect was explained by reduced perceived stereotypicality of the character. Findings are in line with the social identity theory prediction that when gay men (outgroup) are perceived as too similar, and potentially threaten the group identity, heterosexual men would attempt to restore ingroup distinctiveness. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Bertha Pappenheim was the real name of Anna O, the first psychoanalytic patient. In her treatment with Joseph Breuer, Pappenheim invented what she called “Chimney-sweeping,” the procedure of tracing a symptom back to its origins using free association. After her treatment and several subsequent hospitalizations, Pappenheim went on to become a pioneer of German-Jewish social work, a leading feminist, campaigner for women’s rights, and protector of unwed mothers and orphans. I have obtained multiple documents that reveal aspects of her life that have been unappreciated. She was cured not just by her psychoanalytic treatment, but also by realizing her intellectual gifts via her writing and by changing the society that was making her ill. In these ways, she resembled Harry Stack Sullivan, the founder of interpersonal psychoanalysis. Both faced a major crisis in late adolescence and went on to create environments that insulated victims of prejudice and allowed them to flourish. ©, William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis & Psychology and the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society.

AB  - Sexual minorities of color often speak about racism in White lesbian and gay communities while White sexual minorities often consider themselves liberals, especially for issues of racial justice. This study explored this contradiction by analyzing the role of sexual identities in predicting antiracist thoughts and actions of self-identified White people. Data from the 2010–2012 American National Election Survey provided information on the racial consciousness and social movement participation of White people (N = 2,552). In the end, sexuality differences in racial attitudes was somewhat or partially confirmed as White lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals endorsed fewer racial stereotypes and saw more racism than did White heterosexuals. However, these liberal sentiments of White lesbians, gays, and bisexuals were connected more to thoughts more than to political actions. Implications for methodological choices for studying race and sexuality were included, along with ideas for better understanding activism across racial lines. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There is a growing body of research examining the prejudice and discrimination experienced by Muslim youth in Canada. This article explores the narratives of feeling excluded and misunderstood articulated by 8 Canadian-born Shia Ismaili Muslim youth (aged 14-17). Drawing on a psycho-social theoretical framework, I speculate that youth utilize a “happiness defense:” a term that denotes their portrayal of being a “good immigrant” or happy subject who is grateful to Canada for giving them a home. My analysis looks behind the scenery of the happiness defense to examine deeper dynamics such as discomfort, difference, and anxiety as youth seek to find a place of belonging in Canada. Underneath the happiness defense, I speculate about the anxiety of hybridity that is linked to feelings of not belonging. The implications of these findings will be helpful for policy makers, educators, community workers, and adults who work with adolescents. ©, Curriculum and Pedagogy Group.

AB  - The article demonstrates how the problematic socio-political situation of nonheterosexual communities in Poland and Polish traditionalism significantly impacts how nonheterosexual people develop their sexual stories and perceive their sexual practices. It aims to shift the discussion on sex life, primarily conducted in the Anglo-American context that often focuses on the frequency of sexual contact and heteronormative understanding of sexual practices, into a more critical one, attentive to the socio-political context. The article maps queer narratives on sex life and reconstructs the role of heteronormative and homophobic patterns, prejudices, and stereotypes. It demonstrates how public norms and discourses are mirrored, negotiated, and challenged in queer sexual stories. Finally, it shows how these negotiations deeply influence the positionality of nonheterosexual people in Poland and their sexual choices and practices. The article concludes by sharing future paths for research on queer sexual life inspired by geographies of gender and sexualities. The presented analysis draws on 53 individual in-depth narrative interviews and a monthly ethnographic study conducted with 21 nonheterosexual families done within the Families of Choice in Poland research project. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The themes of sexuality and gender must be addressed at all stages of schooling. However, there is a certain invisibility during childhood, as well as a lack of interventions focused on educators. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a formative intervention about sexuality and gender in teachers of Early Childhood Education, in relation to the level of prejudice and attitudes related to sexual and gender diversity, gender roles, and educational competences for working with LGBT students. In total, 37 teachers participated in the study. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were performed in the form of parametric tests (paired samples t-tests) and a thematic analysis. The intervention was positively evaluated, the prejudice level was significantly reduced and there was an immediate effect in relation to the application of knowledge. We suggest the development of interventions on subtle manifestations of prejudice towards sexual diversity and gender roles. © 2022 Universidade de Sao Paulo 1. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social rejection during school years is a painful experience that has long-term effects, including development of negative attitudes toward minorities. Since social rejection is a complex experience, its effect in adulthood may be related to various background characteristics. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the effect of social rejection on negative attitudes toward minority groups in adulthood is related to group dominance and level of religiosity. Using a quantitative method, we administered a questionnaire that tested attitudes of 300 Israeli-born Jewish young people regarding Israeli Arabs and Jews of Ethiopian descent. In accordance with the hypotheses, social rejection was found as a predictor of negative attitudes toward minority groups only among members of the dominant group and those with high level of religiosity. The findings of the current study contribute to Social Dominance Theory and to the literature dealing with double marginality, since they demonstrate for the first time that social rejection at school combined with belonging to a dominant group (men and/or individuals of European descent) predicts a rejection of minority groups. However, social rejection at school combined with belonging to a non-dominant group (women and/or individuals of North African/Middle Eastern descent) predicts an acceptance of minority groups. Also, this research contributes to understanding the complex association between religiosity and prejudice, since it reveals that strong religious beliefs predict negative attitudes toward minority groups of the same religion only when they are combined with high level of social rejection at school. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: In Ecuador, adoption is limited to heterosexual couples and information on attitudes toward same-sex couples who intend to become parents following this pathway is scarce. This study aimed to identify the beliefs of a sample of 319 cisgender people in Ecuador regarding the adoption of children by same-sex couples and explore the reasons why they consider it is appropriate or not for lesbian and gay (LG) couples to adopt children. Methods: Between May and October 2019, participants responded quantitative and qualitative questions after reading a vignette about a couple interested in adopting a child. Participants were randomly presented with one out of three versions of the vignette based on the couples’ sexual orientation (L,G, heterosexual). Descriptive, correlational statistics and analysis of variance were used to conduct quantitative analyses. Qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic and content analysis. Results: Results indicate favorability toward adoption by all couples in general. However, people showed the highest concerns about adoption by LG couples. Qualitative answers indicate the existence of nine types of arguments used by participants to explain their position in favor or against adoption by same-sex couples. Conclusion: Some are problematic since they are rooted in prejudiced ideas about heterosexual people’s superiority regarding their capacities to create emotionally nurturing environments. Policy Implications: Providing information regarding LG parenting might be a way of achieving legislative changes that might, in turn, promote social change by providing a legal platform for same-sex couples to achieve parenthood. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pro-refugee philanthropy is beneficial for refugee integration and an important contributor to intergroup relations in a South African context. No study, however, has provided an in-depth quantitative analysis of what factors drive this type of behaviour. This article investigates what cultural, social and religious factors may predict participation in charitable behaviour towards refugees in South Africa. Three types of behaviours were examined: (i) material donations; (ii) volunteer activities; and (iii) information sharing. Using data from a 2019 Ipsos Migration Survey, the study found that intergroup threat was a robust predictor of charitable behaviour of all kinds. Friendship contact with a pro-refugee volunteer was also positively associated with philanthropic behaviour. Institutional trust and religious orientation were correlated with volunteer activities and information sharing but not donations. Study findings can be utilised to design interventions that increase public participation in actions that help refugees in an African context. © 2022, International Society for Third-Sector Research.

AB  - Since the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) community may be exposed to violence, discrimination, stigma, exclusion, and maltreatment due to their sexual orientation while accessing healthcare services, understanding, and improving the attitudes of future’s health care professionals toward LGBTI individuals seem essential. This descriptive and cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the homophobia among medical, nursing, pharmacy, and healthcare sciences students and examine the related factors. The study included 2,531 students from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and other health sciences (midwifery, nutrition and dietetics, physiotherapy, management of healthcare facilities) disciplines. Homophobia was measured with the Hudson and Ricketts Homophobia Scale. After getting ethical and institutional approvals, data were collected and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests. Medical students had the lowest homophobia score, and their mean score was significantly lower than other students. There was a significant difference between students’ scores according to years of study, age, sex, acquaintance with LGBTI individuals, providing healthcare services to an LGBTI person, and opinions on providing care. Although homophobia scores of nursing, pharmacy, and other health sciences students were lower than the medical students’, policies and expansive content regarding LGBTI should be in place in all health science educational institutes, including medical schools, to prevent students from holding homophobic and prejudicial attitudes against LGBTI individuals. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) are foundational constructs in intergroup relations, yet their development across the lifespan is poorly understood. The few studies on the topic demonstrate that age positively correlates with both SDO and RWA. However, it is unclear whether this association is due to (a) normative aging, (b) generational differences associated with the period in which one was born and raised, or (c) a combination of these processes. This study estimates a series of cohort-sequential latent growth models to examine change due to both aging and cohort effects using 11 annual waves of longitudinal panel data collected from a nationwide random sample of adults (Ns = 61,858– 61,862). Mean levels of SDO and RWA both trended upward across the adult lifespan, although this pattern was more marked for RWA. Cohort effects also emerged for both constructs and were again more pronounced for RWA. Contextual factors thus appear to influence authoritarianism more than they impact the preference for intergroup hierarchy. Similar trends emerged when differentiating birth cohorts by gender and ethnic majority status. Age and cohort effects for generalized prejudice among an ethnic majority group were also assessed (N = 47,955), revealing that prejudice declined in early adulthood but began to stabilize in middle age. This is the first large-scale study to document how SDO, RWA, and generalized prejudice change over the adult lifespan while also examining trends associated with the period in which a person was born and socialized © 2022.

AB  - The current study assessed how the extent to which a gay man resembled a prototypical gay man influenced the judgements others made about them. We hypothesized that highly prototypical gay men would be perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes of gay men, engage in more activities within the gay community, viewed less positively by others, and receive more discrimination. Additionally, perceived group identification and negative stereotypes attributed to the gay man were expected to serially mediate the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, positive attitudes, and discrimination from others. Participants (N = 364) were randomly assigned to view stimuli depicting either a low or high prototypical gay man. High prototypical gay men were perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes, and engage in more stereotypical immoral activities, than low prototypical gay men. Moreover, perceived group identification and negative stereotype attribution serially mediated the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, attitudes toward target, and discrimination. Implications for the Prejudice Distribution Account are discussed. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - LGBTQIA+ people are often subjected to prejudice, discrimination, and violence in many societies. This sets a barrier for LGBTQIA+ people access to social services. This study was conducted to investigate LGBTQIA+ people access to social services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study findings using convenience sampling and exploration design with participants who identify themselves as LGBTQIA+ (N = 856) show that vast majority of LGBTQIA+ people living in Turkey faced serious problems with accessing social services like housing, social assistance, psycho-social support, and post-violence support mechanisms. Future studies which will investigate experiences of LGBTQIA+ people access to social services will help to make the needs and the problems of the LGBTQIA+ community visible and once awareness is made efforts can be made that contribute to the solution. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Children being vulnerable, have special protection under the law through their parents or guardian who are responsible for them; and make decisions for them because they lack legal capacity. One of these decisions a parent/guardian makes is determining the religion of a child. Once the parent/guardian chooses the religion of the child, the child may become bound by its practices throughout childhood. While the right of parents to determine the religion of their children is recognised by domestic, regional and international laws, the way courts in Nigeria treat this recognition suggests that the right is not absolute. This paper adopts the doctrinal methodology in interrogating the extent to which Nigerian Courts permit the observation by a child of the religious practices of his/her parent in relation to submission to medical treatment in order to protect the child's right to life. This paper argues that law and morality are media of social control but have their convergence and divergence. It further argues that sanctity of human life which for many forbids suicide, requires that even adults should not be allowed to object to medical treatment which refusal may result in death which can be seen as "disguised suicide." These authors examined the Supreme Court decision in Medical Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Council v. Okonkwo and found that; Nigerian Courts recognise parent right to choose their children religion and practices however, any religious practice prejudicial to the child based on the "best interest" principle provided under the Child Right Act and its States equivalent will be jettisoned. It examines the practice in Britain and Canada and draw lessons for Nigeria. This paper recommends public enlightenment, prohibition of harmful religious beliefs such as objection to life-saving medical procedure by parents for minors as means of balancing parents/guardian right to choose their children religious beliefs and preservation of the children right to life. © 2022 Universidad de Jaen.

AB  - Attitudes toward same-gender parenting are of timely relevance, given increasing recognition of LGBTQ+ rights around the world. Two studies examined the influence of 2 predictors of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. The first was informational influence, which was manipulated via a newspaper-style article dispelling misconceptions about gender identity of children reared by same-gender parents. The second was social influence via parasocial contact measured as prior exposure to a same-gender adoptive parents TV show. Religious fundamentalism (RF) was assessed as an individual difference moderator of informational or social influence. Outcome variables were beliefs about same-gender parenting, perceived problems with same-gender parenting, and social distance from same-gender adoptive parents. We studied these relationships in Canada (Study 1, where same-gender couples’ adoption is legal) and in Italy (Study 2, where same-gender couples’ adoption is not legal). RF moderated the results of informational and social influence in the Canadian context, such that those high in RF tended to be favorably influenced. In Italy, results of informational influence were typically observed among those low in RF, and social influence directly predicted favorable attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Informational and social influence can improve attitudes toward same-gender parenting, but RF and legal/cultural context are also important to consider. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This qualitative study examines the experiences of 22 newly qualified teachers of Ethiopian origin who tried to integrate into the formal educational system in Israel after completing their graduation. Despite the revolutionary change in Ethiopian educators’ inclusion since the 2000s, their number remains low and the difficulty of integrating graduates belonging to this community are routinely reported. The study pointed out that the graduates still encountered manifestations of racism, expressed in a paternalistic and even arrogant attitude towards them, by representatives of the local authorities, school staff members, and students’ parents. Yet, the study identified the universal challenges that every education graduate is facing as well as the ones that are unique to the graduates’ ethnic origin. Parallel to the essential changes required in the field of multicultural education and in eradicating prejudice and racism, the study proposes several ways for immediate improvement. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We explore the role of "political discontent"as a second dimension of American public opinion. Others have shown that a second dimension tends to capture social and/or racial attitudes. What happens when indicators of discontent are included in such analyses? Using data from two surveys and the ordered optimal classification (OOC) procedure, we scale seven items from the "discontent"literature alongside a larger set of questions that has been shown to capture the two-dimensional structure of mass opinion. Discontent items dominate the second dimension in both data sets. Further, five of the seven items predict voting for "insurgents"in the 2016 presidential primaries. Second-dimension attitudes matter in elections and concern the political system writ large. By extension, the liberal-conservative heuristic gives an incomplete picture of mass political behavior. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This paper examines an intervention using experiential learning and simulations in a virtual world that can promote social proximity, tolerance, and cooperation in diverse societies. The participants in the study were 125 Jewish and Arab students living in Israel. A mixed linear model for repeated measures analysis that included time of measurement (pre and post), ethnicity, and students’ age as independent variables revealed a main effect for time for most social groups included in this study; that is, the participants reported more social proximity to other groups after the course, including groups not studied in the course (the LGBTQ community and people of colour). The results of the study suggest that experiential learning has considerable potential in the field of education to help students question their prejudices, experience being someone else, and ultimately feel social proximity for the other, thus reducing stigmas and racism. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Europe has recently seen a massive multi-ethnic influx of migrants, marred by high social costs of inter-ethnic confrontation. This has prompted scholars to develop training schemes to improve the social skills needed to cope with this situation. Decades of studies have acknowledged empathy as a crucial variable in the development of positive interpersonal and intergroup relations. In this study, we tested a training program for enhancing empathy towards ethnically diverse people in 170 six- to nine-year-old children. The materials were drawn from other best-known training schemes and active techniques were used. Multicultural empathy was assessed with a self-report measure. Test, retest and follow-up (at 6 months) comparisons demonstrated the training’s efficacy, with improvement in multicultural empathy persisting six months later. The results suggest that it can be a useful tool to encourage the development of ethnocultural empathy starting from the first years of elementary school. The practical implications for school education are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Terror management strategies (TMS) are assumed to affect social prejudice. In a prior study, positive death valence in wave 1 reduced gender-related stereotypes in wave 2. Psychosocial intervention against prejudice requires a deeper understanding of the terror management process. We investigated the relationships between death anxiety, death valence, mortality salience and TMS in a mixed method study. Participants showed complex emotions in the face of death, including fear, anxiety, sadness and ambivalent calm. Positive death valence was associated with more conscious fear, but with less implicit death anxiety, while negative death valence was associated with more death denial. In conclusion, we propose death anxiety as a distal precursor and death valence as a proximate precursor of the plural TMS that are triggered by mortality salience. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Migrant and ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in alcohol and other drug (AOD) research. This qualitative study explored AOD use among young people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds in Melbourne, Australia. We conducted one focus group and 16 interviews and thematically analyzed data drawing on the social-ecological model of health. Theme one showed AOD use was considered a “normal” part of youth identity, particularly for participants who had grown up with peer groups in Australia. Theme two highlighted participant’s sense of responsibility to meet expectations and make informed decisions about AOD use to protect themselves and their friends. Theme three highlighted participant’s risk of experiencing AOD-related stigma through negative stereotypes and fear of consequences within families and communities, particularly among female participants. Participants’ perceptions and experiences differed by individual factors, interpersonal relationships, AOD accessibility across settings and broader gender, cultural and religious norms. Interventions developed with young people from migrant and ethnic minority backgrounds are needed to target the social-ecological factors underpinning AOD use, particularly stigma. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In a global community with increased immigration and rising sociocultural tensions, there is a need for psychometrically strong instruments that assess adjustment to increasingly culturally heterogeneous environments. The Multicultural Personality Inventory (MPI) is one such instrument, but previous studies have not reported the instrument’s invariance or item-level responses. The present study examined the psychometric properties of the MPI using item response theory, invariance analysis, and structural equation modeling with a sample of 1,194 participants. We found evidence for a 34-item instrument with a bifactor internal structure that demonstrated partial invariance across gender, race, and generational status. Evidence of concurrent and incremental validity of the MPI was established through predicted associations with acculturation, satisfaction with life, social dominance orientation, mental health, color-blind racial attitudes, and self-reported high school grade-point average, beyond any variance accounted for by Big Five variables. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Picturebooks about religion encourage children to be introspective about their own faith and spirituality, and facilitate conversations between children and adults. Reading picturebooks about faiths and beliefs different than their own, especially those which do not promote negative stereotypes, can also help young readers relate to others. However, books about faiths other than Christianity are underrepresented in libraries, as the majority of religious picturebooks published in the United States focus on Christian holidays and themes. This article presents a bibliography of informational picturebooks which pair words and images to explain religious and spiritual concepts. The books featured are intended for a wide audience and includes multi-faith stories, as well as stories about Judaism, Islam, and atheism/agnosticism. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Our research, conducted with 30 Black students at a predominantly White institution, used mixed qualitative methods to investigate Black students' sense-making of experiences that signalled their non-belonging. All participants experienced both overt and covert racism including the n-word, racist humour, and negative stereotyping; and this occurred in public and intimate spaces. Our reflexive thematic analysis centred on interactional dynamics that can explain how racism on campus is rendered acceptable; and how and why this is consequential for how Black students can act. We found that White students' practices of “acceptable” racism entailed the denial of responsibility and the privileging of White experiences to deflect responsibility. Importantly, these devices signal that the use of racist discourses does not always arise from unconscious bias or naivety. The perceived power dynamics whereby White students decide who belongs and what is acceptable contributed to Black students' inability to act on their own terms. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Globally, education of children with disabilities increasingly occurs in inclusive school settings, requiring specialised teacher education. Scholars emphasise relational and instrumental skills, to overcome prejudice and exclusion. Visual impairment (VI) is emotionally evocative, presenting particular challenges to inclusion. Using data from in-service teacher education for VI inclusion in South Africa, this theoretical paper explores the personal and emotional barriers which teachers must negotiate surrounding the ‘new reality’ of VI in their classrooms if successful inclusion is to be achieved, and how teacher education may support this. We set qualitative data from an in-service short course for teachers of VI learners against ideas from disability studies, critical psychoanalysis and anthropology, conceptualising relational issues arising from VI in the classroom. Due to VI's evocation of unconscious anxieties in the observer, we argue that the experiences and needs of children with VI may be felt as ‘matter out of place’ in the classroom, confounding inclusion. Teacher anxiety threatens the capacity for containment and creativity, undermining the secure relationship which is elemental to successful learning. To manage the experiences, feelings and needs of VI learners, teachers require education which facilitates processing of their own emotions surrounding this evocative form of disability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Based on social psychological theories of intergroup relations, perceptions of threat from outgroups contribute to ingroup favoritism. This research examined the effects of the perceived threat from outgroups (the US) on Chinese people’s favorable evaluations of their government’s responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study 1 conducted an experiment and found that the US’ criticism of China’s responses to the pandemic increased Chinese citizens’ favorable evaluations of the government’s performance. Study 2 was a correlational design and found that the relationship between perceptions of outgroup threats and evaluations of the government’s performance was moderated by ideology and the approval of lockdown policies. These results show that outgroups are sophisticatedly employed by politicians to increase ingroup favoritism and suggest that ideological divide is an important moderator in the association between outgroup threat and the evaluation of ingroup. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the manifestation of the damage caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the extreme FASD manifestation, show both facial dysmorphology and mental retardation. Alcohol consumed during gestational age prejudices brain development by reducing, among others, the synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammatory markers. Alcohol drinking also induces oxidative stress. Hypothesis/Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the potential association between neurotrophins, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in 12 prepubertal male and female FASD children diagnosed as FAS or partial FAS (pFAS). Methods: Accordingly, we analyzed, in the serum, the level of BDNF and NGF and the oxidative stress, as free oxygen radicals test (FORT) and free oxygen radicals defense (FORD). Moreover, serum levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1, TGF-β, and TN-F-α) involved in neuroinflammatory and oxidative processes have been investigated. Results: We demonstrated low serum levels of NGF and BDNF in pre-pubertal FASD children with respect to healthy controls. These changes were associated with higher serum presence of TN-F-α and IL-1α. Quite interestingly, an elevation in the FORD was also found despite normal FORT levels. Moreover, we found a potentiation of IL-1α, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-1α1 in the analyzed female compared to male children. Conclusion: The present investigation shows an imbalance in the peripheral neuroimmune pathways that could be used in children as early biomarkers of the deficits observed in FASD. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Concept creep explains how established social concepts expand to incorporate new phenomena, with such expansions fundamentally changing conceptual definitions and contributing to a loss of a shared social understanding. However, the existing work has focused on concept creep within a small number of categories that are typically more salient for those on the political left. In this work, we examined whether concept creep is a predominantly leftist phenomenon, or whether the same conceptual expansion is present for typically conservative-salient categories, by exploring judgments of concept breadth for a range of social topics. We found evidence for such symmetry when considering concept breadth for categories such as sexual deviance, terrorism, and personal responsibility—with some nuanced exceptions. We discuss our findings in relation to growing political polarization, intergroup relations, and the study of partisan differences using a variety of politically salient stimuli. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Concern about antisemitism in the U.S. has grown following recent rises in deadly assaults, vandalism, and harassment. Public accounts of antisemitism have focused on both the ideological right and left, suggesting a “horseshoe theory” in which the far left and the far right hold a common set of anti-Jewish prejudicial attitudes that distinguish them from the ideological center. However, there is little quantitative research evaluating left-wing versus right-wing antisemitism. We conduct several experiments on an original survey of 3500 U.S. adults, including an oversample of young adults. We oversampled young adults because unlike other forms of prejudice that are more common among older people, antisemitism is theorized to be more common among younger people. Contrary to the expectation of horseshoe theory, the data show the epicenter of antisemitic attitudes is young adults on the far right. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Exploring children's awareness of social categories could uncover the foundation of intergroup attitudes and behaviours. Indigenous to Ireland, Travellers are an ethnic minority marked by a tradition of nomadism, only formally recognised as a distinct ethnic group in 2017. This brief report analyses data from 148 children aged 6–12 (55% female) in the Republic of Ireland. A quantitative task was adapted and applied to assess children's awareness of symbols associated with the Traveller community. We found that primary school children could accurately categorise the symbols which relied on perceptually obvious markers of Traveller identity, and that this remained stable across middle childhood. However, children did not correctly categorise symbols related to less observable elements (e.g., language, trade, religion). To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first to identify specific symbols which are salient in children's awareness about this marginalised group. Implications for school-based interventions are discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The majority of writing on global human rights diffusion focuses on the state level and state’s rejection or assimilation of such norms. This paper turns the focus to the international level and to the norm gatekeeper, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW. The study examines how CEDAW translates the mission of eradication of negative stereotypes. The analysis is based on close reading of UN policy documents defining the concept of stereotypes, and a content analysis of 55 commentary reports addressed to Muslim states from 2010 to 2019. The paper identified three main obstacles to an effective process: the UN’s emphasis on the behavioural manifestation of stereotypes instead of confronting social perceptions; the commentary reports’ use of vague and superficial terminology that fails to operationalise eradication of stereotypes; and a deficiency of positive social and cultural models that inhibits a vision for a world devoid of stereotypes. To conclude, CEDAW condones the presence of negative stereotypes but at the same time avoids translating its mission into clear applicable action. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The psyche-altering effects of COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable tourism behaviors are underexplored. More so, the scant research largely presents tourists’ perspective. Extending this body of work, our study–deploying evolutionary tourism paradigm, examines whether, the why and when perceived COVID-19 infectability (pathogen avoidance motive) impairs resident hospitality, using a multi-wave data from MTurk U.S. workers (N = 857). As predicted, perceived COVID-19 infectability relates positively with tourist negative stereotype, which then relates negatively with resident hospitality. Unexpectedly, perceived COVID-19 infectability’s relation with resident hospitality was positive. However, tourist negative stereotype transmits the negative effect of perceived COVID-19 infectability to resident hospitality. Moreover, COVID-19 origin belief amplifies the positive effect of perceived COVID-19 infectability on tourist negative stereotype, and further strengthens the indirect effect of perceived COVID-19 infectability on resident hospitality through tourist negative stereotype. Theoretical, social, and managerial implications for sustainable tourism development have been discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Older lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people are concerned that their needs will not be recognised, understood or met in older age care spaces. Some are especially worried about care provided by religious care organisations and/or staff with negative beliefs about LGBTQ people and their lives. While these issues have been raised at the margins of previous research, there has not, until now, been a study which has focussed upon them. This article reports on a recent UK preliminary scoping consultation research project, which explored older LGBTQ people’s views about possible care from religious organisations and/or carers. The findings highlight four key fears about: 1) inferior care quality; 2) a lack of affirmative, anti-oppressive care; 3) religious-based prejudice and discrimination; 4) religious conversion attempts. Each theme is considered in relation to social justice, i.e., equality of resources, recognition, representation, and relationality. The need for open dialogue and debate is highlighted and a research agenda is proposed. There is an urgent need to understand what happens in the delivery of care to LGBTQ people by religious care organisations and/or staff, place the concerns identified here in their proper context and determine the appropriate responses. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Peer education regarding respect for LGB individuals can be understood as citizenship education with a specific content. Students who participate in an intervention to increase respect for sexual and gender minorities may also increase their general citizenship competences. Also, participation in such an intervention may strengthen students’ awareness of the relationship between reflections on citizenship and attitudes toward LGB people. A peer educator intervention on sexual and gender minorities was implemented in pre-vocational secondary education by peer educators and 13 to 17 years old students. We examined the impact on attitudes toward LGB peers with a one-group pretest post-test design, and also used this method to examine reflections on acting as a democratic citizen. We found one significant (positive) correlation between a positive judgment of LGB peers and reflection on acting in a socially responsible manner, which was one of the three democratic citizenship reflection scales we used. No effects were found on either attitudes toward LGB peers or reflection on acting as a democratic citizen. Peer education that is more integrated into the daily social practice of students may increase impact. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - For many decades, the question of setting up bilingual place-name signs accompanied the ethnic conflict between the German-speaking majority and the autochthonous Slovene-speaking minority in Carinthia (Austria). On the 10th anniversary of the 2011 compromise concerning the dispute about place-name signs, this article takes a closer look at the characterization of ethnic relations in Carinthia in the past few decades. According to a practice–theoretical empirical approach, the key to understanding this ethnic minority is the disappearance of the Slovene language. This article examines the manifold strategies used by young people to perform Carinthian Slovenian identity during leisure time in the context of, or apart from, cultural associations. With these strategies, adolescents actively try to react to the threatened disappearance of their language as they advocate for its preservation and ensure its enduring presence. The central role of the symbolic dimension of Slovenian language usage is striking. The social cohesion of the Slovene-speaking population must therefore be understood as performative ethnicity. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The self-perception of prejudice and discrimination (SPPD) is a global assessment of the degree to which individuals see themselves as the target of negative attitudes and behaviors because of their social group. This study sought to create a scale to measure SPPD. Evidence of validity was sought based on content, structure, and relationships with other variables. The scale was applied to 571 adults strongly identified with their social groups. A single-factor structure was found, with satisfactory internal consistency and adequate discrimination and threshold parameters. Correlations with other variables were found as theoretically expected. For example, SPPD correlated positively with neuroticism and negatively with belief in a just world. Finally, we found that people from groups with low social status had higher levels of SPPD compared to groups with high social status. The set of evidence shows a different-groups-oriented short-form scale with satisfactory psychometric properties to measure SPPD. © 2022, Associação Brasileira de Psicologia.

AB  - Using a vignette approach, two studies examined the impact of three factors on judgments of parental competence: target parents’ sexual orientation, gender, and parenting behavior. According to the aversive prejudice framework, people should express their subtle prejudice against lesbian and gay parents when the latter show detrimental parenting behavior––that is, when devaluation is easy to rationalize. Samples of 170 and 290 German heterosexual participants each were presented with a parent-child conflict situation. In Study 1, the child threw a public tantrum during a restaurant visit; in Study 2, the children wanted to play outside instead of doing their homework. Irrespective of target gender, lesbian and gay parents were judged as equally or even somewhat more competent than heterosexual parents. In both studies, parents who responded in an authoritative way received the most positive evaluation of parental competence, whereas parents who responded in an authoritarian way received the most negative evaluation. In neither study, however, there was a significant interaction between parents’ sexual orientation and parenting behavior. That is, contrary to hypothesis, lesbian and gay parents did not receive more negative evaluation than heterosexual parents when responding in a comparatively negative, authoritarian or permissive way. Such interaction could also not be found when additionally considering participants’ levels of homonegativity or social desirability. The discussion centers on the increasing acceptance of same-sex parenthood as well as the high appreciation of authoritative parenting in contemporary Germany. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates changes in racial apathy among white young adults using nationally representative panel survey data from the NSYR. Our regression models include social background, social values, and academic orientation variables specified as important correlates of racial apathy in prior cross-sectional studies. We also include interracial contact variables, which existing studies neglect. According to intergroup contact theory, interracial contact should predict decreases in racial apathy. We find variables specified as important correlates in prior cross-sectional studies do not explain changes in racial apathy across time. Surprisingly, interracial friendship associates negatively with increases and decreases in racial apathy. Further, interracial dating predicts increases in racial apathy across time. These findings suggest racial apathy may be dissimilar to other forms of white racial prejudice and interracial contact may be an ineffective method to reduce contemporary forms of white racial prejudice. © 2022 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - Promoting prosocial behaviour towards those who are dissimilar from oneself is an urgent contemporary issue. Because children spend much time in same-gender relationships, promoting other-gender prosociality could help them develop more inclusive relationships. Our goals were to better understand the development of school-age children's intergroup prosocial behavior and the extent to which elementary school-age children consider their own and the recipient's gender in prosocial behaviour. Participants included 515 3rd, 4th and 5th graders (263, 51.1% boys, Mageinyears = 9.08, SD = 1.00) surveyed in the fall (T1) and spring (T2). We assessed children's prosociality using peer nominations. Children became more prosocial toward same-gender peers over time but prosocial behavior toward other-gender peers remained stable. We found that gender mattered: Children showed an ingroup bias in prosociality favouring members of their own-gender group. Having other-gender friendships positively predicted children's prosocial behaviour towards other-gender peers over time. Children's felt similarity to other-gender peers was not directly, but indirectly, related to more prosocial behaviour toward other-gender peers. Findings shed light on potential pathways to fostering school-age children's intergroup prosocial behaviors. © 2022 British Psychological Society.

AB  - Social psychological research on collective victimhood has often focused on comparisons between the ingroup's and outgroups' collective victimization (i.e. comparative victim beliefs such as competitive victimhood or inclusive victim beliefs). This qualitative study examines how people in different contexts of collective victimization and its aftermath make sense of items commonly used to assess comparative victim beliefs, and how they extend or challenge these constructs and their underlying assumptions. We used thematic analysis to analyse eight focus group discussions among four minority groups in the United States with historical or more recent experiences of collective victimization (Armenian Americans, Burundian refugees, Jewish Americans and Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees). Findings extend commonly assessed comparative victim beliefs and reveal participants' critical perspectives on these constructs. The findings also highlight the dialectical structure of collective victim beliefs: Participants not only endorsed but also rejected comparative victim beliefs, and relatedly described both ingroup power and outgroup power in the context of their group's victimization. These findings extend existing social psychological literature on comparative victim beliefs and intergroup relations. © 2022 British Psychological Society.

AB  - Although researchers predict that experiencing greater trait mindfulness should be related to less prejudiced attitudes towards others, the evidence has been inconsistent. We suggest that this is due to the narrow operationalizations of mindfulness that have been utilized thus far. Specifically, research to date has relied solely on mindfulness as it pertains to the self. We therefore examined an expanded definition of mindfulness to study the role of nonjudgmental attitudes towards others and its relation with prejudice. Using a new measure of Nonjudgmental Regard towards Others (NRO), the current study found that Ideological Acceptance, or judgments of another’s actions, ideas, and personality, and Emotion Acceptance, or acceptance of another’s emotions and emotional expressions, were independently associated with prejudiced attitudes towards numerous different outgroups such as drug users, people who are overweight, homosexuals, and people with disabilities. Furthermore, they were able to explain variance over and above the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism. Having a nonjudgmental regard towards others, not just the self, may be an important component of mindfulness that has not yet been explored. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - At the core of what makes humans, and their behaviour, social, is the interplay between self and other. Our identities, for example, are essential to our functioning as social beings as they allow us to make sense of ourselves, and others, across different contexts. We care about how others see us and achieving congruence between how we see ourselves, how we think relevant others see us, and indeed how relevant others actually see us in turn, becomes integral for achieving a positive sense of self. Therefore, humans require recognition from relevant others. This recognition can take many different forms, from legal recognition of one's rights in society, to social recognition of one's belonging to different groups. Moreover, the absence of recognition can lead to serious repercussions and consequences, resulting, on an individual level, in a reduced mode of being and feelings of exclusion, and on a social and political level, in tensions and conflict. The current special issue takes a multidisciplinary approach to contribute to the growing debates and discussions around the importance of understanding recognition and its role in social behaviour. As the introduction to this special issue, this paper argues that the concept of recognition enables a better understanding of how identification and belonging become entangled with power struggles and expressions of agency. Doing so leads us to conclude that a social psychology of identity and intra/intergroup relations which does not consider power relations, as bound up in processes of recognition and its denial, fails to consider the key processes and broader impact that exclusion, subtle or explicit, has on individuals' well-being, belonging and ability to act in the world. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The negligence of implementing a decisive approach against bullying and victimization has caused schools and parents a lot of pain. Many scholars have argued that the school's lack of practical teaching of multicultural education can lead to an increased rate of school bullying, oppression, prejudice, assault, victimization, and discrimination, invariably causing grave catastrophes in the academic institutions such as shootings, sexual molestation, deaths, etc. The secondary data used for this current study was adopted from the Education statistics database (2015–2019) measuring specifically the issues of bullying and victimization of 6th -12th-grade students. A descriptive quantitative research methodology was applied in exploring the variables of the study, and SPSS software was applied in analyzing the data. The study revealed out of the 24,650,000 bullied and non-bullied students, male students were the most participants with 50.9%, and female students were 49.1% having the Mean, SD, and Variance for gender at 4.23, 0.223, and 0.174 respectively. For grade, Mean = 6.87, SD = 4.24, Variance = 2.54, race/ethnicity Mean = 2.97, SD = 3.05, Variance = 1.23, household income Mean = 2.7, SD = 3.86, Variance = 2.77. The result deduced that few bullied students reported their experiences due to the possible threats from the bullies. However, 20.2% of the reported bullying cases is considered abysmal given the total population of the bullied students at 4,986,000. Stringent punitive measures were highlighted by numerous scholars as means to control and eradicate assaults on the school premises. Nonetheless, multicultural practices and multicultural education were recommended as the perceived anti-dote to foster a healthy learning community that is free of victimization and oppression. In conclusion, the study posited that multicultural education practices can be a pedagogical tool to teach students the dangers of victimizing and bullying a fellow student. © 2022

AB  - The political mobilisation of nostalgia is increasingly preoccupying social and political psychologists. A key concern is with rising populism and the use of an imagined golden past to foster threat through anti-EU and anti-immigrant sentiment. This article introduces two key concepts, anemoia – imagining a past not experienced – and prolepsis – how the past influences actions in the present aligned to future goals – to argue that actual recall of past biographical events potentially counters the influence of nostalgic rhetoric designed to influence political decision-making. The focus of this article is a single Scottish case study, Rachel, a member of the Silent Generation of citizens aged over 75 years, who have a living memory of World War II and its aftermath. A dialogical analysis was carried out identifying key I-positions and chronotopic analysis of the dialogical self, relating to experienced extreme childhood poverty and deprivation, anti-Semitism and limited mobility. This demonstrated how living through a historic event and its repercussions, rather than imagining a past not experienced, mitigates against nostalgia. This raises the question of how much mobilisation of the events of a glorious past and anxieties about the future rely upon the unexamined silence of those who recall those same events. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Despite the growing scholarship on Romanian migration after the fall of state socialism in 1989, Romanian women’s migration to France remains largely unexplored. Studies have tended to focus on economic, rural, and low-skilled women’s migration to destinations with gendered labour demands. Based on ethnographic research, this article examines urban, student, and educated women’s migration, by exploring their aspirations and desires to migrate and their everyday experiences in France. Overall, France has attracted a diverse group of Romanians whose migration cannot be explained by push and pull factors alone. Student and educated women of different ages, social statuses, and skill levels invoked migration desires shaped by both personal and political reasons. This article examines women’s drivers of migration and shows that parents, fellow citizens, and social class play decisive roles in their decisions to migrate, enable their departures, and facilitate their arrivals in France. However, social class, including its associated symbolic capital, becomes less prominent in shaping women’s everyday lives in France, where their nationality and its related negative stereotypes can expose women to discrimination and exclusion. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explored the racial bias perceptions of study abroad alumni following international learning experiences in East Africa. Ninety-seven participants, who completed a semester-long study abroad between Fall 2016 – Spring 2019, were recruited into the study. Open-ended survey questions evaluated perceptions of racial bias, racial prejudice, and racial identity development. Six themes emerged, following thematic analysis: (1) integration of race-conscious curriculum and experiential learning, (2) mutuality in local relationships, (3) immersive experiences with rural host families, (4) U.S. faculty in the study abroad context, (5) exposure to implications of racism in a field study, and (6) student reflections of racial majority/minority dynamics. Student perceptions of how and why study abroad experiences influenced implicit racial bias, racial colorblindness, critical consciousness, and racial identity development could inform higher education curricula. Implications for future study abroad practice include empowerment of students of color, opportunities for anti-racism learning, and the relevance of race-conscious curricula in study abroad programs. © 2022 European Association for International Education.

AB  - In Brazil, transgender individuals, those whose gender identity differs from the assigned biological sex, are marginalized by society and face difficulties in accessing the Unified Health System. This study sought to identify these difficulties by carrying out an integrative review of papers published in the SciELO, LILACS, MEDLINE, Virtual Campus for Public Health, Base de Dados de Enfermagem, and Coleciona SUS databases, in the last five years. Of the 26 articles found, only nine met the inclusion criteria. Based on their references other nine papers were included, thus totaling 18. Results point to the following difficulties encountered: Hostility in care; disrespect for the social name; technical and scientific unpreparedness of professionals; difficulty of access to gender reassignment procedures; and prejudice. It is therefore of paramount importance to implement interventions to minimize segregation, and invest in further research on this topic. © 2022, Conselho Federal de Medicina. All rights reserved.

AB  - Identity fusion is traditionally conceptualized as innately parochial, with fused actors motivated to commit acts of violence on out-groups. However, fusion’s aggressive outcomes are largely conditional on threat perception, with its effect on benign intergroup relationships underexplored. The present article outlines the fusion-secure base hypothesis, which argues that fusion may engender cooperative relationships with out-groups in the absence of out-group threat. Fusion is characterized by four principles, each of which allows a fused group to function as a secure base in which in-group members feel safe, agentic, and supported. This elicits a secure base schema, which increases the likelihood of fused actors interacting with out-groups and forming cooperative, reciprocal relationships. Out-group threat remains an important moderator, with its presence “flipping the switch” in fused actors and promoting a willingness to violently protect the group even at significant personal cost. Suggestions for future research are explored, including pathways to intergroup fusion. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Across six studies, we tested how people with physical disabilities were ascribed mental faculties. People with physical disabilities were seen as more capable of mental agency (e.g., thinking), but not more capable of experience (e.g., pain), compared to nondisabled people (Study 1). People with physical disabilities were also seen as more capable of supernatural mental agency (e.g., seeing the future, reading minds; Study 2). Believing that people with physical disabilities were more mentally agentic than nondisabled people was unrelated to Beliefs in a Just World (Study 3) but was related to beliefs about hardship (Study 4). Narratives of overcoming adversity, common in portrayals of the disabled community, increased the perceived mental sophistication of people with physical disabilities (Study 5). Finally, hardship narratives also affected helping behavior toward people with physical disabilities (Study 6). Thus, hardship stories surrounding individuals with disabilities may contribute to beliefs that they have particularly sophisticated minds. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Mental illness stigma is a significant barrier to utilizing mental health services for young populations. Few studies have evaluated how specific stigma dimensions relate to help-seeking and recommendations among adolescents. We examined how the stigma dimensions of labeling, stereotypes, and separation/discrimination influenced self-reported help-seeking behaviors of adolescents and recommendations for hypothetical peers with a mental health problem. Longitudinal data (four assessments) from a study evaluating the effectiveness of three antistigma interventions (curriculum, contact, materials, vs. control) among adolescents were analyzed (n = 396). Help-seeking outcomes comprised services in formal (e.g., doctor), informal (e.g., friend), or school-based (e.g., school counselor) settings. Generalized estimating equations tested associations of labeling, stereotypes, and separation/discrimination on help-seeking for a personal problem and recommendations for vignette characters described as having bipolar depression or social anxiety disorder. Adolescents were more likely to make help-seeking recommendations for peers with mental health problems than they were to seek help for a problem of their own. Labeling was a strong predictor of selfreported help-seeking and recommendations. Mental health literacy, an indicator for low negative stereotypes, was related to increased recommendations but not self-reported help-seeking. Positive stigma action and awareness—high cognizance of stigma and how to engage in proactive behaviors toward treating and destigmatizing mental illness—increased help-seeking in formal and informal settings for oneself. Finally, separation/discrimination did not prevent self-reported help-seeking, but it did increase peer recommendations in certain settings. Stigma did not always influence or interfere with help-seeking in the same way when the help-seeker was oneself versus a peer. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - The purpose of this article is to identify the relation of cultural prejudice and discrimination against social minorities. For this, an integrative literature review was carried out, specifically considering the categories ethnicity, color, and nationality. The results were classified into three thematic axes, the first of which made reference to the target groups of cultural prejudice investigated by the literature. The second axis identified psychological, institutional, health, work and socialization, and culture impacts of the target groups of cultural prejudice. Finally, factors that potentiate discrimination were also identified in the literature. In this scenario, our research is pioneering to systematize the extent of the damage and impacts provided by cultural prejudice through scientific literature. © 2022, Associação Brasileira de Psicologia.

AB  - Literature on Muslims and Islam has not empirically assessed the impact of American Muslims’ gender, religiosity, income inequality, and the interaction between the latter two factors, on their attitudes toward homosexuality. Using logistic regression models fitted to data from the 2017 Pew Survey of US Muslims (n = 712), this article assesses these factors’ effects on their view that society should either accept or discourage homosexuality. Findings reveal that men, compared with women, and more religious individuals tend to express homonegativity; while those from higher-income households are likely to agree that society should accept same-sex relationships. Also, the religiosity-prejudice association is moderated by income inequality. These findings have important religious and social implications. Firstly, the prevailing approach of essentializing Islamic perspectives on homosexuality as being favorable or prejudicial overlooks that they are socially contingent. Secondly, policies contributing to Muslim minorities’ economic well-being can encourage them to embrace liberal religious and social values. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - While classmates have been identified as important socializing agents in relation to adolescents’ prejudice, there is limited understanding of how popularity status plays into classroom transmission of prejudicial attitudes. Drawing on theories of social influence, we used a three-wave panel of Swedish adolescents (N = 941, aged 13–15) to examine the role of sociometric and prestige popular classmates in the development of adolescents’ anti-immigrant attitudes. Multilevel repeated measurement models revealed positive relationships between popular and individual prejudice; between sociometric prejudice and the level and rate of change; and between prestige prejudice and wave-to-wave shifts in individual prejudice. Overall, we found sociometrically popular classmates to be more influential in relation to adolescents’ prejudice. Additionally, we found the effect of sociometric prejudice to be more pronounced if political issues were frequently discussed in the classroom. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The John R. Borchert Map Library was the ideal incubator for an experiment that has changed how a wide range of people are thinking about structural racism and the history of race in American urban environments. Mapping Prejudice used a cartographic visualization of racial covenants as the intellectual nexus of a project that transcended disciplinary boundaries and invited community members into cutting-edge research work. The Map Library provided the physical space, resources, and geospatial expertise necessary for community-driven mapping work. It also served as an intersectional hub necessary for this transformative research initiative, illustrating the synergies between map librarianship and other disciplines. The work depended on the unique contributions of the map librarian: project management; experience networking with researchers, campus departments, and community groups; and knowledge of best practices surrounding data management, curation, and reuse. This article explains how Mapping Prejudice changed academic scholarship and public understandings by engaging volunteers in meaningful research. It concludes by providing a description of future directions for this project and calls on librarians to lead more work of this kind. The example of Mapping Prejudice suggests ways that map librarians can be leading new modes of inclusive, equitable and community-responsive research. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Allport’s Theory of Interpersonal Contact suggests that coming into contact with a member of an outgroup should increase support for that outgroup. Previous studies find mixed results when applying Allport’s theory to reported contact with transgender people. We posit that this is due to imprecise and aggregated measures of contact and a lack of attention to the differences between contact that is ephemeral or ongoing and voluntary or obligatory. We explore our theories with data from a large, high-quality survey conducted in early 2020. We find that while various forms of contact (including voluntary and obligatory) predict warmer ratings on feeling thermometers, only close personal friendships—contact that is voluntary and ongoing—predicts attitudes toward transgender-inclusive policies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: Lantern is a sexual violence prevention program that has been implemented in 23 educational settings targeting children aged from birth to 5 in the province of Quebec, Canada. The current study aimed to document the effects of the Lantern training offered to practitioners in intervention and educational settings working with young children. Methods: A total of 164 practitioners completed a questionnaire before and after their participation in the Lantern training. Results: Positive effects are observed on participants’ knowledge, prejudice-free beliefs and sense of self-efficacy regarding practices designed to prevent sexual violence, provide sex education, and promote egalitarian relationships among young children. Conclusion: The proximity that practitioners share with children makes them ideal prevention allies. The Lantern training gives them tools to cover concepts related to sexuality and sexual violence and to adequately intervene when the safety of a child may be compromised. © 2022 Sexologies

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and correlations of the perceived religious affiliation on a fictitious terrorism case. Participants were 402 French adults who completed a questionnaire after reading a scenario involving the arrest of a person (French vs. North African; man vs. woman) wearing an explosive belt. They indicated the level of the perpetrator’s religious affiliation and judged her/him and the act. The participants’ level of social dominance orientation (SDO) was measured and studied along in its two dimensions. The results showed an effect of ethnicity on perceived religious affiliation, which was correlated with judgment and mediated the effect of social dominance on judgment. The implications of this study are discussed in terms of intergroup interactions and religious prejudice. © 2022 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has exposed a global tendency throughout history to blame immigrants for propagating epidemics. Chinese individuals were thus targeted during past public health crises in Peru, but during the current coronavirus pandemic racist notions painting people of Chinese descent as “agents of contagion” diminished significantly. Here we examine three major epidemics (yellow fever, the bubonic plague, and covid-19) to demonstrate the current and somewhat surprising shift in negative attitudes toward the Chinese community. Peruvians’ refusal to embrace derogatory terms (the “Chinese virus”) or target individuals of Asian descent constitutes an intriguing case at a moment when xenophobic discourse is rampant in the Western hemisphere. © 2022, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - This study suggests that terrorism concerns can hinder the effect of prejudice reduction interventions based on education and outgroup knowledge. There is accordance in the literature that individuals who possess more knowledge about Muslim people and Islam are less likely to have anti-Muslim prejudice. We conducted secondary analyses of data from a representative sample of Australians (N = 1,267), and we found that terrorism concerns moderate the relationship between anti-Muslim prejudice and knowledge of Islam, wherein individuals with higher levels of terrorism concern have high anti-Muslim attitudes regardless of their levels of knowledge. In an experimental study manipulating terrorism concerns, a national sample of 502 Australians was randomly allocated to watch a news video about ISIS or a video portraying Muslims positively. Individuals who watched the ISIS video had significantly higher anti-Muslim attitudes and were significantly more likely to retain negatively framed information about Muslims than those who watched the positive video.

AB  - One critical role counseling psychologists can play in dismantling anti-Blackness and eradicating systemic racism is to build on the field’s strength in understanding individual-level processes (i.e., systems are created and maintained by individual actors). Drawing on antiracism scholarship, we aimed to better understand how colorblind racial ideology (CBRI), or the denial and minimization of race and racism, may serve as a barrier to engaging in antiracist praxis. Specifically, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine if color evasion (ignoring race) and power evasion (denying structural racism) CBRI were differentially associated with anti-Blackness and processes linked to antiracism. Findings based on 375 effects drawn from 83 studies with more than 25,000 individuals suggest different effects based on CBRI type. As hypothesized, we found that power evasion CBRI was related to increased endorsement of anti-Black prejudice (r =.33) and legitimizing ideologies (r =.24), and negatively associated with a range of other variables associated with antiracism, including social justice behaviors (r = −.31), multicultural practice competencies (r = −.16), diversity openness (r = −.28), and racial/ethnocultural empathy (r = −.35). Consistent with theory, color evasion CBRI was related to increased diversity openness (r =.12). We discuss limitations of our study, as well as outline future directions for research and practice to focus on the role of CBRI in sustaining and perpetuating anti-Blackness and systemic racism. Thus, this meta-analysis has implications for pushing the field of counseling psychology to build the bridge between individual ideologies and creating structural change. © 2022.

AB  - Objective: We argue the January 6th, 2021, insurrection represents the culmination of a breakdown of intergroup dialogue in the U.S.We further argue that group psychologists and group psychotherapists can help us understand the antecedents and outcomes of this breakdown and provide a productive way forward through fostering and facilitating intergroup dialogue and researching the process and outcomes of this small group intervention. Method: We review research related to some of the antecedents of a breakdown of dialogue across groups in the U.S. (e.g., affective polarization and social media) to highlight a need for more meaningful intergroup contact that reduces political and other identity-based (e.g., racial) segregation and builds intergroup understanding and empathy. Results: We illustrate how intergroup dialogue, a small group intervention, can help begin to address some of the antecedents and consequences of the breakdown in dialogue that preceded the insurrection on a local level. Conclusion: We conclude that group psychologists and group psychotherapists should devote efforts to understanding the process and outcomes of difficult intergroup dialogues (including how to increase participation in these dialogues), and use their group work skills to facilitate these dialogues on a local level. © 2022.

AB  - Bullied adolescents experience myriad poor outcomes, yet certain responses can have significant mitigatory effects. However, research has yet to examine how the racial context of these interactions affects adolescents’ evaluations of and beliefs about responding to social-exclusionary bullying (SEB). The sample comprised 219 ninth-grade Black (N = 84; females = 46) and White (N = 135; females = 81) students (Mage = 14.84, SD = 0.68; Nfemales= 92) recruited from 5 schools in a large, racially diverse, middle-class Mid-Atlantic metropolitan area of the United States. Participants judged the wrongfulness of 4 scenarios of same- and cross-race SEB and selected how the victims should respond to the victimization. Responses were coded as aggressive, assertive, adult assistance-seeking, or avoidant. Gender, scenario, and response strategy main and interaction effects emerged. The Black-excluder and White-victim scenario was rated least wrong. Assertive responses were selected more often in scenarios with White-excluders; avoidant responses were selected more often in scenarios with Black-excluders. Results suggest that racial context relates significantly to adolescents’ evaluations of and responses to SEB scenarios. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Driven by overwhelming numerical dominance of women in the role of nurses, nursing profession over the last two centuries has been largely scripted with gendered characterizations. However, nuances that shape the language and wording choices that are evoked when describing the stereotypes targeting male nurses remain relatively unexplored. Our current research examined the way 117 female non-nursing and nursing students in Canada characterized male nurses using open-ended self-report measures and thematic qualitative analyses. We contribute to the literature on nursing, gender, and stereotypes by analyzing the personal attitudes and stereotypes held by young female students toward male nurses. Social role theory and the stereotype content model provided the theoretical underpinnings to explore and explain emergent stereotypes and stereotype content. Our findings suggest that students generate more communal, high-warmth characteristics for male nurses than agentic characteristics, suggesting possible paternalistic prejudice toward men in nursing. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - As multiracial children of foreign-born parents, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama embody diversity in politics for many perceivers. Yet some have also questioned their loyalty to their respective groups. We explored perceptions of dual group members’ (DGM; dual nationals, multiracial people, and dual state residents) loyalty among first-party (those who share a group membership with a DGM target) and third-party perceivers (those who do not). Studies 1a–2b showed that first- and third-party perceivers rated DGMs as less loyal than their single group member (SGM) counterparts. However, only first- (Studies 2a–2b) but not third-party (Studies 1a–1b) perceivers preferred SGMs to DGMs for loyalty-dependent roles. Study 3 revealed that perceivers who were higher in patriotism supported DGMs for loyalty-dependent roles less when they were first- (vs. third) party observers. These studies suggest that perceivers readily intuit that DGMs are less loyal than SGMs and, under some conditions, this may lead to discrimination. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Sexual and gender minority (SGM) military veterans have endured a history of discriminatory policies and hetero and cis-sexist-related military culture that can negatively impact identity and mental health. The present pilot evaluation examined measure characteristics of the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale (LGBIS) and lesbian, gay, and bisexual positive identity measure (LGB-PIM) in a clinical sample of SGM military veterans in order to assess the potential use of these instruments in understanding identity and mental health in the context of program implementation. A cross-sectional pilot survey of 83 SGM veterans was conducted in 10 veterans affairs sites. Self-report data were collected as part of a quality improvement project across 2018 and 2019. Results showed that the sample was characterized by low internalized prejudice and identity uncertainty, as well as generally high positive aspects of identity (e.g., identity affirmation, authenticity, social justice beliefs). LGB-PIM subscale internal consistency values were acceptable (α range =.89–.92), whereas LGBIS subscale values varied (α range =.51–.87). Acceptance concerns, identity uncertainty, and social justice beliefs distinguished mental health symptom severity levels. Higher identity uncertainty and social justice beliefs were associated with worse symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. Preliminary results support further application and study of the LGB-PIM and some LGBIS subscales as possible tools in program development and improvement within military veteran samples. © 2022.

AB  - This paper identified the barriers disabled experience in their daily lives using public transport as their travel means in Dhaka. A qualitative investigation of empirical data provides the framework for understanding passengers’ experiences with public transport to deal with barriers. In the city of Dhaka, a focus group discussion (FGD) was held with a group of 34 disabled persons. They shared their perceived barriers from their own experiences with public transport. The barriers I found were negative attitudes by drivers, misplacement of priority seats, unfriendly built environment, high cost of travel, imperfect design inside vehicles, prejudice and discriminatory attitude by other passengers, deficient levelling on transport infrastructure, long-distance between the transport stops/terminals and home, the profit-making tendency by transit boss, absence of audio support for the visually impaired, blockage in the footpath, fears of accidents and traffic injuries and wet or nasty weather. Then I suggested how we could solve their problems by increasing mobility, transport accessibility, social engagement, friendly attitude towards them, community or societal integration, and changing deep-rooted false cultural perception as well as prejudice. More research and studies are recommended to explore the accessibility challenges faced by people with disabilities in Dhaka using public transport. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The present study examined the effects on the role of color-blind racial attitudes on the link between internalization of the model minority myth and race-related stress. Using a sample of 309 (176 males and 133 females) Asian American college students, the present study examined the relationship between color-blind racial ideology (i.e., unawareness of blatant racial issues, unawareness of racial privilege and unawareness of institutional racism) on the link between internalization of the model minority myth (i.e., unrestricted mobility and achievement orientation) and race-related stress (i.e., social climate stress, interracial stress, within-group stress, racism stress and achievement stress). Results primarily suggest the denial of blatant racism and racial issues (and not denial of racial privilege and institutional racism) exacerbate the effect of internalizing the model minority myth related to unrestricted mobility, while it buffers the effect of internalizing the model minority myth related to achievement orientation on race-related social stress. Overall, findings of this study suggest that internalization of the model minority myth and the unawareness of race and racism needs to be considered when looking at adjustment of Asian American college students. These findings also suggest that previous differential findings associated with model minority myth and adjustment warrant a closer look at the different implications © 2022.

AB  - The last few years have been a testament to the fact that anti-Black racism is alive and well in America. It manifests not only in macro-level indicators of social inequity (e.g., housing, education) but also manifests within individual organizations. Importantly, individuals in organizations can endorse anti-Black attitudes and other racist sentiments that influence others’ expressions of bias. In the current research, we examine the power of proximal organizational norms in two studies. In Study 1, 269 participants heard a member of their organization condone or condemn anti-Black attitudes and were then asked to give their own attitudes about Black Americans. Results revealed that participants were strongly influenced by the organization member’s stance on anti-Black racism; compared to those in the control condition, those who heard an organizational peer condone anti-Black attitudes were also more likely to condone, and those who heard an organizational peer condemn these attitudes were also more likely to condemn. In Study 2, we continued to examine the impact of norms on expressions of anti-Black bias by investigating the relationship between bias expression and both proximal (within an organization) and distal (within a more socially and physically distant reference group, i.e., country) norms. Consistent with Study 1, results from 183 participants showed that the proximal norms (but not the distal norms) were strongly related to the expression of anti-Black bias. We discuss the results by considering the critical role that both individual workplace allies and collective organizations can play in shaping the expression of anti-Black bias. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Supporters of American Indian mascots claim that these mascots honor American Indians. If this is the case, then those who have more contact with, and are more supportive of, these mascots would logically demonstrate support for American Indian Peoples in other ways. In this study, we break new ground by employing a cultivation and social learning approach to examine possible associations between greater exposure to American Indian mascots and prejudice toward American Indians, as well as support for their rights. We used an online survey of 903 White Americans to examine associations between long-term exposure to American Indian mascots, attitudes toward Native appropriation, and support for American Indian Peoples. We found that greater exposure to sport media and more contact with American Indian mascots were associated with more prejudice toward and less support for American Indian rights, via double mediators—first via less opposition to American Indian mascots, and second via less opposition to other types of Native appropriation. These findings provide further evidence that American Indian mascots are harmful to American Indians, in this case via their association with higher levels of modern prejudice, less feelings of warmth, and less support for American Indian Nation sovereignty and trust relationship with the United States government. Further, our findings suggest that this harm may be related to lessons learned from the general phenomenon of Native appropriation, which includes acceptance of objectification and dehumanization of American Indians, disregard for their feelings, and legitimation of White settler colonial power. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The current study examined whether aversive and modern racists would convict Black defendants differently based on theoretical differences: aversive racists are egalitarian and discriminate when not reminded of their values, whereas modern racists do not espouse egalitarian values and discriminate when a non-racial reason exists to justify their behavior. Participants read a criminal trial where defendant race (Black vs. White), race salience (present vs. absent), and justification (weak vs. strong evidence) were manipulated. Results showed that aversive and modern racists convicted the Black defendant at similar rates, but aversive racists were more likely to convict the White than the Black defendant. Aversive racists were also more egalitarian and less socially conservative. The finding that aversive racists convict Black and White defendants differently, but modern racists did not, suggests the importance of distinguishing aversive and modern racists to obtain a more complete picture of racial discrimination in juror decision making. © 2022 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.

AB  - One of the difficulties in social research has been to disentangle the effects of race/ethnicity from social class. In two experimental studies with samples of both students and general population (total N = 416), we analyzed the effect of social class, ethnicity and their interaction on prejudice and discrimination using experimental methods. Social class (High vs. Low) and ethnic group (Roma vs. Non-Roma) were manipulated through a cover story. Study 1 showed a main effect of social class, not of ethnicity, on prejudice and discrimination. In Study 2 the effect of social class was replicated, and the interaction effect was also significant for all dependent variables. Results show that negative effects of social class are higher among Roma than non-Roma. Pooled analyses corroborated these findings. Social class is a predictive factor, especially in interaction with ethnicity and should be considered for predicting and reducing prejudiced attitudes and intergroup behaviors fostering inequality. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Despite increased emphasis on the role of inclusive practices and materials in post-COVID-19 classrooms and warnings about implicit biases against disadvantaged groups, the textbook problem has rarely been approached with equity measures in mind. This multimethod study aimed to investigate to what extent L2 reading materials, locally produced and used for refugee education in Turkey and New Zealand, include all children with different proficiency levels, gender identities and cultural backgrounds using corpus-driven methods. All verbal and nonverbal texts from ten thematically similar third-grade storybooks were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. Comparisons against measures of grammatical and lexical complexity, and of gender and cultural equity revealed that despite both being far from achieving the ideal composition for creating inclusive learning-friendly environments, TSL materials were lagging further behind ESL counterparts. They depended on almost uniform sets of easy-to-read narratives embodying simpler grammatical features and high-frequency words, and thus needed extension with relatively elaborate ones to accommodate mixed-abilities. Gender disparities were institutionalised through male overrepresentation in hero-making, negative stereotyping, familial and occupational identification, and engagement in monetary and mobility activities, but occasionally ameliorated, in the ESL case, by reversing conventionally-gendered domestic, technical and intellectual skills in texts and illustrations. The widest gap was observed in cultural representations because TSL materials, written from a tourist’s perspective, focused on imposing superficial knowledge of target-culture elements, and ESL materials on ensuring relevance through greater use of elements from diverse cultures. Therefore, egalitarian representations in gendered and cultural contents are required for their rehabilitation. © 2022, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR). All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: “Polyhandicap” is a French term used since the 1960s originally in the context of medico-social institutions. Its closest english translation is “Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities” but these terms may reflect a slightly different approach. Recent recommendations were issued by the French “Haute Autorité de santé”. The objective of this study is to explore the representations of different french stakeholders associated with “polyhandicap”, in order to better define the concept and facilitate international publications. Methods: This study is based on 33 semi-structured interviews conducted from January to April 2021 with medical doctors, rehabilitation workers, caregivers, and administrative staff involved with such patients. The interview explored the respondents’ opinion regarding the definition, assessment and management of “polyhandicap”. Results: Forty-five percent of the respondents include profound intellectual disability in the core-definition of “polyhandicap”. Other respondents highlight the variability of the importance of mental retardation and some associate this item to the difficulties encountered in communication. Coexisting disabilities are more or less extensively listed. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents state that the term of “polyhandicap” should not be restricted to injuries taking place during early brain development. Fifty-five percent consider that the needs of such patients are not adequately met. Discussion: These multiple representations, source of confusion, can be detrimental to people with “polyhandicap”. This French concept, comprising three levels of analysis (medical, functional and social), and imperfectly covering other terms used abroad, is difficult to transpose internationally. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS
Introduction: Le polyhandicap est un terme français apparu dans les années 1960 dans le contexte des institutions médico-sociales. La traduction anglaise la plus proche est PIMD « Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities », mais ces termes reflètent une approche légèrement différente. Des recommandations récentes ont été émises par la Haute Autorité de Santé. L'objectif de cette étude est d'explorer les représentations de différents acteurs français associés au polyhandicap, afin de mieux définir le concept et faciliter les publications à l'international. Méthodes: Cette étude est basée sur 33 entretiens semi-structurés menés de janvier à avril 2021 avec des médecins, des rééducateurs, des aidants et du personnel administratif impliqués auprès de ces patients. Les entretiens ont permis d'explorer leur opinion concernant la définition, l’évaluation et la prise en charge du polyhandicap. Résultats: Quarante-cinq pour cent des personnes interrogées intègrent le retard mental profond dans la définition de base du polyhandicap. D'autres répondants soulignent la variabilité de l'importance du retard mental et certains associent cet item aux difficultés de communication. Les handicaps co-existants sont plus ou moins répertoriés. Cinquante-huit pour cent déclarent que le polyhandicap ne devrait pas être limité aux lésions cérébrales survenant au début du développement cérébral. Cinquante-cinq pour cent considèrent que les besoins de ces patients ne sont pas suffisamment pris en charge. Discussion: Ces multiples représentations du polyhandicap sont sources de confusion et peuvent être préjudiciables aux personnes polyhandicapées. Ce concept, plutôt français, comprenant trois niveaux d'analyse (médicale, fonctionnelle et sociale), et couvrant imparfaitement d'autres termes utilisés à l’étranger, rend difficile sa transposition à l'international. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Guided by social cognitive career theory (SCCT; Lent et al. in J Vocat Behav 45(1):79–122, 1994), we assessed sociocultural (e.g., home-school cultural value mismatch) and contextual barriers (e.g., institutional climate) in science education and career development at both a baccalaureate-granting institution (BGI) and community college (CC) among 263 students (72.4% female; Mage = 22.96, SD = 5.70) in the USA. For BGI students, path analyses suggest proximal factors such as in-class prejudice negatively predicted science self-efficacy and prejudice from faculty and staff predicted lower career outcome expectations. For CC students, home-school cultural value mismatch directly predicted science career goals. Implications for future research, intervention and policy are discussed. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal dimensions of varied schooling agendas for poor and oppressed caste children and adults in the princely state of Travancore in nineteenth-century colonial south India. Schools became socially contested and politically charged spaces in which various subaltern castes, particularly the Dalits and Nadars, articulated a new language of social and religious self-fashioning. British Protestant missionaries played a crucial role in provoking these imaginations and yet, the joint workings of caste and racial prejudices resulted in ambivalent cultural encounters in the educational landscape. Caste was central to these contestations and negotiations in making modern child subjectivities and tended to produce new forms of inequality and reproduce existing ones. I argue that schooling campaigns for the poor resulted in the perpetuation of hierarchised, caste-inflected norms of childhood and produced multiple marginal children in local society. This paper draws upon British Protestant missionary archives to highlight the unstable and violent geographies in which children of subaltern castes navigated the sphere of modern schooling in colonial Travancore and the constitutive function of schools in the making of marginal childhoods. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As the world becomes more digitized, visual content becomes commonplace in educational spaces. However, visual choices are not always accompanied with critical thought or awareness of the harmful messages or stereotypes connected to the images. The purpose of this study was to examine visual microaggressions embedded in the visual content of webiste projects created by preservice teachers (PSTs) for an education course. We qualitatively analyzed the images that PSTs (N = 97) included in a social issues website assignment and their written reflections on the images they incorporated. Additionally, six PSTs participated in focus group sessions where they reflected on images used across websites. A qualitative analysis of data led to the identification of visual microaggressions and deficit-thinking about children and families. Visual data portrayed children’s home lives as unsafe and unhappy, showed teaching as a white profession, endorsed white saviorism, and reinforced negative stereotypes about poverty. Focus group conversations led to critical visual literacy for some visual microaggressions, while individual reflections did not. Although PSTs in this study unintentionally enacted visual microaggressions in their projects, selected images can still cause harm. Implications for teacher education and schools are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Far-right politics has gained significant support across Europe in recent decades. Previous literature has investigated the conditions that lead to immigrants being perceived as “threats”, leading to increased support for anti-immigrant parties. However, how certain “shock events”–times of dramatic change–mobilize far-right support around anti-immigrant sentiment has been understudied. Drawing on social movement literature, I examine how support for anti-immigrant politics was driven by demographic change during the “refugee crisis” in Sweden. I use a unique dataset on Swedish municipalities (N = 290) between 2014 and 2018 to examine the relationship between immigration and far-right outcomes. I show that increases in Syrian immigrants during the “refugee crisis” led to significant gains in support for anti-immigrant politics at the municipal level. I suggest that the “refugee crisis” constituted a politicized ethno-racial shock that lead to increases in far-right support, as political actors seized on increased immigration to mobilize around threat perceptions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - During times of crisis such as the Covid‐19 pandemic, digital platforms are under public scrutiny to guarantee users’ online safety and wellbeing. Following inconsistencies in how platforms moderate online content and behavior, governments around the world are putting pressure on them to curb the spread of illegal and lawful harmful content and behavior (e.g., UK’s Draft Online Safety Bill). These efforts, though, mainly focus on overt abuse and false information, which misses more mundane social media practices such as racial stereotyping that are equally popular and can be inadvertently harmful. Building on Stoever’s (2016) work on the “sonic color line,” this article problematizes sound, specifically, as a key element in racializing memetic practices on the popular short‐video platform TikTok. We examine how humorous audio‐visual memes about Covid‐19 on TikTok contribute to social inequality by normalizing racial stereotyping, as facilitated through TikTok’s “Use This Sound” feature. We found that users’ appropriations of sounds and visuals on TikTok, in combination with the platform’s lack of clear and transparent moderation processes for humorous content, reinforce and (re)produce systems of advantage based on race. Our article contributes to remediating the consistent downplaying of humor that negatively stereotypes historically marginalized communities. It also advances work on race and racism on social media by foregrounding the sonification of race as means for racism’s evolving persistence, which represents a threat to social cohesion. © 2022 by the author(s).

AB  - People form relationships with people from their own racial groups, a phenomenon called racial homophily, which reduces interracial contact and exacerbates inequality and prejudice. Although viewed as arising from environmental factors, we argue that racial homophily also involves individual choice and, thus, personality factors. We address three major issues. First, are interpersonal concerns (Agreeableness) and intergroup concerns (Openness) differentially relevant to cross-race friendships? Second, are current conceptions of Openness sufficient, or do we need lower-level facets more attuned to intergroup concerns? Third, can we specify the interplay between personality and contextual factors in different settings? Across four studies (total N = 1,820), Agreeableness failed to predict more cross-race friendships, in both self and peer reports, suggesting that interpersonal kindness was not sufficient to overcome racial homophily. In contrast, Openness and Openness to Other (O2, a new social facet of Openness) consistently predicted cross-race friendship. However, the O2 facet had the stronger and only unique effect, suggesting it is the “active ingredient.” High-O2 individuals had an almost equal 1:1 ratio of same-to-different-race network members, whereas low-O2 individuals had 4:1 same-race. These results held for both college students and middleaged adults, both friends and new acquaintances in the network, and both networks established before and at a diverse university. Finally, when moving to a more diverse environment, high-O2 individuals seemed to take advantage of the new environmental affordances, adding more different-race members to their networks. Overall, these studies advance understanding of person–environment transactions, showing how personality traits matter to the structure of people’s social networks.

AB  - To counter ongoing NES/NNES, NEST/NNEST dichotomies and the essentializing of NNESs (Ellis, 2016), we examine the personal and professional tensions of an Indigenous Ecuadoran NNES teaching in a dominant Spanish-speaking context. We attend to the ways Roberto (pseudonym) responds to his students and his peers through the lens of his Kichwa identity, the historic oppressed positionality of and ongoing prejudice toward Indigenous peoples in Ecuador. In such contexts, Roberto cannot share “insider” cultural references to enhance his EFL instruction; rather, he is perpetually set as an outsider—both in the broader frame of NNES movement and more singularly and powerfully within his own professional context. We draw upon Esteban-Guitart and Moll's (2014) “funds of identity” and teacher professional identity development (Sachs, 2005) to explore the following central tensions in Roberto's evolving professional teaching identity: (1) Roberto's sense of himself as (il)legitimate speaker of English, (2) role of structural oppression toward Kichwa as it mediates his perceptions and interactions, and (3) the increased use of communicative-based language instruction. Attending to the multiple facets and resources that comprise “funds of identity,” EFL teacher educators can better account for the complex identity formation for EFL teachers and students. © 2022 TESOL International Association.

AB  - While women representation has improved, people still need to change their mindset when it comes to female school leaders in different societies. We argue that female heads are placed and perceived differently in society. Based on the interpretivist paradigm, we used the qualitative approach. A multiple case study design was adopted, and five female school heads were purposively selected. Semi-structured interviews were used and various findings were made, including that new female school heads receive more inspections from education authorities than new male heads, crying is a therapy for some female school heads, family support is needed by new and inexperienced school heads. In addition, female and married school heads are respected and welcomed more than single female school heads and those who have a different religious affiliation are negatively stereotyped by communities. Lack of training was also found to contribute to the challenges faced by female school heads. A few recommendations were made. After the appointment, new school heads should be given enough time to settle before inspections. Families and stakeholders should give female heads the necessary support in their early years of promotion and new female heads should start in their home areas so as to build confidence. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Approximately one-third of autistics report intimate relationship experience, but few studies have explored neuromixed relationships from the perspectives of non-autistic partners. Non-autistic partners increasingly use peer-led online groups to seek support. The purpose of this study was to capture a theory that reflects the basic social experience of individuals who use these support groups using classic Glaserian grounded theory methodology. Online interviews were conducted with 162 non-autistics who believed that they were in neuromixed relationships. Data were concurrently collected and analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Participants described varying views of autism, from a difference to a disorder, which defined the context of their relationships. Five relationship profiles emerged—mutual partnership: viewed partners as = companionship: viewed partners as friends but lacked a deeper connection; caregiving: viewed partners as dependents and compared relationships to parent–child dyads; detachment: viewed relationships as broken beyond repair and isolated selves from partners; and discriminatory: believed and circulated negative generalizations about autism. Many participants who were dissatisfied in their relationships shared that their partners were not formally evaluated and did not self-identify as autistic. Future research should explore ways that autism labels are (mis)applied by the general public based on negative stereotypes about autism. Lay abstract: Individuals who use peer-led online support groups for partners of autistics describe diverse views of autism, with some describing autism as a difference and others describing it as a disorder. I conducted online interviews with 162 non-autistics who believed they were in relationships with autistics and who participated in online support groups on social media. I analyzed their responses by constantly comparing each interview to previous interviews to develop a theory about their social experiences. As many as one-third of autistics participate in romantic relationships, and many of their partners seek support through groups on social media. Few studies explore what it is like to be a non-autistic person who is in a relationship with an autistic person. The way that participants viewed autism influenced the way that they viewed themselves, their partners, and their relationships. Many participants who were dissatisfied in their relationships shared that they believed their partners were autistic, but their partners had never been formally evaluated and did not self-identify as autistic. Future research should explore ways that autism labels are (mis)applied by the general public based on negative stereotypes about autism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests medical and social models of disability, or sets of assumptions regarding the cause and treatment of disability, and contact with people with disabilities, influence attitudes about people with disabilities. This study tests disability models and contact as an avenue for disability attitude intervention. Three psychology undergraduate classes were examined. Education + contact focused on social construction of disability, challenged the medical model, and was taught by an instructor with a disability (n = 52). Contact did not include disability content but was taught by an instructor with a disability (n = 45). Control did not include disability content and was taught by an instructor without a disability (n = 53). Participants completed measures of disability models and attitudes at the beginning and end of each 10-week course. Results showed medical model beliefs were associated with negative attitudes while social model beliefs were associated with positive attitudes. Participants in the education + contact group reported greater increases in positive attitudes and social model beliefs, and greater reductions in medical model beliefs at posttest than participants in the contact or control groups. The contact group also showed greater increases in positive attitudes and social model beliefs and greater reductions in medical model beliefs compared to the control group. Change in medical model beliefs mediated the relationship between course and attitude change. This is the first study to demonstrate that disability models can be intervened upon and can explain disability attitude change. Such interventions may prepare psychology students to interact with this large minority group. © 2020. American Psychological Association

AB  - This study explores children’s responses to animated, ficational characters when honesty is put to the test through behaviors of racialized, peer-like media characters. Children (n = 178, aged 8–13 years) viewed an episode of a popular U.S. television program, Nickelodeon’s The Loud House, with a dishonest White character (Lincoln) or an honest Black character (Clyde). The findings confirm that Clyde who is portrayed as honest is seen as more honest, higher in morality, and liked more than Lincoln who deliberately lies. Race did not impact how much children like the White character (Lincoln), but Black children reported liking the Black character (Clyde) more than White children. Children who have previously seen the show are more likely to like and have a stronger parasocial relationship with the characters, with a regression pinpointing this is most important for Lincoln, the White character. The main finding that the regression analyses tease out is that it is the parasocial relationship that is significantly positively related to how likable and moral the children rate the characters, not race and racial attitudes. Implications are discussed within a context of mediated contact, social construction of identity and groups, and moral judgements. IMPACT SUMMARY a.Prior State of Knowledge: Previous research suggests that youth can learn moral behaviors from media characters. However, few television studies with youth have examined character honesty and race in a research investigation. b.Novel Contributions. Children who feel emotionally connected to a media character can be more accepting of problematic behavior of the character. Racial bias and preferences for Black or White media characters indicate that racial awareness is salient for youth. c.Practical Implications. Children’s relationships with media characters can have implications on their learning about consequences of moral behaviors. Practitioners should be thoughtful in their representations of characters, particularly children of color, reaching for more positive portrayals of children of color as a means to mitigate judgment of others and enhance interracial relationships. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Interethnic contact is essential to move past out-group prejudice. However, prior work on the relationship between interethnic contact and out-group attitudes mostly considers core social ties. Here, I consider ethnic majority adolescents’ interethnic weaker ties. To do so, I embrace a key feature of adolescent contemporary social life: they overwhelmingly maintain relations online that snapshot hundreds of ties. Using a combination of survey data among Dutch ethnic majority adolescents and linking this with information on their large circle of online contacts, I study whether and to what extent interethnic weak ties online correlate with out-group attitudes. I conjecture and find that interethnic contacts online correlate to less-negative out-group attitudes. Yet, there is a diminishing return for interethnic contacts on less-negative out-group attitudes. These patterns are carried by the Dutch majority’s out-group contacts with Turkish and Moroccan backgrounds. I discuss the implications of these results and suggest directions for future research. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Folk wisdom suggests that “you cannot teach an old dog new tricks.” Accordingly, as the average age of the workforce increases, there is a potential concern based on negative stereotypes that organizations will become less innovative. Drawing from lifespan development theories and theorizing on innovation, we explore this concern by testing, at the organization level of analysis, whether the average age of employees is indirectly related to climate for innovation through employees’ aggregate focus on opportunities (i.e., a negative indirect effect) and work engagement (i.e., a positive indirect effect). Moreover, we proposed that organizational age diversity is a protective resource that moderates these relationships, such that they are weaker in organizations with high as compared to low age diversity. Organization-level data were collected from teaching and non-teaching staff in n = 133 schools across two time points separated by 4 years (Time 1 n = 3712 respondents; Time 2 n = 5183 respondents). Results suggest that the average age of employees within schools was negatively related to employees’ aggregate focus on opportunities which, in turn, positively predicted climate for innovation above and beyond the positive effect of work engagement. Moreover, the negative indirect effect of average age on climate for innovation through aggregate focus on opportunities was weaker for organizations with high age diversity. Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of relationships between age and age-related characteristics and climate for innovation at the organization level, and challenge common misunderstandings regarding the role of age in the workplace. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Mental illness (MI) stigma has been characterized as multi-dimensional including problems of knowledge (stereotypes), attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination); however, most research practice is predominantly applying unidimensional behavioral measures such as social distance scales. Moreover, specific types of MIs and different forms of discriminatory behaviors are not being differentiated. The Stereotype Content Model predicts that group stereotypes (warmth, competence) are linked with different forms of discriminatory behaviors (harm or facilitation) via emotional prejudices (pity, envy, contempt). The present study sought to establish how differential stereotypic perceptions of MI subgroups elicit distinct forms of behavioral discrimination via emotional prejudices. A community sample (N = 60) was randomly assigned to one of three conditions representing MIs across the warmth-competence stereotype space. Patterns of self-completed measures for stereotypes, emotions and behaviors differed significantly between conditions. The association between stereotypes and behaviors were largely mediated by emotions. Systematic patterns of stereotypic perceptions, emotional prejudices and behavioral discrimination are present for individuals with different types of MIs. Hence, generic measures of discrimination, such as social distance scales, may be misleading. Intervention strategies should consider the systematic variation of the factors involved in stigma, differentiating by type of MI and discriminatory behaviors. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In 1949, Simone de Beauvoir cited the fairly unknown author Poulain de la Barre in an epigraph for The Second Sex (1949). When reading The Second Sex, one soon realizes that there are profound similarities between the two authors’ discussions of women’s situation. Both Poulain and Beauvoir view the subjection of women as a process that includes choice as well as force. Liberation necessarily requires overcoming opinions rooted in custom and prejudice. The article develops a comparison between the arguments of Poulain and Beauvoir in order to illuminate interesting features in the works of both authors. The focus is on similarities as well as differences. The first section examines how prejudice and the practices of men’s self-interest have contributed to the reification of women. Section 2 discusses the peculiar nature of prejudices about oneself and section 3 focuses on the metaphysical relation between freedom and materiality. Finally, section 4 examines how mutual recognition becomes possible in the context of freedom, the search for truth, and friendship. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - College students from underrepresented racial groups often experience racial prejudice and discrimination from their White peers at predominantly White institutions (PWIs). White university students may be misinformed about race and unaware of their privilege. In this study, we investigated the effects of online training that aimed to increase participants' cultural competence through multicultural knowledge, awareness of their own privilege, and skills. White college students at a PWI completed a 4-week training program adapted from a 1-day in-person workshop. The training provided 1-h weekly online sessions in which White participants (n = 72) were provided resources aimed to develop cultural competence. It utilized student-acted role plays, reflection questions, articles, and videos to create an interactive experience for students. Results demonstrated that participants showed significant increases in cultural competence and acknowledgment of their White privilege directly following the fourth training session. Further, they exhibited decreases in racial colorblindness. This study suggests that a brief, online training may increase cultural competence in undergraduates which can potentially improve the climates of university campuses. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Stress and coping frameworks posit that active coping may help mitigate stress experiences of individuals, such as the stress resulting from structural racism or anti-immigrant sentiments (i.e., sociocultural stress) Latinx adolescents experience in the United States. Active coping has been linked to better school functioning in mixed-ethnic adolescent populations. The current study examined the associations between active coping and school functioning, as well as the moderating role of gender among 288 Latinx adolescents (M = 13.69, SD =.56; 53% girls). Results revealed active coping related to higher levels of school belonging and grades. No gender differences were found, suggesting active coping works similarly for Latinx adolescent girls’ and boys’ school functioning. This study’s findings contribute to the knowledge on Latinx school functioning by identifying active coping as a potential malleable target for intervention. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Ingroup bias is often treated as the default outcome of intergroup comparisons. We argue that the mechanisms of impression formation depend on what information people infer from groups. We differentiate between belief-indicative groups that are more informative of beliefs and affect attitudes through ingroup bias and status-indicative groups that are more informative of status and affect attitudes through a preference for higher status. In a cross-cultural factorial experiment (Ntotal = 1,281), we demonstrate that when information about targets’ multiple group memberships is available, belief-indicative groups affect attitudes via ingroup bias, whereas status-indicative groups—via preference for higher status. These effects were moderated by social-structural context. In two follow-up studies (Ntotal = 451), we develop and validate a measure of belief- and status-indicativeness (BISI) of groups. BISI showed expected correlations with related constructs of entitativity and essentialism. Belief-indicativeness of groups was a better predictor of ingroup bias than entitativity and essentialism. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Ron Rivera, after eight and a half years as the only Latino Head Coach employed by the NFL, was fired in 2019 by Carolina Panthers’ new ownership. Soon after, Rivera was hired as the new Head Coach of the then-Washington Reds*ins. Empowered to not only coach the team, he has been tasked to shake up the organization's cultural, gendered, and racialized leadership-status-quo. In doing so Coach Rivera threads new ground across the ever evolving color line in U.S. sports, particularly “the brown color line.” This essay explores the life, career, and ongoing-regionally based celebrity stardom of Ronald Eugene Rivera. I argue that Ron Rivera charts pathways forward amidst a U.S. socio-cultural-political climate rooted in anti-Native, anti-Black, anti-immigrant sentiment and a sporting industry embezzled in neoliberal racial politics. The essay theorizes “brownness” in sport from a “Latino masculinity” perspective to situate Rivera's struggles for (in)/(hyper)visibility and the complexed realities of the ongoing gendered color line in U.S. sport amid social pressure and protests for transformation and change. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of smartphone addiction in young adults, and to investigate the relationship between smartphone use, depression, anxiety, and social appearance anxiety. Materials and Methods: Sociodemographic data form, Smartphone Dependence Scale-Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care-Short Form, Beck Anxiety Scale, and Social Appearance Anxiety Scale were applied face to face in this cross-descriptive study. Results: A total of 259 subjects, 128 (49.4%) female and 131 (50.6%) male, were included in the study. 25.9% of the participants were smartphone addicts. There was a high positive correlation between smartphone usage time and smartphone addiction score. The social appearance anxiety average scores of the social media users (30.8±13.9) were higher than those of subjects who do not use social media (28.8±11.3). Smartphone addiction scale had a positive correlation with anxiety and social appearance anxiety scores, while not with depression. Conclusion: Our results revealed that the purpose of smartphone usage affects people more than smartphone usage or smartphone addiction. The internet, and especially programs related to sharing one’s appearance and lifestyle and applications that create an unrealistic appearance that conforms to virtual norms, can add hard-to-repair prejudices to the mind. This situation should be seen as a threat, especially for the younger generation, and is a new sociological problem worth investigating. © 2022 Istanbul University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Weight bias greatly impacts the physical, psychological, and social health of individuals with a higher weight. However, current measures of weight bias were developed years, even decades, ago, and have significant conceptual and psychometric limitations. To explore potentially new or understudied dimensions of weight bias, the present research looks at the perceptions of young canadian adults on the different facets of this prejudice using concept mapping. The first goal was to observe and categorize the content of weight bias perceived by the participants. The second goal was to examine the degree to which participants endorsed the items and dimensions generated in the study. Thirty-four participants generated statements describing their perceptions of weight bias in today’s society in the first phase, and 32 different participants categorized these items in the second phase. Fifty-four items were generated and divided by participants into seven weight bias dimensions: (a) Poor eating habits; (b) Poor health/low level of physical activity; (c) Selfneglect; (d) Denial of presumed health risks; (e) Repulsive physical appearance; (f) Negative personality traits, and (g) Limited intellectual capacities. The seven dimensions of weight bias generated in this study add one dimension to existing weight bias measures, Denial, which could be a more recent facet of weight bias. A significant percentage of the bias reported by participants was related to health behaviors and the denial of presumed health risks. These dimensions appear to be more significant than what was described in existing weight bias measures. Findings will be useful in identifying limitations of current measures and in informing the development of new ones. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Self-stigma has been associated with reduced accuracy of face emotion recognition in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). Stigma may also relate to slowing of performance during cognitive tasks for which a negative stereotype is relevant. This study aimed to investigate the association of mental illness stigma with face emotion recognition among CHR individuals. Participants were 143 CHR individuals identified using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPSs). Face emotion recognition was assessed using the Penn emotion recognition task (ER-40). Stigma was assessed using discrimination, stereotype awareness, and stereotype agreement subscales of the Mental Health Attitudes Interview for CHR. We tested associations of ER-40 accuracy and response times with these stigma variables, including the role of clinical and demographic factors. Racial/ethnic minoritized participants had higher attenuated positive symptoms than nonminoritized participants. Longer ER-40 response times were correlated with greater stereotype agreement (r =.17, p =.045) and discrimination (r =.22, p =.012). A regression model predicting ER-40 response times revealed an interaction of stereotype agreement with minoritized status (p =.008), with slower response times for minoritized participants as stereotype agreement increased. Greater disorganized symptoms and male gender also predicted longer response times. ER-40 accuracy was not associated with stigma. Overall, minoritized CHR individuals with greater internalized stigma took longer to identify face emotions. Future research is needed to assess whether slower response times are specific to social cues, and if internalized stigma interferes with performance in real-world social situations. Reducing stigma may be an important target for interventions that aim to improve social skills © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Previous research demonstrates that the more people experience anger, fear, and other high arousal negative states (HAN) on average, the more prejudice and harm they express toward outgroups. Here we demonstrate that valuing HAN—above and beyond actually experiencing HAN—increases people’s likelihood of engaging in harm toward cultural outgroups in everyday life. In Study 1, U.S. European Americans (N = 227) read hypothetical scenarios in which a member of another cultural group at school, work, or home made them uncomfortable. As predicted, the more participants ideally wanted to feel HAN, the more negatively they responded to the outgroup member in these scenarios (i.e., the more HAN they felt, the more they viewed harmful actions as appropriate, and the more likely they were to engage in these actions). To assess generalizability, in Study 2, we provide evidence from Canada (n = 162) and Taiwan (n = 170) that despite cultural differences in the valuation of specific types of HAN, wanting to feel HAN still predicted negative responses toward cultural outgroups in both cultures. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that reducing people’s valuation of HAN might play an important role in increasing tolerance of cultural diversity in multicultural societies. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Humans have fundamental needs, and they evaluate social groups based on their stereotypical impact on goals related to those needs. According to affordance management theory, when people perceive members of social groups as a threat to fundamental goals, prejudicial emotions, and discriminatory behaviors emerge. The purpose of the current research was to investigate affordance management theory as an explanation for schizophrenia stigma. Study 1 (N = 149) examined the perceived relation of schizophrenia to fundamental needs and showed that people perceive schizophrenia as a greater threat to the goal of selfprotection than goals related to other fundamental needs. Study 2 (N = 312) experimentally manipulated if a fictional target had schizophrenia or physical illnesses and showed that participants perceived the greatest threat to self-protection and child-protection goals in the schizophrenia condition. In Study 3 (N = 149), participants imagined a person with schizophrenia threatening fundamental goals. Ratings of threat, attention, and fear were higher for self-protection and child-protection goals than other fundamental goals. Study 4 (N = 413) experimentally manipulated if an attractive acquaintance had schizophrenia. Participants perceived the person with schizophrenia as an increased threat to self-protection but not affiliation or mateseeking goals. They also reported increased fear and avoidance in the schizophrenia condition. Overall, the results of the studies supported affordance management theory’s predictions about the relation of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.

AB  - With the increasing ethnic diversity in school classrooms globally, understanding how best to harness intergroup contact and promote social cohesion is a timely challenge for science, policy, and practice alike. There is an urgent need, therefore, for applied social psychological research that bridges theory and practice in the pursuit of peace. The present article reflects on the process of working with teachers in ethnically diverse secondary schools in England to coproduce an intervention that aimed to promote better intergroup relations among 11-year-old school students. Through a series of workshops, we cocreated a theoretically informed intervention that was then implemented and evaluated in schools. In this article, we discuss our approach to the development of our intervention. We then conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis of our research process and approach to coproduction and offer recommendations for researchers aiming to carry out applied research in the pursuit of peace. The appropriateness of social psychological frameworks for promoting intergroup relations, and in turn, peace in real-world contexts and implications for future research and practice are discussed. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Outgroup perceptions are a fundamental element of social categorization, particularly in contexts of intergroup conflict. Social Identity Development Theory argues that perceived differences between groups is the first step in ethnic identity development. This understanding of social categories among children may have implications for negative intergroup attitudes or even prejudice. Our study explores how Jews (N = 180) and Arab-Muslims (N = 207) in middle childhood perceive the difference between these two ethno-religious groups in Israel. Thematic analysis found two themes: (a) differences in everyday ethnic and cultural properties and (b) differences related to religion.

AB  - Many of the individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, attack on theU.S. Capitol did not have ties to far-right extremist groups, leading some pundits and researchers to speculate that extremism has become mainstream and much more common in the current political environment. In this article, we discuss events before and during January 6 that affected extremism and pushed people toward polarization. Specifically, we discuss the role of the media, especially social media, in developing like-minded content sharing and polarizing, extremist group norms. The role of groups to drive people toward protest is discussed within research on social movements. The role of identity and acceptability of prejudice toward outgroup political members and how this identity fed into increasing extremist rhetoric are also discussed. Then, we discuss conditions of the day of January 6, including establishment of norms through rhetoric and the social proof of extremist action, and also, the easy exit of those who could leave an increasingly escalating situation. Finally, we address the implications for the current political climate, including the potential for increased violence and extremism © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - The 20th century saw the dismantling of several oppressive regimes and an international turn toward greater social justice. Yet structural inequality and intergroup animosity persist in many postcolonial and postslavery contexts, not least because the dehumanization inherent to those regimes remain entrenched socially. Here we examined whether the racialized hierarchy established under the inhumane South African apartheid system is still manifest in patterns of dehumanization today, and how this impacts intergroup relations and behaviors related to structural reform. Specifically, we investigated blatant dehumanization as the explicit attribution of reduced human uniqueness, factors contributing to its tenacity, and its intergroup outcomes in a national sample of the three largest racialized groups: Black African,Coloured, andWhite.We found that, despite significant changes in power dynamics postapartheid, dehumanization ratings mirrored the apartheid-inspired hierarchy, with White people rated “more human” than Coloured people, and Coloured people rated “more human” than Black African people across participants. Levels of dehumanization were ameliorated by positive intergroup contact and reinforced by feeling dehumanized (meta-dehumanization) and hierarchy-legitimizing beliefs in White and Coloured participants. Finally, White participants’ dehumanization of Black African people predicted, beyond prejudice, several outcomes (social distance, collective action, and petition support) that would sustain the unequal status quo. Our results suggest that intergroup dynamics are influenced by the positions people occupied on the apartheid racial hierarchy, and that curbing dehumanization should be prioritized to advance structural reform in South Africa. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Felt understanding is linked to intergroup relations. However, almost all of the studies linking felt understanding to intergroup relations have been conducted in a relation where ingroups and outgroups cohabit within a community having a shared superordinate political structure/system (cohabitating target). It is unclear whether this association generaliddzes to another relation that ingroups and outgroups live in separate communities with different superordinate systems (separate target). The present work investigates whether the predictive role of felt understanding in intergroup relations differs across the two targets—Chinese people in Japan (CIJ) and Chinese people outside of Japan (COJ). Data were collected in Japan by two online surveys among 536 Japanese (189 females) in 2021. Multigroup analysis found that felt understanding was linked to positive intergroup outcomes (positive action tendencies, outgroup trust, intergroup orientation) for both cohabiting and separate target conditions. Also, post hoc mediation analysis suggested that the cohabiting/ separate target condition was positively related to felt understanding, and higher felt understanding, in turn, results in the outcomes. These results indicate that felt understanding can be beneficial even in intergroup relations not involving a shared superordinate system and that the level (not the effect) of felt understanding may be influenced by cohabiting/separate targets. Implications for consolidating peace in Japan–China relations are discussed, which may be relevant to other international relations. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - A pre–post quasi experimental design (test–retest–late response test) with a control group involving an intervention that aimed at creating contact conditions between the children of a classroom and a puppet “classmate” that held the identity of a Syrian refugee child was implemented in this study. Contact with a puppet is an innovative form of contact which combines features of direct and indirect intergroup contact. The sample comprised of 73 primary school students drawn from a relatively ethnically homogeneous primary school in Athens and attitudes measures, along with a behavioral measure (a money allocation task) were employed. Results showed that contact with the puppet improved children’s attitudes toward the refugees, through inclusion of the other in the self, while an increase of empathy toward the refugees and a reduction of feelings related to threats posed by the refugees to the ingroupwere also revealed. Results were more favorable in the intervention group that included contact and empathy inducing activities with the puppet. Most importantly, there were indications that some of the positive outcomes lasted in time, that is, 6 months after the intervention had finished, while there were also indications of the buffering effect for both intervention groups; again, more profound for the intervention that implemented empathy inducing activities. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - UK government policies over several decades have sought to actively encourage disabled people to take up paid employment, most recently by focusing on the ‘gap’ between employment rates of disabled and non-disabled people. These policies implicitly assume a clear distinction between people who are and are not disabled, linked to medically-oriented, hierarchical notions of deservingness. They also assume that people who need support will self-identify. This article explores factors that undermine those assumptions or expose their contradictory effects. It presents findings from qualitative research with people with mild learning difficulties, discussing their perceptions of disability and how they negotiated an ever-shifting balance of consequences of identifying as disabled or disclosing needs, linked to risks and experiences of prejudice, discrimination and exclusion. Points of interest Government policy to support disabled people into paid work suggests that it is obvious who is and who is not disabled. This research looks at what disability means for people with mild learning difficulties who are looking for paid work. People with mild learning difficulties sometimes view themselves as disabled but sometimes refuse that label, even when they accept that they need support. The research participants gave a wide range of reasons for accepting or rejecting the label of disability. They showed how they balanced hopes for support against fears of rejection or abuse, based on their personal experiences. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Emotional tears are vehicles for bonding between individuals, even with those belonging to different social categories. Yet, little is known about the reactions they provoke toward members of underprivileged groups such as immigrants or the explanatory mechanisms of their effects. Across three experiments (with 546 adults) using standardized images of emotional displays, we tested the effects of tears on cognitive inferences (of warmth and competence) and self-reported affective responses (such as compassion or discomfort), and both directly and indirectly on self-reported prosocial behavioral intentions toward an immigrant male. Compared with nontearful (i.e., neutral and sad) expressions, observers perceived a tearful immigrant as warmer but not as less competent (except for study 3). They also felt more compassion (but not discomfort) and were more willing to offer an immigrant person emotional (i.e., to approach and comfort) and instrumental support (i.e., to donate money to an organization helping immigrants but not volunteer their time). Inferred warmth and felt compassion (or compassion-related emotions) explained the effects of tears on emotional support and donation intentions. This research highlights the need to study emotion expression in the context of interethnic and, more broadly, intergroup relations and the effects of emotional tears beyond the willingness to provide immediate assistance. We also discuss implications that tears might have for promoting different types of solidarity with members of underprivileged groups such as immigrants © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Purpose: Taking a transdisciplinary viewpoint, the authors synthesize the literature on the theoretical, methodological, and epistemological issues in the study of corruption as a construct in project management (PM) as applied to IDPs. While the study of corruption has focused on “who and why” to help understand corruption's occurrence, there is a lack of analysis on “where and how” to ensure corruption's prevention and improve PM to better support delivery actors. The authors rely on four theoretical frameworks to help interpret evidence and formulate a coherent model for managing project socio-cultural context: organizational interests theory (OIT), principal-agent theory (PAT), culturalist theory (CT) and institutional theory (IT). Design/methodology/approach: International development projects (IDPs) have become very complex with greater diversity of donor agencies and aid delivery actors. The relative lack of success of development aid has been linked in part to corruption at various levels. PM methods are essential to help prevent this behavior. To assess the complexity of this problem, the authors completed a grounded theory research based on thirty interviews with international development experts, balancing representation from donor and receiving countries, as well as project managers in public and private sectors. Data are analyzed using a qualitative sorting process using the software NVivo. Findings: Results show that PM, beyond PM's practical nature and technical focus, can offer numerous opportunities to prevent corruption impact on project actors, even in a context where anti-corruption initiatives may be perceived as less effective. The authors present an original theoretical model that illustrates which actors, events and context are related and linked in the dynamic efforts to understand and combat corruption in international development endeavors. Context is linked to dynamics: foreign aid cycle, capture opportunities, context pressures, personal damages done, and control mechanisms exercised. Originality/value: The outcomes and quality of IDPs remain highly controversial, especially with perception of corruption by various stakeholders. Some experts recognize the inefficacy of applying classical PM tools and processes. By contrasting findings to the literature, the authors conclude that an alternative approach to overcome the taboos and prejudices in studying corruption is to ask a different research question. A research agenda is proposed for solving this phenomenon. To guide PM research on development projects, focusing on the “where and how” of corruption requires addressing how actors build their knowledge management capabilities, and address the social and cultural challenges inherent to IDPs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A large portion of research in the social sciences is devoted to using interventions to combat societal and social problems, such as prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. However, these interventions are often developed using the theories and/or intuitions of the individuals who developed them and evaluated in isolation without comparing their efficacy with other interventions. Here, we make the case for an experimental design that addresses such issues: an intervention tournament—that is, a study that compares several different interventions against a single control and uses the same standardized outcome measures during assessment and participants drawn from the same population. We begin by highlighting the utility of intervention tournaments as an approach that complements other, more commonly used approaches to addressing societal issues. We then describe various approaches to intervention tournaments, which include crowdsourced, curated, and in-house-developed intervention tournaments, and their unique characteristics. Finally, we discuss practical recommendations and key design insights for conducting such research, given the existing literature. These include considerations of intervention-tournament deployment, characteristics of included interventions, statistical analysis and reporting, study design, longitudinal and underlying psychological mechanism assessment, and theoretical ramifications. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The spontaneous stereotype content model (SSCM) describes a comprehensive taxonomy, with associated properties and predictive value, of social-group beliefs that perceivers report in open-ended responses. Four studies (N =1,470) showthe utility of spontaneous stereotypes, compared to traditional, prompted, scale-based stereotypes. Using natural language processing text analyses, Study 1 shows the most common spontaneous stereotype dimensions for salient social groups. Our results confirm existing stereotype models’ dimensions, while uncovering a significant prevalence of dimensions that these models do not cover, such as Health, Appearance, and Deviance. The SSCM also characterizes the valence, direction, and accessibility of reported dimensions (e.g., Ability stereotypes are mostly positive, but Morality stereotypes are mostly negative; Sociability stereotypes are provided later than Ability stereotypes in a sequence of open-ended responses). Studies 2 and 3 check the robustness of these findings by: using a larger sample of social groups, varying time pressure, and diversifying analytical strategies. Study 3 also establishes the value of spontaneous stereotypes: compared to scales alone, open-ended measures improve predictions of attitudes toward social groups. Improvement in attitude prediction results partially from a more comprehensive taxonomy as well as a construct we refer to as stereotype representativeness: the prevalence of a stereotype dimension in perceivers’ spontaneous beliefs about a social group. Finally, Study 4 examines how the taxonomy provides additional insight into stereotypes’ influence on decision-making in socially relevant scenarios. Overall, spontaneous content broadens our understanding of stereotyping and intergroup relations © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - This study explored the influence of healthcare ageism on nurses’ moral distress. Episodic interviews were conducted on 25 Romanian nurses in 2020. Thematic analysis revealed that all moral distress sources reported reflected macro-, meso- and micro-level ageism, benevolent and hostile, self- or other-directed, including stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination of older patients. The COVID-19 pandemic-related ageist measures increased healthcare ageism and transformed nurses’ representations of older patients accordingly. Nurses felt moral conflict both when passively witnessing ageist acts and when perpetrating them to adhere to group norms, highlighting the need to combat ageism for both patients’ and nurses’ well-being. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We propose an integrative model for the development of anti-racism in white adolescents that unpacks and combines critical consciousness, color consciousness, anti-racism, and Critical Race Theory frameworks. Black and Brown youth in the U.S. face increasing rates of peer-directed racism, which contribute to long-term negative physical, psychological, academic, and behavioral outcomes. Despite increased focus on how critical consciousness and anti-racism develop uniquely in adolescence, there are no existing theories that provide an integrated, comprehensive model of anti-racist development in white adolescents. Our model unpacks and reorganizes the core features of four prominent theories into cognitive, psychological, and behavioral components of anti-racism development in white adolescents based on existing research to support a next-generation of hypotheses for future research. In doing so, we aim to provide a contemporary theoretical foundation for research that will elucidate anti-racism development among white youth, and help to dismantle structural racism against Black and Brown people in the U.S. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - To what extent do white nationalists influence Congressional representative conservatism? Although ethnocentrism, out-group prejudice, and racial threats strongly predict American political attitudes and voter behavior, how social movements predicated on these beliefs shape political outcomes is rarely considered. We argue that white nationalist activities significantly contribute to the radicalization of Congressional representatives’ policy agendas in a manner non-reducible to demographic or socioeconomic conditions. By mobilizing white voters against racial status threats, they indirectly compel politicians to adopt more radically conservative agendas. We quantitatively test these propositions by examining distributions of white nationalist groups in the American South against Congressional representative conservatism from 2010–2017. Analyses reveal that white nationalists indeed appear to significantly impact representative radical conservatism, even controlling for numerous factors commonly theorized to explain their rise. In doing so, we contribute to emerging insights on the political influence of the radical right on the contemporary American conservative “mainstream.”. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address the main reasons that limit Jordanian women from undertaking expatriation, based on the assumption that Arab women’s opportunities for international engagement may be compromised by local cultural and institutional issues. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectoral survey with 60 Jordanian expatriates (30 women and 20 men) located in EU countries and the UK is used to better explore Eastern women perceptions. Findings: Company’s resistance, a lack of support mechanisms, safety in the destination country and family commitments play a major role in hindering Jordanian women opportunities to be assigned abroad, echoing the commonly recognized barriers identified in previous research. Additionally, the culture of the home country and prejudice toward foreigners act as an additional barrier for women professional development. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study lies in the data collection instrument, that is, the survey. Larger samples are needed to extend these results. The second limitation is that the potential effects of gender differences cannot be examined because the number of men in the sample was small. Practical implications: The findings bring evidence that could be used by organizations to understand the barriers Jordanian expatriate women face and take informed action to tackle them. Meanwhile, more research on Middle Eastern female roles and views is needed to reduce stereotyping against them. Similarly, regional studies can be an opportunity for future development to identify the impact of the regional context. Social implications: This research highlights the intertwining of religious and cultural values in influencing Arabic women’s experience in international assignments and thus, would enhance readers’ understanding of women’s career progression in a new context. Originality/value: This research shows that socio-cultural and political realities need more space in discussions about expatriation. Specifically, the expatriation literature needs more scrutiny and problematizing of the lived experiences of women expatriates from the Global South. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the recent years, research on the conditions, under which members of the host countries such as Germany perceive refugees as threatening and respond with negative attitudes, has increased. However, little attention has been given to the implications that subjective perceptions of threat among the host community may have for their own psychological health. Using integrated threat theory, the current study examined the relationships between perceived threats, person-centered antecedents in intercultural settings, and psychological distress among Germans, who reflected on incoming refugees. Using a survey company, a sample (N = 1000) was recruited, which matched the German census regarding central demographics. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey with validated self-report measures. Assessments covered four perceived threat types (intergroup anxiety, symbolic and realistic threat, negative stereotypes), person-related antecedents (social identity as German, quantity and quality of prior intercultural contact), and psychological distress. Applying structural equation modeling, we found that high social identification as German was related to greater perceptions of symbolic/realistic threat, stronger negative stereotypes and to more intergroup anxiety. Vice versa, high quality of prior intercultural contact experiences was associated with a decrease of all threat types. The quantity of prior intercultural contact showed almost no relations to perceived threats. In terms of indirect effects, greater quality of contact predicted less distress, and greater identity as German predicted more distress, both via symbolic/realistic threat and intergroup anxiety. Taken together, perceiving refugees as a threatening outgroup may signify a self-harming risk, while high quality of intercultural relations may indirectly enhance health. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - To successfully navigate their social world, humans need to understand and map enduring relationships between people: Humans need a concept of social affiliation. Here I propose that the initial concept of social affiliation, available in infancy, is based on the extent to which one individual consistently takes on the goals and needs of another. This proposal grounds affiliation in intuitive psychology, as formalized in the naive-utility-calculus model. A concept of affiliation based on interpersonal utility adoption can account for findings from studies of infants’ reasoning about imitation, similarity, helpful and fair individuals, “ritual” behaviors, and social groups without the need for additional innate mechanisms such as a coalitional psychology, moral sense, or general preference for similar others. I identify further tests of this proposal and also discuss how it is likely to be relevant to social reasoning and learning across the life span. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The hypothesis supported in this paper is that individuals and groups can socialize themselves to negative events in very different, even opposite, ways. The two modes of perceiving and experiencing the failure selected here could be defined in terms of an ‘adaptive failure’ (a failure, even when macroscopic, does not necessarily determine a change of direction: lesson is not learned!) and a ‘strategic failure’ (the failure itself generates social change: trial and error). The aim of this paper is to offer a sociological explanation of these two ways of managing failure, by analyzing: i. the type of social action that is carried out by the agents in these cases; ii. the consequences that these dynamics generate on the physiognomy and structure of socio-cultural systems. The thesis is that an expressive type of action prevails in the first model. Individuals invest emotionally on social situations. This investment usually generates adaptation to the given conditions. As a result, it also adapts to failure. This is because the agents’ true intent is to maximize their advantage in every type of situation. Even in failure. In the second model, one imagines a strategic type of action that tends to achieve predefined goals. In this sense, without prejudice to the final objective, the failure imposes a change of strategy or it may have been planned (and put into account) as a necessary step to achieve the expected result. © 2022, Italian Sociological Review.

AB  - Prison conditions in Brazil have attracted the attention of social movements, the press, and researchers. The prison population grew 707% between 1990 and 2016, with no sign of slowing. This article does not seek to investigate the causes of this dramatic increase — a statistic that is nonetheless worth highlighting — but rather to describe the relation between the judiciary and a specific segment of society, indigenous peoples, evincing yet another point of tension in inter-ethnic relations. As such, this article analyzes the available Brazilian legislation and the practices of the criminal justice system as an official means of prosecution, conviction, and sentencing in the City of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in the northeast of the state of Amazonas, Brazil, and the impacts of state-imposed punishment on indigenous peoples. © 2022, Brazilian Anthropology Association.

AB  - Stereotypes are tools of social perception that attribute a superficial uniformity to individuals within a social group, providing an instrument to assess individuals and groups. The stereotype content model (SCM) provides a framework for understanding these dynamics. SCM explores how groups are stereotyped on competence and warmth. This research utilizes the SCM to study India, a heterogenous society with diverse social groups. The purpose of this paper is to study caste stereotypes using SCM within India while also comparing two distinct regions of the country–the north and the south. This study is unique because (a) earlier studies have not explored stereotyping while recognizing the regional variations “within” India and (b) it applies SCM to caste. We also include how caste perceptions are further defined for groups that fall under the affirmative action program. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we recruited subjects who responded to questions that assessed stereotypes of different social groups. The results indicate the presence of more ambivalent stereotypes and higher belief in karmic ideology in the four southern states compared to the northern states. Possible explanations discussed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article explores the branches of the International Federation of University Women (IFUW) in the interwar period and up to the early 1950s as feminist organisations on the Balkans gathered women intellectuals with various fields of expertise and devoted its initial efforts to equal rights of education and professional career. By means of historical and social network analysis the associations of university women in Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey and their as attempt to create a scientific network of women academics on the peninsula are studied. The main question is to discuss whether or not the Balkan associations of university women were organizations which supported women’s movement against the segregation in the University and the museums, which promoted their scientific work in domestic institutions, which assisted them before public prejudices, which gave them opportunities to make contacts with colleagues abroad, and which provide them with scholarships. The analysis of the Balkan associations is made with a comparison with similar women’s scientific networks in the Western Europe. © 2022, International University Seminar for Balkan Studies and Specialization.

AB  - Public opinion plays an important role in shaping the policy process. We examined public input in the form of written public comments to interrogate group expression and public values in school policymaking. Drawing on theoretical and methodological tenets of critical policy and critical discourse analysis, our study examined 3,339 written public comments across two school districts undergoing school rezoning, which is the process of drawing and redrawing school attendance boundaries. Our findings highlight the complexity of public opinion on rezoning policies related to 1) competing values and visions for school diversity, 2) racialized conceptualizations of community members’ sense of belonging, and 3) forms of boundary maintenance used to discursively resist boundary changes by excluding students and families of color from crucial resources. As more U.S. districts consider rezoning to balance the racial and/or economic composition of schools, this study contributes new insight into stakeholders’ implicit and explicit racial attitudes, motivations, and values in response to rezoning’s complex policy process. © 2022, Arizona State University.

AB  - The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework calls for a systems perspective on addressing complex sustainability challenges. As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of “objective” science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice. It will also provide recommendations for creating open learning environments that are competence-based, and that incorporate multiple methods, acknowledgments of limitations, and alternate ways of knowing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the development and initial validation of an instrument, namely IV-SOPRA (Index of Violence Suffered and Practiced), measuring levels of violence suffered and practiced by students in Higher Education institutions; thus, seeking to advance research into the issue of violence connected to Higher Education. Participants are undergraduate students (n = 1188), who responded to an online questionnaire from a university in the south of Brazil. This was a convenience sample. The population was from all undergraduate courses offered at the partner university (i.e. Arts and Humanities; Social Sciences; Sciences; Medicine). Data analysis was conducted using R environment (R Core Team, 2020), and lavaan package (Rosseel, 2011). Confirmatory factor analysis was carried to investigate model fit to the data according to theorised structure of the IV-SOPRA subscales. Each subscale demonstrates good to excellent fit to the data, according to fit measures and reliability indices. The instrument provides Higher Education institutions with a tool for evaluating and diagnosing levels of prejudice and bullying on campus, so that effective measures can be put in place to deal with problems at hand. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As an indispensable part of cities, wastewater treatment plants play an important role in environmental protection and urbanization. However, the promotion of wastewater treatment plants has been consistently hindered by residents’ negative stereotypes and rejections, which is called “Not-In-My-Back-Yard” (NIMBY) effect. This study collected the first-hand data with the residents residing within 3 kilometers of 9 wastewater treatment plants in Xi’an, China through a survey. Keyword co-occurrence network analysis was conducted and the results illustrate that residents have stereotypes toward wastewater treatment plants. There are two types of residents’ stereotypes toward wastewater treatment plants: positive and negative. The positive stereotypes of wastewater treatment plants in turn can be subdivided into the three categories of treatment technologies, treatment results, and social impacts. But the negative stereotypes didn’t demonstrate meaningful categories. We also tried to identify the influencing factors that cause residents’ stereotypes. The distance from residents’ residence to the wastewater treatment plants has impacts on the stereotypes of residents’ who reside within 1000 meters of the wastewater treatment plant: the farther from the wastewater treatment plants their residence is, the more positive their stereotypes are. We also found that the more educated the participants are, the more positive stereotypes of wastewater treatment plants they have. Moreover, residents’ stereotypes toward wastewater treatment plants are more influenced by formal education. Non-formal education and informal learning probably have less influence on the promotion of wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, we propose to incorporate environmental education for sustainable development into formal education to increase residents’ acceptance of wastewater treatment plants. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent research suggests presumptions about atheists’ uncommitted mating strategy causes atheists to seem less trustworthy, and that people who are more religious or espouse less agreeable attitudes toward uncommitted mating (i.e., more restricted sociosexual attitudes) tend to harbor greater anti-atheist attitudes. We provided additional tests of these ideas and addressed whether they could extend to discrimination against atheists in a “high-trust domain:” likelihood of granting approval to marry one’s adult child. An MTurk sample of U.S. parents (N = 301) self-reported their religiosity and sociosexual attitudes, then were randomly assigned to a condition wherein they read about their adult child’s fiancé who was either depicted as an atheist or devoted Christian. Participants reported their likelihood of approving of their child marrying the fiancé and estimated the fiancé’s committed mating strategy, trustworthiness, and dark personality characteristics. Participants with high religiosity presumed an atheist (vs. devoted Christian) fiancé endorsed a less committed mating strategy, which, apart from presumptions about the fiancé’s standing on dark personality characteristics, was associated with (a) perceiving the atheist as less trustworthy and (b) indicating less approval for their child marrying an atheist. Broadly, the research extends theorizing on how atheism relates to perceived threats to moral values and discrimination. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This narrative is an autoethnographic study of how discrimination and prejudice counteract the academic meritocratic system. In Sweden, which is one of the most gender-equal countries in the world, opposition to gender equality and prejudices against what is considered the Other can be hidden and thus reproduced in decision-making processes and structures. This narrative shows how a professorial recruitment process bypassed the meritocratic system i.e., the system in which qualifications and educational results in combination with the individual’s achievements should play the greatest role in the promotion process. This is a story about how the supposed meritocracy is twisted and manipulated within university contexts and how the “temperament” of a foreign female researcher is utilised to exclude her from entering through the coveted doors of academic departments. Different experiences, characterised by demanding conditions, have been analysed with the help of gender theoretical perspectives, opposition to gender equality, intercultural perspectives and a number of social psychological perspectives linked to prejudice. The description is interwoven with previous experiences from younger years, which together contribute to an increased understanding of the individual narrative and its specific context. © 2022, Croatian Sociological Association.

AB  - Little is known about whether the benefits of intergroup contact extend to contexts (e.g., a diverse underdeveloped township) likely to prove demanding for improved intergroup relations. There is a need for further research in these contexts on the potential inhibitors of contact (such as diversity and threat) and their effects. Perceived social diversity has been implicated in the deterioration of intergroup relations. This is particularly salient in the context of immigrant relations, where anti-immigrant sentiments are characterized by perceived threat and lower outgroup trust. Diversity can, however, have an indirect positive effect on outgroup attitudes, via intergroup contact, which reliably predicts lower perceived threat and prejudice. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that empathy could mitigate negative attitudes towards immigrants. We investigated the relationship between perceived neighbourhood diversity, cross-group friendships, realistic and symbolic threat, empathic responding, trust, and outgroup orientation within the volatile context of Black (African) South Africans’ relations with African immigrants. Survey data were collected from South Africans (N = 317) living in a township. Structural equation modelling showed that perceived diversity was significantly positively associated with both realistic threat (which was significantly negatively associated with outgroup trust) and cross-group friendships (which was significantly negatively associated with realistic threat). There was a significant indirect association between cross-group friendships and positive orientation towards African immigrants via empathic responding towards African immigrants. These findings suggest that cross-group friendships and empathy might mitigate the negative impact of diversity and threat on attitudes towards immigrants, even in this demanding context. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Though India is no stranger to either epidemics or hate speech, the COVID-19 crisis brought to the surface many of the pre-existing schisms and prejudices that subsequently led to both the Muslim minority community and the Dalit community being cast as miasmic and constant agitators against the central government. In the case of hate speech against the Muslim community, it has led to a peculiar situation wherein the invisible but pervasive Islamophobia that has been plaguing the country from the colonial times has risen it ugly head particularly across regional news channels and social media networks, making the phenomena hyper-visible. The Hindutva1 politicians from the extreme right parties have been indulging in spreading anti-Muslim propaganda, moulding the image of the Muslim community as not only disease-bearers and super-spreaders of COVID-19 virus but also as being anti-national, as the central government has proclaimed ‘a war against the COVID virus’ (The Print, 2020, 26 April). During the initial spread of the virus throughout the country, there was an increasing tendency to show the Muslim community as intentionally spreading the disease or as being ignorant of current medical practices, with multiple TV channels airing the views that the Tablighi Jamaat event (a religious congregation held in March 2020) was marked as a super-spreader event, and with multiple politicians engaging in rumour-mongering and hate-speech against the Muslims, framing the community as a miasmic community that needs to be cleared from India. On the other hand, the hate speech against Dalits in India is much more nuanced, indirect and layered. It began as WhatsApp and Facebook messages extolling the caste system and justifying the discriminatory practice of untouchability2 using the logic of social distancing and progressed to painting Dalits and Dalit spaces as unhygienic disease-scapes. This consequently led to the denial of livelihoods to thousands of domestic workers and unskilled workers who belonged to lower caste groups as they found themselves without jobs as most middle caste upper caste families and business owners fired their employees without notice. The study involves a hermeneutical analysis of news reports of the spread of COVID from newspapers and electronic media in English as well as interviews with at least 100 members of groups on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) that propagate extremely communal and casteist material. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - Deeply embedded racism and white supremacist beliefs have made efforts to dismantle discriminatory norms an elusive civil liberty endeavor. In the United States, social welfare policies have historically been founded on prejudicial values of racism and white privilege. Key historical events and political eras have catalyzed the pervasive dominance of white patriarchal values that embody dismissive social constructs that undergird public service institutions. The content of this dialogue will discuss America’s social welfare history beginning with the British era through the Biden/Harris era utilizing critical race theory (CRT) and intersectionality theory to deconstruct the daunting biases that perpetuate racial inequities in the development and administration of social welfare policies. In addition, this conversation will aim to identify strategies to address the structural racism and prejudicial practices within public service institutions in hopes of shifting the dialogue towards evidence-based research, policies, and equitable public administration systems. This Vantage Point commentary provides an opportunity to reflect on emerging issues related to the perpetuation of structural racism and institutionalized discriminatory practices woven into America’s social welfare policies' historical context. Moreover, this timely discussion offers strategies to deconstruct, dismantle, disregard, devise, and disseminate white-supremacist practices embedded within social welfare policies and public service systems. © 2022 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - In an increasingly diverse world, understanding young adults’ intergroup prosocial behavior toward diverse others may inform ways to reduce intergroup conflict and cultivate an equitable and inclusive society. The college years are often the first time that young adults begin to explore their social identities and intergroup relations independently from their parents. Thus, we focused on college students and examined social dominance orientation, social positions, prosocial obligation, and the sense of belongingness in relation to their intergroup prosocial behavior across four domains (i.e., age, gender, race/ethnicity, and department affiliation). Participants were 1163 young adults aged 18–24 years (63.2% females, 34.5% males, and 2.3% gender diverse; 50.7% White, 19.6% Latino, 25% Asian, 2.3% Black) from a large public Southwestern university. Four profiles of intergroup prosocial behavior (self-serving, altruistic, selfish, and reverse ethnic racial bias) were identified and they were differentially related to the social, cognitive, and contextual correlates we examined. Overall, findings highlighted the need to foster intergroup prosocial behavior and the benefits of intergroup prosocial behavior to young adults’ sense of belongingness. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the end of conflict in 1995, Bosnia–Herzegovina still suffers from unresolved ethnic and social tensions, where fostering social cohesion, active citizenship and mitigating ethnonationalist tensions and politically motivated violence remains among the main goals to achieve transformative peace. This paper, based on quantitative analyses of 3,637 adult respondents, shows that the tendency of Bosnians to be active or violent citizens sometimes overlaps and are not very distinct patterns of behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that differentiate pathways and help explain (un)civil civic behaviours and inform the work of peace and development actors. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a quantitative household survey conducted with a representative sample of 3,637 adults in Bosnia and by using a wide range of statistical tools from scaling to correlation analysis. This data set measures factors and conceptual notions associated with passive, constructive and aggressive civic tendencies and social cohesion in a nuanced way by using different metrics and scales. The survey was designed and conducted by The Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development (SeeD) and the Bosnia–Herzegovina Resilience Initiative in 2020, in partnership with The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) and The International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the SCORE Bosnia–Herzegovina study (SeeD, 2020). Findings: Overall, the factors that were discovered to be linked to the manifestation of constructive and aggressive civic tendencies are multidimensional, and range from intergroup relations (e.g. tension, tolerance) to political and civic attitudes (e.g. ethnonationalism, civic responsibility, gender equality), from individual traits (e.g. education, economic stress) to the media landscape (e.g. information consumption). While the empirical evidence shows that some of these factors can push citizens towards both active and violent civic behaviours simultaneously, this study identifies and distinguishes those that can reduce aggressive civic tendencies while increasing constructive civic tendencies. Practical implications: This paper proposes a replicable approach and evidence-based conclusions which can help validate the theories of change for the peace and development actors to ensure that scarce peacebuilding resources are invested where the impact is greatest, and the actors can protect the sanctity of their responsibility to do no harm. Social implications: This paper seeks to provide a robust empirical understanding for more effective policy-making and programming that can support Bosnia–Herzegovina’s endogenous resilience against socio-political shocks and transformative peace trajectory. This paper seeks to demonstrate how peace and development actors can build and use an evidence-base for understanding civic behaviours and as a result formulate tailored efforts with greater likelihood of impact. This would help fulfil commitments towards sustainable development goals and the 2030 global agenda (UN General Assembly, 2015). Originality/value: This study contributes insights to the emerging literature at the nexus of peacebuilding, individual skills/attitudes and civic behaviour. While the conclusions are highly contextual, the methodology is informed by multidisciplinary literature and is replicable in other post-conflict and non-conflict contexts, and thus can be used for cross-country comparisons and theory building around civic activism and constructive citizenship. The approach distinguishes between passive citizens, constructive activists, aggressive activists and purely violent citizens. This study discovers that the bifurcation is between passive citizens and active citizens, and although constructive and aggressive civic tendencies might be theorised to be contradictory, they overlap and tend to co-occur. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Stereotype threat (ST) is a potential explanation for inequalities in language competencies observed between students from different language backgrounds. Language competencies are an important prerequisite for educational success, wherefore the significance for investigation arises. While ST effects on achievement are empirically well documented, little is known about whether ST also impairs learning. Thus, we investigated vocabulary learning in language minority elementary school students, also searching for potential moderators. In a pre-post design, 240 fourth-grade students in Germany who were on average 10 years old (MAge = 9.92, SD = 0.64; 49.8% female) were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: implicit ST, explicit ST without threat removal before posttest, explicit ST with threat removal before posttest, and a control group. Results showed that learning difficult vocabulary from reading two narrative texts was unaffected by ST. Neither students’ identification with their culture of residence and culture of origin nor stereotyped domain of reading were moderators. The findings are discussed with regard to content and methodological aspects such that a motivation effect might have undermined a possible ST effect. Implications for future research include examining the question at what age children become susceptible to ST and whether students have internalized negative stereotypes about their own group, which could increase the likelihood of ST effects occurring. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine the wider societal outcomes of entrepreneurs' networking in ethnically divided post-conflict societies. Using network theory to explain relational dynamics between business, social and personal relationships, we postulate that entrepreneurs' interactions generate connections and paths across ethnically diverse social networks, thus facilitating social relations between ethnic groups. The survey was conducted with 130 entrepreneurs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and North Macedonia. The findings demonstrate that entrepreneurs are driven to increase profit and networks when cooperating with diverse ethnic groups. While spreading their business connections with other ethnic groups, they at the same time form connections between ethnic communities. Entrepreneurs alleviate ethnic cleavages and improve relations between ethnic groups. This article contributes to the recognition of the capacity of economic ties to facilitate cooperative patterns and rebuild impaired ethnic relations in ethnically divided post-conflict societies.

AB  - The dispute between the laborers and the corporations never settled well, and yet the local wisdom has never been taken into account. This instance of overriding led to internal disharmony and drove the productivity down. Despite several attempts, either negotiation or judicial processes, the dispute always ends in discontent for both parties. As this situation prolonged, local wisdom and indigenous knowledge must be taken into account. This study explored the potentiality of utilizing local wisdom to end the dispute in an amicable settlement. It was a descriptive study with a descriptive analysis. The data were collected through observations, interviews, and sampling-technique documentations. This study flaunted three stages in the dispute settlement. First, it began with a conciliation settlement between the conflicting parties mediated by the local authorities. Second, industrial dispute settlement through the utilization of Sara Wanua, local wisdom, to facilitate the local community. Third, a final settlement through a legal proceeding in the district court. The utilization of local wisdom in the dispute settlement has a significant impact because of shared cultural values and ethnic relations. Following these three stages of the dispute settlement, this study suggested more frequent socialization to educate people about the functions and the roles the local wisdom held in settling the dispute between the laborers from the local community and the industrial corporations. Hence, a good understanding and practice of local wisdom should keep the dispute down between these conflicting parties. © National Association of Social Workers-Zimbabwe/Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: Physically less attractive job applicants are discriminated against in hiring decisions. In a US context, the authors tested whether appearance-altering photo-filters can exploit this bias, focusing on the moderating role of job type, gender and race as well the mediating role of two major dimensions of person perception (warmth and competence). Design/methodology/approach: In study 1, 223 managers evaluated White mock applicants presented with or without a beautifying filter for either a position as a social worker or an IT specialist. In study 2, 212 managers evaluated Black and White mock applicants with or without beautifying filters for an HR specialist position. Findings: In study 1, beautifying filters increased perceived hireability irrespective of job type, but especially when applicants were female. Both male and female applicants whose photos were filtered were perceived as more competent, but only male applicants were perceived as warmer. In study 2, beautifying filters increased the hireability only slightly for White female applicants, followed by White and Black male applicants but substantially for Black female applicants. The filters increased the perceived competence of Black (and especially Black female) applicants but not of White applicants and increased the perceived warmth of all groups except for White females. Warmth and competence partially mediated the observed effects on hireability in both studies. Originality/value: In the context of widely available technological advances, the authors show that beautifying photo-filters can exploit attractiveness biases, at least at an early hiring stage. The results emphasize the importance of intersecting factors such as gender and race. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study identifies the stigma experienced by 12 bereaved parents 2 and 5 years after losing a child in the Sewol ferry disaster in South Korea. Using thematic analysis, we categorized the experience of stigma into two components based on Corrigan and Kosyluk’s social cognitive model of stigma: public stigma and self-stigma, and each was analyzed into three types of stigma: stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. We identified four additional factors related to stigma mitigation. The potential implications for characterizing the experiences of bereaved parents, particularly those facing stigma, are discussed in light of these findings in the longitudinal perspective. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The concept of femicide was created within the feminist theoretical field of studies influencing Law reform in Latin America. Eighteen countries throughout the region have criminalized femicide based on different legal provisions, in intimate and nonintimate relations. This article aims to provide a comparison of legal definitions of femicide as adopted in Latin American legal frameworks and to analyze the challenges of using law to give a name to the gender-based killings of women. The transition of the concept to law may partially impact its potential since other forms of gender-based violence may be hidden in a general clause of ‘gender prejudice’. It may also lead to restricted recognition in the legal system since traditionally this system operates in a conservative way wherein individual criminal liability has limitations in addressing institutional discrimination. Despite regional challenges, criminalization has contributed to raising social awareness on gendered killings. It has induced improvements in statistics and pushed for more attention on prevention policies and support for survivors and relatives. Nevertheless, current conservative movements tend to stress only the punitive approach and entail backlash on gender equality policies. This comparative study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the concept in the region. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: Existing research on loosely coupled educational systems has largely ignored the social and affective dimensions of such systems. Drawing on literature from organizational behavior, this study examines how “human” factors, including role identity dynamics, power dynamics, and stereotyping, shape the implementation of state-led education reforms. Research Method/Approach: This study draws on interviews and focus groups with 77 actors from different organizational levels in two states and uses a grounded theory analytical approach. Findings: Our findings indicate that stereotyping is ubiquitous across contexts, that the way actors stereotype and perceive each other depends on their positions in the system, and that stereotypes of higher ups often persist even as higher ups are aware of them and try unsuccessfully to mitigate them. We theorize about the reasons for these outcomes and their consequences for efforts at systemic change. Implications for Research and Practice: This study underscores the importance of social and emotional factors in education reform efforts, which have been under-theorized to this point. It demonstrates that reforms could be more successful when higher ups and lower downs have more frequent and meaningful interactions, which facilitate opportunities to break down social and emotional barriers to successful implementation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Anti-Asian racism in Canada has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and become more rampant. This article integrates Canadian postcolonialism, a critique of Canadian multiculturalism, and a framework of intergroup prejudice to conceptualize the covert anti-Asian racism that is entrenched in Canadian society. How COVID-19 exposes and “legitimizes” anti-Asian racism is further analyzed and included in this conceptualization. This conceptualization also includes social workers’ leading roles in combating anti-Asian racism through reforming and integrating client interventions, cultural policy, social context, and offers directions that can guide future social work research and practice in improving social justice during this crisis. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Psychedelic science has generated hundreds of compelling published studies yet with relatively little impact on mainstream psychology. I propose that social psychologists have much to gain by incorporating psychoactive substances into their research programs. Here I use (±)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an example because of its documented ability in experiments and clinical trials to promote bonding, love, and warmth. Social connection is a fundamental human need, yet researchers still possess few tools to effectively and durably boost it. MDMA allows investigators to isolate the psychological mechanisms—as well as brain pathways—underlying felt social connection and thus reveal what should be targeted in future (nondrug) studies. Accordingly, I introduce a conceptual model that presents the proximal psychological mechanisms stimulated by MDMA (lowered fear, increased sociability, more chemistry), as well as its potential long-term impacts (improved relationships, reduced loneliness, stronger therapeutic alliances). Finally, I discuss further questions (e.g., whether using MDMA for enhancing connection can backfire) and promising research areas for building a new science of psychedelic social psychology. In sum, psychopharmacological methods can be a useful approach to illuminate commonly studied social-psychological processes, such as connectedness, prejudice, or self, as well as inform interventions to directly improve people’s lives. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This article explores the life experiences of the daughters of mixed couples living in Spain. These adolescents and young adults have one Muslim parent of Maghrebi origin and another non-Muslim native Spanish parent. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we examine the identity processes of this female population and the interplay between factors of origin, location, and gender. We find that prejudices around Maghrebi Muslims in Spain have a constraining impact on the identity choices of females in particular. Social perceptions of Islam immediately place these teenagers and young women in a position of being the absolute Other, giving rise to differential treatment and limiting their identity choices and sense of belonging. However, these respondents also demonstrate resilience, empowerment, and agency in confronting socially imposed categories, such as forming counter-narratives and self-categorising in multiple ways – in turn illuminating the socially transformative aspects of ethnic and religious mixedness. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, fear and panic dominated the content of online news. Simultaneously, there was a prevalence of jokes on different social media sites. During the crisis, most Arab countries went through a nationwide lockdown for weeks that people found themselves trapped in their homes and resorted to social media to express their frustration about the prevailing happenings. They began exchanging jokes on social media that indirectly reflected stereotypes about them. One thousand four hundred and twenty-four jokes (1424) were collected from Facebook and WhatsApp messages for three months and were categorized based on the themes they covered. Gender-related jokes ranked the highest and were predominantly targeting women. Hence, this study is an attempt to explore how Arab Women were stereotyped in jokes circulated on social media during the coronavirus crisis. The 508 gender-related jokes were analysed in light of the General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The analysis generated four main themes, namely ‘marital relations’ (33%), ‘habits and attributes’ (26%), ‘beauty and makeup’ (23%), and ‘violence’ (18%). Women were stereotyped as being ugly and less feminine without makeup, talkative, shopaholic, despising and annoying wives, and violent and harmful partners in their private sphere. The study concludes that such negative stereotypes might be unintentionally produced and reinforced through laughter-eliciting jokes circulating fast in the virtual world. © 2022.

AB  - StyleLikeU is a hugely successful online social media platform that presents itself as a social justice movement related to body acceptance. Presenting moving personal stories, it offers a site for what it calls ‘diverse individuals’ to share their experiences as part of promoting individual self-acceptance in the face of a world that prioritizes one kind of body over another, which take the form of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, sizeism and prejudice against disfigurement. Drawing out the discursive script carried across the platform, we show how, beneath the rhetoric of progressiveness, social justice becomes a kind of personal therapy, related to empowerment and transformation, which erases actual differences in personal circumstances and the very forces of injustice. We place StyleLikeU into broader scholarly concerns about the neoliberal colonization of identity politics, diversity and intersectionality in institutions and in branding, drawing attention to how this can form one part of what are now presented as social justice movements. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article describes a Bahá’í concept of peace in the context of discussions about the nature and focus of peace education, in particular the role of moral education as an element of peace education. It introduces the notions of human nobility and the oneness of humanity as the moral basis for holistic peace within a framework of the collective social evolution of humanity, and explores the idea of identifying, understanding, and removing barriers to unity, specifically in the form of inequalities and prejudices, as the foundation of an approach to peace education. The application of such an approach to a university level course is shared through a case study of ‘The Problem of Prejudice’, offered by the Bahá’í Chair for World Peace at the University of Maryland, College Park. Key strands of content and pedagogy are described, and qualitative data from students participating in the course in 2021 (n = 20), collected in the form of self-perceptions of changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes and commitment, are presented. The article concludes with a discussion of the learning gained from this study and how a Bahá’í concept of peace may serve as a resource for university peace educators and students. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The paper introduces a multi-level model to reduce prejudice through supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels. The purpose of the model is to provide theoretically undergirded pathways to explain how societal events calling for systemic changes in DEI practices can engage and inculcate such systemic changes in organizations and institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The model draws upon macro-level (i.e. institutional theory and institutional logics) theories from sociology and strategic management, meso-level theories from leadership and strategy, and micro-level organizational behavior and human resource management theories. Findings: Resting on open systems theory (Katz and Kahn, 1966) as a backdrop, the authors address how institutional changes result in organizational level changes driving multi-level outcomes of increased DEI, reduced prejudice in work-related settings, and performance gains. The authors suggest the recursive nature of the model can trigger institutional level shifts in logics or result in isomorphic pressures that further change organizational fields and organizations. Originality/value: The contribution rests in a multi-level examination to help understand how environmental pressures can motivate organizations to enact broader changes related to social justice, specifically increasing efforts in DEI inside the operational aspects of the organization. By enacting these changes, the authors suggest the resultant positive changes in organizations will enhance culture and performance, creating isomorphic pressure for industry wide changes that may begin to move the needle on addressing systemic problems that feed prejudicial behavior in the workplace. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There seems to be a consensus among educators that dialogue is essential for pedagogical practice. However, the reality of classrooms tends to be different. For Cultural Psychology, monologism and heteronomy need to be replaced by dialogical practices. In this article, this topic is analyzed based on that theoretical perspective and the principles of dialogical psychology, illustrating our analysis with research data referring to an activity developed in a public school with the intended purpose of deconstructing prejudices. Despite the teachers’ established objectives (the discussion of a short film) and even though they sought to value a dialogical attitude as a pedagogical practice, a monological practice was conducted. We discuss in theoretical terms why this tends to occur, hoping to contribute with educators by orienting them to listen, discuss, and reflect with students about topics such as the deconstruction of prejudices. © 2022, Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas.

AB  - The article looks at how memories and experiences of hunger in Dalit life writings form a strong political critique against the claims of modern welfare society. The instances of hunger recorded in Ethiru by Kunhaman are analysed in order to see how hunger itself constitutes a humiliating experience when it is combined with experiences of caste discriminations. Despite developing juridical as well as social sensibilities to irradicate hunger and poverty, caste-ridden contexts give rise to situations of death by hunger not due to any shortage of food but due to ostracization and alienation of the marginalized communities. These moments also expose the colonial and feudal views and prejudices about the poor, their attitude to hard work, and value of labour and charity which still lie deep in the social psyche of many developed countries. The article attempts to locate Kunhaman’s work within the context of emerging critiques from the marginalized communities against tall claims of the progressivism and development indices of Kerala society. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - This study explored the successful career transition experiences of Korean college athletes who ceased to participate in sport prior to completing their college eligibility. In particular, the research addressed the ways in which they overcame challenges while pursuing their desired post-sport career paths. A qualitative approach was adopted to explore participants’ life transitions, uncovering six primary themes: (1) entering the athletic specialist system: motivations and goals; (2) exit from sport: injury, failure of rehabilitation, bullying, and abandonment; (3) challenges in transition: prejudice, exclusion, and stigmatisation; (4) cultivating academic integrity to obtain degrees; (5) social networking outside of athletic culture; and (6) financial and emotional support. The findings were analysed by drawing on Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus, field, social capital, and cultural capital, including physical and educational forms of capital. Findings help to identify factors that aided former athletes in overcoming barriers and gaining competencies to succeed in their careers after sport. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper sets out a framework for exploring flourishing in older age through the lens of what older adults are doing in their lives. Applying a model from positive psychology called personal project analysis (PPA) our study captures a snapshot of older people's goals and their environmental context. Targeting older people aged 80+ we applied PPA methods in a semi-structured interview to elicit participants’ personal projects which were scored on eight wellbeing dimensions (e.g., fun, stress). Qualitative data analysis identified what types of personal projects are employed by this older demographic and the environments in which they are carried out. Results showed our participants were vitally engaged in a wide spectrum of projects exercised in a range of ‘enabling places’ which we categorised as (1) restorative niches (places that afford psychological restoration) such as nature settings (e.g. a garden, local park or riverside); (2) affinity niches (places that afford social opportunities) such as religious venues, social clubs, or cafés; and (3) flow niches (places that afford immersion in mental or physical tasks) such as the home (e.g. the kitchen) or a place associated with a previous career or amateur sport (e.g. cricket club). Our findings are discussed in relation to older people's wellbeing and the role of the built environment. Despite the increasingly negative stereotyping of the ‘older-old’ our study shows that the final decades of life can be a period of continuing growth and learning, a life stage with its own distinct character, rather than a period of decline. © 2022

AB  - People with albinism are prone to experiencing negative attitudes from society, including stigma and discrimination, which place them at risk of mental health-related challenges. This exploratory study expanded and deepened our understanding of people with albinism by examining in-depth the experiences of women with albinism residing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The study utilized community-based descriptive cross-sectional and mixed data collection methods to identify the unique experiences of women with albinism. Findings indicate that women with Albinism experience stress and adversity at some point throughout their lives. This study showed that threats to their safety, discrimination, and abuse affect this population physically and bring profound psychological/emotional impacts. Myths and misconceptions about albinism have laid the foundation for the present prejudices and social stigma, thus requiring increased efforts at public education regarding albinism in Tanzania. Points of interest This article explores the unique experiences of women with albinism in Tanzania; albinism might be an additional factor to others which might contribute to the development of mental health challenges. This study also contributes to research on people with albinism in Tanzania by examining the unique experiences of women from their own voices. The present study focuses on psychological problems and provides awareness on risks the population faces regarding their general mental health. Understanding the experiences and psychological impacts of such experiences to people with albinism, particularly women, may impart knowledge to service providers and society at large. The study found that personal threats to the life of women with albinism or other people with albinism are significant sources of trauma which causes major distress at the time of the experience and in the months following experiences. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study illustrates how speech features that emerged from language contact and acquisition in a pluralistic society can accrue diverse social-indexical meanings over time. The social perceptions towards three variants of coda /l/ in Singapore English-namely dark-l, the variant associated with prescriptive norms, and clear-l and vocalised-l, which are variants that arose through language contact-are examined. The findings show that clear-l and vocalised-l are associated with specific ethnic groups and have equally diverse meanings, but their meanings have evolved differently; vocalised-l is an emerging local standard, whereas clear-l remains largely stigmatised. Their diverse meanings are shown to be connected by social factors within a network of interrelated signs, and their interpretations are dependent on the hearer's experiences, such that we are observing different parts of the sociolinguistic reality. Restricted experiences with the social world and regulation of social perception are also shown to potentially contribute to accent-based prejudices.

AB  - This preregistered research analyzed survey data from ethnic and religious advantaged groups in 12 countries (N = 2,304) to examine the interplay between two determinants of support for social change toward intergroup equality. Drawing on the needs-based model and the common-ingroup identity model, we hypothesized that the experience of accepting intergroup contact and the endorsement of a dual identity representation of intergroup relations would be associated with greater support for equality. Furthermore, integrating the logic of both models, we tested the novel hypothesis that the positive effect of accepting contact on support for equality would be stronger under a high (vs. low) dual identity representation. While the predicted main effects received empirical support, we found no evidence for the expected interaction. These findings suggest that interventions to foster support for social change among advantaged group members can promote accepting contact and a dual identity representation independently of each other. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - How do racial group attitudes shape the political preferences of Black and white evangelicals? Scholarship has documented the relationship between religion and race in shaping political behavior and attitudes. However, less is known about how in-group and out-group racial attitudes operate within religious populations. Using samples of Black and white evangelicals from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, we explore the role of racial identity centrality and racial resentment in determining evangelicals' political preferences. While the role of Black and white identity among evangelicals is minimal, we find strong and consistent conservatizing effects for racial resentment. Together these findings suggest that the evangelical racial divide is not driven by Black evangelicals' attachment to their racial identity, but that racial resentment may drive white evangelicals to more conservative political preferences.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the U.S. government's recent harsh restrictions on immigrants and refugees and the ramped-up anti-immigrant sentiments. The strict borderlands politics, the militarized police at the border zones, family separations and other tactics of fear, silencing, and oppression reinforced within public spheres and institutions (e.g., racialized policies of control, the constant threat of deportation) have greatly impacted the lives of immigrant and refugee families and children (Gándara & Ee, 2018; Zayas et al., 2015). Providing sociopolitical, educational, and emotional support for immigrant/refugee students and their families has never become so urgent during this extraordinary time. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Many disabled people choose to conceal or disclose their disability after weighing diverse levels of discrimination, social awareness, and welfare benefits they encounter in their daily lives. However, few studies have focused on choice experiences regarding concealment or disclosure of disability in various daily situations. Drawing on the experiences of 14 people with mild disabilities in South Korea, this study explores the multi-dimensional contexts of people who choose to present or hide their disability. Our analysis identifies five spectra of disability concealment /disclosure: aversive concealment from social oppression, defensive disclosure for self-protection, aggressive disclosure of disability identity, responsive disclosure for welfare benefits, and seeming concealment of disability identity. Such spectra indicate that the choice to conceal or disclose is a flexible self-presentation process. Furthermore, we discuss how various concealment/disclosure patterns are influenced by South Korea’s radical disability movement that aimed to highlight the existence of people with disabilities in society. Points of interest This study raises a doubt about the existing dichotomised perspective that views hiding disability as a result of disability discrimination and revealing disability as an expression of positive disability identity. This study argues that hiding/revealing one’s disability are strategic options that an individual can choose from in accordance with his/her situation. This study explores why and how disabilities are hidden/revealed by interviewing 14 people with nonvisible disabilities in South Korea. The participants choose to hide or disclose their disability after weighing the disability discrimination, prejudice, recognition, and benefits that will arise from each situation. Beyond the two existing dichotomies (hiding vs. revealing disability), our findings highlight five different strategic options that interviewees choose from according to their situational contexts. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: Existing research on social inequalities in leadership seeks to explain how perceptions of marginalized followers as deficient leaders contribute to their underrepresentation. However, research must also address how current leaders restrict these followers' access to leadership opportunities. This conceptual paper offers the perspective that deficiencies in leaders' behaviors perpetuate social inequalities in leadership through an illustrative application to research on gender and leadership. Design/methodology/approach: The authors situate existing research on gender and leadership within broader leadership theory to highlight the importance of inclusivity in defining destructive and constructive leadership. Findings: Previous scholarship on gender inequalities in leadership has focused on perceptions of women as deficient leaders. The authors advocate that researchers reconceptualize leaders' failures to advance women in the workplace as a form of destructive leadership that harms women and organizations. Viewing leaders' discriminatory behavior as destructive compels a broader definition of constructive leadership, in which leaders' allyship against sexism, and any other form of prejudice, is not a rare behavior to glorify, but rather a defining component of constructive leadership. Practical implications: This paper highlights the important role of high-status individuals in increasing diversity in leadership. The authors suggest that leader inclusivity should be used as a metric of leader effectiveness. Originality/value: The authors refocus conversations on gender inequality in leadership by emphasizing leaders' power in making constructive or destructive behavioral choices. The authors’ perspective offers a novel approach to research on social inequalities in leadership that centers current leaders' roles (instead of marginalized followers' perceived deficits) in perpetuating inequalities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Ecofeminism purports that sexist ideology and climate change denial are related, as prejudice, and its desire for power and nonuniversalism, create a disregard for both. In three studies we examined the associations between hostile and benevolent sexism with climate change denial. The first study (n = 270) demonstrated that hostile sexism explained unique variance in climate change denial over and above two strong predictors of prejudice and climate change denial, social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism. The second study (n = 294) reports on the significant indirect effects of willingness to make sacrifices for the environment on the relation between hostile/benevolent sexism and climate change denial. The third and final study (n = 514) found significant indirect effects of hostile and benevolent sexism, as well as willingness to make sacrifices for the environment, on the relation between power and climate change denial. Universalism demonstrated direct effects with climate change denial when benevolent sexism and willingness to make sacrifices for the environment were taken into account; direct and indirect effects were found when hostile sexism and willingness to make sacrifices for the environment were considered. Our findings provide support for a strong relation between hostile sexism and climate change denial and suggest underlying psychological processes that may represent paths through which climate change attitudes could be indirectly modified. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Horse trading was an important aspect of the Igbo economy and horse-related title taking was a unique feature among various Nigerian groups, especially in eastern Nigeria. The demand for the introduction of humane horse killers in eastern Nigeria was heightened by the economic drive of the colonial political economy, and was not necessarily a consideration for the harmful treatment of animals. Horse-related title taking was accompanied by the increasing rate of intergroup relations between northern Nigeria and various Nigerian groups such as Igala and the Igbo. Ordinarily, men and women sought horse-related titles as signs of prestige and honour. The culture and traditional humane living of the people saw Ogbuinya horse-related title taking as a way of achieving certain degree of social status, but it also regrettably promoted animal cruelty. Sources for writing this article were derived from archival documents, books, journals, and other written materials. A descriptive method of analysis has been adopted in writing this article. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Although an ever-increasing number of social interactions are taking place virtually, people’s relationships with their neighbors remain important. Apartment residents make up a growing proportion of the population in cities worldwide, but there is evidence that many find it challenging to form and maintain local social connections, especially those renting their home. This can negatively impact physical and mental health, and have implications for the management of apartment complexes and local area social sustainability. In this paper, we draw on interviews (n = 41) with renters of four large case study condominium complexes in Sydney, Australia, to investigate their local social interactions. The findings reveal that while many renters desire greater local connection, their opportunities and motivations are limited by factors relating to mobility, tenure security, prejudice, and exclusion from building-related governance. The paper concludes by considering the scope for interventions in design, management and governance to enhance opportunities for social connection. © 2022 Urban Affairs Association.

AB  - In the first half of the 21st century, it is clear that racism and prejudice are prevalent worldwide and begin in childhood—as children can be perpetrators, victims, and bystanders of racism and prejudice. Reducing racism in youth is a critical step toward improving the society we all live in. This special issue reviews and synthesizes the latest research on racism and prejudice in childhood and adolescence, examining the role of families, schools, media, and friendships in reducing prejudice in youth and highlighting how to enhance collective well-being. By focusing on research over the past two decades, and including a range of international perspectives, this special section helps make theoretical, conceptual, and methodological advances on the topic of reducing and protecting children from racism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The war in Donbas led some observers to speculate that this event might threaten intergroup relations in Ukraine. While studies in the 1990s indicated relatively positive attitudes between the different ethnic and linguistic groups, it has not been analyzed systematically how these attitudes have developed over time. Such an analysis contributes to our general understanding as to how war and nation-building politics affect attitudes toward minorities. Analyzing survey data from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology from 1995 to 2018 using multivariate statistical methods, I show that the prejudice toward Russian-speaking Ukrainians-measured using the social distance scale-has increased since 2014, when both the war and Poroshenko's presidency began, although the rise is rather small. A likely explanation to this phenomenon is the perceived link between Russian speakers and Russia as the aggressor in the war. The fact that Yushchenko's presidency (2006-2009) did not result in a similar increase of negative sentiments, despite similarities between Yushchenko's and Poroshenko's identity politics, allows me to suggest that the higher level of prejudice under Poroshenko cannot be solely explained by the political rhetoric promoting an ethnic Ukrainian identity. However, the interplay of political rhetoric and war might have been relevant. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Association for the Study of Nationalities.

AB  - We propose that support for group-based hierarchy among members of low-status or subordinate groups may be boosted by beliefs in future ingroup high status. Specifically, the more individuals believe their group may hold a higher status, the more they support hierarchical intergroup relations (i.e., high social dominance orientation; SDO), by boosting ingroup favouritism. In turn, SDO should be positively associated with collective action tendencies by increasing social competition intentions. Using samples from Catalonia (N = 152) and the Basque Country (N = 262), results showed that independence supporters’ beliefs in future ingroup status enhancement reinforced participants’ SDO, through nationalist sentiments (i.e., ingroup bias) but not through patriotism in the Catalan sample, and directly in the Basque sample. In turn, SDO increased collective actions towards independence by reinforcing individuals’ motivation to compete with the opponent dominant outgroup (Madrid region), especially in the Catalan sample. We discuss the implications of considering situational and contextual factors to better understand individuals’ support for group-based hierarchies and inequality. © 2022 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - Purpose: Stereotypes are simplified and widely shared visions held by a social group regarding a place, object, event or recognizable set of people united by certain characteristics or qualities. They are “dangerous” mental models because they are widely disseminated, devious and capable of acting even unconsciously in individuals, social groups and organizations altering the rationality of assessments and choices and producing discrimination and prejudice. Stereotypes acritically extend from a characteristic of a significant percentage of a category to the totality of individuals. The process of generalization triggered by a stereotype produces the error of discrimination and prejudice. There are numerous forms of stereotypes, but this study takes into account gender stereotypes because they act pervasively, often subtly, to reduce “productivity”. People who are aware of being discriminated perceive an unsatisfactory fulfillment of their motivations, which reduces their incentive to improve their performance. Since productivity measures the efficient use of energy from working in production processes, the author believes that wherever gender stereotypes are at play, there is a productive “waste of energy”, an inefficiency in work activity with harmful effects for organizations of all kinds, including families. Design/methodology/approach: The work aims to demonstrate that wherever gender stereotypes are at play, a “waste of energy” manifests itself in terms of productivity, representing an inefficiency in work activity with harmful effects for organizations of all kinds, including families. To describe the negative effects stereotypes produce in organizations, some models are presented based on the methods and language of systems thinking. These models, although typically qualitative, are capable of exploring the most accepted theories in the literature: tournament theory, the Pygmalion effect, the Galatea effect, self-fulfilling prophecies, the Queen bee syndrome, the role congruency theory, the glass ceiling theory (“think manager, think male” and “family responsibilities wall”). The paper follows a predominantly organizational and corporate approach, although the copious literature on stereotypes belongs largely to the area of social psychology and organization studies. Findings: The paper does not consider the psychological origin of stereotypes but highlights their use as routines-shortcuts for evaluations and decisions demonstrating that, when adopted in social systems and within organisations, stereotypes produce different forms of discrimination: in social rights, in work, in careers and in access to levels of education and public services, reducing performance and limit potential. The paper also examines some ways gender and culture stereotypes can be opposed, presenting a change management strategy and some concrete solutions proposed by the process–structure–culture model for social change (PSC model). Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of the work is that it focuses on gender stereotypes, choosing not to consider the “intersection effect” of these with other stereotypes: racial stereotypes, religious stereotypes, color stereotypes, age stereotypes, sex and sexual orientation stereotypes, and many others, whose joint action can cause serious inefficiencies in organizational work. Practical implications: As stereotypes are a component of social culture and are handed down, by use and example, from generation to generation, the maintenance over time of stereotypes used by individuals to evaluate, judge and act can be seen as an effect of the typical action of a combinatory system of diffusion, which can operate for a long time if not effectively opposed. Il PSC model indicates the strategy for carrying out this opposition. Social implications: With regard to gender stereotypes, it should be emphasized that in organizations and social systems, “gender diversity” should be considered an opportunity and not as a discriminating factor and thus encouraged by avoiding harmful discrimination. In fact, this diversity, precisely because of the distinctive characteristics individuals possess regardless of gender, can benefit the organization and lead to an increase in organizational and social performance. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2020) Goal 5: Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls is examined in this context. Originality/value: This study views the action of gender stereotypes as especially harmful “mental models”, highlighting the distortions they cause in the allocation of productive energy in society, groups and organizations. The paper follows a predominantly organizational and corporate approach, although the copious literature on stereotypes belongs largely to the area of social psychology. Using the “logic” and “language” of systems thinking, theories and models that describe and interpret the distorting effects of organizational choices based on stereotypes rather than rational analysis are highlighted. The action of stereotypes and their persistence over time can also be described using combinatory systems theory. With this paper, the author hopes that by acting on the three wheels of change highlighted by the PSC model, through legal provisions, control tools and actions on the culture operated by educational and social aggregative institutions, it should not be impossible to change the prevailing culture so that it becomes aware of the harmful influence of gender stereotypes and other discriminatory mental models and come to reject them. The author hopes this paper will help to understand the need to make this change. © 2022, Piero Mella.

AB  - Several adverse psychological outcomes among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are well documented in the literature. Notwithstanding the emergence of these data, SGM still receive little attention regarding psychological interventions, which include Schema Therapy (ST), an emerging integrative psychotherapy approach. Even though revisions have been proposed to expand ST’s understanding of emotional needs, schemas, domains, and schema modes, there is a gap in our understanding of SGM. Based on that, the main goal of this theoretical essay is to propose a specific ST intervention for SGM, addressing sociocultural aspects aiming at promoting a healthy functioning that can interpose oppression and internalized prejudice. To this end, we will present (a) the minority stress theoretical framework; (b) the ST model applying to SGM clients; and (c) a few strategies of ST intervention for SGM clients, highlighting the need for strengthening individuals’ healthy schema mode. It should be noted that, despite clinical work being relevant, there are social variables supporting and maintaining maladaptive structures. We hope the therapeutic interventions proposed promote dialogue on this subject and encouraging positive societal changes. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Group-Focused Enmity describes the idea that different outgroup-specific prejudices can be aggregated to a lar-ger syndrome of inequality-based derogation of others. This focus section brings together three studies on Group-Focused Enmity that had been registered and peer-reviewed before they were conducted. All of the reports advance the Group-Focused Enmity literature in important ways and demonstrate the fruitfulness of the concept. They also show that using sophisticated methods can help us to address novel and exciting questions, and demonstrate the opportunities that preregistration offers for studies analysing secondary data. © 2022, Universitaet Bielefeld.

AB  - Individuals who are strongly oriented towards market-based values are more likely to devalue groups identified as ”unprofitable” from an economic point of view. Drawing on insights from Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), this study explores economically legitimized prejudice in light of a far-reaching economization of the institu-tional and cultural structure. Multilevel models using data from the European Social Survey (2018) show that hostility towards immigrants is expressed more among individuals who strongly embrace market-based values and in countries where the institutional structure is dominated by the economy and non-economic social institutions are enfeebled (institutional imbalance). Aggregated market-based values (a “marketized anomic culture”) mediate the effect of a) individual market-based values and b) institutional imbalance on anti-immigrant atti-tudes. This study contributes to a better understanding of group prejudice under conditions of economization. It shows that applying IAT within a multilevel framework offers a fruitful explanation not only for crime but for other sociological phenomena. © 2022, Universitaet Bielefeld. All rights reserved.

AB  - The assessment of students by the social work academy measures their performances on standardized tests. Accusations of racial bias and other prejudices have long challenged the legitimacy of such tests, which may be unofficially used as indicators of an applicant’s intellectual and scholastic potential. When combined with GPA, the highest integrity is assumed. GPA is an acronym for a student’s grade point average. Most commonly, GPAs are used to give account of academic achievement. Thus, GPAs may be more valued by students than their standardized test score or subject matter, given the institutional weight placed upon such information. GRE is an acronym that stands for Graduate Record Examination, which, in social work, often contrasts with GPA. It is a standardized test designed to predict how well a student applicant might perform in postsecondary education. The significance of GPA to students cannot be overstated. Subsequently, student evaluations of faculty teaching empower students to cultivate instructors for inflated grades. In the aftermath, this poses a challenge to the academy: how much authority capital is it willing to assign to investigation? This is an investment in maintaining prestige of the social work profession commensurate with the future of its ethical ideals. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to present an integrated theoretical frame for the subject matter of disability and child protection. Substantive complexities, alluded to in existing literature, surround disability in child protection work. The high stakes and emotionally provocative practice of child safeguarding is often made even more complex by the presence of disability. Difficult balances must be struck, and with a plurality of approaches to understanding disability now available, the proposition is that one emerging theoretical alliance may be of particular utility. Specifically, when used for the subject matter of child protection, an affirmative non-tragedy model of disability within overarching critical disability studies theory, is useful in dealing with the multiple possibilities surrounding disability and child protection. The intention is to present this theoretical frame along with some possibilities for its extension, as a means for all stakeholders to reconsider the complexity that disability and child protection entails.Points of interest Disability is linked to some unique problems in the context of child protection such as that disabled children are more likely to be abused than non-disabled children. Other problems include that disability can mix with other identities in a way that makes risk more complex. Intellectually disabled parents can also experience prejudice and practitioners can struggle to understand and respond effectively to disability. Theorists within disability studies ought to deal with these problems. Part of the problems with disability and child protection is the way in which disability is thought about. The article presents an area of theory known as critical disability studies and a model known as the affirmative non-tragedy model and suggests that these are helpful in understanding issues to do with disability and child protection. Critical disability studies is about criticality and new thinking around disability. The non-tragedy model aims to prevent disability being linked to negativity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Group-focused enmity (GFE) and related research have mostly focused on variable-centred analyses such as structural equation modelling and factor analysis, implicitly assuming that the results apply uniformly to all par-ticipants in the sample. Person-centred research questions and analysis methods, which investigate unobserved heterogeneity in the sample, have been lacking in GFE research. Nonetheless, initial evidence exists from re-search on Islamophobia and GFE that various unobserved latent classes (i.e., subgroups) differing in their aver-age prejudice can be identified within one dataset. In this manuscript, we applied factor mixture modelling to investigate unobserved heterogeneity using the data of the German GFE survey 2011. We found two latent classes of equivalent factor-analytical composition with consistently high versus low expressions of target-specific pre-judice. No comparison of latent GFE means was possible. Membership in the high prejudice latent class was as-sociated with higher age, right-wing political orientation, high right-wing authoritarianism and high social dom-inance orientation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of exploring unobserved heterogeneity in attitudes research and outline how person-centred research can complement variable-centred research in order to under-stand social-psychological phenomena. © 2022, Universitaet Bielefeld.

AB  - This essay enriches causal models capturing the propagation of prejudice, bias, and other aggregative social mechanisms, negative or positive. These explananda include the reinforcement of economic inequality, “mob-like” behavior, peer pressure, and the establishment of social norms. The stage is set by introducing various forms of redundant causation and discussing some difficulties with mainstream preemption. Next the main proposal extends current representations of aggregative social mechanisms in two respects. First, it is more nuanced, as it identifies three distinct kinds of inferences: relevance of causes to effects, degree of redundancy of an effect, and the influence that causes exert on other causes. Second, it offers a quantitative—as opposed to merely qualitative—distinction between the causal contribution of preempting and preempted causes. © 2022 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

AB  - Previous research (Zick et al. 2008) suggested that animosity toward social minorities in Europe is intertwined, forming a syndrome of Group-Focused Enmity (GFE). In the current research, we extended the notion of GFE by identifying the GFE structure in a non-European context (South Korea). We also tested a novel hypothesis that stipulates an interplay between individuals’ self-concept and their value orientation in predicting the overall level of GFE. Two nation-wide surveys in South Korea showed that antagonism toward social minorities that have typically been marginalized and devalued in that country forms GFE while reflecting the unique intergroup context of Korean society. Further, we found as expected that independence in self-concept and a collectivistic value orientation jointly predict lower levels of GFE (Study 1). When political orientation and national identifica-tion were taken into account, the predicted interaction was observed only on antagonism toward ingroup minorities but not toward outgroup minorities by race or ethnicity (Study 2).

AB  - This study examined 587 Turkish adolescents’ (Mage = 13.14, SD = 1.61) judgments and bystander responses towards hypothetical intragroup interpersonal (Turkish victim) and intergroup bias-based (Syrian refugee victim) bullying. Intergroup factors and social-cognitive skills were assessed as predictors. Findings revealed that adolescents were less likely to see bullying as acceptable and less likely to explicitly support the bully in intragroup interpersonal bullying compared to intergroup bias-based bullying. Further, adolescents with higher theory of mind and empathy were more likely to evaluate intergroup bias-based bullying as less acceptable and more likely to challenge the bully. Adolescents’ prejudice and discrimination towards refugees were predictors of bystander judgments and responses to intergroup bias-based bullying. This study provides implications for anti-bullying intervention programs. © 2022 Society for Research on Adolescence.

AB  - There is an unnamed crisis of aesthetic immediacy afoot in the American criminal justice system. Defendants are seen too quickly. Or rather, they are recognized too quickly. They are recognized spatially, at the defense table, surrounded by lawyers and court marshals, playing the protagonists in the court performance. For most observers, this staging and its familiarity bring about a series of untold assumptions—assumptions that, when viewed nakedly, erode the presumption of innocence. While implicit biases and prejudices similarly short-circuit judicial proceedings—procedure and proceduralism itself—nefariously permit implicit narratives to outpace evidence. Tools to interrupt the aesthetics of transgression and its aftermath will serve judicial accuracy without substantial efficiency tradeoffs. While the bifurcation of the guilt and sentencing in American courts laudably partitions the culpability inquiry from the question of deserved punishment—the former, the question of wrongdoing, can never be truly divorced from history, neither personal nor social. Nor should it be. The Anglo-American insistence on a socially ahistorical criminal trial comes at a high cost: real and textured history—the foreground, leadup, and intimate histories of what occurred is kept out, while the more depersonalized histories that undergird daily life, narrative tropes, and mythologies of crime are permitted to play an outsized role. There is no place, as it stands, for simultaneity in truth or a multiplicity of character. This article thinks of ways to render collective transgression and the complexity of truth legally cognizable and to afford individual defendants full subject status as, I argue, the Sixth Amendment demands. It turns to a source famed for disrupting perception and the study of how and why perception is to be unsettled: Russian Formalism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Societally salient issues, like migration, stimulate user engagement with political parties on social media. This user engagement, in turn, is associated with political behavior, such as voting. Nonetheless, few studies so far have investigated the interaction between these factors. We examine how anti-immigration attitudes are associated with user engagement with political parties on social media. In this study, user engagement is understood as following political parties on social media. Through online data that were collected in October 2019 among adults (N= 1,000) in Belgium, we investigate how attitudes and user engagement are associated with voting behavior. Results suggest that attitudes towards migration are associated with user engagement with both left and right-wing parties on social media. Moreover, these attitudes and user engagement - and the interaction between the two - are related to voting behavior: being against (being in favor of) migration and following right-wing (left-wing) parties on social media is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for a right-wing (left-wing) party. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2022.

AB  - The study extends the approach of the Stereotype Content Model to ethnic stereotype content beyond intergroup relations within societies by exploring the North-South hypothesis for competence and warmth. This paper claims that the “desperate” (resource-poor and unpredictable) of lower-latitude climate regions and “hopeful” (resource-sufficient and stable) ecology higher-latitude climate regions translate into typical aggregate attributes and are afterward generalized to the status of all their residents. Further, people use this information as a diagnostic for judgments about the economic value or burden of ethnic groups in their society. Based on the data about aggregated means of competence and warmth for 77 ethnic groups in 38 regions, the multivariate models show that ethnic groups from warmer climates and from lower wealth countries are given lower evaluation in both competence and warmth stereotypes. However, ethnic groups from more northerly countries are also given a lower evaluation in warmth. Ethnic stereotypes reflect both features of ethnic groups in countries of origin (e.g., the North-South polarization) and group characteristics carried by ethnic groups in new contexts (i.e., intergroup relations). Thus, reactions to ethnic groups seem to differ partly depending on countries of origin mixed in people’s minds with information about geography, climate, and national wealth in the social perception process. Stereotypes associated with ethnic groups across countries to some extent track the stereotypes associated with the ecologies in which these ethnic groups are assumed to predominantly live. This highlights the importance of the establishment or expansion of policies and programs regarding international inequality. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This article argues that the failure of early twentieth-century novelistic, autobiographical and periodical literature to acknowledge or celebrate the novelty and social significance of the commercialisation of Bengali food reflected the deeply rooted caste and class prejudices underlying the dietary choices and literary styles of the Bengali bhadralok (educated middle class). As late as the 1970s, eminent Bengali littérateurs lamented the non-availability of ready-to-eat Bengali food, notwithstanding the fact that a chain of new public eateries called Pice hotels had been serving home-style Bengali food since the 1920s. The gastronomic revolution ushered in by these eateries was more or less ignored in contemporary print literature, with the notable exception of Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay’s celebrated novel, Adarsha Hindu Hotel, written in 1940. The failure of Bengali writers to acknowledge the pioneering role of Pice hotels in offering a socially inclusive dining experience in Bengal contrasted with their effusive celebration of the new culinary experiments that created a cosmopolitan eating culture of public dining in the colonial city of Calcutta at the turn of the twentieth century. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recently, major societal events have shaped perceptions of race relations in the US. The current work argues that people’s motivations to be nonprejudiced toward Black people have changed in concert with these broader societal forces. Analyses of two independent archival datasets reveal that nonprejudiced motivations changed predictably in accordance with shifts in the social milieu over the last 15 years. In one dataset (N = 13,395), we track movement in internal and external motivations to respond without prejudice from 2004 to 2017. Internal motivation initially decreased before ticking upward following multiple events suggesting worsening race relations (e.g., noteworthy killings of unarmed Black men, resurgent racialized politics). Conversely, external motivation initially increased but reversed course across the same time span. A second dataset (N = 2,503) corroborates these trends in two conceptually related nonprejudiced motivations. Results suggest that changes in nonprejudiced motivations may reflect broader shifts in the sociopolitical climate. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The public and political debate about immigration now play a big role in all European elections, and there is a trend increasing an anti-immigrant sentiment that receives important media attention. This work, based on the European Social Survey (ESS) round 9 data for 27 European countries, contributes to such debate by introducing a new method in the field, a Fuzzy-Hybrid Approach (FHA), that complements other methodological methods that have been used to measure citizens’ attitudes towards immigrants. The novel approach in the field provides a synthetic indicator that measures openness towards immigrants (OTISI). Then, we analyse the relationship that exists between some specific sociodemographic variables and the new index. Results show that country, political orientation, age, religion, economic situation, gender, birthplace, employment, education, universalism, and conformity are key drivers that explain different attitudes towards immigrants. Our findings concur with other previous studies showing that the results are robust and that the method can be applied in future social science studies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Written by a Polish-Russian scholar Tadeusz Zielinski, Our Debt to Antiquity (1903) was a successful attempt to combat the prejudiced view that classical education resists progress. Zielinski argued that Darwinian laws manifest themselves in his discipline in three aspects: (1) in the emergence of Greek and Latin languages as a result of the selection of word-forms and expressions that testify to certain features of national character; (2) in the persistence of classical education across many centuries as the ‘fittest’ educational system; (3) in the selection of schoolchildren for national elites. Although Zielinski’s application of Darwinian laws of selection to human society may appear reactionary to a modern reader, this article argues that in doing so he defends classical education both from the left-wing populists and from attempts at abuse from the right. Moreover, his thoughts prompt modern scholars to reflect on the real presence of Social Darwinism in our present educational system. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since Vietnam implemented its reform policy in 1986 and normalized relations with China in 1990, the network of border markets along the Vietnamese Chinese border has witnessed greater bustle and development. Several of the local ethnic people’s marketplaces have been expanded and became trading hubs for various goods with other localities and Chinese markets across the border. This paper aims to study the impacts of these border marketplaces and the transformation of local people’s livelihoods, as well as analyze the benefits of these border markets to local ethnic minority groups. The research has been conducted with both qualitative and quantitative approach, including in-depth interviews, group discussions, participatory observation, and questionnaires distributed to 100 petty traders residing in Can Cau Commune, Si Ma Cai District, Lao Cai Province, where one of the Hmong people’s well-known cattle markets is located. The study results found that Can Cau-based Hmong people, who have been making good use of their location, have succeeded in grasping various livelihood opportunities, also by profiting from their social and cultural resources such as their ethnic relations, lineages, languages, and cross-border networks. This is a good example of the successful participation of an ethnic minority group within the borderlands’ economic integration process, although they are faced with market competition and the common instability of border markets. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Research Summary: This study examines how incumbent director reactions to media coverage of the #MeToo movement have impacted the evaluation of prospective corporate directors. We argue that heightened intergroup anxiety related to male–female interactions leads incumbents to seize on social attributes that bolster category-based trust in the reliability of prospective directors' interpersonal behavior. We predict that in response to #MeToo coverage, incumbents evaluate board candidates more positively when they share demographic characteristics or have prior social connections, and these effects are strengthened when incumbents socially identify with the firm. Empirical analyses using a longitudinal survey of evaluations of director candidates support these predictions. Our findings suggest how social movements can produce unintended consequences by inadvertently triggering psychological processes that partially offset the anticipated benefits of the movement. Managerial Summary: Increased coverage of #MeToo has heightened concerns among board members about male–female interactions on the board. Our study finds that as #MeToo coverage increases, incumbent directors evaluate potential board candidates more positively to the extent that they share demographic characteristics, including gender, race, functional background, education and age, or when they are connected through the social network of board appointments. These effects are especially pronounced for incumbents who psychologically identify with the firm, meaning that their self-concept is aligned with features of the organization. Our study suggests how psychological reactions of corporate directors to #MeToo may inadvertently reduce board diversity and overall board effectiveness, and we call for research-based interventions to correct this unfortunate side effect of a critically important social justice movement. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Using the two-dimensional model of prejudice as a theoretical framework, we examined the geographic distribution of prejudice toward African Americans in the United States (N = 10,522). We found the East South Central, West South Central, and South Atlantic regions were associated with modern racism, principled conservatism characterized the Mountain region, aversive racism was prevalent in the East North Central region, and finally, low in prejudice was found in the Pacific, West North Central, Mid Atlantic, and New England regions. Additional analyses on political conservatism, social conservatism, and egalitarianism generally supported the distinctions between prejudice types made by the two-dimensional model. We believe mapping regional prejudice may have implications for testing theoretical differences between distinct types of prejudice as well as for implementing prejudice reduction strategies. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The format and content of competency to stand trial reports are influenced by traditional practices of psychological assessment and report writing that are outmoded for forensic practice. Many such reports include irrelevant, prejudicial information that unnecessary invades the privacy of the examinee, in violation of APA ethical guideline 4.04, and may also contain much data that are unreliable and prejudicial. Traditional report formats are organized around the psychologist’s concerns and topic areas rather than what is most useful to the trier of fact and parties. This article discusses these issues and offers a rationale for radically revising the standard competency to stand trial (CST) report template to make it more focused and objective for readers, more ethically compliant, and with less prejudicial information that may compromise the objectivity of the trier of fact. It also substantially reduces the amount of time required of report-writing. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aim: To explore the care experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians diagnosed with cirrhosis with a focus on support needed. Background: Cirrhosis disproportionately affects Indigenous Australians, and liver diseases contribute to the mortality gap between Indigenous and other Australian adults. Design: A qualitative study. Methods: Using yarning methods, Indigenous patients (n = 13) and support persons (n = 3) were interviewed by an Aboriginal researcher during April-July, 2020. Thematic analysis was used to identify common themes using an inductive approach. Results: Six themes emerged. (1) Experience of diagnosis. This theme included stories of delays in the system, self-awareness of signs and symptoms and relief of being diagnosed. (2) ‘Shame, shame, shame’. Experiences of prejudices and discrimination from health professionals, the lack of understanding of cirrhosis among health professionals, and stories about alcohol cessation and counselling around alcohol cessation. (3) Health literacy. Participants’ understanding of cirrhosis was variable. While the importance of knowledge was recognised, ‘what works for someone might not work for others’. Several patients partnered with their support persons and clinicians to bridge the health literacy gap. (4) Sources of support included family and friends, transport facilities, health professionals and peers. (5) Positive and negative aspects of communication and patient consultation were discussed. (6) Psychosocial counselling to ‘look after the caring side’. The need for more mental health care services was raised. Conclusion: Barriers related to poor health literacy, stigma and lack of practical and emotional support, and issues with communication and patient consultation, may lead to inequitable access to cirrhosis care and treatment for Indigenous Australians. Relevance to clinical practice: Gaining knowledge of the experiences of Indigenous Australians with cirrhosis is important for providing patient-centred and culturally appropriate care. Liver specialist nurses have an important role in bridging the health literacy gap and in supporting Indigenous patients and families. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - As psychiatrists, we found the article, 'Overcoming telemental health disparities during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic' [1] thought-provoking. According to this article, the steady rise in mental health conditions such as depressive disorder, trauma- or stressor-related disorder and substance use related to the pandemic has been recorded in national surveys. This reminds us of a document released by the Chinese government in November last year [2], which proposed for the first time that depression screening should be included in the physical examination of students. Under the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, students' mental health has become a global hot topic, so this document has aroused extensive discussion in society as soon as it was published. However, as the label of depression may cause discrimination, this document has also caused many people's doubts. © 2022 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two parallel processes structure American politics in the current moment: partisan polarization and the increasing linkage between racial attitudes and issue preferences of all sorts. We develop a novel theory that roots these two trends in historical changes in party coalitions. Changing racial compositions of the two major parties led to the formation of racialized images about Democrats and Republicans in people's minds - and these images now structure Americans' partisan loyalties and policy preferences. We test this theory in three empirical studies. First, using the American National Election Studies we trace the growing racial gap in party coalitions as well as the increasing overlap between racial and partisan affect. Then, in two original survey studies we directly measure race-party schemas and explore their political consequences. We demonstrate that race-party schemas are linked to partisan affect and issue preferences - with clear implications for the recent developments in U.S. politics. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Since the 1990s, working-class Irish hip hop MCs have criticised the Irish social welfare system through their rap lyrics. Like most global hip hop, Irish rap uses oppositional politics to offset the stigmatising ideas of class that are propagated by the dominant classes in society, especially negative stereotypes surrounding social welfare recipients. Although not recognised within literary Irish Studies, these lyricists are producing working-class counter-narratives to classist anti-welfare sentiment in Irish society through their poetic lyrics. This article draws from Irish and international Hip Hop Studies scholarship to argue that Irish rap should be regarded as working-class Irish poetry that contains intrinsic literary and cultural value. Focusing on the work of a Louth-based hip hop group, TPM (Taxpayers’ Money), this article reads Irish rap as poetry. Using close textual analysis, I examine how TPM’s rap-poems use adversarial messages and working-class aesthetics to protest and critique anti-welfare hegemony in Ireland. © 2022 by Clodagh Heffernan.

AB  - Pathogen avoidance has been linked to biases against various groups of people, including ethnic outgroups. The present research explored how a non-hypothetical pathogen threat associated with a specific foreign ecology may differentially prompt biases against different ethnic groups. Two studies used an experimental design to examine how the salience of the COVID-19 threat (in early 2020, before COVID-19 was labeled a pandemic) affected perceptions of targets from different racial groups. Study 1 (N = 375; Prime Panels) found that participants in the COVID-19 threat condition, compared to those in the non-pathogen threat condition, perceived all social targets to be more contagious, with the effect being stronger for Asian targets relative to Latino, Black, and White targets. Study 2 (N = 167; undergraduate sample) found that participants in the COVID-19 threat condition, compared to those in the non-pathogen threat condition, were more likely to categorize Asian (but not Latino, Black, or White) targets as outgroup members in a modified minimal group paradigm. Data suggest that the patterns of biases prompted by pathogen avoidance may dynamically change depending on salient heuristic associations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The authors carry out a critical overview of the research on comics and the training of readers based on the analysis of the academic discourse generated around the subject of study. The research reviews the concomitances and intersections between comics and didactics of children's and youth literature. It reflects on the consequences, debates and prejudices that this interrelation has generated in relation to their academic and social status. Likewise, they rigorously examine the main problems that cross-sectional research on the comic strip, derived among others, from the complexity of its definition, its epistemological location and ascription to mass culture and the child receptor from the framework of reading and literary education.

AB  - Research on political apologies spans sociopolitical contexts and disciplines and methodological frameworks. In the rise of interest in political apologies, especially in light of ‘the age of apologies’, social psychologists strive to understand mechanisms of issuing, perception and evaluation of political apologies from many perspectives. This special issue aims to highlight the important role of social psychological theory in understanding political apologies and deepening knowledge in this field. The papers, which comprise the special issue, offer a detailed and comprehensive study of political apology, including both theoretical and methodological lens to enrich understanding of the topic. Concluding, all the papers of this special issue can be of interest in academics and researchers, as well as policy-makers and other stakeholders beyond academia. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

AB  - When studying change in urban infrastructure landscapes, technical, political, and aesthetical choices are often considered in isolation. Yet, large-scale infrastructures such as urban motorways are the crystallisation of design entanglements. The decisions taken by an engineer—to build an elevated highway instead of a tunnel, to erect soundproof walls, to destroy a church instead of a housing block—are the expression of technical knowledge, cultural prejudices, socio-political frameworks, and value-based opinions reframed as expertise. This paper will be focussing on the ‘social imagination’ of the designers, by calling for a recontextualisation of design choices within their professional and cultural discourses, practices and imaginaries in order to question these infrastructural artefacts as socially produced. This paper will illustrate the relevance of applying a critical design framework to study infrastructure landscape change by focussing on the Boulevard Périphérique of Paris, and specifically on the emergence of noise from road traffic as nuisance. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - How do children in the U.S. represent the ideal society? A scientific understanding of how children engage in utopian thinking—and how their ideas relate to cross-cultural standards developed by the United Nations—is potentially useful for the development of social movements aimed at progressive social change. In this article we report the results of group projects created by 56 fifth-grade students (27 boys, 29 girls) in New York City who were instructed to work together in small groups to represent their ideal society of the future. We found that themes of economic prosperity and cultural sensitivity, especially the need to promote social and economic equality and to prevent discrimination and prejudice, were central to children's conceptions of the good society. On several major issues, the utopian societies that were proposed dovetailed with the sustainability development goals identified by the United Nations, especially ‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’, ‘Reduced Inequality’, and ‘Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions’. The children were acutely aware of the need for environmental protection and climate action but understandably lacked a clear sense of how to provide ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’ and ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’ in their ideal societies. © 2022 National Children's Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In many ways the school music curriculum has become increasingly diverse since the 1970s. For example, ‘pop’ and ‘world’ musics have been listed in UK curricula and syllabuses with an aim of becoming more inclusive. However, this article argues that such approaches to curriculum as content have confounded social justice in school music, and in particular when perpetuating a prejudicial discourse. To understand this discourse, three ‘distortions’ of the material nature of musical knowledge are explored as potential sources of ongoing student alienation from school music: reification, hegemonic appropriation and the loss of meaning. These distortions are also exemplified through a case study critique of social realism and the UK government’s Model Music Curriculum. By way of conclusion, and as a possible resolution to the distortions, some characteristics of a curriculum as process are proposed that have implications for decolonisation and wider issues of social justice, such as class and gender. © 2022, Chris Philpott.

AB  - Compared to other groups, relatively less research has specifically addressed the retention of Latinx students in STEM disciplines. These students face many negative stereotypes about their group, especially related to their academic success, yet there is limited research regarding how microaggressions, subtle or ambiguous discriminatory behaviors, targeting Latinx students in engineering education settings impact their experience in those programs. Guided by Sue’s definitions and taxonomy of microaggressions, Critical Race Theory and Latino Critical Theory, the purpose of the current study was to answer the following research questions: 1) What microaggressions do Latinx engineering undergraduates experience in an engineering education environment? and 2) How do these microaggressions impact Latinx engineering undergraduates’ academic well-being, as defined by their academic self-efficacy and academic performance? © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in “moving beyond the individual” to measure area-level racism as a social determinant of health. Much of this work has aggregated racial prejudice data collected at the individual-level to the area-level. Objective: As this is a rapidly emerging area of research, we conducted a systematic literature review to describe evidence of the relationship between area-level racial prejudice and health, whether results differed by race/ethnicity, and to characterize key conceptual and methodological considerations to guide future research. Method: We searched four interdisciplinary databases for US-based, peer-reviewed articles measuring area level racial prejudice by aggregating individual-level indicators of racial prejudice and examining associations with mental or physical health outcome (s). Data extraction followed PRISMA guidelines and also included theory and conceptualization, pathways to health, and strengths and limitations. Results: Fourteen of 14,632 identified articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Health outcomes spanned all-cause (n = 4) and cause-specific (n = 4) mortality, birth outcomes (n = 4), cardiovascular outcomes (n = 2), mental health (n = 1), and self-rated health (n = 1). All studies found a positive association between area-level racial prejudice and adverse health outcomes among racial/ethnic minoritized groups, with four studies also showing a similar association among Whites. Engagement with formal theory was limited and exposure conceptualization was mixed. Methodological considerations included unmeasured confounding and trade-offs between generalizability, self-censorship, and specificity of measurement. Conclusions: Future research should continue to develop the conceptual and methodological rigor of this work and test hypotheses to inform evidence-based interventions to advance population health and reduce racial health inequities. © 2022.

AB  - Tensions between religious freedoms and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) rights have evolved from debates about sinful deviance to competing equality claims. There is a growing debate, originally in the US, but emerging in the UK, about whether religious social workers, particularly those holding fundamentalist Christian beliefs, can deliver affirmative, anti-oppressive services to LGBTQ people. This is important because over two-fifths of social workers identify as Christian and almost a quarter of UK charities, including those running community and residential care services for older people, are religious organisations. These concerns have been highlighted in a recent judicial review involving a social work student, Felix Ngole, who was expelled by the University of Sheffield for making homophobic comments on his Facebook page. The Court of Appeal ruled the University’s decision was procedurally flawed and had conflated religious prejudice with discrimination. This paper considers 70 online responses to a Community Care article written by Ngole, which highlight divided opinions within the social work profession. It critically interrogates, within regulatory contexts, whether it is possible to be both deeply opposed to LGBTQ people’s lives and yet work affirmatively and anti-oppressively with them. An urgent research agenda is proposed. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: This study explored the impact of sexual orientation and cultural context on the way lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), and heterosexual cisgender adults without children from Portugal, Israel, and the UK anticipate the parenting experience. Higher levels of parenthood aspirations (e.g., desires and intentions) and more positive perceptions of the parenting experience (e.g., emotional enrichment upon having children) have been reported among heterosexual individuals than LGB ones and more so in familistic societies than in individualistic ones. However, perceptions of the parenting experience have rarely been examined across different cultural contexts. Methods: One-hundred and sixty-eight adults without children (57 self-reported as LGB) in Portugal were matched on sociodemographic variables with 168 participants from the UK and 168 participants from Israel, resulting in a convenience sample of N = 504 (heterosexual: n = 333, Mage = 27.48, SD = 5.47; LGB: n = 171, Mage = 29.77, SD = 7.12). Results: Overall, participants from Israel and Portugal, as well as heterosexual participants in general, perceived parenting in a more positive way than either their counterparts in the UK or LGB participants, respectively. Parallel patterns also appeared separately for LGB and heterosexual participants, with higher levels of social support and lower levels of stigma anticipated in both Portugal and Israel than the UK. Conclusions: Both sexual orientation and the socio-cultural context are associated with parenting perceptions. However, the effect of the cultural context seems to surmount that of sexual orientation, with both LGB and heterosexual individuals from more familistic countries anticipating parenthood in a more positive way, than their peers from the UK. Policy Implications: Repercussions of the findings include consideration of the needs of prospective LGB parents in terms of social support, culturally competent and affirmative interventions regarding LGB parenthood, and policies targeting prejudice and counteracting heteronormativity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The ontologization process involves the use of social representation relating to the human–animal binary to classify ingroup and outgroup members. To date, no study has investigated the multidimensional nature (i.e. human, animal and automata) of the ontologizing process via structural equation modelling (SEM). Four hundred and twenty-one Italian participants were asked to attribute 24 positive/negative, human/animal/automata associates to each of three target groups: typical Roma/Chinese/Italian. Results showed that the proposed six-factor model (i.e. positive/negative, human/animal/automata essence) was statistically robust for each of the three groups. The Roma group was animalized by attributing more animal negative associates than any other target group, whereas the Chinese group was mainly given a robot positive essence. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Peaceful coexistence and trade among human groups can be fragile and intergroup relations frequently transition to violent exchange and conflict. Herewe specify how exogenous changes in groups environment and ensuing carrying-capacity stress can increase individual participation in intergroup conflict, and out-group aggression in particular. In two intergroup contest experiments, individuals could contribute private resources to out-group aggression (versus in-group defense). Environmental unpredictability, induced by making non-invested resources subject to risk of destruction (versus not), created psychological stress and increased participation in and coordination of out-group attacks. Archival analyses of interstate conflicts showed, likewise, that sovereign states engage in revisionist warfare more when their pre-conflict economic and climatic environmentwere more volatile and unpredictable. Given that participation in conflict is wasteful, environmental unpredictability not only made groups more often victorious but also less wealthy. Macro-level changes in the natural and economic environment can be a root cause of out-group aggression and turn benign intergroup relations violent. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

AB  - Although uniquely destructive and wasteful, intergroup conflict and warfare are not confined to humans. They are seen across a range of group-living species, from social insects, fishes and birds to mammals, including nonhuman primates. With its unique collection of theory, research and review contributions from biology, anthropology and economics, this theme issue provides novel insights into intergroup conflict across taxa. Here, we introduce and organize this theme issue on the origins and consequences of intergroup conflict. We provide a coherent framework by modelling intergroup conflicts as multi-level games of strategy in which individuals within groups cooperate to compete with (individuals in) other groups for scarce resources, such as territory, food, mating opportunities, power and influence. Within this framework, we identify cross-species mechanisms and consequences of (participating in) intergroup conflict. We conclude by highlighting crosscutting innovations in the study of intergroup conflict set forth by individual contributions. These include, among others, insights on how within-group heterogeneities and leadership relate to group conflict, how intergroup conflict shapes social organization and how climate change and environmental degradation transition intergroup relations from peaceful coexistence to violent conflict. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

AB  - Humans often favour ingroup members over others, a bias that drives discrimination and intergroup conflicts. Hostile relations between groups and homogeneity within groups may affect such ingroup bias. In an experiment with members of three natural groups in Ethiopia, we vary intergroup relations (neutral versus enmity) and exploit the natural variation in the homogeneity of groups (homogeneous versus heterogeneous) to identify their effect on in-and outgroup concerns. We find that ingroup bias largely manifests as positive concern for ingroupmembers combined with no concern for outgroup members. Enmity has no effect on ingroup bias, whereas ingroup concern is amplified in homogeneous groups. Group homogeneity, thus, is the primary driver of concerns for others in our study s context. Our results are relevant to understanding the consequences of exclusionary group identities. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Though popular culture is celebrated among people across the country, the admiration for folklore and performing arts is very limited. In the domain of folklore, performing art forms are categorized and stratified based on ‘who is performing it’ or ‘who is eligible to perform’ with a benchmark of the social status of purity and pollution. This article discusses and reflects the dilution of casteism and fabricated caste identities and prejudices in oppari, ancient folklore and a musical dirge song performed in Tamil Nadu, which is considered as a polluted, discriminated cultural outcome and custom to be performed and etched with people belonging to oppressed classes in society. It also keeps a close lens and discussion on change in oppari, the role of casteism and its revamp in the contemporary scenario and sociocultural aspects of oppari within the realm of caste and performance. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - Previous work has reported a relation between pathogen-avoidance motivations and prejudice toward various social groups, including gay men and lesbian women. It is currently unknown whether this association is present across cultures, or specific to North America. Analyses of survey data from adult heterosexuals (N = 11,200) from 31 countries showed a small relation between pathogen disgust sensitivity (an individual-difference measure of pathogen-avoidance motivations) and measures of antigay attitudes. Analyses also showed that pathogen disgust sensitivity relates not only to antipathy toward gay men and lesbians, but also to negativity toward other groups, in particular those associated with violations of traditional sexual norms (e.g., prostitutes). These results suggest that the association between pathogen-avoidance motivations and antigay attitudes is relatively stable across cultures and is a manifestation of a more general relation between pathogen-avoidance motivations and prejudice towards groups associated with sexual norm violations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - At the height of the Exclusion Crisis, an annual ‘solemn mock procession’ of the pope marched ‘through the City of London’ to a large bonfire into which an effigy of the pope was dumped. These processions took place on the accession day of Elizabeth I. They reportedly attracted as many as two hundred thousand spectators. This article reads these processions through the lens of civic ceremony, taking the performance of civic identity on the streets of London as the foundation of the threatening power of these cultural events. It demonstrates the significance of the trajectory of the march to Temple Bar, marking London’s boundary with Westminster and the court. This article also analyses the satiric broadside engravings that bolster the credibility of the processions’ central claim: that Englishness and Protestantism were inseparable and united against the foreign threat of Catholicism. With a variety of contemporary witnesses, this article challenges the claims that Protestantism had a united front at the time or that the purported statue of Elizabeth at Temple Bar was even a likeness of her. Working with the vocabulary of civic ceremony, the ‘Solemn Mock Processions’ of the Pope revive an old prejudice to coerce a unified national identity based on the exclusion of religious others. © The London Journal Trust 2021.

AB  - Existing studies of the multi-group dynamics of prejudiced societies focus on the social-psychological knowledge behind the relevant processes. We instead create a multi-agent framework that simulates the propagation of prejudice and measures its tangible impact on prosperity. Levels of prosperity are tracked for individuals as well as larger social structures including groups and factions. We model social interactions using the Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma (CPD) and a new agent type called a prejudiced agent. Our simulations show that even modeling prejudice as an exclusively out-group phenomenon nonetheless generates implicit in-group promotion, leading to higher relative prosperity of a prejudiced population. This skew in prosperity is seen to be correlated to factors such as size difference between groups, and the fraction of prejudiced agents in a group. Our model is a step towards a deeper understanding of the origins, propagation, and ramifications of prejudice through simulative studies grounded in apt theoretical backgrounds. © 2022 The Operational Research Society.

AB  - A central tenet of the health professions is that of equitable access to health care. However, disparities in equitable healthcare provision continues to be a challenge in many societies due to prejudices against the LGBTQ community. This study was aimed at exploring the attitudes of medical students toward LGBTQ patients in Malaysia. A qualitative approach was adopted to seek depth of understanding of clinical year medical students’ perceptions and attitudes toward LGBTQ patients. Data were collected in 2018 through individual interviews and focus group discussions with a total of 29 participants, using a semi-structured question guideline. Purposive sampling comprised representation from the three major ethnic groups in Malaysia. Thematic analysis using NVivo highlighted three main themes i.e., neutrality, in compliance with the Professional Code of Conduct; implicit biases and tolerance of an Odd Identity; explicit biases with prejudices and stereotyping. The lack of knowledge and understanding of the nature and issues of sexuality is problematic as found in this study. They are primarily biases and prejudices projected onto marginalized LGBTQ patients who must contend with multiple jeopardies in conservative societies such as in Malaysia. With some state policies framed around Islam the concern is with the belief among Malay/Islamic students for LGBTQ individuals to go through conversion ‘therapies’ to become cisgender and heterosexual. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A primary through-line of the research literature on the correlates of structural diversity in education has focused on intergroup outcomes, including prejudice reduction and improving attitudes toward racial and ethnic out-groups. Over the past two decades, advances in theory have illustrated how individuals may cognitively adapt to ongoing interactions with diverse others, informing new investigations into the potentially beneficial effects of educational diversity for individual development outside the intergroup context and beyond the impacts of more equitable resource distribution. The current article summarizes the state of research on links between children and youth’s experiences in racially and ethnically diverse schools and classrooms and their individual development in academic, social-emotional, and executive function domains. Overall, the emerging research on these individual effects is promising. Implications within the context of increasing support for school choice are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The expression of prejudice has mutated over the last century, and most Western countries now legally support equality. However, for ethnic minorities, work discrimination is one of the most evident challenges they have to face. Three preregistered experiments, with an overall sample of 1,507 participants, analyzed the effect of a job applicant’s ethnicity and other characteristics (e.g., gender, attractiveness), which were manipulated with a CV, as well as possible moderator variables (tolerance and racism), on participants’ judgments about the candidate: stereotypes (competence, sociability, morality, and immorality); emotions (admiration, contempt, compassion, and envy); and active and passive facilitation tendencies at work. The results indicated that tolerance and racism modulated the effect of ethnicity on the dependent variables in an administrative occupation (Studies 1 and 2) and in the hostelry industry (Study 3). A pooled analysis revealed that egalitarian participants (high tolerance or low racism) reported an unexpected positive bias toward a Moroccan candidate compared to a Spanish candidate. Non-egalitarian participants (low tolerance or high racism) showed the expected ingroup bias only for (im)morality: they perceived Moroccan applicants as less moral and more immoral than Spanish candidates. Studies 2 and 3 confirmed that the Moroccan candidate was perceived as less prototypical of his/her category than the Spanish applicant was. We discussed the primacy of (im)morality in social perception as well as the relevance of distinguishing between egalitarian and non-egalitarian people when trying to understand the complexity of new expressions of prejudice and to identify strategies to avoid discrimination in the workplace. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is most common chronic disease among male population. Symptoms that appear due to benign prostate enlargement significantly influence patients` quality of life, activities, and psychosocial behaviour. The aim of this study is to evaluate the affection of psychosocial factors on diagnosis and treatment of the patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) so a new insight on morbidity and treatment can be reached. The expression of the lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH is scored through International Prostate Scoring System (IPSS). We have made a prospective analysis of patients who are looking for urologist opinion for the first time; we quantified their symptoms with IPSS questionnaire and gathered information about patients` social status. Out of 89 patients with BPH symptoms, 47 come from rural areas and lower social status, although other 42 come from bigger cities. Patients from rural areas expressed more severe symptoms due to the longer time from the beginning of the symptoms to the time they seek for specialist opinion. Reasons are patients` habits, more expressed prejudices in accepting the disease and patients` lower education. Organising campaigns for raising the awareness of the patients with BPH symptoms will result with lower morbidity of these patients living in the smaller municipalities. © 2022, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Background: Stereotypes are oversimplified beliefs about groups of people. Social psychology concepts and theories describing ethnicity-related stereotypes are well reported in non-medical educational settings. In contrast, the full impact of stereotyping on medical students, and the extent to which they were represented in health professions education (HPE) is less well-described. Using the lens of social psychological theory, this review aimed to describe ethnicity-related stereotypes about medical students portrayed in HPE literature and the impacts of those stereotypes. Methods: A critical narrative approach was undertaken. Social psychology concepts and theories were used as a framework through which to review the impacts of ethnicity-related stereotypes on medical students as described in HPE literature. A database search of Ovid MEDLINE, JSTOR, Project Muse, and PsychINFO was conducted to identify both theoretical and empirical articles relating to this topic in the HPE literature. Data was synthesised using thematic analysis, giving particular care to appraise the evidence from perspectives in social psychology. Findings: In HPE, the experiences and impact of stereotyping on learners from minority ethnic groups was explained by social psychology concepts such as stereotype threat, stereotype reactance, attributional ambiguity, self-fulfilling prophecy, stereotype boost, stereotype lift, and stereotype masking. Stereotype boost and stereotype lift were particularly described among students who identified as White, whereas stereotype threat was described more commonly among students from minority ethnics groups. The impact of stereotyping is not just on assessment, but may be across all teaching and learning activities at medical school. Interpretation: Social psychology concepts and theories can be used to describe the experience and impact of ethnicity-related stereotypes in HPE. Educators can better support learners from minority ethnic groups by self-reflecting over assumptions about individuals from minority ethnic groups, as well as minimise the impact of stereotyping and bias to create more inclusive learning environments. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In post-conflict societies marked by strong negative stereotypes or delicate and sometimes unstable political contexts, teaching both knowledge and understanding of conflicting historical narratives has become a matter of educational urgency. Conversely, a framework for effective teacher training that prepares teachers to activate and facilitate the exchange of multiple perspectives has yet to be identified. This qualitative and exploratory research aims to answer the questions, what boundaries do expert teacher trainers believe that teachers in post-conflict societies encounter when brokering multiple perspectives in the classroom? Which teaching or training methods can teacher trainers use to help teachers reduce the impact of these boundaries? To advance the use of multiperspectivity in post-conflict history education and enhance history-teacher training design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve experts in history-teacher training to answer these questions. The expert’s statements were openly and axially coded using Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) Ecological Systems Theory as an analytical lens. Identifying ten personal or environmental boundaries to brokering multiperspectivity in the classroom, and two training approaches to help teachers establish continuity between their multiperspectivity training and day-to-day teaching practices. Further providing actionable recommendations for educators, non-governmental organizations, and educational scientists. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - How do disasters affect intergroup peace and conflict? Existing research shows that disasters can have opposing effects on how we perceive others: they can exacerbate existing tension in some cases or serve as catalysts for peace and cooperation in others. Yet we know little about the conditions under which we should expect one or the other. In this study, we estimate the impact of disasters on perceptions of out-groups. We combine a dataset of mass disasters with tens of thousands of individual-level survey responses recorded in Round 6 of the Afrobarometer data between 2014 and 2015. Using a difference-in-differences approach exploiting spatial and temporal proximity to disaster occurrences, we estimate the degree to which disasters affect public opinion toward out-groups. As disaster occurrence is plausibly exogenous to interview dates or respondent locations, our approach allows for an improved test of how the shock from disaster can impact public perceptions. Moreover, we show such impact varies by considering the differences in political salience of out-group identities and short- versus long-term differences in the impact on group dynamics. The implications of our findings for understanding the aftermath of past disasters and effects of future disasters on intergroup peace and conflict are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Prejudices tend to come as a package deal; people who are more racist tend to also be more sexist, and so on. Documentations of such attitudinal patterns–generalised prejudice–have a rich history, but the theoretical understanding thereof has been lagging. In recent years, we have seen clear theoretical advancement in the understanding of this phenomenon. We discuss classic premises in this research along with newer research that challenges some of the most ingrained ideas about generalised prejudice. For instance, we discuss research challenging the notions that generalised prejudice is an “us” versus “them” phenomenon, as well as a product of conservative ideology. We further argue that prejudice generalisations need to be studied at different levels of abstraction. Finally, we propose integrative perspectives on generalised and target-specific prejudice, with greater emphasis on processes of generalisation, rather than static generalised prejudice factors. © 2022 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - The increasing consumer demand for shopping eco-friendly products online leads brands and marketers to offer more products that are claimed to be eco-friendly on online stores. However, it is very difficult for consumers to evaluate the credibility of such claims, and marketers usually do not offer resources to help consumers make the evaluation. Hence, consumers must utilize limited information cues (e.g. country-of-origin, price, etc.) that are available to them to evaluate the credibility of green claims and the greenness of products. Two online experiments were conducted to examine how product COO, product price, and product types affect consumer perception of product greenness and green claim credibility. The findings suggest that product COO is a powerful factor that influences consumer perception. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings were discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Dominant social groups describe favelas based on negative stereotypes, which are increasingly being challenged by various collective actors. Originating from a collaborative effort carried out by academics and favela residents, the Marielle Franco Favela Dictionary is an online platform that aims to spread alternative narratives regarding these territories and their populations through collective knowledge building. This article discusses the common ground and points of contention regarding the different forms of knowledge held by academics, activists, and favela residents. Furthermore, we reconstruct the trajectory of the Dictionary’s creation, and in so doing overcome certain tensions and incorporate other languages and registers able to support the production of memory in favelas. © 2022

AB  - Background: This paper describes findings from research conducted on students who participated in a service-learning course in South Africa. Objective: The study aimed to understand how participants constructed their experiences of service-learning and to interrogate their emotional investments in these constructions. Method: Data were collected and analyzed using a psychosocial methodology, consisting of discursive and psychoanalytic readings of interview transcripts, reflective journal entries, and researcher field notes. Results: The discursive findings focus on how participants employed liberal traditional learning discourses to construct service-learning as linear resulting in subject positions that reinforced prejudices and the power structures supporting these. A psychoanalytic reading of the data suggests that participants invested in these constructions to defend against their own anxiety related to uncertainty and guilt about privilege in an unfamiliar context. Conclusion: Students invest in liberal traditional discourses of service-learning for defensive reasons, which can be understood as arising from the intersubjective and social context in which the service-learning takes place. Teaching Implications: Recognizing prejudice as emanating from anxiety generated by the affective work required for service-learning means thinking creatively about how to both contain and allow this affective work to take place in service-learning activities. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This article examines how Palestinians' intergroup contact experiences relate to their attitudes towards interactions with Israelis (i.e., normalization). We draw on four recent advances in intergroup contact literature. First, recent research indicates that positive contact can impede disadvantaged groups' motivation to challenge inequalities. Second, increased endorsement of normalization mediates this sedative effect of positive contact on motivation to resist in the West Bank. Third, negative contact has been related to increased motivation for social change. Fourth, institutions and societal norms shape the meaning of intergroup contact and its effect on intergroup relations. We hypothesize that negative experiences at checkpoints can act as reminders of institutionalized inequalities and thus attenuate sedative effects. Furthermore, we explore the contextual boundary conditions of such reminder effects. Analyses of cross-sectional survey conducted among a representative sample (N = 1,000) in the West Bank including Jerusalem showed that (1) positive intergroup contact related to normalization endorsement (sedative effect), (2) negative intergroup contact related to decreased normalization endorsement (mobilizing effect), and (3) negative contact experiences (at checkpoints) canceled out the effect of positive contact (reminder effect), but only in Jerusalem. Results suggest that the impacts of intergroup contact need to be interpreted in light of institutionalized forms of group inequality and segregation. © 2022 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - background In France, despite fear-based communication by the authorities and the media, vaccination against COVID-19 has received little support from the population. For a young population often convinced that severe forms of the disease affect older people, we hypothesized that communication based on the idea of love would be more effective than communication based on fear of vaccination. participants and procedure In a convenience online French sample (N = 480, Mage = 19.4), vaccination intention was asked after fear priming, love priming, no love/prejudice priming, or a control condition. Participants also reported their fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and the recommendation they would make regarding vaccination of a loved/unloved person. results Vaccination intention was higher in the love condition than in the fear and no love/prejudice conditions. Surprisingly, fear of vaccination was lower in participants who were presented with fear-inducing questions. conclusions Implications of these results are discussed in relation to the fear of vaccination and the transpersonal value of the idea of love. The results suggest that COVID-19 is experienced as a threat both to oneself and to those one loves most. Therefore, calls for fear in the media and on social networks seem less likely to motivate a young population to vaccinate than the reminder of intense emotional ties to loved ones. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - When is the expression of prejudice seen as authentic? Perceived authenticity refers to how much one judges another’s behavior to reflect the beliefs, attitudes, goals, and desires of that person. We investigate whether perceived authenticity can operate as a vicarious justification for prejudice—a way for prejudiced people to defend the prejudiced statements of others. In six studies, prejudice was positively related to perceived authenticity of similarly prejudiced statements: People are more likely to label prejudiced statements they agree with as authentic. We develop a vicarious justification account of “authentic prejudice.” People need not justify what is socially acceptable; if authenticity serves as a justification for prejudice, it will be reported only when the prejudice is nonnormative. Three studies demonstrate that the positive relationship between prejudice and perceived authenticity is heightened when the expressed prejudice is seen as unacceptable. People call “authentic” what they agree with but feel they cannot express. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have been the longstanding targets of racism and discrimination in Australia. This paper presents the findings of a systematic literature review designed to identify and synthesise the available evidence exploring these intergroup attitudes, and the factors that correlate with them. Method: Searches were conducted in Medline, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, ProQuest Psychology Database and PsycINFO databases. Eligible studies were required to measure attitudes of non-Indigenous Australians towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Results: Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria (n = 2,958). The results outlined: (a) the prevalence of negative attitudes, (b) attitudes were most commonly conceptualised as modern racism, and (c) that there are a range of factors that are associated with negativity towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Conclusions: The review outlined the relationship between attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and demographic, ideological, individual differences, and intergroup factors. This review highlights the need for continued research in this domain to inform appropriate prejudice reduction strategies. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples face continued adversity, prejudice, and discrimination on their own land. This heightened propensity to be targeted for prejudice is a known social determinant of poorer health and wellbeing. Understanding racial attitudes towards this group is an imperative step in understanding and combating this health disparity. What this topic adds: There is a paucity of academic research exploring negativity towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples The limited quantity of evidence does establish a range of correlates with negative attitudes that can be clustered into four themes–demographic factors, ideological variables, individual differences factors, and intergroup factors. More research is warranted in this domain to further establish a body of evidence on intergroup attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, with a renewed focus needed on prejudice reduction techniques. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This essay argues that prediction markets, as one approach for aggregating dispersed private information, may not only be praised for their epistemic accuracy. They also feature characteristics that are morally desirable from the point of view of epistemic justice. Notably, they are a promising approach when we are trying to address testimonial injustice. The impersonality of market transactions effectively tackles the issue of identity prejudice, which underlies many forms of testimonial injustice. This is not to say that prediction markets do not pose challenges for epistemic justice of their own like the risk of excluding knowers based on ability to pay. Or, in light of identity prejudice’s systematicity, the risk of discouraging some knowers because of differences in education or social background that lead to a certain unease when faced with prediction markets. The essay discusses these challenges, concedes limitations but also offers countermeasures to certain worries–e.g. hosting prediction markets on a play-money basis. Throughout, the essay addresses the question of the potential scope of using prediction markets for epistemic purposes, notably by means of the practical example of a prediction market for monetary policy. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Decolonising academia has gained much traction in some global north and global south countries over the last few years, resulting in initiatives such as decolonising the curricula. However, the terrorism industry as a whole has so far escaped such calls. The industry has a long and deep relationship with global north countries, such as the US. The industry produces a range of surveillance and military technologies and knowledge on political violence. The knowledge is often used to develop counter-terrorism strategies that are used as part of global north democratising projects to ensure that global north neo-liberal, political and cultural ideals are the future for global south countries, making them manageable. Therefore, an important question needs to be posed, which is, can terrorism studies be decolonised? I believe that terrorism studies can be decolonised but only by developing decolonial terrorism studies. However, I am aware that some governments and terrorism scholars, institutions, NGOs and the military and tech industrial complex may be against this idea for prejudicial, political, economic and epistemic reasons. Others may favour “friendly” decolonization, as a way to maintain existing power structures, control and epistemic direction of terrorism studies. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - We propose genetic social psychology as a theoretical framework to render intelligible both the suppression of the expression of prejudice and prejudice reduction in childhood. In particular, we explore the role of positive in-group norms in prejudice reduction in childhood and adolescence and their interplay with realistic and symbolic threats and subgroup identification in the post-conflict setting of Cyprus in a sample of 303 (51.5% female) 7–12-year-old students (mean age = 8.73 SD = 1.58) and 387 (60.2% female) 12–17-year-old students (mean age = 14.24 SD = 1.45) collected from a random sample of thirty-nine schools in the Greek Cypriot community. The following hypotheses were tested (a) threats and social identification will form a closer link with prejudice in older than younger children (H1), (b) positive in-group norms will “trump” threats in relation to the expression of prejudice in older children (H2), (c) strength of identification would enhance the effect of positive in-group norms in the expression of non-prejudicial views (H3), and finally (d) strength of identification would enhance the impact of positive norms on prejudice reduction in childhood, through a deeper conversion process of threat reduction, whereas on the contrary, it will diminish their impact in adolescence through ideological resistance (H4). We found broad support for our hypotheses and discuss practical implications of the findings for education. © 2022, Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida.

AB  - To understand how stigmatization of people diagnosed with a mental disorder occurs in secondary mental healthcare staff in mental healthcare centers in Chile was the objective of the study. A descriptive qualitative and interpretative design with an ethnographic approach was used. Participants' observations, ethnographic, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals at three secondary mental health centers. Qualitative descriptive and interpretative content analysis was used. Stigmatization of users is shaping up in their trajectory in the health center. Identity changes from person to “patient,” which generates dependence on the expert role of healthcare professionals. Stigma is expressed in the interactions between a health institution, a professional team, and a user, reproducing power and control relationships associated with the biomedical model and reinforcing a cycle of chronification in the user. Health teams are stressed by discrepancies between the current mental health policy and the user's biomedical understanding. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - AI systems are increasingly deployed in both public and private sectors to independently make complicated decisions with far-reaching impact on individuals and the society. However, many AI algorithms are biased in the collection or processing of data, resulting in prejudiced decisions based on demographic features. Algorithmic biases occur because of the training data fed into the AI system or the design of algorithmic models. While most legal scholars propose a direct-regulation approach associated with right of explanation or transparency obligation, this article provides a different picture regarding how indirect regulation can be used to regulate algorithmic bias based on the New Chicago School framework developed by Lawrence Lessig. This article concludes that an effective regulatory approach toward algorithmic bias will be the right mixture of direct and indirect regulations through architecture, norms, market, and the law. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The author provides an insider view of women directors' selections on corporate boards from the empirical setting of India and find if the recruitment practices in this space discriminate against women. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected data from a diverse cohort of 27 directors through semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed by applying an interpretative inductive approach and using the software NVivo's 12-plus version. Findings: The author’s findings show that board recruiters present different selection criteria and processes to women candidates depending upon heterogeneity among candidates' professional standing. Recruiters view women directors as a diverse cohort and value resourceful and experienced women when making recruitment decisions; these women directors are also found influencing directors' selection processes. Originality/value: The results question the underlying assumptions of prejudice against women as posited by the feminist and social identity theorists without accounting for the heterogeneity among women and situations. By proposing the female-gender stereotyping deactivation theory in top leadership matters, such as board selections, the author argues that stereotyping becomes irrelevant in the strategic decisions of board selections. This new theorisation about women's access to leadership roles will help the cause of women empowerment both at a cognitive and practical level. Future researchers can test the gender deactivation theory among women leaders in diverse cultural contexts by looking at the intra-cohort differences among women leaders. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Residential segregation, especially of rural migrants, is of growing concern in China. A key question is whether this spatial separation is entirely due to income – rural migrants priced out of affluent areas – or whether other factors, such as institutional discrimination or social prejudice or homophily, are also at work. We employ state-of-the-art methods to yield a more detailed and nuanced picture of segregation in Shijiazhuang, a second-tier Chinese city. We use a multilevel modelling approach that allows us not only to quantify the extent of segregation at different spatial scales, but also to disentangle the intersectional nature of segregation: the extent to which segregation is due to migrant status or low income alone. We find that migrant status is actually more important than occupation in determining segregation. These findings emphasise the imperative to decompose intersectional segregation into its constituent parts, a task recently made possible by developments in multilevel modelling. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2022.

AB  - The value of intercultural music learning on intergroup attitudes has been demonstrated in the literature, such as enhancing intercultural sensitivity and building interethnic friendships. However, the process by which intercultural music learning influences intergroup attitudes has not yet been illuminated. This study investigated the impact of an intercultural music course on intergroup attitudes among middle school students (N = 277) from Yi, Han, Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups in a multi-ethnic school in Sichuan province, southwest China. The research tools included questionnaire surveys, reflective journals, semi-structured interviews and observational field notes. The findings revealed that the intercultural music course significantly improved the students’ intergroup attitudes compared with the regular and non-music courses. The findings further identified six process dimensions that helped capture the gradual changes in students’ attitudes towards other groups as well as the cumulative nature of the effects of intercultural music learning. This study sheds light on approaches to using music to learn about, communicate with and appreciate other cultures. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The field of public administration has long resisted admitting an uncomfortable truth. Public administrattion is culpable in creating and maintaining racist, white supremacist policies and institutions through which Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color disproportionately experience prejudice and discrimination and, therefore, inequities and injustices throughout public services and society. However, few have been willing to have this difficult conversation. This Dialogue symposium seeks to contribute to this conversation, and this introduction both previews pieces in the symposium while also adding context to key concepts and discussions. © 2022 Public Administration Theory Network.

AB  - Colourism – skin shade prejudice – is a social justice issue for People of Colour globally. Yet, there has been no major sociological study that explores colourism in the UK. Addressing this gap, we draw on nine in-depth qualitative interviews with Black and Mixed-Race heterosexual men living in England that formed part of a larger study of colourism. Using reflexive thematic analysis through an intersectional feminist lens, we argue that colourism is gendered. We found that Black men both experience colourism and perpetuate it by teasing male peers and favouring women with light skin. Our analysis generated three themes: (1) navigating colourism as part of growing up; (2) skin shade paradoxes for Black and Mixed-Race men; and (3) colourism and desirability through the Black male gaze. This research provides a nuanced exploration of colourism from Black and Mixed-Race men’s perspectives. It underscores the significance of colourism in the UK. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - How does implicit bias contribute to explicit prejudice? Prior experiments show that concept knowledge about fear versus sympathy determines whether negative affect (captured as implicit bias) predicts antisocial outcomes (Lee et al.). Concept knowledge (i.e., beliefs) about groups may similarly moderate the link between implicitly measured negative affect (implicit negative affect) and explicit prejudice. We tested this hypothesis using data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2008 Time Series Study (Study 1) and Project Implicit (Study 2). In both studies, participants high in implicit negative affect reported more explicit prejudice if they possessed negative beliefs about Black Americans. Yet, participants high in implicit negative affect reported less explicit prejudice if they possessed fewer negative beliefs about Black Americans. The results are consistent with psychological constructionist and dynamic models of evaluation and offer a more ecologically valid extension of our past laboratory work. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Background: Families of critically ill patients and their healthcare team must make life and death decisions together. Ideally, intensive care unit team members collaborate in the support of patients and families as goals of care are clarified and care plans are created. Few interventions exist to improve collaboration around this process. Team-based communication skills training about goals-of-care conversations represents one promising intervention. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a communication skills training workshop on coordination and collaboration among ICU team members. Design: Participants from a single institution completed surveys immediately before and six months after completion of the workshop. All participants, including nurses, physicians, social workers, and chaplains, completed a goals-of-care Relational Coordination survey. Nurses and physicians completed a Jefferson Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Nurse Collaboration (JSAPNC) survey. Results: Thirty-six participants were enrolled in three workshops. Seventeen and fifteen participants completed the relational coordination survey and JSAPNC respectively at both time points. The mean intergroup relational coordination index increased from 2.94 pre-intervention to 3.19 6-month post (P =.002, d=.89). Nurse relational coordination index ratings of all other groups increased from 2.84 pre-intervention to 3.08 6-month post (p =.004, d=1.23). Mean total scores on the JSAPNC survey did not change significantly from pre-intervention (53.8) to 6-month post (54.2, P =.45). Conclusion: Team-based communication skills training may improve ICU team relational coordination surrounding goals of care. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the assessment of attitudes about poverty used in nursing education considering the first Sustainable Development Goal targets. Tools assessing attitudes about poverty have been used in nursing education studies to examine the beliefs of nursing students. Design: An integrative literature review was carried out in five international databases in the areas of health and nursing and in four Latin American and Caribbean databases. Results: Four tools were identified, with Attitude Toward Poverty Short Form and Attitudes about Poverty and Poor People being the most used in the studies. Items from tools measured attitudes negative, prejudiced, and stigmatizing about the population living in poverty. In addition, items from tools measured a range of concepts from poverty to social inequality and disenfranchisement. Conclusion: The identification of poverty is a critical strategy for tackling poverty. In this sense, poverty assessment tools have the potential to recognize poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Bias among faculty search committees has been considered a significant barrier to diversifying the professoriate. Given the traditional faculty hierarchy in academia, junior faculty search chairs may not have the positional power to challenge authority when confronted with bias or prejudice. Yet, search chairs are expected to ensure equitable practices and outcomes in their searches. In response to this quandary, through the lens of role theory, this study examined how faculty roles, within the hierarchical structure of tenure, affected equity during the hiring process. Findings revealed that the faculty hierarchy often superseded decision-making power given to search chairs if they were junior faculty, often leading to implicit support of biased hiring practices and the perpetuation of a culture of Whiteness. The study also indicated that search chairs’ identities, values, and perceptions influenced how they operationalized diversity and equity in the search process, contributing to either diversity advocacy or support of the status quo. This qualitative inquiry makes an important contribution to the literature by exploring the ways in which faculty search chairs’ status and social identities impact interpersonal committee dynamics and decisions about hiring diverse candidates. © 2022.

AB  - Studies about the experience of Student Service Members and Veterans (SSM/Vs) at U.S. institutions of higher education have consistently found that SSM/Vs believe that their military status results in stereotyping by peers. This is the first study to use quantitative methods to examine 1) the stereotypes SSM/Vs believe exist about them, and 2) the stereotypes actually displayed by non-SSM/V peers. A survey was administered to 177 students (87 SSM/Vs and 90 non-SSM/Vs) at a large, four-year university in the Midwest United States. Explicit questions and an experimental manipulation were used to address the research questions. Findings suggest that SSM/Vs believe more negative stereotypes exist than do non-SSM/Vs. Further, of 48 attributes used as options, the current methodology uncovered evidence of 6 specific stereotypes that non-SSM/Vs hold about SSM/Vs: disciplined, leader, masculine, mentally ill, stuck in the past, and tense. These results can guide future research about SSM/V transition to higher education, and address specific barriers to the well-being of this population. © 2022 Society for Military Psychology, Division 19 of the American Psychological Association.

AB  - Workplace backlash, the explicit/implicit, and/or intentional/unintentional attempts to reject efforts to promote diversity, taken by both dominant and subordinate social group members to maintain the group-based social hierarchy at work, has emerged as a major threat to fostering diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace. Although intense scholarly attention has been paid to workplace backlash, the literature has a highly individualistic and fragmented perspective of backlash, which hinders theoretical advancement. As a remedy for conceptual and theoretical heterogeneity, I first conducted a systematic review of the literature to present a critical overview of past scholarly endeavors and take stock of the empirical evidence. This article provides an alternative, unified definition of workplace backlash drawn from intergroup relations and the power hierarchy among social group members. Finally, based on the perspective of group-based social hierarchy, this study describes the emergence, development, and maintenance of workplace backlash through the lens of social dominance theory. Implications and future research suggestions are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To date, discussion regarding autism in education has been primarily concerned with autistic students, and research usually relates to pedagogical practices that can be implemented by neurotypical teachers to support them. Seldom does the conversation around autism in the classroom consider autistic teachers, which automatically negates lived experience which could provide critical insights into inclusive education. This review examines literature which is concerned with the lived experiences of autistic teachers in education settings from early childhood to high school, with the purpose of illuminating the understanding of autism in schools. This study finds that autistic teachers are more prevalent than traditional ideas about education have suggested, with many teachers deciding to hide their autism due to negative stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour. This study focuses on the range of strengths and challenges that autistic teachers experience and highlights a gap in the literature exploring lived experience of autistic teachers, conducted by autistic researchers. The study concludes that autistic voices are essential for addressing disconnects between inclusive education theory and practice; a disconnect which creates barriers to success for autistic people in society. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The current investigation tested if people’s basic belief in the notion that human beings have developed from other animals (i.e., belief in evolution) can predict human-to-human prejudice and intergroup hostility. Using data from the American General Social Survey and Pew Research Center (Studies 1–4), and from three online samples (Studies 5, 7, 8) we tested this hypothesis across 45 countries, in diverse populations and religious settings, across time, in nationally representative data (N = 60,703), and with more comprehensive measures in online crowdsourced data (N = 2,846). Supporting the hypothesis, low belief in human evolution was associated with higher levels of prejudice, racist attitudes, and support for discriminatory behaviors against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ), Blacks, and immigrants in the United States (Study 1), with higher ingroup biases, prejudicial attitudes toward outgroups, and less support for conflict resolution in samples collected from 19 Eastern European countries (Study 2), 25 Muslim countries (Study 3), and Israel (Study 4). Further, among Americans, lower belief in evolution was associated with greater prejudice and militaristic attitudes toward political outgroups (Study 5). Finally, perceived similarity to animals (a construct distinct from belief in evolution, Study 6) partially mediated the link between belief in evolution and prejudice (Studies 7 and 8), even when controlling for religious beliefs, political views, and other demographic variables, and were also observed for nondominant groups (i.e., religious and racial minorities). Overall, these findings highlight the importance of belief in human evolution as a potentially key individual-difference variable predicting racism and prejudice © 2022.

This study explores gay fathers’ desires, motivations, and experiences of having a child. Participants’ challenges and concerns regarding having and raising children also were explored. Data were obtained through in-person interviews of 11 self-identified gay fathers. The data were then analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) analysis. The analytical results identified three themes that shed light on participants’ desires and experiences of parenthood. These were: (1) innate motives to parent and gender role strains, (2) enacted stigma (i.e., acts of rejection due to sexual orientation and traditional gender roles), and (3) children’s social rejection due to their parents’ sexuality. The findings of this study stress the influence of contextual factors (stigma) and intrapersonal factors (internalized anti-gay prejudice) in participants’ health and well-being. This study potentially tries to expand cultural awareness of research in this field. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Researchers have consistently found an increased vulnerability to sexual violence in bisexual women. Much like the broader literature around sexual violence against women, the limited research examining this vulnerability in bisexual women has focused on intraindividual victim factors such as alcohol use, mental health, and previous sexual assault victimization. Sexual violence researchers are expanding their purview to include sociocultural factors manifested in the immediate context of sexual violence perpetration and victimization. Adding to this expanding awareness of the importance of these factors, the current study explored the relationships between bisexual women’s perceived experiences of dehumanization, hostile sexism, and biphobia in the social circle with which they spend the most time and their reported experience of sexual violence within the last year. Consistent with prior research indicating heightened vulnerability to sexual violence in bisexual women a substantial portion of participants (72.2%) reported experiencing sexual violence within the last year. Of those participants reporting experiences of sexual violence, most (93%) of those reporting sexual violence endorsing surviving rape. Hypotheses were partially supported, with peer hostile sexism, biphobia, and dehumanization of bisexual women significantly relating to sexual violence. When examined simultaneously, only peer hostile sexism and biphobia emerged as unique predictors of vulnerability to sexual violence. The current study adds to the literature supporting the need for increased focus on bisexual women’s unique vulnerability to sexual violence, as well as the important and underexamined roles of sexism and biphobia as contributing factors to this vulnerability through peer-level processes and social norms. © 2022.

AB  - Police have been criticized for their biased treatment of minorities. While many officers do not hold prejudicial attitudes toward minorities, discrimination continues. Stereotype threat research offers one possible explanation for why this is so. Paradoxically, studies reveal that officers who feel more threatened by the ‘racist cop’ stereotype rely more on coercive force in interactions with minorities. This perpetuates the view that police are racist. This study examines whether officers can overcome the negative consequences of experiencing stereotype threat. It focuses on the link between stereotype threat and officers’ support for procedural justice policing, and examines how social identity moderates this relationship. Using survey data from 307 police officers (22.5% females, 11.1% non-Australian ancestry, and 69.4% general duties officers), we find that stereotype threat is associated with reduced support for procedural justice, but is moderated by how officers self-identify. Officers who identify more strongly as ‘guardians’ (i.e. they emphasize policing as a service) are more likely to display stereotype resistance; that is, they are better able to resist the negative consequences of the ‘racist cop’ stereotype. Those who identify less strongly as ‘guardian’ officers, in contrast, fall victim to stereotype threat and display stereotype conformity. Implications are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - English language teaching has become a global phenomenon, involving racially and culturally diverse teachers travelling across national borders. While these transnational teachers bring diversity to host countries, the superiority of White native English speakers continues to be reinforced. This raciolinguistic ideology can uniquely shape the subjectivities of English language teachers of colour who sojourn abroad. Focusing on three African American female teachers of English who were participating in the English Program in Korea (EPIK) to teach in South Korean schools and posting YouTube videos to describe their experiences, this qualitative study examined the nature of their experiences and intersecting subjectivities regarding race, colour, language, gender, and nationality, as well as privilege and marginality as they are expressed online. The analysis focused on how intersectionality, a notion originally developed to describe Black women’s unique experiences in the United States, would be applied to this transnational context. A thematic analysis of a total of 12 videos revealed these EPIK teachers’ multifaceted and negotiated subjectivities as American teachers, victims of racial prejudice, and ambassadors with a mission to educate local people. These subjectivities signify the intersectionality of privilege and marginality, which are embedded in the local and global ideologies and power relations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cultural change is theorized to generate intergroup hostility. Three experiments apply the Cultural Inertia Model to test the effects of change on intergroup relations. Two predictions of cultural inertia were tested: (a) cultures at rest tend to stay at rest and (b) individual difference variables function as psychological anchors. In static societies, perceived change leads to greater threat (Experiment 1), endorsement of anti-immigration legislation (Experiment 1), and collective angst (Experiments 1 and 2). Perceptions of change in static societies lead to more fear-related emotional reactions (Experiment 3). Framing cultural change as continuous rather than abrupt may be a solution for reducing negative reactions caused by cultural change (Experiments 2 and 3). Individual difference factors function as anchors that cement individuals in a state of uniformity (Experiments 2). The findings demonstrate that social interactions rely on perceptions toward change and individual difference factors that anchor one’s willingness to accept change. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This colloquium discusses the crucial need to reconcile the ironic dilemma of enforcing social-distancing measures and social relationships simultaneously during the COVID-19 crisis. Young children have been exposed to multifaceted challenges during this time. However, their well-being, education, and safety have often been overlooked, ignored, or compromised. It is argued that society should abandon childism, which is prejudice and/or discrimination against children, and implement a holistic approach to protect and prioritize children's well-being, fundamental rights, and humanity. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The dynamics of cohabitation in increasingly diverse urban settings are experienced at various levels. Certain types of interactions contribute positively to the sense of belonging and to social cohesion while others reinforce prejudices that can lead to discrimination and exclusion. What are the different types of interactions in increasingly diverse urban settings? Are there certain types of situations that are more likely to promote or prevent bonds of trust between individuals or communities? In this article we present a new methodological framework for collecting ethnographic data on intercultural dynamics in increasingly diverse urban settings. Using what we refer to as ‘indirect ethnography’, this methodology involves collaboration with professionals and practitioners who are exposed to intercultural situations on an everyday basis and who agree to participate in workshops designed to collect ethnographic data about what they see on the ground. After a discussion of how the workshops emerged and how they are organized, we present a series of preliminary observations using theoretical insights from systems theory, especially with regards to the problem of how to talk about difference without reinforcing prejudice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research aims to examine what motivates “white” people working to bring more racial justice to South Africa through education to become involved in this work. Using theories of narrative identity and social action, as well as drawing on previous studies of white identity in South Africa and the USA, this qualitative study explores the narratives of white racial justice activists from a South African perspective. The analysis revealed three large narratives that guided the sense of self of participants. The three big stories are as follows: “People Are People”, “Following God”, and “Quality Education for All”, which provided the underlying framework for the motivations and moral action of participants. These narratives highlight a move away from overt prejudice and is a sincere attempt to positively engage with the “new South Africa”, however by not engaging with race at all, it could be viewed as avoiding the guilt of continued racial privilege. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Social constructionist beliefs posit that sociocultural forces shape power-stratified social categories, whereas essentialist beliefs posit that social categories are defined by an immutable, natural essence shared by category members. Across three studies, we developed and validated the Social Constructionist and Essentialist Beliefs Scale (SCEBS) to assess the latent structure of ontological beliefs about two social categories: gender and race. In Study 1 (N = 598), we found a three-factor structure for SCEBS-Gender and SCEBS-Race, consisting of Social Constructionism, Essentialism, and Realism. In Study 2a (N = 300), we examined factor structure stability and criterion-related validity. We found incremental validity of SCEBS, and social constructionist beliefs particularly, for predicting modern sexism and symbolic racism beyond extant, essentialism-focused measures. In Study 2b (N = 218), we established 4-week test–retest reliability of SCEBS. Our research demonstrates the value of assessing both social constructionist and essentialist beliefs in the study of prejudice. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In September 2021, the 34th Brazilian Surgical Conference hosted the “Panel: Women in Surgery”-the only session in the event solely composed of female speakers. Although gender inequities in surgery are well recognized in the international literature, the panel portrayed how distant we are from the desired equity in our country. In addition, the session emphasized the need to broaden the debate and identify the mechanisms for greater inclusion and maintenance of women in the surgical career. In this editorial, we provide a historical overview of gender disparities in the Brazilian surgical ecosystem, highlight the contributing factors to a reduced number of female surgeons, and how the structure of medical societies may influence the rise of women to leadership positions. Accordingly, we discuss the benefits of gender diversity for surgeons, patients, and institutions. Furthermore, we analyze the representation of women in the Brazilian College of Surgeons since its foundation and in the scientific sessions at the conference, demonstrating that more initiatives are required to encourage female representation in the college. Finally, we propose a series of recommendations to foster engagement and contribute to the prosperity of women surgeons in Brazil. © 2022, Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper argues that the emergence of social media as a new public sphere has shaped masculine identity in the cyber platform. Such masculinity in Assamese society (the Assamese-speaking community), based on the images of the ideal Assamese man is linked with a form of Assamese nationalistic masculinity that gathered momentum during the Assam Movement (1979–1985). Politics of identity in Assam is basically trapped in the world of appearances, fighting real and imaginary enemies, and drawing strength from prejudices and misconceptions of groups, about themselves and others. This process of identity creation also shaped the identity of the “ideal” Assamese man in the recent socio-political history of Assam. This article is an attempt to define how masculinity works in the cyber world by focusing attention on Assamese nationalistic masculinity which is based on the image of the “RealAssamese Man.” The “Real Assamese Man,” in turn, draws inspiration from a socio-cultural context which started with the creation of Assamese iconographies of masculinity which were later transformed and appropriated to serve the purpose of identity-politics. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background Health care managers face the critical challenge of overcoming divisions among the many groups involved in patient care, a problem intensified when patients must flow across multiple settings. Surprisingly, however, the patient flow literature rarely engages with its intergroup dimension. Purpose This study explored how managers with responsibility for patient flow understand and approach intergroup divisions and "silo-ing"in health care. Methodology/Approach We conducted in-depth interviews with 300 purposively sampled senior, middle, and frontline managers across 10 Canadian health jurisdictions. We undertook thematic analysis using sensitizing concepts drawn from the social identity approach. Results Silos, at multiple levels, were reported in every jurisdiction. The main strategies for ameliorating silos were provision of formal opportunities for staff collaboration, persuasive messages stressing shared values or responsibilities, and structural reorganization to redraw group boundaries. Participants emphasized the benefits of the first two but described structural change as neither necessary nor sufficient for improved collaboration. Conclusion Silos, though an unavoidable feature of organizational life, can be managed and mitigated. However, a key challenge in redefining groups is that the easiest place to draw boundaries from a social identity perspective may not be the best place from one of system design. Narrowly defined groups forge strong identities more easily, but broader groups facilitate coordination of care by minimizing the number of boundaries patients must traverse. Practice Implications A thoughtfully designed combination of strategies may help to improve intergroup relations and their impact on flow. It may be ideal to foster a "mosaic"identity that affirms group allegiances at multiple levels. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - This paper examines the volume and type of anonymous comments academics receive in student evaluations of courses and teaching (SETs) at the 16,000 higher education institutions that collect this data at the end of each teaching period. Existing research has increasingly pointed to the negative issues of student surveys, but very little research has focused on the volume, type, and impact of anonymous student comments on academics. This paper analyses the survey results of 674 academics to inform higher education leaders and the sector more widely of the amount and type of abusive comments academics are receiving. The work also demonstrates that the highest volume, most derogatory, and most threatening abuse is directed towards women academics and those academics from marginalised groups. The paper finds that previous estimates of the rate and severity of abusive comments that academics receive, and the impact to academics’ wellbeing, mental health, and career progression, have underestimated what is taking place. The paper argues that many universities are failing to protect their staff from this abuse, and the prejudice nature of SET results, which will continue to have a negative impact on the career progression of marginalised academics - a major flaw in a sector that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. © 2022, Crown.

AB  - To problematise Western discourses of a homophobic Africa, there is a need to analyse evidence of homophobia and its interplay with other attitudes, in ways that explore contextual differences. Hence, this article offers an original sociological analysis of quantitative data on homophobia in African states, examining how this inter-relates with xenophobia. Social attitudes data are drawn from the Afrobarometer research project as a unique and important source, and compared in five diverse contexts: Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal and Zambia. Data are examined from Round 6 (2014–2015) and Round 7 (2016–2018). Findings are interpreted in light of specific national literatures on the relations between sexuality, gender and nationalism, as well as wider critical and postcolonial perspectives – especially conceptualisation of sexual nationalisms, and recent literatures on political homophobia. Whereas analyses of homonationalism in Western societies have explored alignments of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex rights affirmation with anti-immigrant attitudes, this study explores such relationships between homophobic and xenophobic attitudes in alternative patterns within specific African contexts. The analysis delivered not only challenges Western discourses of generalised African homophobia (especially discussing the counterexample of Mozambique) but also advances understanding of the complexity of how attitudes inter-relate in different postcolonial states. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to look at levels of perceived discrimination in school among students of different races and to assess whether there are significant short- or long-term effects as they develop. This study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which is a multi-stage nationally representative study of individuals who were in 7th–12th grade during the 1994–1995 school year. Responses on teacher discrimination items showed that Black students reported the highest levels of perceived teacher discrimination. Educational expectations were lowest for Hispanic students. At wave three, participants who identified their race/ethnicity as Hispanic or other reported the worst overall health, whereas at wave four, White participants had significantly better overall health than the other three groups. Teacher discrimination was found to be a significant predictor for educational expectations, income expectations, and overall health eight and 15 years later. When stratified by race, higher teacher discrimination predicted lower educational expectations and poorer overall health eight years later for Black, Hispanic, and White students. © 2022, W.

AB  - Intergroup contact has long been lauded as a key intervention to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup attitudes among youth. In this review, we summarize classic perspectives and new developments in the intergroup contact literature, highlighting both prospects and challenges associated with achieving desired youth outcomes through contact. First, we review literature showing how positive intergroup outcomes can be facilitated through cultivating optimal conditions for contact, as well as by attending to youth’s emotional responses to contact. We then discuss how desired contact outcomes may be inhibited by limited understanding of ways in which contact strategies may affect youth across developmental stages, as well as by limited focus on societal inequalities and intergroup conflict, which require examination of outcomes beyond prejudice reduction. We also review growing bodies of research on indirect contact strategies—such as extended contact, vicarious contact, and online contact—showing many options that can be used to promote positive relations among youth from diverse backgrounds, beyond the contact literature’s traditional focus on face-to-face interaction. We conclude this review by acknowledging how understanding both prospects and challenges associated with implementing contact strategies can enhance our capacity to prepare youth to embrace group differences and build more inclusive societies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This paper aims to explore the experiences of female leaders considering the interplay of gender, religion, and culture. Drawing on an inductive-qualitative study, the paper examines perceptions regarding the role of religion and cultural norms in women’s ascension into leadership positions in Jordan. The results indicated that Jordanian women leaders adopted an Islamic feminist worldview and did not embrace a liberal nor a socialist/Marxist feminist worldview. Women leaders seemed wanting to claim their religion back from those forces that are reportedly holding their aspirations hostage to monolithic interpretations of religious texts. By constantly referring to their religion, female leaders wanted to be granted spaces of trust and responsibility in leadership positions that they did not see contradictory to the way they understood their faith. The paper provides insights into how women leaders understand prejudicial stereotypes and discrimination in their society, explaining how those are linked to patriarchal socio-cultural traditions emphasizing male control. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - There is increasing appreciation that group memberships can have both beneficial and damaging impacts on health. In collaboration with Nepal Leprosy Trust (NLT), this longitudinal study explores a group-based approach to stigma reduction among people affected by leprosy in rural Nepal (N = 71)—a hard to reach and underrepresented non-WEIRD population. Informed by the ‘social cure’ literature, and the progressive model of self-stigma, we use a longitudinal design. We found that a sense of belonging to a self-help group can facilitate education in terms of health literacy, and over time these two factors also have impacts on participants stigma. Specifically, self-help group belonging predicted improvements in health literacy, leading to reduced endorsement of negative stereotypes and thus less stigma-related harm among people affected by leprosy. The study offers promising evidence that group-based interventions, which support health education, can reduce the harmful impact of stigma in very challenging contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - South Korea is a popular destination for Chinese students studying overseas. Prior to the pandemic, Chinese students comprised the largest percentage of foreign students in South Korea. This paper provides insights into major trends germane to Chinese students studying in South Korea. In addition, it explores challenges that Chinese students encounter while studying in South Korean universities, which include socialization problems, Korean and English language barriers, academic difficulties, and discrimination and prejudice. It also examines historical and political issues that have an impact on Chinese people living in South Korea. Strategies for improving successful integration are discussed. These include having effective academic and social support systems, promoting intercultural communicative competence, advanced preparation before leaving China, mutual adjustment activities that enhance understanding and awareness between different cultural groups, reflective practice and quality improvement, and exposure to diverse viewpoints. Finally, practical implications, which could improve the overall adaptation of Chinese students in South Korean universities are discussed. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose: People with Parkinson’s disease (hereafter Parkinson’s) can experience stigma through the attitudes and actions of others (enacted stigma) and through anticipation of enacted stigma and internalisation of negative stereotypes (felt stigma). Self-compassion may protect against the impact of stigma. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between self-compassion, stigma, and psychological distress among people with Parkinson’s. Methods: A total of 130 people with Parkinson’s completed questionnaires measuring self-compassion, enacted and felt stigma, and depression, anxiety, and stress. Correlation, mediation, and moderation models were used to investigate relationships between variables. Results: All variables correlated significantly in the expected directions. Felt stigma mediated the relationship between self-compassion and the three outcome variables–depression, anxiety, and stress. Self-compassion did not moderate the relationship between enacted stigma and distress and suggested enacted stigma was associated with distress, regardless of levels of self-compassion. Conclusions: Self-compassion and both enacted and felt stigma are important predictors of distress for people with Parkinson’s. Part of the relationship between lower self-compassion and psychological distress appears to occur via the internalisation of stigma. These findings may be relevant to the development of individualised and societal interventions with the aim of improving the psychological wellbeing of people with Parkinson’s.Implications for rehabilitation Self-compassion was associated with lower levels of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) and self-stigma partially mediated this relationship. Self-compassion did not moderate the relationship between enacted stigma and psychological distress, suggesting enacted stigma increases distress, regardless of self-compassion. The development and assessment of the effectiveness of compassion-focused interventions tailored for people with Parkinson’s may be important as well as systemic stigma focused interventions. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Sexual and gender minorities often experience discrimination or stigmatization during health encounters. When patients feel stigmatized, they are more likely to delay seeking help and it affects patient cooperation and compliance, thus undermining therapeutic efficacy itself. We examined knowledge and attitude toward LGBT+ people among Hungarian (n = 743) and foreign (n = 130) medical students of the four Hungarian medical universities and 188 students from other faculties. Homonegativity and inadequate knowledge about sexual minority individuals are correlated with male gender, conservative political views, religiosity, religious behavior, and the absence of LGBT+ acquaintance. Medical students show more negative attitudes than students from other disciplines, although foreign medical students were more accepting than Hungarian program students. Further investigation of sexual minority-related content of the Hungarian medical education and revising the written and hidden curriculum would be desired, as well as collecting data from postgraduate students, physicians, and wide range of university faculties. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the context of the border dispute presented by Peru against Chile in the The Hague Court, this study analyzes the influences of two ideological motivational dimensions: Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) on a set of intergroup attitudes that involve both nations. To this end, a survey study of 196 Chileans and 223 Peruvians participants was conducted. The instruments used to measure ideology and political attitudes are the following ones: RWA Scale; SDO Scale; Scale of Intergroup attitudes between Chile-Peru and specific questions on interest in the Hague litigation and willingness to fight for one's country. The results show that in the Peruvian case attitudes of belligerence and alert and a greater willingness to fight for the country are better explained by the RWA, while in the Chilean case these same attitudes are explained both by the RWA as well as the SDO. On the other hand, pacificist attitudes are explained inversely by SDO in both countries. These findings support the hypothesis that intergroup dynamics between both countries have been marked by expressed actions of a Chilean expansionism versus a Peruvian vengefulness and suggest that equalitarianism will promote attitudes toward respect and cooperation between both groups, changing the frames of expansionism and vengefulness for one of a culture of peace. © 2022 Universidad CES.

AB  - Although previous research has shown that deliberative discussions have consequences for intergroup attitudes, very little is known about this impact during the formative adolescent years. In addition, the mechanism explaining the mechanism through which discussions affect intergroup attitudes is not clear. This 3-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, MageT1 = 13.41, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of teacher-initiated political discussions in the classroom for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analysis showed that adolescents who perceived political discussions to be less frequent increased in anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth with more frequent discussions. Similarly, classrooms with less deliberative atmosphere were more negative toward immigrants than classrooms with a higher frequency of discussions, and this effect remained two years after the students moved to new schools. Mediation analysis revealed that general political interest (but not news consumption) explained the effects of classroom discussions on attitudes: Youth who perceived that their teachers frequently initiate political discussions developed higher general political interest and, in turn, lower anti-immigrant attitudes than youth with less frequent discussions. The findings show an important role of classroom political discussions for the formation of intergroup attitudes in adolescence. The findings suggest that frequent discussions reduce the risk of prejudice development by stimulating youth general political interest. © Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To analyze the structure of the social network of people living with HIV and AIDS. Method: Exploratory and descriptive research with a qualitative approach, developed through interviews with twenty-two people living with HIV and AIDS, from November to December 2019. For analysis, the theoretical-methodological framework of social network was used. Results: The primary networks were of medium size and low density, formed by family members, relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. The secondary networks were characterized by public, private, third sector institutions, workplaces, and by the informal network, which provided support according to the need for care. Conclusion: The family was considered the center of the primary social network structure; however, weaknesses in these social relationships were evidenced. The family relational context of the person with HIV and AIDS was influenced by the secrecy of the diagnosis due to the fear of prejudice and discrimination for being HIV-positive. There was a predilection for the services of the secondary social network that took on the role of specific care for the disease. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social stigma in the form of knowledge aspects, attitudes, or prejudices, and discriminatory behavior is a serious issue that affects people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the surrounding environment. AIM: The study aimed to determine the correlation between religiosity with social stigma and public acceptance of people living with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: This cross-sectional study applied a convenience sampling technique and involved 400 people. The subject is a citizen of the community domiciled in Bandung aged between 17 and 65 years. Instruments used included measurements of religiosity, social stigma, and public acceptance. All instruments used have been declared reliable. The data analysis used Spearman’s rank test and used frequency distribution or religiosity levels, social stigma, and public acceptance from the society. RESULTS: This study revealed that the mean overall religiosity score among the study population was 38.4 ± 5.3 (score range: 15–75). Most people’s social stigma against HIV/AIDS was high (58.7%), with a score of 80.1 ± 24.0. In addition, most of the community was less accepting of the presence of people with HIV/AIDS amid their environment (54.7%) with a score of 35.1 ± 10.2. The results showed a positively correlation between religiosity with social stigma (r = 0.325, 95% CI, p &lt; 0.05) and religiosity with public acceptance (r = 0.506, 95% CI, p &lt; 0.05) of people with HV/AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: Person’s level of religiosity determines a social stigma against people with HIV/AIDS, and then, this will determine acceptance of people with HIV/AIDS in the community. The data from this study can be used as basic information to develop strategies to reduce stigma by creating awareness and increasing community acceptance of people with HIV/AIDS. © 2022 Angga Wilandika, Suzanna Yusof, Diah Nur Indah Sari.

AB  - Indian students in Britain before the Second World War were a sizeable social group who exerted noticeable influence on Indian nationalism and on British institutions and society. The politics of race and empire were mediated through British schools and universities in this period with consequences for Indian students, and their peers. This article discusses the ways in which Indian students were socially segregated in Britain, including facing a colour ban in some parts of the country, and the consequences of this racial prejudice. It argues that the mobility of colonial students during the time of empire not only had a personal effect on their lives, but encouraged them to become politically engaged in the politics of metropole and empire, engaging in nationalism, socialism and the female suffrage movement in both Britain and India. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, it was aimed to experiment a new method to increase the quality of the history of mathematics course instruction in the primary mathematics education. The method composed by synthesizing project-based and collaborative learning methods was named “Newspaper Preparation Method,” and the course was delivered using this method. Exploratory design, one of the mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative techniques are both used, was applied in the study. The sample of the study consists of 35 undergraduate students studying in the primary mathematics education department. The quantitative data analyzed through SPSS-25 while qualitative data analyzed through content analysis. The results of data analysis revealed that the pre-service teachers held positive attitudes towards the method. Also, participants realized that they gained skills such as proactivity, research, inquiry, reproductivity, authorship, teamwork, and socializing. Besides, pre-service teachers’ prejudices were eliminated against the course, their motivation increased, their curiosity was triggered, and most importantly the pre-service teachers deemed themselves important. Moreover, this method has transformed the course from a boring program into an exciting and enjoyable part of the syllabus. Finally, pre-service teachers stated that they learned the class effectively and permanently, their vocabulary and general knowledge increased, and their computer literacy improved. It is predicted that this study will contribute to the literature through analyzing a hands-on method and inspire those teaching the history of mathematics. © 2022, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - Former literature found that various ‘different’ students experience exclusion and rejection by their peers in schools. This may be linked with the attitudes that their school and classmates hold towards them. Identifying someone as ‘Other’ may indeed result in prejudicial attitudes which, in turn, can lead to his/her marginalisation and exclusion. From an inclusive perspective, it is thus pivotal to explore student attitudes towards the conceived different ones and how they are linked with exclusionary patterns among peers in schools. To contribute to the understanding of the link between peer attitudes, diversity and exclusion, the present paper reports on the stages of development of an instrument aimed to measure adolescents’ attitudes towards otherness which combines a qualitative and a quantitative approach. Beside measuring their attitudes, the instrument also investigates students’ representations and definitions of otherness. Such representations–as emerged from the pilot study of the instrument–will be presented here. The findings confirmed the importance of adopting a wider and non-categorical approach to otherness in the study of peer attitudes and exclusionary processes in schools. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The paper focuses on Facebook's shaping of communication regarding the European migrant crisis in the Czech Republic. Topological spaces in communication with entanglements of inclusion and exclusion were produced by practicing the communication, with the mutual influence of two kinds of the collective unconscious, the technological and the Orientalist unconscious. The paper is based on a participant observation of Czech-language Facebook groups and pages where discussions about the European migrant crisis proliferated. Due to the technological unconscious, algorithm-induced “filter-bubbles” helped to separate discussions of different opinions about migration so people with anti-immigration attitudes could be building European free-thinking people identities who distrust mainstream media, and people with pro-migration attitudes were excluded and considered trustful “sheeple”. Due to the Orientalist unconscious, European free-thinking people identities were strengthened by the sharing of ideas about uncivilized, irrational, and barbaric imaginative spaces of migrants' origin, which were entirely Other to Europe. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Prejudice against people with Vitiligo is pervasive across societies. However, little attention has been given to measuring individual differences on the way that it is expressed. To overcome this gap, we developed and validated the Scale of Prejudice towards People with Vitiligo (SPV) throughout six online studies. Studies 1a and 1b (N = 136) addressed the development of the SPV’s items, their content and semantic validity. Study 2 (N = 121) showed that its nine items are organized into three correlated factors (cognitive, behavioral, and affective) with high internal consistency. Studies 3a and 3b (N = 386) confirmed this factor’s structure using confirmatory factor analysis, and explored the convergent–discriminant validity of the instrument. Study 4 (N = 417) replicated these findings and demonstrated the SPV’s configural, metric, and scalar invariance between two experimentally manipulated target-groups: Black person with Vitiligo versus White person with Vitiligo. Results also showed experimental criterion validity, in that participants scored higher on SPV in the Black (vs. White) Vitiligo condition. Furthermore, results revealed that the higher the social contact with people with Vitiligo, the lower the prejudice expressed towards this population. When combined, these findings are the first to document the correlational and experimental evidence of ameasure of prejudice towards individuals withVitiligo. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Social anxiety can have an adverse effect on social connections, educational achievement, and wellbeing. However, the extent to which students stigmatize their peers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in female educational settings remains unknown. This study investigated the relationship between SAD, peer-liking and stigma in a cohort of early adolescent girls. The sample was 103 sixth and seventh graders attending three girls’ schools in Australia. The students, aged between 10- and 13-years, were randomly allocated to either a control (n = 52) or experimental (n = 51) group. Participants completed an online survey while at school to examine their responses to one of two age-and-gender matched vignettes: a hypothetical peer with SAD (experimental condition), or without SAD (control condition). Contrary to expectations, group comparisons revealed that students with the SAD vignette liked their peer more than students with the non-SAD vignette. Also, students endorsed higher levels of pity, lower levels of fear, but similar levels of anger when considering their SAD (versus non-SAD) peer. In the SAD group, higher levels of pity were associated with greater peer-liking. The opposite pattern was evident in response to the non-SAD peer. Importantly, students discriminated less (preferred less social distance) in response to their peer with SAD. This points to the potential benefit of adolescent peer programs that aim to promote positive peer-relationships as a protective factor for students with SAD. Future research may examine gender and socio-economically diverse students to increase the confidence with which findings can be generalized to other educational settings. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Research is often guided by maps of elementary dimensions, such as core traits, foundations of morality, and principal stereotype dimensions. Yet, there is no comprehensive map of prejudice dimensions. A major limiter of developing a prejudice map is the ad hoc sampling of target groups. We used a broad and largely theory-agnostic selection of groups to derive a map of principal dimensions of expressed prejudice in contemporary American society. Across a series of exploratory and confirmatory studies, we found three principal factors: Prejudice against marginalized groups, prejudice against privileged/ conservative groups, and prejudice against unconventional groups (with some inverse loadings for conservative groups). We documented distinct correlates for each factor, in terms of social identifications, perceived threats, personality, and behavioral manifestations. We discuss how the current map integrates several lines of research, and point to novel and underexplored insights about prejudice. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - Important but broad values such as “social responsibility” are understood differently by different groups, understandings that often reflect the values and traits of the ingroup. This research examines whether the tendency to project the characteristics of the ingroup onto understandings of “social responsibility” correlates with negative intergroup attitudes as would be expected on the basis of the ingroup projection literature. Building on recent research, we also examined whether reassuring people of their group’s identification as socially responsible might remove the correlation between projection and negative outgroups attitudes without reducing the rate of projection. Two experimental studies using the ingroup projection model provide support for these expectations. The research was conducted at a secular university (N = 188) and a religious university (N = 69) that profess different understandings of social responsibility. At both universities, projection and negative attitudes were correlated when the ingroup’s membership in the broader category of socially responsible students was threatened and in the control condition, but not when their membership in the broader category was reassured. Importantly, the rates of projection did not differ across the three conditions (control, threat, and reassurance), suggesting that reassurance does not reduce projection, but rather changes its defensive nature. These findings suggest the value of reassuring groups of their membership within broad, abstract categories, as it may allow for the kinds of conceptual disagreements that make up healthy societal debate while simultaneously discouraging the tendency for those disagreements to spill over into more general negative intergroup attitudes. © 2022.

AB  - Hate speech recognizers (HSRs) can be the panacea for containing hate in social media or can result in the biggest form of prejudice-based censorship hindering people to express their true selves. In this paper, we hypothesized how massive use of syntax can reduce the prejudice effect in HSRs. To explore this hypothesis, we propose Unintended-bias Visualizer based on Kermit modeling (KERM-HATE): a syntax-based HSR, which is endowed with syntax heat parse trees used as a post-hoc explanation of classifications. KERM-HATE significantly outperforms BERT-based, RoBERTa-based and XLNet-based HSR on standard datasets. Surprisingly this result is not sufficient. In fact, the post-hoc analysis on novel datasets on recent divisive topics shows that even KERM-HATE carries the prejudice distilled from the initial corpus. Therefore, although tests on standard datasets may show higher performance, syntax alone cannot drive the ‘‘attention“ of HSRs to ethically-unbiased features. © 2022 Mastromattei et al.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the idea of inclusion in women’s bottom-up peacebuilding in Ghana. Inspired by the growing importance of “inclusion” and “local empowerment” in the discourse and practice of local ownership in peacebuilding, this paper seeks to investigate the scope and degree of inclusion of key actors such as women and youth, and how that affects peacebuilding and sustainable peace in some conflict-affected zones. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a cross-sectional case study design and qualitative strategy. It is based on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions conducted with actors who have been engaged in grassroots peacebuilding in Ghana and West Africa. The analysis was largely inductive, identifying emerging themes and patterns in the research data. Findings: The findings indicate that young women are usually absent or not engaged meaningfully in the mobilization of women and youth in the “inclusive” grassroots peacebuilding in Ghana. This is due to the prevalence of deep-seated cultural and political prejudices or stereotypes about women in the areas studied. As these local constructs and thus practices are difficult to change or challenge, peacebuilding non-governmental organizations (NGOs) usually deploy innovative ways by mobilizing socially constructed women’s positionalities – as “whistleblowers,” “cross-ethnic/cross-cultural actors” and “socially networked actors” – in ways that promote women in contemporary peacebuilding discourses and practices. Through mobilizing these stereotypes (to forestall possible provocation, especially from dominant actors or gatekeepers), peacebuilding NGOs have subtly positioned women centrally within a vibrant peace infrastructure in Ghana. Yet, due to the dominance of some patriarchal sociopolitical structures, only older women and young men occupy the spaces for women and youth’s peacebuilding. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is one of the first research papers to question not only the scope but also the degree of inclusion and participation of women in peacebuilding in sub-Sahara Africa. This has nuanced scholarly debates on the subject and encouraged the development of innovative programmes targeted at a more comprehensive gendered and youth-ed inclusion to address the inequality gap in peacebuilding discourses and practices. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A growing body of scholarship documents the intersectional nature of social stereotyping, with stereotype content being shaped by a target person’s multiple social identities. However, conflicting findings in this literature highlight the need for a broader theoretical integration. For example, although there are contexts in which perceivers stereotype gay Black men and heterosexual Black men in very different ways, so too are there contexts in which perceivers stereotype these men in very similar ways. We develop and test an explanation for contradictory findings of this sort. In particular, we argue that perceivers have a repertoire of lenses in their minds—identity-specific schemas for categorizing others—and that characteristics of the perceiver and the social context determine which one of these lenses will be used to organize social perception. Perceivers who are using the lens of race, for example, are expected to attend to targets’ racial identities so strongly that they barely attend, in these moments, to targets’ other identities (e.g., their sexual orientations). Across six experiments, we show (a) that perceivers tend to use just one lens at a time when thinking about others, (b) that the lenses perceivers use can be singular and simplistic (e.g., the lens of gender by itself) or intersectional and complex (e.g., a race-by-gender lens, specifically), and (c) that different lenses can prescribe categorically distinct sets of stereotypes that perceivers use as frameworks for thinking about others. This lens-based account can resolve apparent contradictions in the literature on intersectional stereotyping, and it can likewise be used to generate novel hypotheses. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Against the background of climate scepticism and raging anti-immigrant sentiments across Europe, the politics of climate change and the politics of migration are fraught with tension. The two converge over discussions about ‘climate refugees’. But what merit does the term ‘climate refugee’ have, and are there potential problems associated with it? This article pays attention to how racialised discourses underwrite the concept of climate refugees in ways that further exclude already marginalised populations. In place of ‘climate refugees’, it proposes ‘ecological displacement’ as a notion which stresses how and why people are displaced within or across borders. While, indeed, anthropogenic climate change is a real threat to the livelihoods of humans (among other species), it is not the only environmental driver of displacement. By using the term ‘ecology’, this article argues that we allow for a description which encompasses other potential displacement drivers beyond climate change, such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and political violence. Citing ‘displacement’ makes the term available to populations who are displaced by damaged ecologies both within and across borders, in and outside of Europe. The notion of ‘ecological displacement’ and ‘ecologically displaced people’ tries to rehumanise those carrying the heaviest social and climate burdens on a burning planet. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In this study we analyze distinct socio-political predictors, namely, system justification, moral foundations, political ideology, social dominance orientation and authoritarianism, of two distinct but interrelated postcolonial ideologies, namely symbolic exclusion and historical negation in regards to the Mapuche people, in a sample of the general Chilean population (n = 1.242). According to the results, symbolic exclusion is explained by the political ideology of the participants, their social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification and one specific moral foundations’ dimension: harm/care. On the other hand, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification, political ideology, and two specific moral foundations (loyalty/betrayal and authority/subversion) play an important role in predicting the historical negation of negative events affecting the Mapuche Indigenous people in Chile. Our results are discussed in terms of their implications for present-day intergroup relations between the Mapuche and non-Indigenous Chileans. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Anti-atheist bias in the United States is both persistent and pervasive. However, most experimental psychological research demonstrating anti-atheist bias have used White targets or targets whose race is not explicitly mentioned. Thus, it is unknown whether atheists of colour, who have two stigmatised identities (e.g., their race and atheist identification), are perceived differently from their ingroup counterparts with one stigmatised identity (e.g., Black Christian). Using a between-subjects experimental design we examined White Americans' (n = 286; Mage = 39.91, SD = 13.17) perceptions of Black atheists' trustworthiness and racial identification relative to Black non-atheists. We also explored whether exposure to Black atheists versus Black Christians would influence White individuals' feelings of warmth towards Black Americans in general. There was no evidence that White individuals perceive Black atheists as less trustworthy or less racially identified than non-atheist Black individuals (i.e., Black Christians and Black individuals whose religious identity was not explicitly mentioned). Results did reveal, however, that White individuals had higher feelings of warmth towards Black Americans in general (and several other stigmatised groups) after exposure to a Black Christian versus Black individuals who were not Christian. Implications and future research directions are discussed, particularly focused on atheists who are multiply stigmatised. © 2022 International Union of Psychological Science.

AB  - When Gabriel Fauré (1845-1924) became a 'regular' at the Parisian salon of opera legend Pauline Viardot in 1871, he encountered businessmen and politicians in addition to aristocrats and socialites, plus artists and authors as well as amateur musicians and professional peers. Encouraged by Madame Viardot and inspired by her 'artistic salon', Fauré produced sophisticated works with stylistic duality: music that appealed to and satisfied both intuitive and analytic listeners. This essay examines three of Fauré's compositions that feature stylistic duality, each dedicated to a member of the Viardot family. These include two early mélodies, 'Chanson du pêcheur (Lamento)' (1872) and 'Au bord de l'eau' (1875), plus the Romance pour violon (1877). It demonstrates that these pieces, which sought to engage a diverse audience and involve each member in an individualized and interactive aesthetic experience, reveal considerable sophistication below their immediately attractive surfaces. This article also avers that abandonment of misconceptions and prejudices is essential to full appreciation of Gabriel Fauré's refined and innovative art. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The current study investigated the effectiveness of an online-based, empathy-focused intervention program that is developed for Turkish local society to increase their positive attitudes towards refugees. The sample of the four-week intervention program consisted of 52 participants that were randomly assigned to experimental (n = 26) and control groups (n = 26). Participants completed the Attitudes towards Syrians Scale in both groups before and after the intervention program. In the control group, no implementation was provided, only the individuals filled the pre-test and post-test questionnaires within the same periods as the experimental group. Participants in the experimental group also filled a sentence completion activity at the end of the program. The results of the study showed that Empathy Focused Intercultural Communication Program for Turkish Local Society showed a positive promissory approach for increasing positive attitudes towards Syrian refugees, increasing emphatic and altruistic approach. Lastly, these results, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed and the possible implications were shared. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An unsung alumnus of the Manchester School, Axel Sommerfelt (b. 1926) published little during his career, but has nevertheless had a major impact on contemporary Norwegian anthropology. Following six years as a lecturer in Salisbury, he taught at the University of Oslo from 1966 until his retirement in 1996. This article traces his intellectual itinerary. Beginning with a re-study of Fortes's Tallensi material, Sommerfelt later carried out fieldwork on inter-ethnic relations in south-western Uganda. He distinguished himself from his Norwegian colleagues through an interest in colonial history, nationalism and structural power which tends to be absent from Fredrik Barth's work. Sommerfelt's teaching and mainly unpublished writings reveal him as a supporter of a strong empiricist programme and a skilled Africanist who would have been a worthy contributor to the Manchester School, had he only published his work. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Homophobic bullying is a major social issue, especially in the school settings. This may be particularly common in many Western countries but it appears globally. Bullying causes both short and long-term problems hence its prevention must be seen as a relevant and urgent step in educational settings. Psycho-educational programs should be promoted in order to help eliminate school-children’s prejudices and bias about gay and lesbian peers, homophobic bullying. 191 school-children (n = 101 females, n = 90 males), aged 12–14 years old, attending a secondary school in Foggia (Italy) were recruited and assessed at baseline (T0) and 2 months (T1) after receiving a systematized, repeated psycho-education aimed to promote their awareness on sexual variations, and reduce homophobic prejudices and stereotypes. They were assessed for their empathy quotients, their knowledge of gender– related stereotypes, homophobic attitudes, anger, emotional regulation, before (T0) and after the intervention (T1) in a standardized manner. The psychoeducational program significantly reduced homophobia levels towards gays (−9.38%) and lesbians (−5.42%,) as well as improved emotional adjustment (+25.9%) and pro-sociality (+3.85%) among school-children (0.0486≤ all p < 0.0001). Also, a statistically significant improvement of empathy (+11.3%) and levels of state anger (+0.35%) has been significantly reported. This study reports on the benefits of a repeated, systematic, prospective psycho-educational intervention conducted in the school-setting leading to an improvement of empathy, pro-sociality, emotional regulation and a reduction of homophobic attitudes and anger among students. © 2022 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

AB  - Large carnivores are challenging to conserve because people are ambivalent. This research analyzed the social perception of wolves and brown bears from a novel psychological approach rarely used within conservation: animal species stereotypes (category-based generalizations). Spanish college students ascribed 17 characteristics to wolves (Study 1, N = 144 participants) and 18 to brown bears (Study 2, N = 199). Four domains–Physical (e.g., beautiful) Species-related (carnivorous), Cognitive (cunning), and Social (dangerous)–captured the stereotype content of both species, with the Social (Physical) domain being more relevant for wolves and bears. Results indicated that people a) identified stereotypes for large carnivores, as they do for people; and b) held ambivalent stereotypes (including positive and negative characteristics). Findings extend the stereotype content model and can inform the conservation of large carnivores in the 21st century. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - People who use illicit drugs are continuously subjected to harsh stigmatization from society. This study explores the perspectives of people who use illicit drugs, specifically their general beliefs about illicit drug use and related stigma. A convergent parallel mixed methods design was used, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The participants were recruited in a Psychosocial Care Centre (CAPSad) of a municipality in the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Findings revealed that illicit drug use can cause individual, family, professional and social difficulties, including problems with the law. The participants indicated they felt victimized by illicit drugs and their use, but also shared prejudicial and discriminatory views, highlighting self-stigmatizing perspectives. There is a need to develop intervention studies with a psychosocial approach on the use of illicit drugs, valuing the person’s participation in the treatment, covering biomedical approaches, having in mind the social impact of illicit drugs and their use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The study of authoritarianism has a long history in the field of psychology; however, much of this research focuses on Western countries, especially the United States. In effort to better understand authoritarianism cross-culturally, we explore the current state of authoritarianism in an important cultural context: Russia. Thus, the current paper reports on large-scale research of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation in the modern Russian context. Six studies (total N = 1,358) included personality traits, basic human values, social beliefs, and intergroup attitudes that allowed us to comprehensively consider authoritarian attitudes in Russia. The results showed that personological profile and pattern of reaction to threat among Russian authoritarians is similar to Western authoritarians. However, economic views inherited from Soviet ideology make Russians differ in their view of economic conservatism from that supported by Western authoritarians. These data provide insight into the psychology of authoritarianism as well as explore novel aspects of Russian culture. © 2022 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - The garden landscape of urban residential areas has significant environmental benefits, allowing people to get closer to nature and integrate with nature to relax and have some social benefits at the same time. This article is aimed at studying the effect of urban greening remote sensing on residential landscape construction. This paper uses the greening remote sensing image processing algorithm combined with the analysis method of SURF color remote sensing image and conducts the experiment based on the urban greening remote sensing on the residential area landscape architecture research. This article combines sustainable development strategies with innovative design methods to deeply study the role of urban greening remote sensing on the construction of residential landscape architecture. At the same time, the experiment in this article also proposes that the garden landscape of urban residential areas can provide entertainment for people, soothe residents' mood, and achieve the best use of residential buildings. However, there are still some constraints in the development process of residential industry: insufficient government support, relatively backward technology of residential industrialization, lack of support and input from enterprises, and prejudice of people's traditional concept towards it. The experimental results of this paper show that the remote sensing image features of buildings in residential areas and public areas are obvious. In the recognition of 46 training features and 34 detection features, the number of correct remote sensing recognition features is 32, and the green building image remote sensing recognition is good. The accuracy is 94%, which can meet the identification requirements of greening in the building. Combined with the specific conditions of urban greening and garden construction in my country, it can meet people's entertainment needs and, to a certain extent, can also improve people's life and cultural taste. © 2022 Yucen Zhai and Wen Li.

AB  - Behavioural immune system theory predicts that attitudes towards immigrants become more hostile during times of increased threat from pathogens, as pandemic threat triggers aversive emotional responses, which in turn foster outgroup hostility. We test this notion in the context of the current Covid-19 crisis. Combining both original individual-level survey data of around 6,000 European respondents during the second Corona wave in winter 2020/2021 and regional data of pandemic threat in a multilevel design, we show that Covid-19 pandemic threat exposure in 105 European regions is indeed associated with more negative attitudes towards immigrants. Moreover, hierarchical path models indicate that Covid-19-induced anger fosters anti-immigrant attitudes, while we find no evidence that disgust as a pivotal avoidance-oriented emotion is crucial. In contrast to conventional wisdom, individuals reacting with fear to the pandemic hold more immigrant-friendly orientations. Taken together, our results indicate that the behavioural immune system (BIS) appears as a compelling obstacle to inclusive orientations. However, our findings challenge the notion that every emotion triggered by the BIS translates the pandemic threat into negative attitudes towards immigrants. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Black Lives Matter rallies across Australia in 2020 drew wide attention to Indigenous deaths in custody, calling forth racial justice to right the wrongs of continuing colonization. However, many may have missed the rare, if not fortuitous, presence of Chinese Australians at the rallies and the heated discussions within the Chinese community on social media. Little recognition of the cross-cultural contact between Chinese and Indigenous peoples points to a blind spot vis-à-vis Australia’s race and ethnic relations, a schism that needs bridging if community-wide social cohesion and reconciliation is to be realized. The key question is: why do Indigenous-Chinese relationships remain unrecognized and misunderstood by the mainstream society? In an attempt to tackle this question, this essay will look into the under-reported participation of Chinese individuals and organizations at the Australian BLM rallies and provide a critical consideration of the mixed attitudes within the Chinese community over the rallies in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. By exploring the understated support and camaraderie, as well as fractures and frictions, of the ongoing relationships between Indigenous and Chinese Australians, this essay examines the conceptual, historical and transnational factors that render the recognition of their interrelations difficult in contemporary Australia. It brings together otherwise disparate issues, including the conceptual divide between race and ethnicity, segregation history, identity politics, and transnational racism. It links cyber discussion within the Chinese community in Australia with the discourse of race in China, so as to chart the transnational connectivity of racial discourses and racism against cultural others in the era of social media. In so doing, the essay will offer new insights into Indigenous-Chinese interrelations in culturally diverse Australia. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study focuses on the perspectives of parents in a Ndebele heritage language family in post-Gukurahundi Matabeleland in Zimbabwe. Gukurahundi is a codename for a military operation that resulted in the killing of over 20 000 mainly Ndebele speakers in Matabeleland and the Midlands (of Zimbabwe) between 1983 and 1987. The failure by the state to publicly acknowledge and own the genocide has resulted in survivors deploying nuanced strategies in dealing with Gukurahundi inflicted trauma. This article examines how the focal parents’ Gukurahundi language experiences are infused into their explicitly articulated family language policy. The study deploys Tannenbaum’s reconceptualisation of family language policy as a coping and defence mechanism to demonstrate how the parents’ emotional dispositions and orientations towards the use of their Ndebele heritage language as a form of coping strategy are enmeshed with memories of language prejudices experienced during Gukurahundi. The study also exposes how focal parents’ reification of a Ndebelecentred family language policy is emotionally laden, and borders on the proscription of Shona as a defence against the reproduction of post-Gukurahundi state-wide Ndebele marginalisation in the family. © 2022 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Disparity exists between racially minoritized students and their White student counterparts in academic achievement. This discrepancy engenders the difference with which students will have opportunities in advanced courses; rates of high school graduation, college acceptance, and completion rates; and salary and quality of life. The academic disparity between the two groups has been found to have roots in stereotype threat, which causes anxiety where the individual’s behavior may confirm the negative stereotypes of one’s in-group. Reducing stereotype threat has been theorized to allow minoritized students and those in negatively stereotyped groups to enhance their academic performance by removing levels of anxiety hampering their performance. Following previous work, whereby the academic achievement gap between Black and White middle school students were reduced, this study examines the effectiveness of such an intervention on 4th grade, elementary students’ reading achievement levels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: A consensus in the literature is that anti-gay prejudice has a negative impact on HIV programming for men who have sex with men (MSM). This paper aims to analyse the prevalence and predictors of anti-gay prejudice in Barbados, an island in the Caribbean, and possible impacts on the full recognition of the right to health care. Design/methodology/approach: The study used nationally representative data obtained from the Caribbean Development Research Services capturing anti-gay prejudice in Barbados in 2004, 2013 and 2019. The data were analysed using logit models and ordinary least squares regression. Findings: The share of persons who expressed feelings of hatred towards gays and lesbians did not change significantly over the period. Social distance attitudes improved between 2004 and 2013 but have not changed since. Men generally expressed more prejudice than women and male sexual prejudice could be localised to three groups – men without tertiary education, men under 51 and members of non-Christian religions. Meanwhile, there was little consistency in the predictors of women’s attitudes over the period. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the trends in attitudes towards sexual minorities in a developing country. The main conclusion is that although health care is provided as a universal right to all Barbadians, a strictly medical approach to HIV prevention among MSM in countries with high levels of anti-gay prejudice is insufficient. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article addresses the compulsory seizing of children from vulnerable women in Brazil. Its objectives were: to discuss the violation of the right to maternity; to present the imposed restrictions especially on poor, black and indige-nous women; the strategic control over their lives and children, and the resistance movements that oppose segregation. The sources of the research were: narratives of women in vulnerable situa-tions, family members and health workers; inter-views with strategic actors; document analysis; field journal. It became evident that vulnerabili-ties-linked to the criminalization of poverty and racial prejudice-have justified these separations. The lack of responsibility that State and society practice towards the support network for women, the devaluation of non-hegemonic productions of maternity, and the reinforcement of a ‘reason of the world’, that produces violence as a tool for exclusion establishing practical limits on the right to maternity. Women and children are disregar-ded in their singularities. Resistance movements have shown that intersectoral dialogues are an alternative to overcome discrimination and vulnerabilities. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Medicinal plant (MP) use supports comprehensiveness of care in Primary Health Care (PHC), enabling appreciation of popular knowledge and self-care. This integrative literature review aims to analyze researches that approach the insertion of using MP in PHC. PICO strategy was used as a guideline in search of evidence, reuniting 18 articles published between January 2015 and August 2020, in the Virtual Health Library and PubMed databases. The variables of analysis were knowledge of PHC healthcare professionals about MP and associated policies, MP use by its users, highlighting their profile, the reasons that lead to the use and lack of security in MP use. The results show insufficient knowledge of healthcare professionals about Integrative and Complementary Practices policies and the medicinal uses of plants. The main users are women, elderly, with low income and education, either in Brazil or other countries. Regarding safety in MP use, frequently there is no correct identification of species, its origin, its preparation and the appropriate dose for each case. Finally, failure to approach these contents during training of healthcare professionals generates less knowledge, less research and more prejudice due to lack of information, impairing incentive and dissemination to the community. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - The present study investigated how 380 early childhood pre-service teachers perceived equity in science education and how they planned to incorporate their equity concept into their future science teaching practices. An inductive thematic analysis of the data collected indicated that the majority of pre-service teachers harboured misconceptions about equity in science education. They also conceptualized equity in science education as involving English learners, something unrelated to children’s racial/ethnic backgrounds. Colorblindness and deficit beliefs were pervasive among pre-service teachers. One important implication is the need for pre-service teachers to understand that resolving opportunity gaps in science education between dominant and nondominant children depends on building their knowledge of equitable science instruction. Another implication is the need for ECE science teacher educators to create opportunities for pre-service teachers to identify their own cultural backgrounds, as well as to critically and continuously reflect on their own biases and prejudices towards children who come from diverse backgrounds. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This article focuses on a particular group in capitalist society that is disabled, demeaned and denied by capitalism itself, through processes of economic exploitation, systematic and systemic class exclusion, and discrimination/ prejudice-that is-the working class. In doing so I recognise that the working class (defined as all those who sell their/our labour power) is segmented horizontally into `layers’, or strata (for example, the dispossessed, unemployed, unskilled, though to the supervisory. managerial level/stratum) and also vertically, for example, by `race’and by gender, with particular ethnic groups, and women in general, disabled and oppressed and exploited to a greater degree than their/ our white, male sisters and brothers). Analysing from a Classical Marxist perspective I address the structures of the capitalist state through which this exclusion and `subalternising’ is imposed, through formal state structures such as education, media, the panoply of state force and class law, as well as through the material power of the capitalist class, expressed through, for example, wage suppression and enforced immiseration of the majority of the working class. In doing so I address two types of neo-Marxist analysis-`Structuralist neo-Marxism’ and ‘Culturalist neo-Marxism’, and the dialectical relationship between them. They differ on such matters as: the degree of `relative autonomy' for resistant agency; the relative impact and import of cultural-ideological as against structural-material analysis; and the salience or not of social class analysis, the Capital-Labour relation, vis-a vis other forms of oppression such as `race; and gender', and their implications for political resistance and organisation at the cultural-ideological level and at the level of power, the material power to reform and revolutionise economic and social relations of Capital. I propose an activist programme of resistance at two levels. Firstly, societal level, looking at Marxists such as Marx and Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky and the dialectical relationship between Reform and Revolution. Secondly, at the level of Education, both formal and informal (through social movements, political parties, trade unions, through public pedagogy for example). Within the formal education structures, I advance specific proposals regarding schooling and teacher education. This is a panoptic paper-the issues above are linked in terms of Classical Marxist analysis of capitalism, class exploitation and oppression, and the implications of such analysis for the praxis and politics of resistance. © 2022, Institute for Education Policy Studies.

AB  - It is widely accepted that individuals with convictions are disadvantaged when trying to access the job market. People convicted of sexual offences face further prejudice and stigma given the nature of the most extreme examples of their offences. Desiring employment but being unable to secure it presents challenges for the individual. This study focused on the real and perceived barriers that twelve British men experienced while seeking employment with a criminal record pertaining to a sexual offence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with interview data analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Two superordinate themes emerged. Stigma as a Barrier to Employment explored the impact of the disclosure of the sexual criminal record at interview and the enduring stigmatisation the participants faced as a result of the ‘sex offender’ identity. In the second theme, Autonomy and Control, participants sought to explain the personal significance of being employed, and how their inability to secure employment had resulted in the loss of autonomy and the introduction of self-isolating behaviours. Finally, they acknowledged having felt ‘better off’ in prison at times, due to the lasting effects of social exclusion. The implications of the research are discussed further. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the role that teachers play in preventing the expression of blatant and subtle prejudice among students. Using a self-reported survey conducted in the south of France, we investigated the attitudes of 1,858 middle and high school students. Multivariate analyses show that when students see their teachers addressing issues about racism, discrimination and cultural diversity in the classroom, their attitudes of intolerance decrease. Nevertheless, mediation and moderation models highlight the existence of external factors, such as the parents’ educational attainment, that affect the students’ capacity to internalise their teachers’ discourse. Contrary to our expectations, the students’ level of trust in the education system has no significant influence on their perception of the effectiveness of teacher interventions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study used in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of women with disabilities in Burkina Faso to explore how discrimination based on gender and disability intersects and influences exposure to violence, as well as the impact of such discrimination on social participation, a theme barely studied in West Africa. The study thematically analysed the narratives of 35 women with disabilities–including mental, physical, auditory and visual–(age range = 15-53), rural and urban that were collected through four focus groups and eight case stories of rape survivors. As presented in the statements of the women surveyed, the combination of stereotypes and prejudices linked to disability and unequal gender relations make these women predominantly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially sexual violence. This increased vulnerability to sexual assault emphasises the processes of social exclusion these women experience, at all levels of society, which for most of them results in limited social participation. The findings of this study showed the need for policies related to women’s empowerment and inclusion of people with disabilities to adopt an intersectional approach, to better consider the specific issues of women with disabilities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Bricolage is commonly recognized as a practice of non-Traditional resource mobilization by immigrant entrepreneurs within their country of residence. When the host country is in an adversarial social and institutional context characterized by the liability of foreignness, we posit that accessing "resources at hand"in the external environment is hampered by anti-immigrant sentiments, both socially and institutionally. Through a rigorous analysis of eight cases of immigrant entrepreneurs and their South African-based enterprises, we apply Bourdieu's theory of practice to examine the practice of bricolage at a more nuanced level. Our findings suggest that the localized prejudice against immigrants 'otherizes' their foreignness, and in turn, heightens the entrepreneurs' awareness of their habitus. We argue that the immigrants' 'heightened habitus' represents an internalization of both cognitive (i.e. resources at head) and adaptive (i.e. resources at heart) dispositions informed by the home country, and which serve as crucial endogenous resources by which to reimagine and reconstruct external resources accessed via local social capital. We present the novel theoretical contribution of immigrant entrepreneurial bricolage as the utilization of both endogenous resources at head and heart, which are activated by-and intended to overcome-their liability of foreignness. Our contribution also aims to reconstruct the frequently referenced exogenous resources at hand. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2022.

AB  - This qualitative analysis examines school social workers’ equity work for immigrant students, including their perceptions of immigration enforcement and school climates that support or hinder immigrant student experiences. We conceptually expand understandings of nested contexts of reception and racialized organizations across macro, meso, micro levels, and how they affect immigrant students’ educational experiences, mobility, and belonging. Utilizing open-ended responses from a unique national survey data set, we examine school social workers’ perceptions of the macro, meso, micro racialized contexts that immigrant students encounter, how school social worker perceptions reflect racial attitudes as part of the racialized organization of schools in which they work, and how such racial attitudes influence their actions and potentially disrupt racial inequality in schools. Discussion of the impact of school social workers’ racial attitudes, and perceptions of racialized contexts and how they influence school social workers’ advocacy for immigrant students is offered. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The essay deals with the problem of the empirical analysis of the concept of social distance using a temporal rather than a spatial approach. To this end, the Bogardus’ Social Distance Scale is introduced by emphasizing that it was defined by employing a spatial perspective and describing the socio-cultural environment in which it was designed. Then, it is illustrated a temporal perspective to empirically investigate the concept of social distance introducing the concepts of allochronism, social time and standard time. In particular, it is argued that social time has close connections with our perceptions, interpretations, values, needs and cultures, and as such is particularly suitable for investigating socio-temporal distance. Moreover—as the main focus of this essay—the methodological procedure used by the author to examine the socio-temporal distance of ethnic relations between migrants and natives in Italy is illustrated. By comparing significant indicators suitable for assessing living conditions, it will become evident how the two social groups live in different temporal worlds, although they are physically contemporary. In particular, it is shown how migrants live in a temporal bubble that represents a “piece” of modernity inserted in a postmodern world. It is concluded that studying social distance using a temporal approach is very effective and has several applications: it can be used not only for ethnic relations but also for research on minority, weak, marginal groups, in gender or intergenerational studies, and in all fields in which gaps/disparities/ inequalities must be compared. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Microaggressions are subtle insults, invalidations, or slights that target people due to their association with a marginalized group. Microaggressive experiences have been shown to degrade quality of life and corroborate negative stereotypes towards persons with disabilities. To date, minimal research has been dedicated to exploring microaggressions within adults who stutter. Methods: Seven adults who stutter participated in semi-structured focus group interviews similar to Keller and Galgay's (2010) qualitative investigation of microaggressions experienced by adults with a disability. Group interviews were transcribed and analyzed using QSR NVivo software to develop themes and subthemes. Results: Eight major themes were identified within two supraordinate themes: Microaggressive Behavior (patronization, second-class status, perceived helplessness, workplace microaggression, clinical microaggression, denial of privacy) and Perception of Microaggressive Behavior (exoneration of listener, no or minimal microaggressive experience). Although patronization, second-class status, and helplessness were mentioned frequently by multiple participants, exoneration of the listener was the most frequently recurring theme. Discussion: Based on these preliminary focus group interviews, stuttering-based microaggressions broadly resemble ableist microaggressions reported by Keller and Galgay (2010). Interviewees also expressed a reluctance to identify slights related to stuttering as microaggression and often characterized these incidents as unavoidable. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - People with visible skin diseases often experience stigmatisation. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a new intervention for medical students to counter the stigmatisation of people with skin di-seases. The intervention was evaluated using a ran-domised controlled design. Effectiveness was as-sessed at 3 time points. Data from 127 participants were analysed. Regarding the outcome “social dis-tance”, a significant difference between the measurement points was observed for the intervention group (χ2(2) = 54.32, p &lt; 0.001), which also showed a significant effect on agreement with negative stereotypes (F(1.67, 118.67) = 23.83, p &lt; 0.001, partial η2 = 0.25). Regarding the outcome “agreement with disease-re-lated misconceptions”, a significant difference between the measurement time points was observed for the intervention group (χ2(2) = 46.33, p &lt; 0.001); simi-lar results were found for the outcome “stigmatising behaviour” (F(1.86, 131.89) = 6.16, p = 0.003, partial η2 = 0.08). The results should encourage medical facul-ties to invest in such courses in order to prevent stig-matisation of people with skin diseases. © 2022, Medical Journals/Acta D-V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Immigrant communities in Chile face barriers to their integration, in the form of discrimination and social exclusion. Psychology of liberation claims that, when minority groups experience oppressing conditions, community engagement can be a path toward integration. Nevertheless, community participation has been mainly studied in North America and Europe. Through a concurrent nested mixed-method design, this study explores the relation between community engagement and perception of integration of Peruvian immigrants in Santiago de Chile. One hundred and ten Peruvians (age range 19 to 52 years), engaged in migrant organizations (MOs), completed a self-report questionnaire that aims to identify the predictors of integration based on psychosocial perspective (education), acculturation (national identity and ethnic identity), and liberation psychology literature (perceived institutional sensitivity, knowledge of the Chilean culture and laws). Additionally, 18 Peruvian leaders (ages 31 to 56 years) were interviewed in order to explore intergroup relations and organizational strategies that their MOs use to enhance integration. An interesting and novel finding points to the role of a Latin-American identity that appears to have potential negative consequences in maintaining the status quo for the social exclusion that Peruvians currently face. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - When students are grouped into school tracks, this has lasting consequences for their learning and later careers. In Germany to date, some groups of students (boys, ethnic minority students) are underrepresented in the highest track. Stereotypes about these groups exist that entail negative expectations about their suitability for the highest track. Based on the shifting standards model, the present research examines if and how stereotypes influence tracking recommendations. According to this theory, members of negatively stereotyped groups will be judged more leniently or more strictly depending on the framing of the judgment situation (by inducing minimum or confirmatory standards). N = 280 teacher students participated in a vignette study in which they had to choose the amount of positive evidence for suitability they wanted to see before deciding to recommend a fictitious student to the highest track. A 2 (judgment standard: minimum vs. confirmatory) × 2 (target student’s gender: male vs. female) × 2 (target student’s ethnicity: no migration background vs. Turkish migration background) between-subjects design was used. No effects of target gender occurred, but the expected interaction of target’s ethnicity and judgment standard emerged. In the minimum standard condition, less evidence was required for the ethnic minority student to be recommended for the highest track compared to the majority student. In the confirmatory standards condition, however, participants tended to require less evidence for the ethnic majority student. Our experiment underlines the importance of the framing of the recommendation situation, resulting in a more lenient or stricter assessment of negatively stereotyped groups. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at mAP 0.5 and mAP [0.50 : 0.95], respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few-shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The General Social Survey (GSS) shows that many self-identified white adults continue to hold racial attitudes that can be regarded, collectively, as a persistent social problem. Similar to findings from the analysis of electoral surveys, the GSS also shows that these racial attitudes have more strongly predicted political behavior since 2012. However, and in contrast to group-identity interpretations of these patterns, the increase in predictive power since 2012 is attributable to a positive development: above and beyond the effects of cohort replacement, support for compensatory interventions to address black-white inequalities has increased substantially, whereas prejudice and bigotry have decreased slightly. Because these changes have been larger on the political left than on the political right, the attitudes have gained in overall predictive power. © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Housing First (HF) has spread on the international scene as an evidence-based intervention to overcome homelessness among people with mental health problems. In Brazil, the HF has been adopted as a reference in the development of initiatives geared to people living in the streets who make harmful use of drugs. Studies point to the need for greater understanding of the dynamics of implementation in different settings. Thus, using the literature review method, we analyzed the factors that facilitate and hinder the implementation of HF. Sixty-eight papers published from 2003 to 2020 were selected from the PubMed, Scopus, PsychoINFO, Embase, Lilacs, and Scielo databases. We identified factors in four dimensions: Intervention characteristics, implementation context, institutional aspects, and implementation process. The unavailability of housing, the lack of coordination of the services needed by residents, and the resistance of implementing agents to the HF principles are factors that hinder the implementation. In turn, agents with values, attitudes, and skills converging with the model and continuing education appear as facilitators. We point out the need to understand and favor the HF integration process in the existing social protection systems. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify the extent of implicit and explicit bias in a sample of pharmacy students and to determine whether there is an association between implicit bias, explicit bias, and responses to clinical cases. Methods. Investigators sent links to two online surveys to students at six US schools and colleges of pharmacy. In the first survey, students responded to two clinical cases. Students were presented with a picture of a White or Black patient with each clinical case. On the second survey, students indicated their level of racial implicit bias as assessed by the Harvard Implicit Association Test and their level of racial explicit bias. Pearson’s correlation was used to determine the correlation between bias and responses to the clinical cases. Results. Three hundred fifty-seven first, second, and third year pharmacy students responded to both surveys (response rate 52%). The students who were presented with the picture of a Black patient rated the patient’s pain and the reliability of the patient’s family as higher than students presented with the picture of a White patient. Students had more negative implicit and explicit bias towards Black patients. Neither implicit nor explicit bias correlated with student responses to the clinical cases. Conclusion. Evidence of slight to moderate negative implicit bias and slight negative explicit bias towards Black patients was identified in this group of pharmacy students. Future studies that include a more representative population and heighten the stakes of the clinical scenario should be done to investigate a possible correlation between bias and clinical behaviors. © 2022, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore if the learning of biographical writing contributes to the positive views and attitudes towards others of different groups. The paper used the Research and Development approach by designing and implementing a learning model of biographical writing. The subjects of this study were 200 seventh-grade students having different ethnic and religious backgrounds from nine junior high schools. The data-collecting method was pretest-posttest. The results of the study demonstrated that the average scores of the aspects of student empathy, student positive attitudes towards ethnic differences, and student positive attitudes towards religious differences increased in all the schools investigated. The increase of average score in the aspect of student empathy, positive attitudes towards ethnic differences, and positive attitudes towards religious differences could be classified into three categories: High, medium, and low. Most of the schools under study experienced medium and low increases of average score in all aspects. © 2022 Eurasian Society of Educational Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Historical, social representations about stigma and prejudice related to unhoused people cause psychological distress, feeling of shame, and withdrawal from family and social relationships. This paper aimed to understand how unhoused people and health professionals perceive, repro-duce, elaborate, and address the representations produced by their social conditions. This qualitative research employed participant observation, interviews with 24 unhoused people, and a focus group with professionals from the services provid-ing care to the unhoused people. The study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where crack use is very prevalent. An analysis was performed using the phenomenological narrative method. Stereotyping conjures the self-image of an un-worthy, unwanted person, which justifies daily discrimination and, above all, the loss of the most critical condition of all beings, namely, their hu-man condition, besides legitimizing the lack of care and violence against them. Deepening the relationship between prejudice and discrimination in the context of vulnerable populations and health services can assist therapeutic projects that promote the reduction of psychological distress, better care, and social recognition of citizenship of the unhoused people. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - The comprehensive, twofold goal of this paper is to investigate how social identities in a multilayered social platform of a public hospital are shaped, and to explain the impact of these identities on staff interrelations, patients, and the organization’s overall ability to meet challenges. We conducted a qualitative study, collecting data from 30 employees working in a medium-sized public hospital in Israel using a semi-structured interview guide. Using a thematic analysis approach and drawing on social identity theory, we found that departmental identity is the most prominent social identity associated with the hospital staff. This identity was strengthened by strong in-group management, but little influenced by senior out-group management; its importance also caused organizational goals to be overlooked. We discuss these findings and offer recommendations for addressing the adverse impacts of departmental identity on staff, patients, and the organization’s ability to meet challenges. This study has clarified sources and impacts of SI in a hospital context. It has also demonstrated the need for a more unified hospital identity to improve the hospital’s daily work and achieve the organization’s goals in a dynamic, competitive environment. Most literature on social identity has addressed personal- and group-level antecedents of social identity, neglecting the potential participation of in-group and out-group management in shaping these identities, as well as management’s contribution to the achievement or nonachievement of organizational goals. By adopting a qualitative approach, the current study provides a deeper understanding of how senior management and direct in-group management can shape social identities—a perspective heretofore missing from the research. Recognizing these identity-shaping forces is essential for understanding the challenges that hospitals face, and the various (at times, life-or-death) consequences of these forces. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Despite a large proportion of working mothers in the American workforce, research suggests that negative stereotypes and discrimination against working mothers continue to exist. In a set of two experimental studies, the current paper examined subtle discrimination against non-pregnant, working mothers in different hiring settings. In Study 1, using a between-subject field experiment and applying for geographically dispersed jobs with manipulated resumes, we found evidence for subtle discrimination, such that mothers received more negativity in callback messages than women without children, men without children, and fathers. They were also rejected more quickly than women without children and fathers. In Study 2, using a more controlled experimental paradigm, we tested our hypothesis in a hypothetical interview evaluation setting. We found that mothers faced more interpersonal hostility across different job types as compared to women without children. Together, these studies highlight the presence of subtle discrimination against working mothers at different stages of the hiring process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As social policies have changed to grant more rights to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, some Christians in the United States have suggested that LGBT rights impede Christians’ religious freedom. Across five studies, we examined the causes and consequences of zero-sum beliefs (ZSBs) about Christians and LGBT individuals. We demonstrate that Christians’ beliefs about conflict with sexual minorities are shaped by their understandings of Christian values, social change, interpretation of the Bible, and in response to religious institutions. In Study 1, heterosexual cisgender Christians endorsed ZSBs more than other groups. Christians reported perceiving that anti-LGBT bias has decreased over time while anti-Christian bias has correspondingly increased. In Study 2, Christians’ zero-sum beliefs increased after they reflected on religious values, suggesting that intergroup conflict is seen as being a function of Christian beliefs. Study 3 confirmed the role of symbolic threat in driving ZSBs; perceived conflict was accentuated when Christians read about a changing cultural climate in which Christians’ influence is waning. An intervention using Biblical scripture to encourage acceptance successfully lowered zero-sum beliefs for mainline but not fundamentalist Christians (Study 4). A final field study examined how ZSBs predict sexual prejudice in response to changing group norms. After a special conference in which the United Methodist Church voted to restrict LGBT people from marriage and serving as clergy, zero-sum beliefs became a stronger predictor of sexual prejudice (Study 5). We discuss the implications of Christian/LGBT ZSBs for religious freedom legislation, attitudes toward sexual minorities, and intergroup conflict more generally © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Transformative travel is based on the sustainable approach of encouraging travelers to immerse themselves at the destination, be challenged, engage in introspection, identify their prejudices, and develop worldviews that are more inclusive of others’ beliefs, knowledge, and customs. A significant gap present in the transformative travel literature is the lack of understanding of the travelers’ external activism outcomes, which are outcomes related to a perceived change in the travelers’ personal role in supporting societal change (e.g. becoming an activist). This area is crucial to examine because the ultimate goal of self-reflection in travelers is to sustain external activism. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate whether travelers express the presence of external activism outcomes in their discourse of perceived transformation. Travelers, who describe themselves as being transformed, share their discourse of external activism outcomes via short-answer testimonies, which are analyzed using content analysis. Their discourse reveals that travelers frame external activism as outcomes of their perceived transformation. Practitioners can use findings to advocate and market transformative travel as a sustainable way to foster inclusivity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Though much work has examined how sexual orientation and body shape are jointly constituted, less has examined the joint perception of body shape, gender/sex, and sexuality. We draw upon multifarious person perception approaches to examine how personality and sexuality-related traits are attributed to bodies of varying shape (skinny, average, fat) when presented with differing social identities along the axes of gender/sex (male, female) and sexual orientation (heterosexual, lesbian/gay). In a sample of 991 participants, we found robust evidence that trait application varied by both body shape and sexual orientation. Further, supporting our hypotheses, we found that gay male bodies were perceived as more feminine than heterosexual male bodies, and skinny male bodies were perceived as more feminine than other body shapes. Supporting additional hypothesizing, lesbian female bodies were perceived as more masculine than heterosexual female bodies, and fat female bodies were perceived as the most masculine across sexual orientations. Partially supporting our hypotheses, we found that average bodies were perceived as the most typical for all identities; further, bodies perceived as less typical of their social identity category were perceived as experiencing heightened prejudice on the basis of body shape. © 2022 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - Recently, an increasing number of scholars have been showing interest in old-fashioned racism again. While recent studies on old-fashioned racism apparently increase our knowledge of this psychological theory of racism, the studies actually shed light on a different type of racism, namely offensive racism. The aim of this text is to argue that psychological theories of racism, like old-fashioned racism and modern racism, depend on societies’ social norms. I will show that questionnaires are highly sensitive to social norms, and if there is change in social norms, the original measurement object alters. The theory of old-fashioned racism implicitly assumes agents that follow (or conform to) the social norm to behave prejudiced. Today, however, this social norm does not exist in Western societies. If agents express the same prejudices today, they indicate their willingness to breach the social norm to behave unprejudiced. Thereby, classic old-fashioned racism measures reflect a new kind of racism today. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Contact between different groups (i.e., intergroup contact) is well supported as a means to reduce negative intergroup attitudes. It is important, however, to explore outcomes of intergroup contact beyond intergroup attitudes, especially outcomes tied to social change such as policy support. We examined the relationship between intergroup contact and support (or lack of support) for cannabis-related policies and penalties specific to immigrants. We examined this in Canada, where the recent legalization of cannabis led to new policies with varying degrees of public support. Among Canadian undergraduates, we found that more contact with immigrants was associated with lower support for relatively harsh cannabis-related penalties for immigrants. In particular, having higher-quality contact with immigrants was associated with greater opposition to such penalties. Additionally, those higher in right-wing ideology were more supportive of penalties for outgroup members (immigrants) than ingroup members (Canadians in general). Future directions and potential implications of the findings are discussed © 2021. Canadian Psychological Association

AB  - Based on an integrated model of doctor–patient psychological mechanisms, the formation mechanism of doctor-–patient trust was systematically demonstrated from the healthcare professional (HCP)’s perspective integrating intergroup relations (expectations), interpersonal relations (communication), and psychosocial (stereotypes). The results of a survey of 3000 doctors and nurses from 14 provinces in eastern, central, and western China support the rationality of an integrated model of doctor–patient psychological mechanisms. The establishment of doctor–patient trust is influenced by the direct role of primary intergroup factors, the indirect role of immediate interpersonal interactions, and the moderating role of social psychology. Specifically, (1) doctor–patient trust is directly predicted by HCP’s expectation and indirectly influenced by communication; (2) stereotypes regulate the relationship between HCP’s expectation, communication, and doctor–patient trust: the activation of positive stereotypes enhances the positive relationship among the three; Negative stereotypes only positively contribute to mediated pathway-communication behaviors and have a weaker facilitation effect compared to positive stereotypes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Guided by the following questions: (1) What are the experiences of immigrant children attending schools in communities experiencing police brutality and anti-immigrant sentiments? (2) How do middle school children of immigrants visually represent their experiences with legal violence? and (3) What are children’s visions of freedom and community safety in this context?, this article highlights the understudied preadolescent children of immigrants through a 2-year study of a multidisciplinary theater class at a local elementary school in South Central Los Angeles. Data includes child interviews, class observations, artwork, and performance videos, from recently arrived Mexican and Central American children aged 10 to 13 years. Findings reveal how children come to understand policing, reinforcing concepts like “good cop/bad cop,” conflating local police and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents, but also imagining alternatives for community safety outside of police systems. This work contributes to the fields of immigration, abolitionist education, and ethnic studies, among others, offering new ways of supporting immigrant children through the use of arts-based tools. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Intraminority solidarity research has previously focused on how similarities in discrimination experiences can facilitate stigma-based solidarity. Yet, research on a lay theory of generalized prejudice has demonstrated that people tend to perceive attitudes towards stigmatized social groups as co-occurring. Integrating these lines of research, the present studies sought to examine if the extent to which prejudices are perceived to co-occur can facilitate stigma-based solidarity for marginalized social groups, and in turn promote interest in coalitional justice. Recruiting heterosexual Black Americans (Study 1), White women (Studies 2–3), and White men (Study 4), the present research demonstrates that perceiving prejudices as co-occurring increases stigma-based solidarity that in turn produces greater interest in coalitional justice efforts that include the ingroup. The present findings demonstrate the importance of focusing on beliefs about perpetrators’ attitudes when examining intraminority solidarity and highlight the limitations of a lay theory of generalized prejudice to fight prejudices broadly. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This article contributes to the emerging literature on gender studies, in general, and on the LGBTQ+ phenomenon, in particular. While the global society recognizes the rights of the third sex, other countries are reluctantly acknowledging while inadvertently stigmatizing LGBTQ+ individuals. Unfortunately, some Filipino same-sex couples were still the target of ridicule, criticism, and prejudice. In this paper, we analyzed via a biographical narrative the relationship dynamics of same-sex Filipino couples confronted with homophobia, heteronormativity, and discrimination. Biographical narratives established an excellent way of making theoretical sense of social phenomena such as gender studies. To do this, we interviewed same-sex couples from the provinces of Western Visayas, Philippines. The results revealed interdisciplinary perspectives that reflected the basis for engaging and maintaining such a relationship. A recurring essence across all identified perspectives that compelled same-sex couples to stay in a relationship was their mutual love. Mutual love becomes a strong driving force that keeps the relationship between same-sex couples all the more substantial while facing heterosexual society's disapprobation. The concepts of love and friendship, by extension, genuine same-sex relationship, when properly understood, can go beyond the border of human instinctual tendencies. Such impartial manifestation of love can extend across cultural differences and eventually build crossroads as avenues of sharing what one has without counting the cost. We recommend the need to further the campaign against homophobic views, albeit providing counseling intervention and psycho-education that help improve the psychological well-being of same-sex couples. © 2022 Montaño1 et al.

AB  - Introduction: The United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities identified the Chinese blind massage policy as “reserved employment” in its Concluding Observations in 2012. In response, this paper reviewed the policy on blind massage in China and discussed its effectiveness and social impact. Methods: Adopting a historical perspective, this paper describes the development stages of the blind massage policy in China. It reveals the social construction process of the blind massage policy. Government data were provided to help analyze the positive and negative effects of the policy according to the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Results: The blind massage policy is a national strategy involving semi-reserved employment to improve the low employment rate of people with visual impairments in China. It promoted employment of people with visual impairments at the start, but, as the system of the blind massage gradually took shape, it restricted these individuals from choosing a career freely. The blind massage policy has resulted in deep-rooted social prejudices, and it demonstrates disability-based discrimination and charity-oriented practices. Discussion: The Chinese blind massage policy is discriminatory and does not reflect the modern concept of disability rights advocated in the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Implications for Practitioners: The Chinese government needs to promote institutional reforms to provide better education and employment for people with visual impairments to change the limited content of vocational training and eliminate discriminatory policies. © American Foundation for the Blind 2022.

AB  - Anger is a key emotion in terms of understanding public responses toward crime: it is frequently mobilized in public discourses and is elicited by specific incidents. This study focuses on intuitive anger: a rapidly emerging negative emotional response that eschews principles of punishment but nevertheless contributes to punitiveness. This study uses facial electromyography to measure intuitive anger, and assess its effect on punitiveness drawing on data collected among university students in Canada (N = 87). The study’s repeated-measures experimental design allows for testing the hypotheses that: (i) individuals will experience greater intuitive angry responses when making punitive decisions for purported ‘stereotypical criminals’ and that (ii) anger will appear early in the decision-making process, and lead to more punitive decisions. The results of crossed-multilevel regression models provide evidence of the manifestation of anger within half of a second of individuals’ engagement in punitive decision-making. Intuitive anger follows principles that are central to intergroup relations, although it was not found to be predictive of rapid punitive decisions. The findings are discussed in terms of the moral and social implications of intuitive anger in the context of punitiveness toward crime. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Same-sex marriage and family counselors usually do not have enough experience and training background to help same-sex couples with marriage and family issues. Some counselors may have a personal bias toward same-sex couples due to the absence of same-sex couples and families’ background. Marriage and family counselors provide counseling services to their clients with marriage and family problems and conflicts, resulting in a positive recovery negotiation. The purpose of this study was to understand and investigate the attitudes of marriage and family counselors regarding same-sex couples and families, an area ignored in mainstream marriage and family counseling. Based on 300 surveys and 38 interviews from marriage and family counselors in the United States, the researcher categorized that more than half of the participants expressed negative attitudes against same-sex couples and families, due to cheating, unsafe sexual activities, and domestic violence. Some counselors refused to provide counseling services to same-sex couples and families due to misunderstanding and prejudice. The results suggested that additional in-service professional developments and curriculum reforms are essential to promoting multicultural family structure. © 2022 Luis Miguel Dos Santos.

AB  - Deprovincialization is a set of attitudes characterized by two sides: a nuanced and fresh perspective on the in-group culture and an open and accepting attitude toward other groups. After reviewing early research and indirect tests of the construct, we focused our attention on research investigating these two sides of deprovincialization. Studies conducted in various countries demonstrate that deprovincialization as in-group cultural nuance is a strong and reliable correlate of reduced prejudice and improved intergroup relations; moreover, it is distinct from both national identification and cultural relativism. Studies conducted in Italy show that deprovincialization as openness toward other groups is related to positive intergroup contact and intergroup harmony and has longitudinal negative effects on prejudice. Importantly, in both lines of research the beneficial role of deprovincialization goes beyond the effects of constructs such as social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, nationalism, and demographic variables. We conclude by proposing suggestions for future research and highlighting relevant issues to be considered in policy development and implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Previous studies on public depression stigma did not include different severity levels and thus, did not adequately consider the continuum notion of depressive disorders. Aims: We address the following research questions: 1. Are there differences in public depression stigma according to different severity levels? 2. Is stigma associated with sociodemographic characteristics, experience with depressive symptoms, and symptom severity? Methods: Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted in winter 2019/2020 in Germany (N = 1009). Three vignettes representing mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms were used. Three indicators of stigma were assessed: negative stereotypes, anger reactions, and desire for social distance. Age, sex, education, and experience with depression (own affliction, contact) were additionally introduced into multiple linear regression analyses. Results: Overall, negative stereotypes, anger reactions, and desire for social distance do not significantly vary by depression symptom severity. All components of depression stigma showed positive associations with age, while anger was negatively associated with experiences. Conclusions: Our results do not indicate that public depression stigma is more pronounced when symptoms are more severe. Conclusion is ambivalent: Persons with severe depression do not seem to be additionally burdened by increased stigma, but the German public holds stigmatizing attitudes even towards individuals with mild depressive symptoms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examined the impact of native youth’s subjective well-being on exclusionary attitudes toward immigrants, seeking to understand the relationship between subjective well-being, political distrust, and anti-immigrant attitudes over time. Using longitudinal data, we followed three cohorts of native young adults (N = 1352; Mage = 22.72, SD = 3.1) in Sweden over a period of 2 years. The results showed that subjective well-being did not predict an increase in anti-immigrant attitudes among native youth, but anti-immigrant attitudes had a significant impact on subjective well-being. The data also found bidirectional and mutually reinforcing relationships between subjective well-being and political distrust, and between political distrust and anti-immigrant attitudes. These results highlight that improving young adults’ subjective well-being represents an important basis for preventing the development of political distrust, which in turn could reduce native youth’s susceptibility to adopt hostile attitudes toward immigrants. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions in our contact with others and the introduction of social distancing barriers. These rules can enhance the psychological mechanisms resulting from fear of contamination and may lead to exacerbating prejudiced attitudes towards certain social groups seen as possible carriers of infection. Fear of infection and ideas about cleanliness and dirtiness have indeed historically and culturally influenced the way we interact with other people, both on an inter-personal and inter-group level. The aim of the present research is to analyse whether the concern about COVID-19 is linked to prejudices towards other social groups and whether this relationship is mediated by individual representations of cleanliness. Results on 251 Italian citizens showed that concerns about COVID-19 are positively related to prejudicial attitudes towards immigrants and that such a relation is indeed mediated by so-called cultural representations of cleanliness. Specifically, the so-called cultural representations of hygiene—by which people and groups are categorized as being more or less civilized on the basis of their cleaning practices—was a significant mediator.

AB  - In interpersonal relations, it is known that expressing self-conscious emotions such as guilt and shame following a transgression is beneficial to reconciliation. In the current research, we examine whether this also applies to intergroup relations. Groups of three persons played an intergroup version of the “centipede game,” in which one party can cooperate with or exploit another party. In Study 1, two groups played six rounds of this game in each of two phases. Between phases, groups rated how much guilt, shame, and pride they experienced in relation to how they had performed in Phase 1; these ratings were shared with the opposing group. Groups expressing high levels of guilt and shame were associated with greater cooperation in Phase 2, whereas groups expressing high levels of pride were associated with lower cooperation in Phase 2. In Study 2, all groups played against a “group” programmed to behave in an exploitative way in Phase 1. This group then expressed shame, pride, or no emotion (control) about its performance. Cooperation in Phase 2 was significantly higher in the shame than in the pride condition, and altruistic punishment was highest in the pride condition and lowest in the shame condition. Between them, these studies show that emotional expression plays an important role in repairing intergroup relationships and in particular that expressing shame about a transgression enhances intergroup cooperation following a transgression. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In response to U.S. government restrictions imposed as part of a nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic, charismatic worship leader Sean Feucht began a series of worship concerts. Feucht positioned these protests as expressions of Christian religious freedom in opposition to mandated church closings and a perceived double-standard regarding the large gatherings of protesters over police violence against Black and Brown persons. Government restrictions challenged the sine qua non liturgical act of encounter with God for evangelicals, Pentecostals, and Charismatics: congregational singing in Praise and Worship. However, as Feucht’s itinerant worship concerts traversed urban spaces across the U.S. to protest these restrictions, the events gained a double valence. Feucht and event attendees sought to channel God’s power through musical worship to overturn government mandates and, along the way, they invoked longstanding social and racial prejudices toward urban spaces. In this essay, I argue that Feucht’s events reveal complex theological motivations that weave together liturgical-theological, social, and political concerns. Deciphering this complex tapestry requires a review of both the history of evangelical engagement with urban spaces and the theological history of Praise and Worship. Together, these two sets of historical resources generate a useful frame for considering how Feucht, as a charismatic musical worship leader, attempts to wield spiritual power through musical praise to change political situations and the social conditions. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Longstanding and negative stereotypes regarding athletes’ academic performance can have negative impacts. In this paper, two experimental studies on such stereotypes that explore the effects of identity safety and the benefits of self-complexity interventions are presented. In Study 1, 124 high school athletes were divided into two groups and instructed to read short texts containing descriptions of identity safety and identity uncertainty, respectively. Subsequently, we administered a questionnaire on academic values and allowed participants to select between learning activities of varying difficulty. In Study 2, 112 high school athletes were divided into two groups and given short texts to read containing descriptions of identity safety and identity uncertainty. Subsequently, the participants were further divided into groups that received a high or low self-complexity intervention. We used the change in participants’ selection of the difficulty level of the learning activity as an indicator of the effects of the intervention. The findings revealed that participants in the identity safety group selected academic tasks of higher difficulty after the intervention. In Study 2, the high self-complexity intervention exerted benefits for participants, whereas the participants receiving the low self-complexity intervention selected tasks with lower difficulty. From the motivational perspective, the present findings indicate that building identity-safe environments and implementing high self-complexity interventions can help athletes combat the negative impacts of stereotypes with regard to their academic performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that disgust sensitivity contributes to moral self-regulation. The relationship between religiosity and disgust sensitivity is frequently explored as a moderator of moral-regulating ideologies, such as conservative and traditional ideologies. However, religiosity is suggested to differ from these in moral attitudes against social dominance and racial prejudice. Psychological theories, such as the societal moral intuition and the evolved hazard-perception models, have proposed that there could be reasons to support a distinct relationship between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. These reasons relate to the intuitive pursuit of spiritual purity and the non-secular transcendental emotional-reward value of moral behaviour for religious individuals. In the present manuscript, we conducted the first dedicated meta-analytic review between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. We analysed a summary of forty-seven experimental outcomes, including 48,971 participants. Our analysis revealed a significant positive association (r =.25) between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. This outcome suggests that sensitivity to disgust could have distinct spiritual purity and moral self-regulatory response value for religious individuals. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Past research has shown that intergroup contact can be a promising intervention to improve intergroup relations and that contact-based interventions might be most effective during adolescence. In postconflict Northern Ireland, widespread residential segregation and a largely separate school system limit opportunities for intergroup contact between adolescents from the Catholic and Protestant communities. We evaluated whether a large-scale intervention to facilitate intergroup contact between students attending separate schools (the ‘Shared Education’ program) improves a range of outcomes relevant for intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. We conducted a 5-wave longitudinal, quasi-experimental study that followed a large sample of school students (N = 5,159, Mage = 12.4, age range: 10–14 years; 2,988 girls, 2,044 boys) from 56 predominantly Catholic or Protestant schools from sixth to tenth grade. We compared the developmental trajectories of students who, in 9th (14–15 years) and 10th (15–16 years) grade, shared some classes with students from the other community, as part of the program, to students who did not. We found that participating in shared classes had a medium-size, positive effect on the amount of intergroup contact students had outside of class, and small, positive effects on students’ outgroup attitudes, outgroup trust, and intergroup empathy (but not on their intergroup anxiety, future contact intentions, deprovincialization, or multicultural beliefs). Our findings show that a school-based program of shared education can provide a viable and effective intervention to facilitate intergroup contact, improve intergroup relations, and foster social integration among adolescents at a large scale in a postconflict society © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Friendships with members of our own group (ingroup) and other groups (outgroups) shape our attitudes toward outgroups. Research on intergroup contact has shown that the numbers of outgroup and ingroup friends we have influence our outgroup attitudes, whereas research on socialization has shown that the attitudes held by our friends influence our outgroup attitudes. Past research, however, examined these processes in isolation, which precludes discerning whether having friends, or the attitudes held by our friends, are both important in shaping our outgroup attitudes, and, if so, which is more important. To disentangle these effects, we conducted a 5-wave social network study in 2 ethnically diverse schools (N = 1,170 students). By applying a novel longitudinal coevolution model, we were able to separate the effects of having ingroup and outgroup friends (contact effects), and the effects of those friends’ attitudes (socialization effects), on individuals’ outgroup attitudes, while controlling for friendship selection processes. In so doing, we found that it is principally the attitudes of ingroup friends—not outgroup friends’ attitudes or having ingroup and outgroup friends alone—that predict individuals’ outgroup attitudes. Our findings have important theoretical implications, as we demonstrate that combining the divergent approaches of intergroup contact and socialization enables us to better understand outgroup attitude development. Our findings also have practical implications, as we show that, even in diverse environments, individuals rely primarily on friends from their own group to inform their attitudes toward other groups. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Social justice movements often consist of both targets of bias (e.g., Black people) and nontarget allies (e.g., White people). However, little is known about what factors shape minorities’ perceptions of allies and their ally behaviors. Across four studies, we investigated Black participants’ perceptions of Whites’ motives to engage in ally behaviors. In Study 1, we found that Black participants perceived nontarget allies as both highly internally and externally motivated, suggesting ally motives may be ambiguous to Black perceivers. Studies 2–4 examined the effect of Black participants’ suspicion of Whites’ motives on perceptions of White allies’ sincerity and support for their ally efforts. As predicted, suspicious Black participants perceived White ally protestors, confronters, and political candidates as less sincere than similar Black targets and, in turn, were less supportive of White allies’ efforts. Discussion focuses on how perceived motives of White allies impact perceptions of allies and their ally efforts. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The stigmatizing attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) can be a major barrier to effective patient care. As future physicians, medical students represent a core group that should be targeted with focused knowledge and adequate training to provide patient care without prejudice. The aim of the current study was to examine HIV/AIDS knowledge, and the stigmatizing attitude towards PLWHA, among medical students in Jordan. The current study was based on a self-administered online questionnaire, which was distributed during March–May 2021, involving students at the six medical schools in Jordan, with items assessing demographics, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and HIV/AIDS stigmatizing attitude, which was evaluated using the validated HIVstigma scale. The total number of respondents was 1362, with predominance of females (n = 780, 57.3%). Lack of HIV/AIDS knowledge among the study participants was notable for the following items: HIV transmission through breastfeeding (40.8% correct responses), HIV is not transmitted through saliva (42.6% correct responses), and vertical transmission of HIV can be prevented (48.8% correct responses). Approximately two-thirds of the respondents displayed a positive attitude towards PLWHA. For six out of the 14 HIV/AIDS knowledge items, lack of knowledge was significantly correlated with a more negative attitude towards PLWHA. Multinomial regression analysis showed that a significantly more negative attitude towards PLWHA was found among the preclinical students compared to the clinical students (odds ratio (OR): 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43–0.97, p = 0.036); and that affiliation to medical schools that were founded before 2000 was associated with a more positive attitude towards PLWHA compared to affiliation to recently founded medical schools in the country (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.42–2.42, p < 0.001). About one-third of medical students who participated in the study displayed a negative attitude towards PLWHA. Defects in HIV/AIDS knowledge were detected for aspects involving HIV transmission and prevention, and such defects were correlated with a more negative attitude towards PLWHA. It is recommended to revise the current medical training curricula, and to tailor improvements in the overall HIV/AIDS knowledge, which can be reflected in a more positive attitude towards PLWHA, particularly for the recently established medical schools in the country. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to review themes and methodological strategies of the Brazilian scientific literature regarding families headed by gay and lesbian parents. Methods: We performed the searches in November 2019 and January 2020 in the Web of Science, EBSCOHost, PUBMED/MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases, from 2009 to 2019, in Portuguese and English languages, and yielded 20 eligible articles. We followed PRISMA protocol guidelines and we carried out a thematic analysis in NVivo. Results: Four broad themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the data available in the articles retrieved: (a) Family conceptions: the historical importance of the biological bond and the idea of affection as a means by which these parents and their children co-construct a sense of family; (b) parenting routes and their repercussions for the couple and/or in family relations; (c) prejudice against sexual diversity, social support, and the impact on family relationships; (d) literary and media representations and expectations regarding gay and lesbian parenting. Conclusions: The results showed that most Brazilian research focuses on families headed by lesbian parents that had access to parenthood through reproductive technologies. The most used methodological strategies were cross-sectional designs, snowball sampling, individual semi-structured interviews, and content analysis. The quality assessment indicated that most studies did not describe researchers’ positionality. Policy Implications: Theoretical and empirical research in Brazilian is required to better address family-based stigma and discrimination. However, the present study’s findings can also guide future research and interventions in health care and promotion designed to minimize risks or exposure to adversities and strengthen resilience processes in such family configurations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As global efforts to address COVID-19 become more urgent, the public discourse on attitudes towards immigrants has also become more polarized. In such a heightened social and political context, we study the impact of intergroup contact in political jurisdictions with different shares of minority populations. Drawing on data from the Australian Election Study and the Census, we find that less intergroup contact with neighbours from minority birthplace, language and citizenship backgrounds is correlated with higher anti-immigrant sentiments. These results have significant implications for immigrant-receiving countries with existing legislation and policies that direct immigrants to move to areas of lower population density, lower presence of immigrants, and less previous exposure to international migration. The evidence presented in this study suggests that without sufficient political and policy sensitization to the issues for immigrants living in these areas, there could be detrimental social and political impacts to both immigrants and society more generally. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As autism is an invisible and often stigmatised condition, disclosing the diagnosis may lead to both support and/or discrimination. This mixed-methods questionnaire study examined autistic adults’ experiences of disclosure in various contexts. The sample consisted of 393 participants aged 17–83 years from two longitudinal surveys. Almost all participants disclosed their diagnosis to someone, most commonly to friends. A significant minority of participants studying and/or working at the time had not disclosed to their education provider/employer. Content analysis of open-ended responses showed participants desired to gain understanding and support from disclosure but feared prejudice. While some received support, others encountered dismissiveness and misunderstanding. Findings highlight the need to improve autism understanding and reduce stigma within and beyond educational and employment contexts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: This paper seeks to understand the impact of sustained protests for racial justice on attitudes toward racial minorities, the police, and policies that would benefit racial minorities. Methods: Using a large, nationally representative survey collected before and after the death of George Floyd and the protest movement that followed it, I employ a propensity score matching to identify the causal impact of these protests on perceptions of discrimination against blacks, favorability of the police, racial prejudice, and support for reparations for slavery. I also identify heterogeneous effects in rural America to identify the limits of these attitude shifts. Results: I find evidence that George Floyd's death caused an increased perception of discrimination against blacks, decreased favorability of the police, decreased racial prejudice, and increased support for reparations. I also find muted and heterogeneous effects in rural America. Conclusion: These findings speak to the power of social protest to shift attitudes and policy preferences and to the persistent divide between urban and rural Americans. © 2021 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.

AB  - Objective. To describe whether there are stereotypes towards older adults by the group of teachers in initial training. Method. The approach was quantitative and not probabilistic through a statistical study with university students preparing to become primary school teachers in the Spanish education system. This training profile includes adult and senior education as an additional professional opportunity. The sample (n=110) has been selected among students of the Primary Education Degree. We have applied the Negative Stereotype Questionnaire for the Elderly (CENVE) and the Educational Stereotype Questionnaire for the Elderly (CEEAM). Results. We suggest that the respondents present some degree of stereotypes towards older adults; the stereotype is greater when we question the deterioration of memory and cognitive impairment in general. However, the data are positive, except that in the case of the health factor we found two items in which respondents reported a higher level of stereotyping. Conclusions. Based on these results, we conclude that it is necessary to work on stereotypical perceptions, especially with students pursuing careers related to education, since their professional performance can lead them to develop their teaching careers in adult and senior education. The education professions must be involved in improving quality of life, active aging, and lifelong learning through professional practice and the elimination of personal and societal stereotypes. © 2022 Universidad Nacional.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is permanently changing modern social and economic coexist-ence. Most governments have declared infection control to be their top priority while citizens face great restrictions on their civil rights. A pandemic is an exemplary scenario in which political actors must decide about future, and thus uncertain, events. This paper tries to present a tool well estab-lished in the field of entrepreneurial and management decision making which could also be a first benchmark for political decisions. Our approach builds on the standard epidemiological SEIR model in combination with simulation techniques used in risk management. By our case study we want to demonstrate the opportunities that risk management techniques, especially risk analyses using Monte Carlo simulation, can provide to policy makers in general, and in a public health crisis in particular. Hence, our case study can be used as a framework for political decision making under incomplete information and uncertainty. Overall, we want to point out that a health policy that aims to provide comprehensive protection against infection should also be based on economic criteria. This is without prejudice to the integration of ethical considerations in the final political decision. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In the first few decades of the twentieth century, makeshift shelters known as chozas grew in Madrid. Using historical monographs and the press as main sources, in this article we discuss the influence of medical thinking on the problematisation and eradication of this form of urban growth. During the nineteenth century, scientific racism identified poor housing areas as a source of disease and immorality, yet the public powers in Madrid tolerated and overlooked the development of these spaces until the early twentieth century. It was only when the fear of epidemics and warnings from the press became too great that the authorities began to implement various high-profile ‘sanitary campaigns’ to destroy the shacks. Although these initiatives did not solve the sanitation problems because the deprived populations frequently constructed new living areas, the continued efforts of the public authorities succeeded in displacing the shantytowns to the less regulated periphery. Whilst the spaces were transformed, the representations that signalled them as pathological spaces seems to have remained.

AB  - This paper explores how LatCrit and testimonios were used to explore and make sense of one Afro-Latino adolescent’s immigration story. Picturebooks written by those emic to a community have long been acknowledged as providing a site where children of color can find a space that not only validates their lived experiences but also provides a counternarrative or testimonio that decenters negative hegemonic narratives that position Latiné youth as the “other.” This study contributes to the body of scholarship about the significance of using emic entry-point text picturebooks in middle schools to help youth, parents, and teachers to combat anti-Latiné and Anti-Black-Latiné negative stereotypes as part of a larger effort to cultivate inclusive middle school learning environments. © Copyright © 2021 AMLE.

AB  - Although income inequality has become a focus of political and social discourse, counseling psychology research examining correlates and consequences of legitimizing income inequality remains sparse. A significant barrier to the study of income inequality is the lack of available measures to assess attitudes toward socioeconomic inequality. The purpose of this study was to develop and provide initial validity evidence for the Legitimizing Income Inequality Scale (LIIS). Results supported a bifactor structure for the LIIS with a general factor (ω =.95) and subfactors measuring Social Welfare Beliefs (ω =.92), Economic Fatalism (ω =.87), and Economic Meritocracy Beliefs (ω =.90). The LIIS significantly correlated in theoretically consistent directions with scores on measures of classist attitudes, socioeconomic conservatism, impression management, and colorblind racial attitudes. Implications for future research and training using the LIIS are provided. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Two studies (N1 = 193; N2 = 598) were conducted in Poland to examine the role of two types of ingroup commitment (i.e., national narcissism and national identification) as predictors of attitudes towards immigrants and refugees (disadvantaged groups) and intentions to engage in collective action against them. As predicted, national narcissism (but not national identification) was related to more hostile intergroup attitudes and greater willingness to engage in collective action against refugees and immigrants. The positive effect of national narcissism on intentions to engage in collective action against immigrants and refugees was mediated by attitudes towards those groups. These results show that applying a more fine-grained approach to ingroup commitment (e.g., national narcissism vs. national identification) among advantaged group members allows for a better understanding of their intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions to actively oppose the rights of disadvantaged social groups via collective action. © 2021

AB  - Assumptions about dogs’ personality are influenced by their appearance, which may lead to differences in ownership styles and subsequent canine welfare. The influence of canine appearance on observers’ emotion attributions to dogs remains largely unexplored. This study investigated whether canine head shape is related to how both dog owners and non-dog owning adults in the U.K. attribute emotions to still images of dogs, and in the case of dog owners, to their own dogs. Attachment, respondent personality and dog trainability were assessed as potential influences on emotional attribution in owners. Overall, 2451 participant responses were received. Still images of mesocephalic dogs were attributed primary and positively valenced emotion with more strength and frequency than other groups. Mesocephalic images were also attributed negatively valenced emotions less frequently and with less strength than other groups. Apart from empathy, no significant differences were found in emotional attribution to owned dogs of different head shapes; however, human personality influenced attribution of emotions to owned dogs. The finding that some dogs are attributed emotions more readily based on their appearance alone has applied importance, given, for example, the potential for misattribution of positive emotions to dogs in negative emotional states, and potential prejudice against dogs considered in negative emotional states. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study examined the validity of the contact hypothesis on changing student attitudes toward older adults as well as accessing the benefits of an ongoing intergenerational service-learning program for older adults. The model introduced in this research paired students from a large university in the southeast (mean age = 23) with older adults (mean age = 83) residing in an assisted living facility. A quasi-experimental pre- and posttest design employing the Perceptions of Aging and Elderly Inventory (PAEI) and the Elderly Patient Care Inventory (EPCI) indicated the program had significant positive effects on student attitudes toward aging as well as improving the likelihood of working with older adults. Qualitative accounts provided by students demonstrated a reduction in negative stereotypes and a greater understanding of and empathy for older adults. Comments from older adult participants indicated the stimulating experience improved overall quality of life by reducing boredom and loneliness, maintaining an important connection to the outside world, and serving as a welcomed exchange for keeping them young at heart. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present study contributes an empirical analysis that makes explicit a central social imaginary underpinning organised cultural encounters between ‘locals’ and immigrants: that contact between individuals who would not otherwise meet can lead to long-term inclusion of immigrants. While research on why local populations fear or exclude newcomers is important, our study draws on interviews with locals involved in community initiatives in Norway in the wake of the refugee influx in 2015 to enquire into ideas that guide locals’ practices seeking to include. We find that a ‘promise of inclusion’ forms part of a social imaginary underpinning the organised encounters studied here, featuring ideals of meeting as equals and reciprocity in social relationships while also unveiling how practices of inequality operating within the encounters are common. Emphasising the extent to which it is possible to manage the risk of power inequalities, the study adds to the ongoing academic conversation on organised encounters by distinguishing between power inequalities operating within organised encounters and inequalities operating within the imaginary of the encounter itself. Whereas the research participants are often aware of this paradox, their motivations and approaches are still informed by the social imaginary and guided by the promise of inclusion. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The authors summarize the evolution of child psychoanalysis, including Freud’s extensive pediatric experience, to introduce Anna Freud’s aspiration for an integrated psychoanalysis, comprising the whole life cycle. The authors suggest that her disappointment that child analysis did not receive wider acceptance in the field is related to the phenomenon of “childism,” a pervasive prejudice against children. Nevertheless, some progress in organizing integrated child and adult psychoanalytic trainings has been made; the Michigan Model of Integrated Training is an example and its relation to the IPA’s adoption of an available Integrated Training Track is described. Resistances, problems and erosions are also discussed. At the time of writing, the authors suggest that, while many forces are arrayed which undermine integration of trainings, enthusiastic and sustained effort may create a viable future for integrated psychoanalytic education. © 2021 Claudia Lament, Rona Knight, and Wendy Olesker.

AB  - According to the Dintilhac nomenclature, human assistance is determined after consolidation as are the expenses related to third party permanent assistance to help the disabled victim carry out administrative procedures and more generally different aspects of daily life. In situations of post-traumatic mental disability, the evaluation of the need for a third party must allow for compensation, not only for daily living, but also in term of safety needs, the restoration of dignity and to make up for the loss of autonomy. The difficulty of assessing the need for a third party in case of disabling psychiatric symptoms is correlated to the initial difficulty of identifying and establishing the after-effects attributed to the traumatic event. It is also related to the absence of precise indicative scales for psychiatric disorders. The psychiatric pathologies that can be developed following a trauma are diverse. There is of course post-traumatic stress disorder, but it is also possible to find other anxiety disorders, as well as reactionary mood disorders. It is also necessary to take into account the decompensation of preexisting disorders. The quality of the expertise, whatever the diagnosis, is to evaluate the victim's needs in the most accurate way possible and taking into account daily discomfort. Indeed, the intensity of the symptoms can lead to a significant loss of autonomy for the victim. This can be due on the one hand to the disabling psychiatric symptomatology but can also be related to the consumption of psychotropic treatments. It is also important to anticipate the need for a third party during leave if hospitalization in psychiatric ward was necessary. Another element to take into account is the potentially fluctuating nature of psychiatric symptoms in the post-consolidation period. It may therefore be appropriate to assess the need for a third party on the basis of the most recent pre-consolidation fluctuations and to consider the possibility of a worsening of the situation post-consolidation. In the context of psychiatric symptoms, in the vast majority of cases, the need for a third party is that of assistance or support. Assessing the current or future need for a third party in the case of disabling psychiatric symptoms resulting from a traumatic event is complex, especially when the victim benefits from significant family or health support. Indeed, this support may mask certain difficulties or, on the contrary, prevent the mobilization of certain existing capacities. The purpose of this article is to propose a grid to help assess the need for a third party in the case of disabling psychiatric symptoms. Different entries to be rated from A to C evaluate personal safety management, participation in social life, travel, personal maintenance as well as the management of treatments, budget and administrative procedures. In association with these entries, a number of hours are suggested and practical examples are shown. It seems necessary to help the experts in the evaluation of these needs and to standardize this evaluation as much as possible. Victims of mental disabilities need medical treatment and care but also daily life aids and support. To compensate for psychological damage, whatever the permanent functional deficit defined, evaluating the needs for human assistance requires a precise and individual quantification needs in the victim's social, family and environmental context. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Evidence supports Allport's (1954) contention that social contact reduces mental illness stigma and promotes symptom recognition. However, an important limitation of existing research is that it typically relies on relatively simplistic measures of contact (e.g., any contact, number of contacts). Here, we build on prior work by examining how contact with persons with mental illness within social networks shapes labeling processes and beliefs about the causes of mental illness. Using egocentric network methods and vignette data from the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1173), findings reveal that connections to valued ties (e.g., friends, family) that disconfirm commonly held stereotypes about people with mental illness contribute to improved recognition of mental illness and reduce the likelihood of endorsing stigmatizing beliefs about causes of mental illness. By using network theory and methods, this research extends current understanding of the role of contact by revealing not only whether contact matters, but how it matters and under what circumstances it may reduce prejudice and discrimination attached to mental illness in contemporary society. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objective: Citing the black family as the locus of responsibility for black disadvantage has a long history in the United States; however, only limited research has examined the place of family upbringing in studies of Americans’ beliefs about the causes of racial inequality. Methods: We use data from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 General Social Surveys (GSS) to examine the prevalence and selected correlates of a newly offered (by the GSS) and culturally centered explanation of the black/white socioeconomic status gap focusing on “differences in upbringing.”. Results: The “upbringing” explanation is the most popular of the five reasons offered by the GSS in all three waves of data available for examination. Three-quarters of GSS respondents endorse this view, while less than half endorse the next most popular explanation. Upbringing is also the most popular explanation among all three race/ethnic groups we examine, though non-Hispanic whites endorse this view most strongly. Conclusion: Our results offer important insights for future survey design and investigations of public beliefs about racial inequality. © 2021 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.

AB  - Objective: Interracial interactions are often fraught with concerns about experiencing discrimination or being negatively stereotyped (i.e., social identity threat). Past research revealed that Black participantsinteracting with a White partner view the presence of racial diversity in a White partner’s friendshipnetwork as a signal of identity safety. We extend this work by clarifying the role of ingrouprepresentation in friendship diversity. Namely, we assess social identity safety of Black participantswhen anticipating an interaction with aWhite partner whose friendship networks include diversity withor without ingroup representation. Method: In an experimental study (N = 301), Black adults (52.8%female, 47.2% male; Mage = 29.96) expected to interact with aWhite partner who had all White friends(No Diversity); Black and White friends (Diversity with Ingroup Representation); or Asian, Latinx, andWhite friends (Diversity without Ingroup Representation). We assessed participants’ perceptions oftheir White partner as prejudiced, how they expected their partner would think of them (Blackmetastereotypes), and their anticipated interaction challenges, rejection concerns, and friendshipinterest immediately prior to the anticipated interaction. Results: Black participants had feweranticipated challenges, fewer rejection concerns, and more friendship interest when their Whitepartner’s friendship networks included (vs. excluded) ingroup representation. These effects weremediated by perceived partner prejudice and Black metastereotypes. Conclusions: These findingssuggest that while any diversity of an outgroup member’s friendship network is better than no diversity,ingroup representation is especially important in reducing threat and increasing social identity safety ininterracial interactions © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the “ultimate scapegoat” outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the “context-dependent” outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this theoretical article, we illuminate the ways in which the ethnic/racial identity literature to date is limited in its ability to fully capture the diverse experiences of Black youth in the U.S. and Canada. Specifically, despite representing a growing share of the Black population, the experiences of immigrant-origin Black youth (at least one parent born outside the U.S./Canada) are often overlooked and undertheorized in ethnic/racial identity research. We draw from the phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory, intersectional invisibility framework, and the theory of multiplicity to highlight conceptual and methodological gaps in the way ethnic/racial identity is studied among Black youth. Accounting for the detrimental impact of negative stereotypes, racial discrimination, and xenophobia, we unpack the unique process of ethnic/racial identity development for immigrant-origin Black youth. We then apply acculturation theory to address the limitations in ethnic/racial identity findings. We conclude with recommendations to clarify inclusion criteria when using the term African American and to report on Black youth’s ethnic diversity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Rationale and Objective: Interpersonal racial/ethnic discrimination is a risk factor for depression across the lifespan in minoritized racial/ethnic groups. This study tests a model proposing that social cognitive processes, including relational schemas, mediate the link between discrimination and depression. Relational schemas enable individuals to form mental representations of others, reflecting prior social learning and generating expectations about future social relations. Racism-related relational schemas include, among others, concerns about being rejected or invalidated, concerns about confirming negative stereotypes held by others, and cynical mistrust of others. Prior studies have typically examined the mediating role of one or two relational schemas in the association between discrimination and depression; less is known about the unique and combined effects of multiple dimensions of racism-related social cognition. Methods: The model was tested in a convenience sample of ethnically diverse, non-white participants recruited from two sites, a community medical center (N = 136; Mage = 38, SD = 13.0) and a private university (N = 120; Mage = 19.4, SD = 1.3), yielding a consolidated sample of 256 participants (64% women). Data were collected between September 2016 and April 2018. Participants completed paper-and-pencil self-report measures of exposure to interpersonal discrimination, depressive symptoms, and eight measures of relational schemas. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the eight relational schemas defined three primary dimensions: concerns about rejection and invalidation, social vigilance, and mistrust. A structural equation model in which the association between exposure to discrimination and depressive symptoms operates through latent factors representing three social-cognitive dimensions demonstrated adequate fit (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMR = 0.04). A significant mediational effect was found only for concerns about rejection and invalidation. Conclusion: The conceptual model supported by this study may help inform psychological interventions aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of racial/ethnic discrimination on mental health. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Whom do individuals blame for intergroup conflict? Do people attribute responsibility for intergroup conflict to the in-group or the out-group? Theoretically integrating the literatures on intergroup relations, moral psychology, and judgment and decision-making, we propose that unpacking a group by explicitly describing it in terms of its constituent subgroups increases perceived support for the view that the unpacked group shoulders more of the blame for intergroup conflict. Five preregistered experiments (N = 3,335 adults) found support for this novel hypothesis across three distinct intergroup conflicts: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, current racial tensions between White people and Black people in the United States, and the gender gap in wages in the United States. Our findings (a) highlight the independent roles that entrenched social identities and cognitive, presentation-based processes play in shaping blame judgments, (b) demonstrate that the effect of unpacking groups generalizes across partisans and nonpartisans, and (c) illustrate how constructing packed versus unpacked sets of potential perpetrators can critically shape where the blame lies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Most research investigating the effect of continuum beliefs on stigma has used weak manipulations which may contribute to mixed findings within the experimental literature. There is also a lack of research into how continuum belief manipulations may impact help-seeking and help-provision. This study used an online manipulation of continuum and categorical beliefs about schizophrenia to examine the subsequent impacts on stigma, help-seeking, and help-provision. A total of 271 participants were randomised into either a continuum, categorical, or control condition. Participants received an informational video, a magazine article, and research highlights relevant to their condition. Prosocial support behaviour was assessed through a novel volunteering measure. The magnitude of change between pre-intervention and post-intervention measures of continuum and categorical beliefs was large. Continuum presentations reduced prognostic pessimism and negative stereotyping. Meanwhile, categorical presentations increased prognostic pessimism. Participants across conditions showed increased help-providing intentions after removing the highest scores to avoid ceiling effects. Fear and blame also decreased significantly across all conditions. There was no difference between conditions on our novel volunteer help-provision measure. Our findings have implications for anti-stigma programs and may help inform the design of future continuum belief manipulations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the current study we investigated the relationship between ethnic prejudice and resilience and the perception of inclusion of immigrant students among primary and middle school teachers in two different countries (Italy and Spain). Participants were 315 teachers: 75 Catalan women, 25 Catalan men, 202 Italian women, and 13 Italian men. Participants completed the Classical and Modern Racial Prejudice Scale, the Resilience Process Questionnaire, and an ad hoc questionnaire evaluating teachers’ perceptions about immigrant students and their inclusive education process. The results showed two different models: The first one, referring to Italian teachers, suggested that the resilience component “return to homeostasis” helps teachers in the creation of positive perceptions and evaluations toward immigrant pupils and their inclusion process. The second model, referring to Catalan teachers, suggested that ethnic prejudice hinders the creation of positive attitudes and evaluations, but the resilience component “reintegration after loss” helps teachers in the creation of positive attitudes. Psychoeducational and practical implications are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the 1990s, Canadian historian Peter Hart claimed tens of thousands of native southern Irish Protestants experienced something akin to “ethnic cleansing” at the hands of the IRA in the early 1920s. Hart's research revised the “Irish nationalist revolution” (ca. 1917–1923) as an essentially ethnic conflict, and this article re-examines his evidence and methodology. Exaggerating the number of forced migrations, Hart's analysis rests on erroneous statistical proofs which he supported with a gross evidence selection bias. To better understand Hart's revision, his work is compared with Michael A. Bellesiles' Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture (2000), which also exhibited similar but also very different statistical errors. A central argument in this article is that erroneous statistical proofs are best understood as social constructs, where they articulate the prejudices of their host academies. Greater awareness of this problem is needed if it is to be avoided in the future. © 2021 Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Relative to heterosexual peers, sexual minority youth experience significant mental health disparities. This is partly due to prejudicial encounters (e.g., discrimination, victimization) because of their sexual minority status, and potential intersecting and compounding prejudicial experiences related to their ethnic minority status. However, even though religiosity has been identified as a protective factor in the general literature and may be especially relevant for youth in Latinx families, few studies have examined whether religiosity serves as a buffer of the relations between discrimination-related stress and mental health in sexual minority Latinx youth. Thus, the aims were to examine (a) whether ethnic and sexuality discrimination have additive or multiplicative effects on depressive symptoms, and (b) whether own or family religiosity (defined by religious importance and attendance) moderates the relations between discrimination and depressive symptoms. Sample included 377 youth (Mage = 20.29, SD = 2.61, age range 14–24). Results did not support an interaction between ethnic and sexuality discrimination, nor between own religiosity and ethnic discrimination, in predicting depressive symptoms. There were significant interactions between family religiosity and discrimination (ethnic and sexuality), in which family religiosity was negatively associated with depressive symptoms only at average and low levels of discrimination. There was a significant interaction between own religiosity and sexuality discrimination, in which own religiosity was negatively associated with depressive symptoms only at the low level of sexuality discrimination. Findings highlight the importance of examining the intersection of religion, sexuality, and Latinx minority status in relation to mental health outcome. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - Immigration scholars and religious studies scholars have explored generational changes in religiosity. Less clear is the significance of religion in the lives of Black immigrant second-generation youth. Moreover, while there is research on intraracial boundary-negotiations between Black Americans and Black immigrants in the United States, it is rarely discussed in the context of religion. Drawing on interviews with seventy one second-generation West African teenagers in New York City, this paper explores the role of religion in the integration of Black immigrant second-generation youth. I find that religion is a primary tool through which ethnoracial boundaries are maintained between the children of West African immigrants and their Black American counterparts. I spotlight three means through which religion matters for ethnoracial boundaries: congregational demographics, religious codes of conduct and Islamophobia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that religion is a key component of second-generation ethnoracial identity-formation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Ageism is studied extensively in community-dwelling older adults, but remains poorly understood in institutionalized older adults. Here, we compared the physical, psychological, and social variables associated with self-reported age-based biases in community-dwelling older adults and in those living in nursing homes (NHs). Material and methods: Participants (n = 272) in this descriptive cross-sectional study lived in NHs (n = 126) or in their homes (n = 146), were 60 years or older, and had no cognitive or serious functional impairments. Those in NHs had been institutionalized for at least six months. The dependent variable was negative stereotypes toward aging (CENVE). We developed generalized linear models (GLMs) by place of residence and sex following the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment´s (CGA) methodology. Results: There is a statistically significant relationship between negative stereotypes of aging and different multidimensional variables. These variables differ between institutionalized and non-institutionalized adults and between men and women. While some variables are non-modifiable (age and sex) others are potentially modifiable (educational level, participation in activities, length of NH stay, hand strength, autonomy, and depression). Conclusions: This study compared, for the first time, levels of ageism in older people living in two different social environments. Because most of the significant variables are modifiable in both environments, our results provide a framework to combat this type of discrimination. Promising strategies include anti-ageism policies and laws, educational interventions, and increased intergenerational contact. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Among sexual minorities, bisexual individuals experience higher rates of victimization and symptoms of PTSD than their lesbian and gay peers as well as heterosexual individuals. Despite these disparities, little work has examined factors contributing to PTSD symptoms among bisexual adults. The current study examined the associations between bisexual-specific minority stress and PTSD symptoms in a sample of adults with bisexual orientation and tested social support as a potential mediator of this association. Participants were 488 adults (378 cisgender women, 49 cisgender men, 61 transgender individuals), ages 18 to 66 years, with bisexual orientation based on identity and/or attraction to multiple genders. Greater anti-bisexual prejudice was associated with greater PTSD symptoms (β = 0.16) and lower social support (β = −.16), while accounting for sociodemographics and sexual identity-based victimization. Social support was associated with lower PTSD symptoms (β = −.25), while accounting for sociodemographics, sexual identity-based victimization, and anti-bisexual prejudice. Mediation analyses indicated that anti-bisexual prejudice was indirectly associated with greater PTSD symptoms through lower social support. Addressing bisexual-specific minority stress and its role in diminishing social support for bisexual individuals represents a critical component of trauma-informed research and intervention development in the bisexual community. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The newly arrived Roma Slovak community in a large urban city in the north of England has been widely perceived as having a myriad of social problems and there is a conflict with the wider community. This paper presents the results of a project to explore barriers and possibilities for the social and educational integration of newly arrived Roma Slovak migrants in the UK. The research carried out ethnographic fieldwork in a post-16 service for young people, using a CRT approach based on Yosso’s community cultural wealth model. The paper also applies an intersectional analysis and problematises assumptions that portray Roma communities as homogeneous, marginalised, and uncritically family oriented. The findings recover the voices and perspectives of the Roma Slovak community from a critical, though positive, perspective. The Roma Slovak students’ stories that emerged from this research are in stark contrast to the negative stereotypes commonly shared about the community. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Various forms of bias exist in medicine, including race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and weight bias. Weight bias has not received as much attention in the literature as other forms of bias. More often when discussing weight bias, the discussion is with regard to physician to patient bias, or patient to physician. In this article, we summarize the study performed by McLean et al. as well as the podcast and discussion, and social media commentary, in which the investigators evaluate the presence of physician to physician weight bias. © 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - Two pre-registered experiments (Total N = 822) explored the effect of economic inequality on social class stereotyping and the social mechanisms driving this relationship. In both experiments, participants were randomly assigned to a fictitious society with high or low levels of inequality and rated a wealthy and a poor individual on Vertical (i.e., assertiveness and competence) and Horizontal stereotype dimensions (i.e., friendliness and morality). We found that higher (versus lower) inequality caused both social classes to be perceived as more incompetent, immoral, and unfriendly, and the poor to be perceived as more unassertive. Moreover, we found that high (versus low) inequality caused stereotypes of the wealthy and poor to be more different on unique dimensions (i.e., in relation to the poor, the wealthy were stereotyped as more assertive, but also more unfriendly and immoral). Importantly, inequality affected the stereotype dimensions through distinct mechanisms. We found evidence of class-based categorization mediating the effect of inequality and social class stereotypes on the Vertical dimension, and evidence of negative intergroup relations (i.e., increased competition and reduced trust) explaining stereotypes on the Horizontal dimension. Further, we found that social class stereotypes influenced support for redistributive wealth policies. Our work contributes to the literature by identifying the mechanisms through which inequality affects perceptions of the social classes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A primary process in settler colonial societies is erasure of Indigenous presence. We employ a symbolic interactionist approach, embedded in macro-level critical analysis, to explore the conveyance and interpretation of American Indian identity in everyday interaction in the settler colonial society of the United States. We surveyed 213 White American participants, asking them to write about indicators they utilize to determine American Indian identity, and 104 American Indian participants, asking them to write about experiences associated with conveying and others interpreting their American Indian identities. Our findings reveal similarities and differences between White and American Indian perspectives associated with three types of indicators: perceived phenotypical, perceived cultural, and verbal. We find that racialized phenotypical perceptions of American Indian identity contribute to misidentification and invisibility of American Indian people. Cultural stereotypes also contribute to invisibility. We situate these findings in dominant U.S. culture and structures rooted in settler colonial processes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Such research was based on the activities developed by 12 ceramic craftswomen in the community, members of the Ceramic Craftswomen Association of Maruanum-ALOMA (Associação de Louceiras do Maruanum in portuguese). It was possible, through field research, with a qualitative approach, to understand the social context of ceramic craftswomen, to verify the spoken mathematical knowledge learned out of school in the production of ceramic tableware, in family farming, and consequently in daily habits, such as Marabaixo culture. Through participant observation, it was possible to verify aspects in the relationship between the contents of school mathematics and the activities developed by the ceramic craftswomen, which brings us possibilities of a bridge for teaching mathematics in quilombola schools. The results presented here point to the importance of a school education focused on valuing local culture, which strengthens ethnic relations in the search for equity and establishes an artistic-cultural rescue. In this sense, the presence of women as maintainers of household income and in the political leadership of the community stands out. This leads us to reinforce the understanding of the representativeness of the practices of ceramic craftswomen in the teaching of school mathematics, in which the concepts approached in the classroom are exemplified with everyday reality from the communities. Thus, we hope that this article will contribute to reflections at the most diverse levels and educational modalities. We also hope to contribute with other research in Ethnomathematics and to disseminate the quilombola culture present in the state of Amapá, which is currently under constant attacks on its rights by the state policy that has been installed in Brazil since 2016. © 2022

AB  - Background: Contributions of older adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic have been eclipsed by discourse positioning them as an at-risk population. We assess whether age-based framing (e.g., senior citizen) is associated with more negative stereotyping in the media compared to familial role-based framing (e.g., grandparent) across 8 months, from a baseline period (October 2019–December 2019) to the onset of the pandemic (January 2020–May 2020). Methods: Leveraging a 12-billion-word news media database—with over 30 million news articles from over 7000 websites—we identified the most common synonyms for age-based framing (e.g., senior citizen) and familial role-based framing (e.g., grandparent). For each framing category, we compiled the most frequently used descriptors every month, amassing 488,907 descriptors in total. All descriptors were rated from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive) to determine a Cumulative Aging Narrative Score (CANS) for age-based and familial role-based framing. Results: Age-based framing of older adults increased negative stereotyping in the media by seven times compared to familial role-based framing during COVID-19. The percentage of positive topics for age-based framing was significantly lower during COVID-19 (35%) than before (61%). Conversely, the percentage of positive topics for familial role-based framing was higher during the pandemic (91%) than before (70%). Conclusion: This is one of the first empirical studies on whether framing older adults based on age or role is linked to more negative stereotypes during COVID-19. We argue for a more role-centered approach in framing older adults so that their contributions are acknowledged and valued by society. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Importance: Previous studies have shown high rates of mistreatment among US general surgery residents, leading to poor well-being. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) residents represent a high-risk group for mistreatment; however, their experience in general surgery programs is largely unexplored. Objective: To determine the national prevalence of mistreatment and poor well-being for LGBTQ+ surgery residents compared with their non-LGBTQ+ peers. Design, Setting, and Participants: A voluntary, anonymous survey adapting validated survey instruments was administered to all clinically active general surgery residents training in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited general surgery programs following the 2019 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported mistreatment, sources of mistreatment, perceptions of learning environment, career satisfaction, burnout, thoughts of attrition, and suicidality. The associations between LGBTQ+ status and (1) mistreatment, (2) burnout, (3) thoughts of attrition, and (4) suicidality were examined using multivariable regression models, accounting for interactions between gender and LGBTQ+ identity. Results: A total of 6956 clinically active residents completed the survey (85.6% response rate). Of 6381 respondents included in this analysis, 305 respondents (4.8%) identified as LGBTQ+ and 6076 (95.2%) as non-LGBTQ+. Discrimination was reported among 161 LGBTQ+ respondents (59.2%) vs 2187 non-LGBTQ+ respondents (42.3%; P <.001); sexual harassment, 131 (47.5%) vs 1551 (29.3%; P <.001); and bullying, 220 (74.8%) vs 3730 (66.9%; P =.005); attending surgeons were the most common overall source. Compared with non-LGBTQ+ men, LGBTQ+ residents were more likely to report discrimination (men: odds ratio [OR], 2.57; 95% CI, 1.78-3.72; women: OR, 25.30; 95% CI, 16.51-38.79), sexual harassment (men: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.39-2.99; women: OR, 5.72; 95% CI, 4.09-8.01), and bullying (men: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07-2.12; women: OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.37-2.91). LGBTQ+ residents reported similar perceptions of the learning environment, career satisfaction, and burnout (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.97-1.52) but had more frequent considerations of leaving their program (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52-2.74) and suicide (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.26-3.04). This increased risk of suicidality was eliminated after adjusting for mistreatment (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.90-2.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Mistreatment is a common experience for LGBTQ+ surgery residents, with attending surgeons being the most common overall source. Increased suicidality among LGBTQ+ surgery residents is associated with this mistreatment. Multifaceted interventions are necessary to develop safer and more inclusive learning environments.. © 2022 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Institutional efforts to create safe environments can function as signals to identity safety and reduce expectations of identity threat within the institution. Prior research on institutional identity safety signals, however, has yet to consider an important question: Do people use institutional identity safety signals to inform their expectations of identity threat in their broader social environments? Because people's day-to-day lives are often outside of signaling institutions, it is important to understand whether institutional identity safety signals also influence expectations of identity threat outside of the signaled space. Here, we explore this question by testing how the presence of safe spaces—designated areas where people can feel comfortable in their social identities and safe from prejudice—affect people's expectations of threat in their broader environments. Across four vignette-based studies using US participants sampled from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and an undergraduate subject pool, participants who read about someone observing a safe space sign (compared to signs unrelated to identity safety) reported increased prejudice expectations in their broader environments. These prejudice expectations mediated increased attributions of prejudice (Study 1); motivations to combat prejudice (Study 2); and support for movements and policies addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion (Study 3). These effects were not moderated by group membership. Results suggested that safe spaces increased prejudice expectations because they are perceived as a response to a problem in the broader environment. Together, the present research contributes to existing literature by testing the effects of a new signal (i.e., safe spaces), examining how localized identity safety signals transfer to the broader environment, and highlighting novel outcomes following from prejudice expectations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - During the 1960s, several hundreds of African students attended long-term academic or vocational programs in Israel. For Israel, offering higher education to Africans was considered a way to strengthen its influence in decolonizing Africa, while for African states, it was a means to gain vital technical expertise and reduce reliance on ex-colonial powers or the Cold War superpowers. African international students, however, were not merely pawns in this larger international political game. Responding to everyday racism and influenced by radical and Pan-Africanist ideas of the turbulent sixties, these students became active participants and commentators within Israeli society. They employed diverse strategies to promote anti-racist and anti-colonial causes, engaging in political activism at levels that were uncommon in the Israeli student social scene. By doing so, African students in Israel contested local prejudices about Africa and Africans and taught the hosting society important lessons on political awareness, broad-mindedness, acceptance, and racial tolerance. This history tells of understudied aspects of the global Black-Jewish relations in the 1960s. It also provides a novel perspective on Israeli society–one that surpasses the well-discussed Jewish-Arab or Ashkenazi-Mizrahi divisions–and contributes to the scholarly understanding of the meanings and manifestations of Blackness in Israel. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Keira Bell’s case against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust challenged the notion that children can consent to certain forms of gender-affirming care, and the subsequent trial has sparked global effects. This paper considers the unconscious fantasies and anxieties that surround both this trial and trans childhood more broadly. Although psychic phenomenon, the normalized defenses of adults continue to inform policy, healthcare, and have a significant impact on the materiality of trans lives. Drawing from Elizabeth Young-Bruehl, I argue that gender non-conforming children become an extension of their caregiver’s subjectivity and provide a unique container for adult’s projected, unbearable thoughts and feelings. In particular, Young-Bruehl’s use of three Freudian personality structures is helpful for tracing symptomatic expressions of childism and conceptualizing the different unconscious motivational forces behind otherwise disparate, public discourses of concern for the child’s wellbeing. © 2021 Claudia Lament, Rona Knight, and Wendy Olesker.

AB  - People living with mental illnesses and their families may conceal their conditions to avoid prejudice and discrimination. Stigma often prevents people from receiving adequate health care and other social support services which could exacerbate social and health consequences such as unemployment, homelessness, substance use, and compulsory hospitalization. In this paper, we discuss social contact as a promising anti-stigma strategy for enhancing social interactions among people with mental illnesses, their families, and those without mental illnesses. In particularly, we consider next steps for an approach that works to reduce the stigma-related burden of mental illness. For social contact to be effective in reducing mental illness stigma, it requires broad social buy-in as well as implementation within care systems. Engagement with this approach can be driven through diverse contact-based education using collaborative efforts of society, academic institutions, policy-makers, health professionals, media, and governments. Ultimately, this work aims to consider the next steps in enacting social contact as an anti-stigma strategy through direct interventions and contact-based education. The success of this approach requires pragmatic public policies to support its implementation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Critical discourse analysis (CDA) increasingly recognises the role played by multiple semiotic modes in the discursive construction of social identities and inequalities. One embodied mode that has not been subject to any systematic analysis within CDA is gesture. An area where gesture has been extensively studied, and where it is shown to bear significant semiotic load in multimodal utterances, is cognitive linguistics. Here, we use insights from cognitive linguistics to provide a detailed qualitative analysis of gestures in a specific discursive context – the anti-immigration discourse of Nigel Farage. We describe the gestures that accompany a range of rhetorical tropes typical of anti-immigration discourses and critically analyse their role, alongside speech, in communicating prejudice and legitimating discriminatory action. Our analysis suggests that gesture is an important part of political discourse which is worthy of further investigation in future CDA research. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Adopting the Critical Discourse Analysis perspective, this study investigates the ideology reflected by the anti-Islam and anti-Muslim discourse in China, the power dynamics revealed by such discourse and how social media discourse differs from and utilises the government discourse. Four ways to disguise the anti-Muslims, anti-Islam prejudice are investigated: appealing to patriotism to demand cultural assimilation; claiming to defend secularism; framing Islam as incompatible with mainstream culture; appealing to consumer rights to reject halal food. Non-Muslims and assimilated Muslims (especially the elites) are found to have the prerogative to dictate who belong to the ingroup, what dietary restrictions are legitimate and whom to blame when undesirable situations arise, while Muslim non-elites are at the receiving end of such dictates. This study also argues that social media discourse expresses antagonism of higher intensity than the government discourse does, and may misappropriate the official narratives to express the interlocutor’s hatred towards Muslims. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Increases in racial minority populations are profoundly reshaping the composition of the American electorate, and multiracial identifiers are one of the fastest growing groups. Yet little is known about the political ideology and policy preferences of Americans who identify with more than one race. We address this gap here by examining the political views of the two biggest US multiracial groups—White-Asians and White-Blacks. We also advance prior work by assessing the role that linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience play in explaining multiracials’ political attitudes. Leveraging the largest national political survey of multiracial adults to date, we find that White-Asian and White-Black multiracials are on the whole more progressive than Whites, expressing levels of linked fate and social and racial attitudes that are comparable to those of their minority race. We argue that the growth in these multiracial populations seems most likely to benefit the Democratic Party. © 2021 Southern Political Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Allyship is a growing phenomenon in many organizational contexts, and the involvement of advantaged group allies in identity-oriented social movements (e.g., men in the feminist movement) is ubiquitous. However, the impression that these advantaged group allies make on their intended beneficiaries is unclear. Over the course of four studies, we explore disadvantaged group activists' attitudes toward their advantaged group allies. We find converging evidence that disadvantaged group activists prefer advantaged group allies who engage in actions that demonstrate high levels of trustworthiness (e.g., selflessness, loyalty) and low levels of influence (e.g., centrality, power) in the movement, whereas non-activists show only a significant preference on the influence dimension. This evidence was observed in a survey of 117 social movement activists (Study 1), and in three experiments with 752 liberal women and nonbinary individuals (Study 2), 305 feminist social movement activists (Study 3), and a separate sample of 805 feminist social movement activists (Study 4). Taken together, our research documents the causal effects that different allyship behaviors have on beneficiaries' attitudes toward advantaged group allies (Studies 2, 3, & 4) while recruiting samples of currently engaged movement activists to solicit their unique perspectives (Studies 1, 3, & 4). We thereby identify the specific ways of being an advantaged group ally that elicit the most positive impressions from their intended beneficiaries, which have direct implications for supporting intergroup coalitions and social change. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - With the increasing post-massification of higher education institutions (HEIs), access-providing business schools (vs elite educational institutions) continue to rank at the bottom in terms of quality. This study defines and develops a measure of quality in the context of access-providing business schools in a developing country. Access-providing private business schools face competing challenges of balancing inclusiveness and access with excellence and quality. Pursuing inclusiveness and access alongside excellence and quality seems a utopian ideal. However, this study propounds transformative quality as key for addressing these conflicting issues, which have long impacted post-massification and continue to have a grave effect post-pandemic. We propose a five-factor, 27-item scale of transformative quality (TRFQ). We validated the proposed scale through three studies exploring the perspectives of front-line faculty members representing 25 business schools from 10 major cities in India. The study results indicate that TRFQ comprises five dimensions such as critical confidence, problem-solving skills for approach-avoidance, overall awareness, overcoming prejudices and skillfulness. The role of TRFQ in future research has implications and recommendations for institutional management in business schools and for policymakers. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Recent social movements have illuminated systemic inequities in U.S. society, including within the social sciences. Thus, it is essential that attachment researchers and practitioners engage in reflection and action to work toward anti-racist perspectives in the field. Our aims in this paper are (1) to share the generative conversations and debates that arose in preparing the Special Issue of Attachment & Human Development, “Attachment Perspectives on Race, Prejudice, and Anti-Racism”; and (2) to propose key considerations for working toward anti-racist perspectives in the field of attachment. We provide recommendations for enriching attachment theory (e.g. considering relations between caregivers’ racial-ethnic socialization and secure base provision), research (e.g. increasing the representation of African American researchers and participants), and practice (e.g. advocating for policies that reduce systemic inequities in family supports). Finally, we suggest two relevant models integrating attachment theory with perspectives from Black youth development as guides for future research. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the health of older adults. In addition to a higher risk for serious illness and death, the societal value of senescent adults was challenged. There have been conflicting results reported in the research literature regarding positive and negative stereotypes of older adults, and areliable and valid assessment tool to measure content (existence of astereotype) and strength (intensity of astereotype) is unavailable. To address issues with instruments employed to measure ageist stereotypes, researchers developed the Stereotypes Content and Strength Survey. University students (n=483) were directed to “think about their perceptions of older adults” and indicate how many they believed could be described using the terms listed on a5-point Likert-type scale from none-all. Response categories for each descriptive item were dichotomized into 1 = “some, most or all” and 0 = “none or few.” Based on an odds analyses of 117 items, 84 met the content criteria to be considered astereotype regarding older adults. Using the criteria for strength, items were categorized into 36 “strong,” 25 “moderate,” and 23 “weak” stereotypes. Assessing the content and strength of stereotypic beliefs using this procedure may contribute to major bias influencing ageist perceptions. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There is a high need for well-qualified teachers across all STEM content areas, especially in secondary physics. Our work examines why individuals choose to pursue physics teaching. This study, at a primarily undergraduate institution in the Northeastern United States, uses a modified version of Watt and Richardson’s Factors Influencing Teacher Choice (FIT-Choice) model as an analytical frame to describe why individuals choose to teach physics. The study employed a mixed methods convergent design approach. Qualitative data sources include transcribed interviews (with physics/secondary education majors and physics faculty), providing multiple perspectives on students’ choice to pursue teaching, and one open-ended survey item. Quantitative data sources include a survey based on Watt and Richardson’s FIT-Choice model administered to all physics undergraduate majors at our institution (those enrolled in a physics/secondary education dual major and other physics majors). Our findings revealed several clear trends including: prior teaching and learning experiences were critical in helping an individual choose to become a teacher; future teachers reported a clear love for the subject (physics); specific skills and expertise are needed to effectively teach secondary physics; and physics teaching is a mechanism for enhancing social equity. There was some discussion of negative stereotypes about teaching careers, but this was relatively small compared to other trends. Implications for this work could include creating tools to aid in recruiting a larger pool of highly qualified secondary physics teachers. © 2021 Association for Science Teacher Education.

AB  - Attachment theory emphasizes both the importance of supportive relationship partners, beginning in infancy, for developing a sense of security, and the adaptive benefits of this sense. In this article, we consider bolstering the sense of attachment security as a means of reducing and overcoming prejudice, discrimination, and racism. We review basic concepts of attachment theory, focusing on what we call the broaden-and-build cycle of attachment security. We review studies showing that the sense of attachment security is associated with reduced prejudice and less discriminatory attitudes and behavior toward people outside one’s own social or racial group. Finally, we propose theoretical ideas and research suggesting that attachment security can protect against the adverse psychological effects of others’ acts of prejudice and discrimination toward oneself. We conclude that, despite large gaps in the research literature, attachment theory is a useful conceptual framework for understanding and combatting prejudice, discrimination, and racism. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article attempts to study two different causal mechanisms where education affects individual attitudes toward foreign countries. On the one hand, education stands for human capital and/or skill level. According to the factor endowments model, for example, well-educated people in a capital-abundant country can materially benefit from trade ties with other labor-abundant countries. On the other hand, education cultivates social trust, disseminates information, and expands breadth of social perspective, all of which can make one more pro-outsider. Hence, both explanations tend to predict that one’s educational attainment is associated with a positive opinion of outgroup members and foreigners. By cross-national comparison including both developed and developing economies, I find empirical evidence supporting the socializing not the utilitarian effect of education on outgroup attitudes, using data from the second wave of the Asian Barometer Survey. Further structural equation modeling shows that education socializes an individual to be more internationalist and cosmopolitan mainly through an expanded social perspective. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individual's right to protest, but people tend to have differing attitudes toward protests depending on the issue being protested. Across two studies we examined general attitudes toward protests, racial attitudes, and political ideology as predictors of support for two separate pairs of recent, politically distinct protest actions. In Study 1, participants provided attitudes toward the 2017 Charlottesville and 2016 NFL protests. In Study 2, attitudes toward the 2020 George Floyd and COVID-19 lockdown protests were assessed. In both studies, support was highest for protests aligned with political ideology, and racial prejudice consistently emerged as a predictor of protest support, even for the COVID-19 lockdown protest that was not explicitly racially motivated. These findings provide further evidence of prejudice being a political force and partisan beliefs biasing understandings of social issues. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Context: Medical educators are increasingly paying attention to how bias creates inequities that affect learners across the medical education continuum. Such bias arises from learners' social identities. However, studies examining bias and social identities in medical education tend to focus on one identity at a time, even though multiple identities often interact to shape individuals' experiences. Methods: This article examines prior studies on bias and social identity in medical education, focusing on three social identities that commonly elicit bias: race, gender and profession. By applying the lens of intersectionality, we aimed to generate new insights into intergroup relations and identify strategies that may be employed to mitigate bias and inequities across all social identities. Results: Although different social identities can be more or less salient at different stages of medical training, they intersect and impact learners' experiences. Bias towards racial and gender identities affect learners' ability to reach different stages of medical education and influence the specialties they train in. Bias also makes it difficult for learners to develop their professional identities as they are not perceived as legitimate members of their professional groups, which influences interprofessional relations. To mitigate bias across all identities, three main sets of strategies can be adopted. These strategies include equipping individuals with skills to reflect upon their own and others' social identities; fostering in-group cohesion in ways that recognise intersecting social identities and challenges stereotypes through mentorship; and addressing intergroup boundaries through promotion of allyship, team reflexivity and conflict management. Conclusions: Examining how different social identities intersect and lead to bias and inequities in medical education provides insights into ways to address these problems. This article proposes a vision for how existing strategies to mitigate bias towards different social identities may be combined to embrace intersectionality and develop equitable learning environments for all. © 2021 Association for the Study of Medical Education and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In Spain, (anti-)racism is of scarce relevance to public debates and, when the topic is broached, it has mainly been discussed in relation to non-EU migration. Besides, its historical link with colonialism generally remains unacknowledged. This article analyses the problematisation of ‘race’ and ‘racism’ in this context, as performed by hegemonic stakeholders (i.e. public servants, NGOs, experts) in the fields of anti-discrimination, Roma inclusion and immigrant integration policies. As the fieldwork materials illustrate, this understanding rejects ‘race’ not only from a scientific-biological perspective but also as a social-political category. Accordingly, racism is depoliticised and theorised in a twofold manner: (1) as a matter of stereotypes, prejudices and lack of information about the ‘Other’; (2) as the aggressive acts of explicitly racist individuals/organisations. The structural, historical and institutional dimensions of racism are addressed either as background context, or they are negated by public policies. By not confronting the uneven power relations (re)produced by racism, this approach reaffirms ‘institutional whiteness’ as the underlying perspective of mainstream Spanish anti-racism. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Schools of social work are tasked with preparing students to support the field’s ethical challenge of eliminating racism. Given that color-blind racial attitudes constitute a form of continued racism, identifying the factors associated with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI) in social work students represents a first step toward meeting this challenge. Drawing from critical race theory, this cross-sectional study surveyed a convenience sample of 305 master of social work (MSW) students across five schools of social work to explore which individual characteristics are significantly associated with CBRI at the bivariate and multivariate levels. A multiple linear regression assessed CBRI’s multivariate associations with demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation) and professional characteristics (i.e., prior work experience with marginalized communities, bachelor of social work [BSW] attainment, MSW concentration). Results showed that increased age, gender identification as men, and BSW attainment had statistically significant, positive associations with CBRI, compared to their respective reference groups. Compared to straight sexual orientation, identification as gay or lesbian, bisexual, and other sexual orientation was significantly associated with lower CBRI. Macro-focused MSW concentration was the strongest statistically significant independent variable and was associated with decreased CBRI. Fostering critical self-awareness of MSW students’ racial blind spots may support meeting social work’s ethical challenge. © 2021 Council on Social Work Education.

AB  - Whilst domestic violence against women receives significant international attention and prominence within the scholarly, media and policy discourses, much silence and reservation is evident in the case of domestic violence against men by women. The dominant societal notion portrays women as the natural victims and men as perpetrators, making it challenging to contextualize men’s experiences of domestic violence in the intimate relationship. Against this backdrop, using Bangladesh as a case study, this article highlights key factors contributing to the silences, subjugations and controversies associated with domestic violence against men in order to present the state of current knowledge for such violence. Currently, there is a paucity of scholarly information on domestic violence against men and policy, legal and social supports available for these victims require attention. It is thus, suggested to break the social prejudice associated with such violence and adopt appropriate policy and legal interventions including gender-neutral laws to protect men at home from violence perpetrated by women. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Many societies today are organised as race-based social hierarchies, with clear boundaries between racial groups at the top versus bottom. The growth of multiracial populations has been heralded as holding the potential to blur existing group boundaries. But whether multiracial people do blur boundaries depends critically on how monoracial perceivers categorise them. We review our research programme on how monoracial perceivers’ categorisation of multiracials depends on sociopolitical motives. We present the Sociopolitical Motive × Intergroup Threat Model of Racial Categorisation, which describes how sociopolitical motives interact with specific threats to drive multiracial categorisation, and how this depends on perceivers’ group position in the racial status hierarchy. Our empirical work is based on the U.S. context, but we discuss how our research, grounded in theories of intergroup relations that have been tested cross-culturally–social dominance, system justification, authoritarianism, and social identity theories–may apply more broadly. © 2021 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between the ‘othering’ of Irish and Jewish communities in London up to the end of the 1920s, and punitive action and harassment against these minorities on the part of the British state. Beginning by looking at early articulations of antisemitic and anti-Irish prejudice, it will consider how the associations of both groups with radical politics and transgressive behaviour led to the negative involvement of the Metropolitan Police in the lives of Jewish and Irish Londoners on a day-to-day level at the end of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian period. The situation was then exacerbated through the experience of war, and the revolutionary events in Dublin in 1916 and Petrograd in 1917. Irish and Jewish communities, as transnational diasporas, were associated with international subversion, and militant action in London itself. The article will discuss the campaign waged by the state in its various manifestations between 1918 and 1922, including arrest and imprisonment without trial and deportation to Ireland and Eastern Europe. It will conclude by identifying how the actions of the state against Irish and Jewish communities anticipated action against other minorities over the course of the twentieth century. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Millenarian movements used to be regarded as native reactions to enormous social disruptions caused by colonial intrusion, doomed to failure and at best a step on the way to more “modern” forms of collective social resistance. In fact, they have both pre-dated and outlasted colonialism, featuring in ethnic politics across Asia and beyond to this day. Nevertheless, its encounter with modernity has not left millenarianism unchanged, as is shown in this article’s historical case study. A comprehensive timeline and mapping of past and present Hmong-Miao millenarian activity highlights several enduring features including a context of economic and political crisis, their transnational nature, the prevalence of manipulation and/or coercion, and specific cultural symbols within supernatural predictions. Equally important are the historical developments, from pan-ethnic to mono-ethnic and from violent to peaceful (but still threatening to political and religious authorities), reflecting historical trends of ethnicisation and territorialisation. The mechanics of such reproductions and transformations are then unpacked, before the Hmong-Miao experience is compared with millenarian activity from other groups of upland Southeast Asia. Millenarianism continues to play a role in voicing social discontent, challenging power structures and moulding ethnic relations, but needs to be examined and understood within evolving socio-political contexts. © 2021 Asian Studies Association of Australia.

AB  - This study investigates whether the declining economic performance and social status of traditional news media, which are two dimensions indicating the professional disruption of journalism, are associated with journalists’ engagement in public relations (PR). The results of a cross-sectional survey reveal two paths to the PR-journalism boundary crossing, although the level of boundary crossing is overall controllable. First, economic disruption indirectly predicts journalists’ engagement in media pitching and media event planning through their identification with colleagues who have engaged in PR. Second, perceived waning social status both directly and indirectly predicts their engagement in media pitching and media catching, with their disidentification with PR practitioners as a mediator in the indirect relationship. These findings suggest that, while professional disruption may induce journalists to seek more information subsidy, their professional identity can be a source of both resistance against and support for this trend. Theories on social identity and intergroup relations are adopted to explain this dilemma. © 2021 The Centre for Chinese Media and Comparative Communication Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

AB  - Renton reviews McGeever's analysis of the Bolshevik encounter with antisemitism in 1917. He argues that McGeever's narrative builds on insights which were already in the public domain, while acknowledging that McGeever takes the story further by showing that anti-Jewish violence was more pervasive than previously understood. He argues that the rise at the same moment of both revolutionary sentiment and racist prejudice is not a phenomenon restricted to 1917, but is a recurring feature of British and European history. He notes that the heroic figures in McGeever's narrative stood at an intermediary position between Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and internationalism (Marxism), and argues that this was a recurring position within Jewish politics, as discernible in the 1940s as it had been in 1917. He suggests that further research might well elucidate the contribution of other ethnic minorities whose most principled fighters also occupied a similar position mid-way between nationalism and internationalism. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This attitudinal study examines racism–conceptualized as a general belief in a hierarchical order of racial/ethnic groups–from a comparative cross-national perspective. The study develops theoretical arguments regarding individual and country-level explanations of racist views and tests them using ESS data. It demonstrates that racist views are not rare in Europe, yet their extent varies substantially across countries. In societies with lower levels of social cohesion, citizens are more likely to adopt racist views, as compared to societies with higher levels of social cohesion. Although a country’s economic inequality is not associated with the prevalence of racist views, inequality does seem to condition the impact of gender on such views. In more economically unequal countries, the gender gap in racist views–where men express higher levels of racist views–is greater than in more economically equal countries. No association between ethnic diversity and levels of racist views was found. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Public stigma is a form of devaluation by other people’s negative reactions to a specific behavior or mental health condition. When dealing with the physical consequences of addiction, substance users experience distress due to negative prejudice against them and their families. Method: In Shanghai, China, a community survey was conducted with four experimental vignettes to examine the general public’s experience with mental health issues and their perceptions toward substance users. Respondents were randomly assigned to answer one of these vignettes regarding public stigma toward a male or female vignette subject (VS) with substance addiction. Results: Data from 123 respondents showed no statistical significance in public stigma perception toward a male or female subject either with alcohol or cocaine misuse problems. However, older individuals perceived mental illness more negatively when it is connected to substance addiction. These respondents see public stigma as a matter of “family shame,” “hostility,” “discrimination,” and “labeling” that represent the risks that hinder help-seeking. Conclusion: This study suggests designing culturally sensitive treatment models that could help substance users recognize face-saving factors in their help-seeking process. Community education as a prevention measure should emphasize the importance of treating substance users as an individual, not as a problem. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The social identity tradition has not reached a consensus regarding the question of whether identifying with an ingroup directly leads to ingroup bias, or whether this association may be moderated by group norms. One previous study (Jetten, Spears, & Manstead, 1997) showed that an ingroup norm of fairness as opposed to differentiation seems to moderate this link between identification and ingroup bias. The present research aims to examine the extent to which real-life group members (Kurds and Turks) with a history of conflict engage in ingroup bias as a function of their level of identification when group norms prescribe favoritism or equality. In Study 1, Kurdish and Turkish participants report their ingroup norm (egalitarianism or favoritism) and allocate a fixed amount of funds between Kurds and Turks in a hypothetical situation. The results show a significant interaction between social identification and group norm on ingroup bias. Accordingly, ingroup bias increases with the strength of identification when the norm is favoritism; however, there is no relationship when the norm is egalitarianism. Study 2 manipulates the ingroup norm for Kurdish and Turkish participants in the same hypothetical context. This time, the interaction is marginally significant but in a similar direction, where stronger identification leads to higher ingroup bias in the favoritism norm condition, yet this effect disappears in the egalitarianism norm condition. These findings extend the literature on the role of norms in intergroup relations, emphasizing the important role of egalitarian norms in reducing ingroup bias even in real-life conflict-ridden contexts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We compared the differences and explored the associations between ethnic identity and Chinese national identity, and the intergroup attitudes of adolescents from the Yi, Han, and Mongolian ethnicities in a Yi ethnic autonomous region in China. The participants (N = 1830, 50% female) were middle school students (n = 910, M age = 13.51) and high school students (n = 920, M age = 17.71). We found (a) significant ethnic differences between the high school students in the subscales of behavior, self-identification, and achievement; (b) that the three ethnic groups exhibited nonsignificant differences in their perceptions of Chinese national identity; (c) a positive association between ethnic identity and Chinese national identity for the adolescents across ethnicities; (d) a positive association between ethnic identity and intergroup attitudes for the Yi adolescents only; and (e) that Chinese national identity was positively associated with intergroup attitudes for the Yi and Han adolescents and for the Mongolian middle school students, but not for the Mongolian high school students. This suggests that age and context play central roles in shaping the ethnic and national identities of adolescents in such regions, and those who grow up in an inclusive environment are more likely to develop positive intergroup attitudes. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Past research has assumed that social egalitarians reject group-based hierarchies and advocate for equal treatment of all groups. However, contrary to popular belief, we argue that egalitarian advocacy predicts greater likelihood to support “Succession”-based ageism, which prescribes that older adults step aside to free up coveted opportunities (e.g., by retiring). Although facing their own forms of discrimination, older individuals are perceived as blocking younger people, and other unrepresented groups, from opportunities— that in turn, motivates egalitarian advocates to actively discriminate against older adults. In 9 separate studies (N = 3,277), we demonstrate that egalitarian advocates endorse less prejudice toward, and show more support for, women and racial minorities, but harbor more prejudice toward (Studies 1 and 2), and show less advocacy for (Studies 3–6), older individuals. We demonstrate downstream consequences of this effect, such as support for, and resource allocation to, diversity initiatives (Studies 3–6). Further, we isolate perceived opportunity blocking as a critical mediator, demonstrating that egalitarian advocates believe that older individuals actively obstruct more deserving groups from receiving necessary resources and support to get ahead (Studies 4–6). Finally, we explore the intersectional nature of this effect (Study 7). Together this research suggests that when it comes to egalitarianism, equality for all may only mean equality for some. © 2021.

AB  - Public campaigns debating the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) individuals to be treated as equal under the law highlight stigma and prejudice harmful to health and well-being. Previous research documenting the negative effects of political campaigns on LGBTIQ people’s health and well-being has largely left unexplored the effects on their families and allies. The present study analyzed open-ended responses of the parent allies of LGBTIQ people (N = 232) to questions about the effects of the public debate during the 2017 Australian Marriage Law postal survey. Parents expressed some positive experiences of connection to other supporters of marriage equality. Parents also reported many negative emotions and experiences. The debates increased their awareness of prejudice and discrimination targeting their children and made them fearful for their own and their children’s safety. Parents reported negative impacts on some interpersonal relationships with friends, family members, co-workers, and other community members. They expressed feelings of alienation and anger toward the government, media, and religious institutions for fostering anti-LGBTIQ prejudice and discrimination. Some parents reported feeling discouraged about society or humanity in general because of the public debate. Findings are discussed in relation to affiliate stigma and parental minority stress, and the need to consider in research and practice the effects of LGBTIQ stigmatization on family systems. © 2021.

AB  - This study presents a tool developed in Spanish to measure teachers’ and students’ attitudes towards physical and sensory disability in the context of higher education in Latin America. The effects on attitudes towards contact with people with disabilities, and training on that topic, were also studied. The research involved 718 participants (563 students and 155 teachers). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed a bifactorial structure, with the 27 items grouped into two dimensions: egalitarian attitudes and prejudiced attitudes. Internal consistency was excellent (α >.90). The Questionnaire on Attitudes towards Disability in Higher Education (QAD-HE) shows appropriate psychometric properties and can be applied in various Spanish-speaking countries due to the language and culture adaptation process carried out. The results demonstrated that teachers with previous contact with and knowledge about disabilities had positive attitudes towards students. © 2021 HERDSA.

AB  - In psychology, prejudice has typically been studied by social psychology (e.g., intergroup processes), but the last 20 years have seen a renewed and growing interest for research on personality traits and prejudice. The present meta-analysis integrates findings between personality traits (Big Five), ideological attitudes (SDO; social dominance orientation and RWA; right-wing authoritarianism-), and cultural attitudes (cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation). Our theoretical framework was the Dual Process Model (DPM; (Duckitt, 2001), which posits that low agreeableness and low openness predict more cultural prejudice through the mediating effects of SDO and RWA. We also developed an extended DPM-2 by adding cultural appreciation as a second outcome. The systematic search for published and unpublished studies identified 300 independent samples. Overall, the main meta-analytical results support both the initial DPM and the extended DPM-2. In the DPM, low agreeableness was linked to cultural prejudice through SDO, whereas low openness was related to cultural prejudice through RWA. In the extended DPM-2, in addition to the same mediated links already present in the DPM, agreeableness was linked to cultural appreciation through low SDO, whereas openness was related (though weakly) to cultural appreciation through low RWA. In addition, the antecedents of cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation are mostly the same; they do not necessarily have the same effect sizes. Importantly, the findings support that cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation are partially distinct and negatively interrelated attitudinal constructs. Results are discussed in terms of appreciation and prejudice toward ethnocultural outgroups being two complementary concepts for research. © 2021. Canadian Psychological Association

AB  - Intergroup contact is key to social cohesion, yet psychological barriers block engagement with diversity even when contact opportunities are abundant. We lack an advanced understanding of contact seeking because intergroup contact is often an independent variable in research, and studies on contact seeking have favoured experimental probing of selected factors or measured only broad behavioural intentions. This research carried out the first ecological tests of a novel multilayer-multivariate framework to contact seeking/avoiding. These tests were centred on a Muslim-led community contact-based initiative with visible support from local authorities following a terrorist attack. Non-Muslim Australian women (N = 1,347) contributed field data on their situated contact motivations, choices, and attendance at an intercultural educational stall; many (N = 559) completed a profiling test battery. Among those who responded to the initiative invite, the rate of taking up the high-salience contact opportunity in this heated setting was high and reflected multiple approach/avoidance motivations. Contact seeking/avoiding was not just allophilia/prejudice; it presented as new typologies of politicized solidarity, courage, apathy, and moral outrage. While intergroup predictors were significant across all profiling analyses, intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors also regularly contributed to explain variance in non-Muslims’ contact motivations and choices, confirming their multilayer-multivariate nature. © 2021 The British Psychological Society

AB  - There is still little research about the association of anti-immigrant attitudes with ethnic discrimination. In this study we investigate whether there is more rental discrimination against ethnic minorities in Belgian municipalities with more negative attitudes and higher perceived threats toward immigration and refugees. For this purpose, we merged unique data from correspondence tests with the aggregated attitudes in 44 municipalities. There was profound discrimination against candidates with Moroccan names by both private landlords and realtors. In contrast to theoretical expectations there was not more ethnic discrimination in municipalities with more negative attitudes or higher perceived threats. However, it appears that rental candidates–irrespective of their ethnic origin–are less likely to be invited in municipalities with higher threats and more negative attitudes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In one large-scale experiment using U.S. respondents on Mechanical Turk (N = 2,899), we studied how subtle differences in framing and context impacted estimates of the Black–White wealth gap. Across our 10 different experimental manipulations of framing and context, respondents consistently overestimated Black family wealth relative to White wealth. There was also substantial variation in the magnitude of these wealth estimates, which ranged from a low of 35 to a high of over 60 percentage points across the conditions. Overestimates were largest when respondents were asked about the Black–White wealth gap at both past and present time points and closest to accuracy when respondents used images as pictorial comparisons for White and Black wealth. Overall, while framing and context certainly affect the magnitude of this misperception, the tendency to overestimate racial wealth equality is extremely robust. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the Seeds of Unity curriculum on a Pre-Kindergarten class consisting of four to five-year-old children in Brooklyn New York. The syllabus is a fusion of The Starting Small Program created by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the teaching of emotional competence theory. This study measured fourteen, four to five-year-old children before and after a ten-month exposure to the Seeds of Unity Curriculum. The Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS) was utilized to measure changes in emotional competence before and after exposure to the curriculum. The results showed a mean score on the Gresham Social Skills index that placed the girls in the 76% before the program and the 97% after, and the boys went from the 64% to the 89% when measured against children their age. Despite the small N, this study showed that using this curriculum, increased social emotional intelligence. The competencies incorporated into this paradigm are vital to improving relations between cultures in the ethnically diverse New York city schools and provides hope that change is possible. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Evidence from industrialized countries show that discrimination and experienced and/or perceived negative encounters with healthcare workers affect frequency and type of healthcare sought by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. In Guyana, and the wider English-speaking Caribbean region, there is a dearth of research on how healthcare workers and students perceive and interact with LGBT patients. This study investigated the attitudes and knowledge with regards to LGBT health among students at a medical school in Guyana by using quantitative, self-administered online surveys. We analyzed data using SPSS for descriptive and analytic calculations, and results showed that students held moderately prejudiced attitudes toward LGBT persons. Religiosity and heterosexual orientation were the main factors found to be associated with negative attitudes. Knowledge levels were also moderate with pronounced deficiencies in certain areas, and almost all students had not received LGBT-specific medical education, but most indicated a desire for such education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Social workers often address the emotional needs of family caregivers, which are particularly salient during the decision-making process regarding the choice of a living environment for a relative with dementia. In most home care settings, an assessment of caregivers’ needs is not part of routine practices. This study aims to describe the intervention strategies adopted by social workers in relation to caregivers’ emotions during their decision-making process. A qualitative research design was adopted. Seven social workers were recruited from three health and community service facilities in Montreal, Canada. One group and three individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data was analyzed using Miles, Huberman and Saldaña’s method (2013). Seven intervention strategies were identified: investigating emotions, acknowledging emotions, encouraging caregivers to carry on their role, focusing on the rational aspects of the decision, mitigating prejudices against nursing homes, mediating family dynamics and acting upon families’ needs. Some of these strategies are aimed at social workers meeting the demands of their jobs whilst others are centered around soothing caregiver emotions. These results can inform support services and future interventions by grounding them in the realities of service providers. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Sino-phobia, which has reportedly grown internationally during the COVID-19 pandemic, is a potential obstacle to China’s economic and foreign policy initiatives involving Russia and Central Asia. After providing historical and theoretical context, the authors analyse publicly reported time-series data from Russia and original survey data from Russia and Kyrgyzstan to assess the extent of Sino-phobic attitudes and their associations with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic variables. By also considering attitudes toward Americans and other national groups, the authors show that anti-Chinese sentiment, while high, does not exhibit especially pronounced tendencies. In Russia, nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment are key correlates of Sino-phobia. Additional survey research is necessary to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Sino-phobia and determine whether it hinders China-friendly policies, as some observers have suggested. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Despite the importance of cultural difference perceptions in intergroup relations, prior work has paid insufficient attention to the intersection between intergroup contact, perceived cultural distance, and policy support. Using cross-sectional data from a community sample of 210 Turkish citizens, this study examined whether perceived cultural distance would mediate the link between intergroup contact and support for Syrian refugee rights. The results showed that perceived cultural distance mediated the relationship between contact quality, but not contact quantity, and support for refugee rights. This mediated relationship was further moderated by political orientation, such that perceived cultural distance mediated the role of contact quality in support for refugee rights only among participants with a leftist (vs. rightist) orientation. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings were discussed, along with a reflection on future research directions.

AB  - Previous research indicates that user comments serve as exemplars and thus have an effect on perceived public opinion. Moreover, they also shape the attitudes of their readers. However, studies almost exclusively focus on controversial issues if they explore the consequences of user comments for attitudes and perceived public opinion. The current study wants to find out if hate speech attacking social groups due to characteristics such as religion or sexual orientation also has an effect on the way people think about these groups and how they think society perceives them. Moreover, we also investigated the effects of hate speech on prejudiced attitudes. To explore the hypotheses and research questions, we preregistered and conducted a 3 × 2 experimental study varying the amount of hate speech (none/few/many hateful comments) and the group that was attacked (Muslims/homosexuals). Results show no effects of the amount of hate speech on perceivedpublic opinion for both groups. However, if homosexuals are attacked, hate speech negatively affects perceived social cohesion. Moreover, for both groups, we find interaction effects between preexisting attitudes and hate speech for discriminating demands. This indicates that hate speech can increase polarization in society. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Sexual prejudice toward men who have sex with men (MSM) is a pressing concern in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Given the high HIV infection risk among this population, sexual prejudice perpetuated by healthcare providers, affects access to and willingness of MSM to seek HIV care services. However, data on healthcare providers’ attitudes towards MSM in SSA are limited, and there are no locally-adapted measures of sexual prejudice. We adapted a scale to measure sexual prejudice with a sample of 147 healthcare providers in western Kenya. Results from exploratory factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure. The scale demonstrated high internal consistency with Cronbach’s α = 0.91. Healthcare providers who had prior interpersonal contact with MSM, had ever been trained on counselling MSM, and had higher knowledge about MSM health needs reported lower sexual prejudice scores, compared with peers who lacked these experiences (p < 0.001). In contrast, healthcare providers who had experienced secondary stigma (negative judgments from peers and community) for providing care to MSM reported higher scores of sexual prejudice scale (p < 0.001) compared with providers who had not experienced secondary stigma. The scale provides a contextualised tool to assess healthcare providers’ attitudes toward MSM in Kenya and countries in SSA with similar cultural norms. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The study examines the effects of visual framing in news coverage of law enforcement use of lethal force. In a 2X2 online experiment, participants read one of four versions of a news story that included visual racial cues (images depicting a Black vs. a White victim) and a delinquent/normative frame—depicting the victim wearing attire that signifies either normative or delinquent behavior (regalia vs. a hooded sweatshirt). Both race and delinquency framing influenced the readers’ stereotype endorsement and feelings toward Black Americans. However, judgment of the police officer’s behavior solely depended on the victim’s race. These findings demonstrate the importance of imagery accompanying news reporting on social issues in activating and intensifying White-centered intergroup biases. Implications for responsible journalistic practices are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - During the interwar years, gendered inequalities in newspaper newsrooms and social prejudice against ‘mobile’ women combined to force women who wanted to work as foreign correspondents to seek alternative routes to raising their voices on international affairs. Women’s reportage can be found in a range of platforms from the mainstream press to early journals of humanitarian communication and literary magazines. When women reported for major newspapers they were often precariously freelance and the gendered nature of their treatment by newspaper hierarchies emphasised their, and all women’s, outsider status when it came to international politics. Women's international journalism, often rooted in the humanitarian tradition, concentrated on telling the lives of minor characters and ordinary people, and offers insights into individual human suffering at a time of great international anxiety. Their writing, often anonymous or in overlooked niche publications, represents a missing actor on public opinion at this critical time. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Negative stereotypes about female intellectual abilities occur in children as young as 6-years-old and can shape a child’s educational path and career choice, particularly in relation to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). The current study (N = 40) explored preexisting gender stereotypes in a purposeful sample of 6 to 8-year-old white British girls at a dance and performing arts center and tested the impact of a brief story-based intervention that exposed young girls to intellectually brilliant female role models in STEM. Rch Findings: Findings indicated that exposure to stories about women in science can help counter negative stereotypes concerning female intellectual ability. Another stereotype, “females are nicer than males”, was prevalent in most participants and was not affected by the current intervention. Pre or Policy: A key implication of this study is that young girls who learn about members of their own gender group who accomplished success in STEM fields may be more inclined to think of STEM careers as a possibility for females in future. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Physical Education (PE) teachers are subject to a great deal of social stereotyping. The goal of the study is to analyze the main reasons and motivations of three future PE teachers (two females and one male) with motor disabilities to undertake the profession in the future. Their families and the teachers who have taught them also participate. The disabilities are an arm amputation, severe hip dysmetry and Tourette’s syndrome. These future teachers, under a reflective perspective, expose the reasons and motivations why they want to be PE teachers, specifying diversity of experiences in the past and how they would like to teach the subject in the future. The introduction discusses whether disability fits into the ideal body type of PE, delving into the theories of social identity [Tajfel & Turner, 1979. An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. G. Austin & S. Worchel (Eds.), The social psychology of intergroup relations (pp. 33–47). Brooks- Cole] and social desirability (Paulhus, 2002). A qualitative approach is used in which three categories (established prior to obtaining the results) of analysis are established: (a) Motivations for being a PE teacher; (b) Limitations and obstacles exercised by society; and (c) Professional identity and conception of PE. Interviews with participants and their families, narrative journals and discussion groups are the data collection instruments used. The results show how, despite the fact that the motivation of future teachers is high (want to be physical education teachers above any other profession), the social constraints they face in order to achieve their dream are diverse. These obstacles are manifested in derogatory comments and lack of infrastructure and adapted material to be able to practice. Families and teachers agree that there is still a long way to go to achieve inclusion, especially in the area of PE. This inclusion refers to the acceptance into the subject of all students, regardless of their physical and psychological characteristics. It is essential to continue researching about disability and PE, since it allows breaking down a variety of existing barriers about the beliefs that people with disabilities have about the limitations of teaching the subject. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe people’s day-to-day experiences with weight-based discrimination and to distill themes that shed new light on this phenomenon. Design: A qualitative study was conducted in 2019 using a purposive sampling strategy. A racially and ethnically diverse sample of 32 U.S. adult men and women with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 completed a semi-structured interview. Results: Primary types of interpersonal weight-based discrimination included offensive comments, negative assumptions, social rejection, and unwanted attention or bullying. Participants also encountered environmental sources of weight bias such as inadequate seating in public venues. Three higher order themes that cut across people’s experiences with weight-based discrimination were identified: 1) the often-ambiguous nature of weight-based discrimination; 2) intersections between body weight and other social identities; and 3) the role of social comparison processes. Conclusion: Findings provide a detailed portrait of people’s everyday experiences with weight-based discrimination. These experiences often reflected widely held negative stereotypes about people with higher body weight and conveyed the socially devalued status of higher-weight individuals in society. Findings have important implications for future research and interventions aimed at reducing the harmful effects of weight-based discrimination on health and emotional wellbeing. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A number of recent studies find that integration and multiculturalism policies help soften anti-immigrant attitudes among the broader population. These findings, however, emerge from cross-sectional analyses and are potentially vulnerable to omitted variable bias. The analysis in this paper overcomes that limitation by adopting a longitudinal approach. This approach uses data from repeated cross-sections drawn from the European Social Survey and the European Values Survey. These data can be treated as panels in a longitudinal framework once it is recognised that the relevant variables (including the attitudes variables) can be handled effectively as country-level averages. Multi-level modelling (the default approach in existing research) is not necessary; in particular, there is no need to use individual-level control variables. In a fixed-effects analysis of country-level data, adoption of more open/accommodating integration and/or multiculturalism policies does not lead to a reduction in anti-immigration sentiment. The findings of the cross-sectional studies evidently suffer from significant omitted variable bias. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Ethnic minority patients face challenges concerning communication and are at higher risk of experiencing health problems and consuming fewer healthcare services. They are also exposed to disparaging societal discourses about migrants which might undermine healthcare institutions’ ambitions of equitable health care. Therefore, healthcare professionals need to critically reflect on their practices and processes related to ethnic minority patients. The aim of this article is to explore healthcare professionals’ experiences of working with ethnic minority patients by using the critical incident (CI) technique. In two focus group sessions, participants discussed challenging events in their encounters with patients. The critical incidents show that healthcare professionals may experience unfamiliar situations related to their work performance, prejudice toward patients, and labeling by patients the professionals do not identify with. The professionals’ reflections are discussed in relation to social discourses on migration and their work conditions, and the possible influence on the professionals’ preconceptions and the patient–professional relationship in health care. Reflections about work experiences with ethnic minority patients and aligned societal discourses should be included in healthcare workers’ professional development. Critical incident reflections at work may contribute to better-coping strategies for healthcare professionals and improved patient–professional relationships with ethnic minority patients. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This article develops the concept of “mimetic weaponization” for theory-building. Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from “sharing a joke” to promoting “alternative facts,” rebuking “political correctness” or “wokeness,” defending preferred framings of “free speech,” or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with “mainstream” media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme’s public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize–ostensibly through humour, parody or satire–rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as “just a bit of fun.”. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Discrimination and vilification of Muslims in the United States have historical and political roots. This study explores everyday incidents of marginalization and oppression through the framework of structural violence. Structural violence refers to the systemic inequalities embedded within societal structures that create and support these oppressive conditions. In this community-engaged qualitative study, 10 self-identified Muslims from the northeastern United States were interviewed to understand their lived experiences of structural violence. Using thematic analysis, seven themes were identified: Racialized and xenophobic Islamophobia; normalized violence against Muslims and fear of safety; exclusion, marginalization, and subjugation through policies; Muslims as spokespersons for Islam; Intersecting marginalized identities and oppression; challenges of navigating Muslim identities; resilience and resistance through faith, activism, and community. This study aims to understand and contextualize the experiences of Muslims within a systemic and geopolitical framework. Another critical objective is to promote a discourse to address how academics and clinicians reproduce and maintain structural violence and to instead engage in socially transformative approaches embedded in the principles of decolonizing and mutually-liberating cross-struggle solidarity. These must be cultivated through community-informed intersectional collaborative strategies for dismantling oppressive structures and promoting agency, resilience, activism, and resistance. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Introduction: Internalized sexual stigma, adult attachment, relationship satisfaction, and emotion regulation pay a major role in predicting depression in minority populations. Method: We examined the variables in a sample of 165 gay (64.8%) and bisexual men (35.2%), ages 19-68 years (M = 36.2; SD = 11.6). Results: Internalized stigma, attachment insecurity, relationship satisfaction, and emotion dysregulation predicted depression; emotion regulation mediated the relationship between internalized stigma and depression, between attachment and depression, as well as between relationship satisfaction and depression. Conclusion: Findings suggest the importance of improving educational community programs on sexual prejudices and on social homo and bi-negativity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We examined the relationships between different types of in-group positivity and prejudice toward gay and lesbian people among heterosexual men. We assumed that prejudice toward gay and lesbian people among heterosexual men should be predicted by gender-related collective narcissism (i.e., an unrealistic belief about in-group’s greatness which is contingent on external validation and extremely sensitive to any signs of threats) and not secure gender in-group identification (i.e., a confidently held in-group evaluation which is independent of the recognition of the group by others and serves as a buffer against threats). Across two studies (final Ns = 212 and 180) we found that gender-related collective narcissism (but not secure gender in-group identification or gender self-esteem) is positively related to prejudice toward gay and lesbian people among heterosexual men. The results of Study 2 demonstrated that this relationship was largely accounted for by the perceived out-group threat. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper aims to disrupt the dominant ‘segregation as negative’ narrative, by exploring hopeful experiences and perceptions of ethnic residential concentration. Drawing on fieldwork in an ethnically mixed, working-class inner-city neighbourhood, we critically reflect on recent debates around ethnic segregation, particularly hegemonic and ‘official’ policy discourses that position ethnic concentration as incompatible with social solidarity. Narratives from residents’ in-depth interviews in Liverpool 8 problematise this association, offering alternative interpretations of ethnic concentration. Historically, Black and other racially minoritised communities were spatially confined to this area through endemic structural racism. This accentuated existing class, religious and racial inequalities, leading to the stigmatisation and marginalisation of neighbourhood and community. Neighbourhood challenges to racism help both shape and reinforce allegiance and belonging to the neighbourhood of Liverpool 8. Out of structural discrimination and spatial confinement, a unique identity with place has been forged. This has strengthened perceptions of social solidarity amongst residents and led to a neighbourhood belonging ‘through difference’, not despite the multiple disadvantages residents faced, but, in many ways, because of them. Our findings underscore the value of contextualising the circumstances under which ethnic concentration is (re)created–to appreciate the nuances of its consequences, and how communities respond to them. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Black and Latina women are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Despite existing research linking social networks and HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high-risk populations, little research has examined how ethnic/racial minority women’s social networks shape HIV prevention and intervention targets. Using interviews with a sample of 165 predominantly Black and Latina-identifying women from a small city in the Western U.S., this research examines the relationship between egocentric network characteristics and HIV knowledge, attitudes, and testing history. Results reveal that network characteristics play a significant role in shaping HIV-related knowledge, prejudice, and testing intention but not HIV testing history. Individual-level factors like homelessness and perceptions of testing barriers are more salient for explaining testing behaviors than network characteristics. Intervention efforts to improve knowledge and reduce prejudice among Black and Latina women may benefit from mobilizing network ties. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This theoretical paper examines historical traumas and the impact they have on the mental health fields when working within similarities and across difference. This paper also examines racist ideologies in North America and how they are woven into the institutions and interpersonal relationships one can encounter. Traumas that are examined for the purposes of this paper are collective traumas such as Drapetomania, Tuskegee experiment/study, police brutality and the lynch laws. The use of some props in the dance/movement therapy field is examined through the lens of trauma-informed social justice care to prevent harm. There will be a theoretical model for clinicians to use to track their bias, assumptions, power, privilege, and prejudice. Please note that traumas will be discussed in this paper, take care of yourself, these topics can be difficult to read about and revisit. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - More than 8,100 people in San Diego live unsheltered on the street, with an additional 3,626 in temporary or emergency shelters. Efforts to address this humanitarian crisis have largely involved expanding existing models designed by government and social service providers that ironically exclude the voices of individuals with a lived experience of homelessness. The opportunity to store their belongings at the Transitional Storage Center provides a physical freedom to make choices, while liberating them from “dehumanizing” negative stereotyping. Using a constructivist grounded theory, the descriptive narratives gathered for this study allow for reframing the problems, solutions and perceptions of homelessness. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Much of the scholarship to date on the phenomenally popular Kamala Khan focuses on ways this titular character of the Ms. Marvel comic series complicates constructions of gender, religion, and immigration. This article endorses such claims, but instead highlights Kamala’s older brother, Aamir, arguing that his character constitutes a powerful counter narrative that refutes pervasive negative stereotypes about American Muslim men in both public and private realms. Over the first few years of the series, Aamir’s character evolves from unworldly and typically irritating older brother to loving husband and father, in the process complicating one-dimensional negative stereotypes of Muslim men in the domestic arena. When he is targeted by supervillains in an attempt to radicalise him into terrorism, Aamir’s refusal to accept a warped version of Islam not only reinforces the complexities of Muslim beliefs and practices but also challenges readers to acknowledge their own potential roles in accepting and perpetuating harmful misrepresentations. In the process, the comic’s illustration of the political and social marginalisation and oppression experienced by Muslims in our theoretically pluralistic society implicitly positions Aamir, as well as Kamala, as an argument for equity and justice. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Existential nihilism is on the rise in modern societies, but no previous work has investigated the social psychology of seeing no meaning in life. In the current research, five studies (N = 1,634) show that targets’ existential nihilist beliefs elicit a range of negative stereotypes about personality traits, commonly valued social traits, and targets’ ability to perform basic adaptive social tasks. Results demonstrate that these negative stereotypes are mediated by belief that the target is depressed more than the belief the target is non-religious or that the target does not plan for the future. Unlike atheists, who are seen as competent, no positive stereotypes emerged for nihilists, suggesting both future research and interventions aimed at updating false beliefs about nihilists. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Previous research has linked the internalization of shame and negative stereotypes associated with substance use to increased severity of substance use problems (i.e., negative consequences associated with alcohol and drug use, including occupational or relational difficulties and illegal behavior). However, little work has examined how other aspects of substance-use-related stigma (e.g., encounters with and anticipation of discrimination) might be related to the severity of substance use problems. Further, the psychological mechanisms through which stigma drives substance use problems remain poorly understood. Addressing these key limitations, the current study examined the role of executive functioning (EF) deficits in the relation between substance-use-related stigma and severity of substance use problems. Methods: In fall 2019, adults exposed to trauma who use substances were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (N = 320, 46.9% women) and completed self-report measures of substance-use-related stigma, EF deficits, and substance use problems. Results: Substance-use-related stigma was positively associated with EF deficits, which in turn related to substance use problems. Substance-use-related stigma was also indirectly associated with substance use problems through EF deficits, suggesting that EF deficits accounted for the significant association between substance-use-related stigma and substance use problems. Conclusions: These findings provide initial support for the role of EF deficits as a mechanism through which stigma drives substance use problems among individuals exposed to trauma. Results underscore the potential utility of addressing stigma coping and EF deficits in interventions aimed at preventing and treating substance use disorders. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We aimed to validate a long and a short version of the popular SDO6 scale for children, by testing their reliability and factorial structure, as well as divergent and criterion validity. Italian fourth- and fifth-graders (N = 271; 49.45% female) were administered the Child SDO6 scale, composed of 16 items, along with a series of personality and intergroup relations measures (using foreigners as the minority group). Paralleling results obtained with adults, findings concerning the short version provided evidence for a two-factorial structure, consisting of an SDO-Dominance and an SDO-Anti-egalitarianism dimension. Both for the long and the short version, greater levels of SDO-Dominance and SDO-Anti-egalitarianism were associated with more neuroticism, attitudinal and stereotypic bias, and with less agreeableness, openness to experience, dispositional and intergroup empathy. In conclusions, the two SDO dimensions as assessed by the short Child SDO6 Scale may be relevant variables to consider when testing intergroup relations processes among children. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Similar to discussions in social work education classrooms facilitated by Intergroup Dialogue (IGD), the Human Library (HL) is an opportunity for students to engage in personal one-on-one dialogue about prejudice, discrimination, and oppression. To date, no study has been conducted of the use of the HL in social work education. A qualitative case study approach exploring the perceptions of 11 participants in an HL event hosted by one midwestern university explored two research questions: How do those in the role of enlisted participants (Books) describe the HL experience? and What potential does the HL have to create IGD in the social work classroom? Data analysis revealed the following unique themes: (a) arriving with the baggage of the narrative, (b) intention to educate and raise awareness, (c) surprise at the undeserved respect they received from readers, (d) perception of a shift from monologue to dialogue, and (e) recognition of expanding the narrative that fueled positive self-perceptions. Freire’s critical theory was applied to the findings, identifying the benefits of its use in social work education compared to more traditional IGD offerings. © 2021 Council on Social Work Education.

AB  - Globalisation, migration, socio-political shifts, and access to the internet are increasing the religious and belief diversity of Irish society. This flux presents challenges for young people who are endeavouring to establish a secure identity. The focus of this research was to understand how the identity development of post-primary students of minority faith or worldview, is impacted by attending a school with a Catholic ethos. The research methodology was qualitative. To provide an opportunity for students to voice their experiences, 18 post-primary students of minority faith or worldview were interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to identify the findings. Reflecting on an interpretivist paradigm, the epistemology which underpinned this research was constructivism. While theories of adolescent moral and identity development alongside theories of othering, conformity, and agency supported the research study. The findings report some students struggled to find a secure identity due to conflicting societal, school, peer, and family beliefs. Perceived negative stereotyping of their beliefs created feelings of otherness with implications for students’ self-esteem. Students’ sense of belonging and well-being was impacted on by Catholic-centric school practices combined with current provision to ‘opt-out’ from Religious Education classes. However, the research also found human agency resulted in a kaleidoscope of student responses to the inherent challenges of adolescent identity development. © 2021 NAPCE.

AB  - Public opinion has moved towards a more restrictive approach to immigration since 2008, particularly in countries more strongly affected by economic recession. This is generally assumed to be a consequence of economic threat due to greater competition for scarce material resources, such as employment, leading to anti-immigration sentiment. However, not all individuals are affected equally by job losses, nor by the presence of migrants. Using data from the European Social Survey (2008–2016), in conjunction with the Labour Force Survey (2007–2016), this paper examines if individuals within occupations and sectors which face economic decline as measured by job losses, and which have a greater representation of migrants, are more likely to express anti-immigration sentiment. In line with the threat hypothesis the study finds that positive job growth is associated with pro-immigration sentiment while a greater share of migrants within occupations and sectors is linked to greater opposition towards immigration. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As the United States becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, interactions between Black people and other minority groups have become increasingly common. The present research examined how a perpetrator’s group membership affects judgments of employment discrimination against a Black victim. Four experiments (combined N = 1,016) tested predictions derived from the prototype model of discrimination. Participants reviewed a case file where a Black, Latino, Asian, or White manager rejected a Black job applicant. Attributions to discrimination were much stronger for a Latino, Asian, or White manager compared with a Black manager. Attributions to discrimination were slightly stronger for a White manager compared with an Asian or Latino manager; however, effect sizes for these differences were small. Attributions to discrimination were similar for the Asian and Latino managers. Whether the perpetrator had outgroup standing relative to the victim was the strongest factor influencing attributions to discrimination for a Black victim of employment discrimination. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Trying to cope with stigma by association (SBA) often results in behaviors leading to social isolation and withdrawal. This study aimed at exploring the stigma-related experiences of family members of persons living with bipolar disorder (PW-BD). A semi-structured interview was conducted with relatives of PW-BD. Open-ended questions addressed three issues: awareness of public stigma of bipolar disorder, experiences of associative stigma, and ways of coping with experiences of SBA. Data were collected from a purposive sample of 21 family members. Experiences of SBA were specifically related to the different family roles. Parents had to deal with responsibility, partners with the choice of staying or not, and siblings with “a sort of duty.” These specific prejudices enhanced specific coping strategies. This is the first study to highlight specific issues and coping from the perspective of family members. Based on these findings, specific targeted interventions could be developed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Far-right actors are often purveyors of Islamophobic hate speech online, using social media to spread divisive and prejudiced messages which can stir up intergroup tensions and conflict. Hateful content can inflict harm on targeted victims, create a sense of fear amongst communities and stir up intergroup tensions and conflict. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to better understand at a granular level how Islamophobia manifests online and who produces it. We investigate the dynamics of Islamophobia amongst followers of a prominent UK far right political party on Twitter, the British National Party. Analysing a new data set of five million tweets, collected over a period of one year, using a machine learning classifier and latent Markov modelling, we identify seven types of Islamophobic far right actors, capturing qualitative, quantitative and temporal differences in their behaviour. Notably, we show that a small number of users are responsible for most of the Islamophobia that we observe. We then discuss the policy implications of this typology in the context of social media regulation. © 2021 Department of Security Studies and Criminology.

AB  - In the United States, race and racism are woven into the very fabric of the welfare state. Racial antipathy has undermined public support for benefits perceived as favoring African Americans and has resulted in significant cuts in programs for the poor. Recently, some studies have found that public discussion on immigration has linked attitudes toward Hispanics and illegal immigrants with preferences toward programs once overwhelmingly influenced by racial attitudes. Building on this literature, the present study assesses the effect of racial and ethnic attitudes on state policy outcomes. Specifically, we examine Medicaid eligibility criteria for four categories of beneficiaries, ranked by level of perceived deservingness. We find that eligibility limits are most generous for children, followed by pregnant women and parents. Benefits for “other adults” (low-income non-parents aged 18–64) are subject to more stringent eligibility criteria or entirely unavailable. In contrast with the limits for other groups, the primary attitudinal predictors of Medicaid eligibility limits for the “other adults” category are antipathy toward Blacks, Hispanics, and illegal immigrants. These results confirm that perceptions of deservingness are a central component of U.S. social policy and demonstrate that material policy outcomes–not just policy preferences–are substantially shaped by attitudes toward Hispanics and immigrants as well as African Americans. © 2021 Midwest Sociological Society.

AB  - This article discusses dis/ability and physical education teacher education (PETE). The aim is twofold. First, I explore how dis/ability is problematised in PETE syllabi from nine Swedish universities. Bacchi's What's the problem represented to be? approach for analysing policy texts is used. The centre of attention thus shifts from a problem and its solution, to how a phenomenon is made into a problem and to the effects of this problematisation. Second, a theoretical framework that corresponds better with the aims of the steering documents advising Swedish compulsory schools and PETE is proposed. In the analysis, two dominant problem representations were discerned. First, pupils with impairment or special needs are constructed as the problem. When pupils with impairment are problematised, they risk being constructed as deviant and marginal in PE. This is reinforced by the fact that, in some cases, the subject is dealt with in only a few pages of text and as part of a single course. Second, power relations, norms or inequality are constructed as the problem. Thus, the focus shifts from the pupils’ reduced physical, cognitive or neuropsychiatric ability to the interactions with able-bodied teachers and peers. Bacchi also asks where the silences are in the texts. The notion of disability, caused by social barriers such as inaccessibility and prejudices, is completely missing. Moreover, ableism–discrimination that favours being able-bodied–is not explicitly dealt with, not even when the syllabi bring up power relations or norms. A change within PETE is required, with inclusive education as the goal. I suggest that both the effects of impairment and ableism, which lead to disabilities, need to be taken into account. Cripistemologies–that is, the knowledge of disabled people–would be useful in this process, as a way to dismantle ableism and appreciate differences. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Older adults are often stereotyped as having less technological ability than younger age groups. As a result, older individuals may avoid using technology due to stereotype threat, the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group. The present research examined the role of stereotype threat within the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Across two studies, experiencing stereotype threat in the technological domain was indirectly associated with lower levels of technology use among older adults. This was found for subjective (Study 1) and objective measures (Study 2) of use behaviour, and for technology use in general (Study 1) and computer use in particular (Study 2). In line with the predictions of the Technology Acceptance Model, this relationship was mediated by anxiety, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioural intention. Specifically, stereotype threat was negatively associated with perceived ease of use (Studies 1 and 2) and anxiety mediated this relationship (Study 2). These findings suggest that older adults underuse technology due to the threat of confirming ageist stereotypes targeting their age group. Stereotype threat may thus be an important barrier to technology acceptance and usage in late adulthood. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article aims to define the main facets and challenges of undocumented migrants on the move in Fez city (Morocco) and their impact on neighbourhoods and on society at large. It seeks to measure the integration of sub-Saharan migrants in the host community through the metrics of their participation in economic and social activities in urban space and discusses the main hurdles impeding their integration. The data show that there is, on the one hand, a quite low degree of acceptance by the local population, which in general tolerates their presence although signs of discrimination and prejudice in certain neighbourhoods are observed. On the other hand, the sample shows that some sort of partial integration occurs through forms of micro-entrepreneurial activities and use of city services. Further, the article proposes the idea of rethinking the concept of citizenship in order to understand the new flows of migration. It shows that the concept of citizenship needs to be re-considered beyond the formal and legal dimension, in order to include informal dimensions for a more realistic rendering of the interaction between migrants and the city. Unlike Isin (2017. “Performative Citizenship.” In The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, edited by Ayelet Shachar, Rainer Bauböck, Irene Bloemraad, and Maarten Vink, 500–523. Oxford: Oxford University Press) and others who focus mainly on acts of citizenship as political, the article reveals that migrants perform their own acts of citizenship through social interaction, in line with Ong's (2007) theory of mutations of citizenship. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The current research investigates people’s attitudes toward an ambiguous situation of police violence against a woman suspect. We hypothesize that the suspect’s race and participants’ ambivalent sexism, particularly benevolent sexism, will jointly inform perceptions of the suspect’s femininity, and in turn, perceptions of the suspect’s pain, judgments of who is to blame, and perceptions the officer was justified in using force against the suspect. Across two studies, we found support for our hypotheses: participants who reported more benevolent sexism thought the suspect were more feminine, but this association was only present when the suspect was White, as opposed to Black. Perceived femininity, in turn, predicted perceptions the suspect felt more pain, was less blameworthy for the situation, and perceptions that the officer’s use of force was less justified (Study 2). © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Ageism is a term used to describe negative stereotypes and prejudices often leading to the discrimination of older adults. Ageism has been linked to negative outcomes such as a decreased quality of life, discrimination in the workplace, and poorer mental and physical health for older adults. Promoting positive contact experiences between older and younger generations in combination with education about aging has shown to improve attitudes among younger adults toward aging. Using the Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences (PEACE) model, this study examined the attitudes toward aging among 23 undergraduate students prior to and upon completion of an intergenerational service learning project, embedded within an aging course. The Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) was used to measure levels of ageism before and after the intergenerational service learning project. The overall mean among the entire sample for the pre-FSA scores (68.86 ± 1.47) was significantly greater than the mean scores on the post-FSA scores (63.13 ± 1.48), t = 5.584, p <.001, demonstrating a significant decrease in ageism scores upon completion of the intergenerational service learning project. Findings validate the utility of intergenerational service learning programs and offers advice on the implementation of evidence-based strategies aimed at reducing ageism among the population. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study explores the lived experiences of 28 Chinese international students to enhance understanding of their social integration in the Dutch higher education institutions, with a focus on intercultural friendships. The findings indicate that establishing friendships with non-Chinese students is challenging due to several reasons: language comprehension/production, cultural distance, interests in different social activities, lack of initiatives from Dutch students, (perceived) prejudice and discrimination, and dependence on the Chinese community. The findings underscore the need for institutions to provide more support for Chinese students regarding linguistic competences and cultural understanding, while highlighting the importance of promoting an inclusive academic environment. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Criminalization of social groups can create new norms for intergroup relations. An example for this is the 2018 amendment to the Hungarian Fundamental Law, which openly criminalizes homeless people. In our research, we investigated whether criminalization of homelessness can become a source of justifying violence against homeless people in the Hungarian context. We assumed that right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation would positively predict support for violence against the homeless, and the acceptance of a criminalizing law can serve as a justification for this. Our hypotheses were tested using a convenience (N = 196) and a representative sample of the population of Budapest (N = 674). We found that both RWA and SDO predicted support for violence, and this connection was mediated by the new law. We also found that justification was influenced by educational level, as the association between SDO and violence increased with higher levels of education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The model of ethnification posits that in post-socialist contexts ethnic identities are used as a source for political mobilization against ethnic outgroups. In Croatia, this is further amplified by collective war experiences. This paper investigates the association between identity-based variables, related to ethnification and war experiences, and anti-immigrant prejudice in Croatia. The study employed structural equation modelling of the data from a large youth sample (N = 1,034). Higher ethnic threat, lower cultural capital, more exclusive conception of nationhood and right-wing political orientation predicted stronger anti-immigrant prejudice. Ethnic threat moderated the effect of political orientation on prejudice: under high ethnic threat there was no difference between left-wing and right-wing individuals. As the results correspond to findings from Western countries, we argue that comparable explanations of anti-immigrant prejudice may be applied to non-Western and Western contexts. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Prejudice towards trans women is an under-examined but a critical social problem in Turkey. Patriarchal femininity sanctions women who do not comply with the idealised female bodies and feminine norms. On the other hand, ideals of hegemonic masculinity necessitate that men avoid femininity. In that sense, prejudice against trans women ostensibly stands at the intersection of hegemonic masculinity ideology and femininities that diverge from patriarchal feminine norms. Therefore, this study examines the mediatory effect of femmephobia in the link between masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women as measured by negative affect and social distancing motivations. Results indicate that femmephobia significantly mediates the relationship between the endorsement of masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women. Among three mandates of masculinity ideology, the endorsement of the antifemininity mandate was the most solid indirect predictor of negative affect and social distance through femmephobia, followed by mandates of toughness and status, respectively. Although participant gender does not have an indirect effect on the outcome variables, it has a direct effect on men’s social distancing intentions but not on negative emotions. The results are discussed in the light of existing literature which intersects with the devaluation of femininity. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - People with Albinism tend to face multiple adverse physical, psychological and social consequences. Very little is known about experiences of women with Albinism and their deliberations whilst making reproductive decisions. This study aimed to explore lived experiences of women with Albinism and to understand their perspectives on reproductive decision making. Qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten women with Albinism in Taiwan. Five key themes emerged from the accounts which were centred around the sense of discrimination that they felt whilst growing up, their strive for normality, making difficult choices in their reproductive decisions, desire to protect children from harm and reflections of parenting struggles from own experiences and the experiences of their parents. We call for global and national policy makers and practitioners to introduce explicit measures to challenge the myths, stereotypes and prejudices associated with Albinism including specific interventions towards supporting women in pregnancy decision making.Points of interest Very little is known about the lived experiences of women with Albinism and their deliberations whilst making reproductive decisions. The research found that a key element of the overall experience is the sense of discrimination that the women had to face due to their physical appearance and visual impairment. Most women actively attempted to fight off notions of abnormality and to keep their identity close to what they perceived as normal. The women with and without children viewed pregnancy decisions as making difficult choices. Having a child who would not inherit Albinism was a key influence in pregnancy decisions. They strongly desired to protect the children from the difficult experiences that they have had. The research recommended that global and national policy makers and practitioners should introduce explicit measures to challenge the myths, stereotypes and prejudices associated with the condition including specific interventions towards supporting women in pregnancy decision making. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Today’s management of migration is strongly dependent on the role of reception centres. Despite their crucial role, scholars of the securitisation of migration have overlooked at how they affect the process. In the light shed by this special issue, the present contribution analyses non-state actors’ cognitions and narratives in the management of reception centres, so as to explain their performative roles in securitising or de-securitising human mobility as a threat. Its findings prove that, when reception centres’ managers hold prejudicial cognitions, they develop negative practices that produce hostile and stereotyped narratives. A multi-method comparative case study, including covert ethnography, field observation and in-depth interviews, shows that, differently from speech-acts, narratives do not need to be accepted by the audience to exercise their effects. The audience is impressed from the narratives, which in a performative act, make people feel and perceive what the narration stages [Alexander, J. 2004. ‘Cultural Pragmatics: Social Performance between Ritual and Strategy.’ Sociological Theory 22 (4): 527–573; Lyotard, J. F. 1979. La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savior. English Translation “The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge”. Manchester University Press]. Akin accountings contribute to spiralling the process, by self-fulfilling and reinforcing the securitisation of migration. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Negative stereotypes associated with certain groups can lead to stereotype threat, a phenomenon that can negatively impact performance. The majority of existing studies that find negative effects of stereotype threat on performance are based on subpopulations such as students and older adults. This paper contributes by investigating the concept of stereotype threat in the context of adults at a range of ages of Roma ethnicity in Slovakia. The study is based on an incentivized lab-in-field experiment with 203 participants. Its main goal is to investigate whether reminding Roma adults of their ethnic identity affects their performance. The results suggest that making ethnicity salient reduces the performance of Roma adults by approximately 11%. These findings are consistent with the expectations of the stereotype threat hypothesis. The study further examines confidence as a potential channel, but the findings are ambiguous. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Nation state building, competing sovereign claims, the capitalist drive for land and resources fuelled by international market forces and prevalent racial ideologies can be identified as major structural factors that leads to the dispossession of indigenous lands and in many cases to the physical destruction of indigenous peoples. In this context settler colonial studies continues to work towards a theory of settler colonialism. This article contributes to these debates by examining the genocide of the Selk’nam in Tierra del Fuego through the lens of extinction discourse. It analyses the way that extinction discourse emerged as an explanatory–and exculpatory–narrative for the fast diminishing numbers of the Selk’nam not only among officials and settlers uninterested in their fates, but also among the missionaries engaged in humanitarian efforts to save them. In particular the relationship between negative stereotypes of primitiveness and savagery and the settler process constitute a major point of analytical inquest. This epistemological ambition means that this article is textually based and as such relies on displaying a selection of texts in their original forms contextualised within the history of settler colonialism. It concludes by suggesting that understanding and challenging the role and pervasiveness of social Darwinist discourses on extinction remains a central issue in understanding settler genocides and a challenge for promoting the recognition of indigenous identities and rights. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The objective behind the present article is two-fold. Firstly, departing from the assumption that distance and salience dynamics are key to both functioning and impact of the media, we aim to present a new theoretical perspective on social media discourse understood as both product and process–Media Proximization Approach–and thus shed light on the exploratory potential of Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS) paradigm (KhosraviNik, 2017b. Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS). In J. Flowerdew, & J. E. Richardson (Eds.), Handbook of Critical Discourse Analysis (pp. 583–596). Routledge) emphasizing both the horizontal (industrial) and vertical (social) dimensions of digital communication. Secondly, identifying various dimensions of proximization within social media, we will discuss their role in creating a conducive environment for the spread of populist ideologies, and, more generally, changing the communication dynamics between the primary and secondary definers. Data-wise, the article focuses on current social media discursive practices concerning Enoch Powell’s ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in the context of rising anti-immigration sentiment and Brexit campaign. Two YouTube videos recontextualizing the speech along with the accompanying comments will be discussed here to show how political discourses get remediated in social media where their ‘prosumers’ imbue them with new form, function and emotionality. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Council of Social Work Education (CSWE) and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) mandate that social workers engage diversity and difference to practice cultural competence. Because the social work profession serves a diverse population that includes humanity’s extensive list of intersecting backgrounds and identities, the very essence of cultural competence comprises fundamental complications in its overall conceptualization, construct, and application of theory to practice. The purpose of this study explored the challenges newly employed social workers faced in practicing cultural competence relative to their experiences as novice professionals. The sample included 20 participants who recently graduated from accredited CSWE MSW programs and were newly employed in the field of social welfare. Through qualitative research methods, data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and one focus group. The findings emphasized the multifaceted nature of cultural competence and highlighted (a) areas for growth in feelings of inadequacy, (b) frustration with fundamental organizational barriers, and (c) prejudice from clients. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The 2012 gangrape of a young woman in Delhi, known as the Nirbhaya case, became an international media event that cast public spaces in India as unsafe, and situated sexual violence as a problem characterized by class difference and lack of development. This dominant media discourse reiterated long-standing neocolonial, classist and casteist tropes that signified a failure of transnational solidarity. At this time, Talk to Me, a public art intervention by the Bangalore-based feminist artist collective, Blank Noise, went viral on social media. The project took place near the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology on a lane along which many women experience molestation and harassment. Students from Srishti engaged strangers–typically migrant and displaced men from the lower classes–in a conversation over tea and a snack. In this article, I analyse Talk to Me as an intervention that offered a counternarrative and countervisual to the dominant, fear-based characterization of public spaces in India. Talk to Me encouraged participants, through a process of dialogue and conversation, to identify and overcome their internalized biases about the lower-class, migrant men who are often constructed as sexual threats to upper-class women. These conversations, I argue, were designed to break down ingrained biases and internalized prejudice, and to attempt to create compassion and solidarity across the barriers of class, education, language, and gender. The intervention offers a model of building solidarity that is not passive or automatic, but rather requires the difficult and often uncomfortable labour of self-reflection and introspection. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Directors of color at college counseling centers face many challenges. In this article, three directors of color will describe the issues they face on a daily basis working in predominantly white institutions to illustrate how racial identities intersect with leadership. Included among the dynamics explored are the external pressures of unattainable expectations held by supervisors; microaggressions and negative stereotyping among peers; stereotype threat; and internal pressures around being undermined in racialized ways by staff; and managing projections and over-identifications among staff. We highlight the ways it can feel like walking a tightrope around serving the needs of a diverse staff. The article concludes by offering suggestions and next steps for supervisors of directors of color, staff of directors of color, and directors of color themselves. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We examined how people construct their social identities from multiple group memberships—and whether intergroup contact can reduce prejudice by fostering more inclusive social identities. South Indian participants (N = 351) from diverse caste backgrounds viewed 24 identity cards, each representing a person with whom participants shared none, one, two, or all of three group memberships (caste, religion, nationality). Participants judged each person as “us” or “not us,” showing whom they included in their ingroup, and whom they excluded. Participants tended to exclude caste and religious minorities, replicating persistent social divides. Bridging these divides, cross-group friendship was associated with more inclusive identities which, in turn, were associated with more positive relations between an advantaged, an intermediate, and a disadvantaged caste group. Negative contact was associated with less inclusive identities. Contact and identity processes, however, did not affect entrenched opposition to (or undermine support for) affirmative action in advantaged and disadvantaged groups. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - A survey of 340 UK residents was conducted when the COVID-19 virus first reached the UK in February 2020. We measured past experiences of positive and negative intergroup contact with Chinese people as predictors of intergroup threat and emotions in the context of the pandemic; and how these processes in turn predicted support for discriminatory policies designed to restrict the freedom of Chinese people in the UK. We tested a novel threat-matching hypothesis which draws upon models of outgroup-specific social perception to predict that the emotional processes underlying contact effects will depend on the specific threat posed by the outgroup. In the present epidemiological context, Chinese people posed a salient threat to individuals’ physical health and welfare. Accordingly, we show that whilst intergroup contact predicted both fear and anger towards the outgroup, the indirect effect of contact on support for Chinese restriction policies via fear was significantly stronger than the indirect effect via anger. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how specific threat and emotions drive intergroup contact effects, and offer important insights for efforts to maintain positive intergroup relations in the face of the crisis. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Research on intergroup bias usually focuses on a single dimension of social categorization. In real life, however, people are aware of others’ multiple group memberships and use this information to form attitudesabout them. The present research tests the predictive power of identification, perceived conflict, and perceivedsymbolic threat in explaining the strength of intergroup bias on various dimensions of social categorization inmultiple categorization settings. We conduct a factorial survey experiment, manipulating 9 dimensions ofsocial categorization in diverse samples from 4 countries (n = 12,810 observations, 1,281 participantsrepresenting 103 social groups). The dimensions studied are age, gender, ethnicity, religion, place of residence,education, occupation, income, and 1 country-specific dimension. This approach allows exploring thegeneralizability of established determinants of bias across dimensions of categorization, contexts, and targetgroups. Identification and symbolic threat showed good generalizability across countries and categorizationdimensions, but their effects varied as a function of participant and target groups’ status. Identificationpredicted stronger bias mainly when the participant belonged to a higher status and the target belonged to alower status group. Symbolic threat predicted stronger bias mainly when the target was a minority groupmember. Conflict predicted bias only in few cases, and not only the strength but also the direction of the effectsvaried across countries, dimensions, and target and participant groups. These findings help to clarify the limitsof generalizability of established determinants of intergroup bias and highlight the need for new explanationsof social– cognitive processes among minority group members © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - This article examines findings from a qualitative study exploring the experiences of young adults with disabilities regarding their perceptions of interpersonal discrimination on public transport in two Australian states. Interpersonal discrimination by members of the public included contests for accessible seating, receiving unwanted physical assistance, bullying and intimidation. Participants reported that transport staff engaged in verbal abuse and hostile interactions including questioning the young person’s disability. These experiences appeared to be influenced by narrow perceptions of disability, visibility or otherwise of the young person’s impairment, limited understanding of the needs of young people with disabilities, and the age and gender of the person behaving in a discriminatory way. The discriminatory experiences were reported to have had a negative impact on the social and economic participation of these young adults in their communities.Points of interest The participants of the study disclosed diverse experiences of interpersonal discrimination by the travelling public and transport officials. Interpersonal discrimination impacted on some of the young adults’ capacity to move about freely, as they sought to avoid exposure to prejudicial attitudes and verbal abuse. Heightened concerns about getting to and from activities safely affected the young adults’ willingness to use public transport for their daily activities. Eliminating day-to-day interpersonal discrimination that young adults with disabilities experience on public transport requires legislative, policy and societal change. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Virtually all studies on inter-ethnic attitudes in Western Europe and North America find that higher educated individuals report greater tolerance towards migrants and ethnic minorities. The overwhelming evidence on this link has even led scholars to call for educational expansion as a policy measure to increase social cohesion in today’s ever more diverse societies. But most of this evidence comes from cross-sectional correlations, and it is still unclear whether increasing education actually causes greater levels of tolerance. In this study, we follow a cohort of students aged 15 years over a period of 8 years from the German Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey (CILS4EU-DE). We focus on students who change from lower tracks into upper secondary and later tertiary education (the ‘treatment’ group) and compare them to a control group of similar students who stay in the lower track and leave school without entering university. Matching and fixed-effects panel regressions provide no evidence for a causal effect of changing into a higher educational track on subsequent prejudice towards ethnic minorities. We conclude that the descriptive difference between educational groups in their attitudes towards ethnic minorities is evident, but attending higher education per se does not seem to cause this difference. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Despite increasing scholarship on sexual minority youth (SMY), little is known about the experiences and outcomes of those who identify as asexual. This study investigates how internal and external stressors, mental health and health risk behaviours differ between asexual youth and other SMY. The study uses a sub-group analysis (n = 5,314) of an online survey of self-identified sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY). Descriptive and inferential statistics compare asexual (n = 669) to non-asexual (n = 4,645) respondents across two developmental phases–adolescence (age 14–19) and young adulthood (age 20–25)–while accounting for gender minority (e.g., transgender) self-identification. Results indicate that asexual youth had significantly higher internalised LGBTQ-phobia and tended to have poorer mental health (e.g., higher rates of depression), while having experienced less interpersonal discrimination/prejudice and having engaged in fewer health risk behaviours (e.g., substance use). Findings have implications for clinical practice. Future research should continue to investigate the impact of risk and protective factors on outcomes for asexual young people. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Much research demonstrates that people high in religiosity tend to be prejudiced against value-threatening groups. Therefore, some researchers have suggested that people who are not religious may be less prejudiced. Are nonreligious people characterized by general tolerance? If not, what are the bases of their prejudices? This research investigated prejudice toward Christians and atheists among people who identify as nonreligious (atheist, agnostic, and spiritual-but-not-religious), documented this prejudice in the form of exclusion behaviors (Study 1) and self-report of affect and social distance (Studies 2–3), and explored potential mechanisms of nonreligious prejudice toward Christians: individual differences in belief style and biases against Christians (Studies 2–3). Results showed the nonreligious are not generally tolerant and that differences among these groups in belief superiority, feelings of distrust, and fear of contamination by unpalatable ideas all explained differences in prejudice toward Christians. These findings help provide a more comprehensive picture of religious intergroup prejudice. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The literature on migration and racism usually focuses on Western, highly skilled migrants working in global cities who reproduce racial postcolonial hierarchies or on less-privileged, low-skilled migrants and refugees, whose situation is analysed in terms of experienced racial prejudices. Our article aims to fill the gap related to the in-between category of middling migrants and to analyse their relations with neoliberalism and racism. By drawing on qualitative research, the paper examines racial neoliberalism and the question of how racism operates in the everyday life of middling migrants. In contrast to the nascent literature on middling migrants, we focus less on their experiences of racism as how migrants’ neoliberal subjectivity contributes to the strengthening of racism. Our analysis demonstrates that middling migrants not only evoke the neoliberal hierarchy of desirable and undesirable migrants but also, through neoliberal subjectivity, reproduce the neoliberal logic of silencing and marginalising racism as a social problem. We argue that, paradoxically, although middling migrants are not openly racist and often become victims of racism themselves, they nevertheless contribute to maintaining the conditions for racism to exist. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - By bringing in the Big-Two model of social perception, the present research extended previous literature regarding how people perceive homogeneous and cohesive groups from the process level to the content level. We compared the effects of intragroup similarity and interaction on warmth and competence judgments about groups. The similarity or interaction (high or low) of the novel groups (Study 1) and an international group (Study 2) was manipulated by descriptions. Participants were asked to rate the target groups on warmth- and competence-related traits. Consistent with our hypotheses, similarity polarized both warmth and competence judgments, whereas interaction polarized warmth judgments but enhanced competence judgments. The current research not only advances group perception research but also provides practical implications for improving group image and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) both predict generalized prejudice, dehumanization, intergroup discrimination, oppression, violence, right-wing political party preference, and generally punitive attitudes. Authoritarian attitudes have been theorized to involve maladaptive emotional, cognitive, and social self-regulation. However, there is no study of authoritarianism using the functioning of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) as a physiological index of self-regulation, thus leaving it unclear whether regulation is “impaired” with authoritarian attitudes per se. PNS functioning is commonly assessed by examining tonic and phasic heart rate variability (HRV). These two components are recognized to be important in terms of adaptation to stress. Decreased HRV has been associated with hypoactive prefrontal regulation, hyperactive subcortical structures, maladaptive self-regulation, hyper-vigilance, decreased prosocial tendencies, defensiveness, impulsive behaviors, and aggression. Previous research suggests that self-regulatory failure may favor hostile attitudes and prejudicial intergroup behaviors. In a first study, we found that high RWA was associated with lower tonic HRV at rest. In a second study, stress-induced autonomic reactivity and poststress autonomic recovery were examined as potential pathways linking authoritarian attitudes to self-regulation. We found that high RWA and high SDO were associated with (i) lower tonic HRV during stress, (ii) greater autonomic reactivity during stress, and (iii) lower autonomic recovery. Overall, our results suggest that autonomic dysregulation during and following stress is a plausible physiological pathway connecting RWA and SDO to self-regulation. Implications of such results for research on political attitudes are discussed © 2020. American Psychological Association

AB  - This study explores the reciprocal perceptions, main tendencies, prejudices and expectations of the societies in Turkey and North Cyprus. To this end, 160 participants from both societies were interviewed. The specific social processes that result in various judgements, thoughts and tendencies observed in the semi-structured interviews were evaluated by the discourse analysis method. Although the research findings and analyses are not representative of the whole populations, they still shed light on common perceptions. In fact, the results counterintuitively revealed that people from both societies exhibit increasing suspicion, if not negativity, about each other despite the widely accepted nationalist narrative of ‘motherland-babyland’, which is believed to be the main dynamic of the relations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Anticipated HIV stigma refers to expectations held by individuals regarding social rejection, prejudice, and discrimination if they were ever to be infected by HIV. Much of the prior work on the impact of this anticipated stigma on HIV testing focus on men who have sex with men and transgender women populations, suggesting that higher levels of anticipated stigma contributes to delays in HIV testing. The same association is insufficiently explored in heterosexual men. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the association between anticipated HIV stigma and HIV testing in a mainly self-identified as heterosexual (n = 97.4%) sample of 434 Brazilian male soldiers. In this sample, 84.3% of the study participants had never been tested for HIV. Those with higher anticipated HIV stigma were more likely to delay HIV testing. These data suggest that campaigns and actions should target heterosexual men young population, not only sexual and gender minorities. Future research and interventions are warranted to guarantee environments with less stigma and to develop HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention among heterosexual men. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Research indicates that students’ developmental capacity must be accounted for if postsecondary institutions’ various diversity programs, pedagogies, and related efforts are to be successful. One such effort that has increased in prevalence in recent years, intergroup dialogue (IGD), is a pedagogy that brings together diverse groups of students to engage in sustained, facilitated dialogues on topics related to diversity and social justice. Decades of IGD research have informed the development of the critical-dialogic theoretical framework of IGD, which describes how this particular approach to dialogue engages students in communicative, cognitive, and emotional processes that promote intergroup understanding, intergroup relationships, and intergroup collaboration and action. Using the theory of selfauthorship and theories of epistemological development as analytical lenses, this article examines the extent to which the critical-dialogic theoretical framework of IGD, along with the research that informed its development, account for factors associated with students’ interpersonal, intrapersonal, and epistemological development. This analysis and conceptual integration of the IGD, self-authorship, and epistemological development literatures reveal that IGD research and theory development have focused primarily on matters of interpersonal relationships and intrapersonal identity, with less attention given to students’ epistemological assumptions of knowledge, knowing, and related meaning-making. Implications for IGD theory development, practice, and future research are discussed © 2020 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education

AB  - The Olympics aim to promote peace and unity across the globe through sports. Ironically, however, we predicted that the Olympics could be associated with intergroup biases because the Olympics not only activate social/national identity as a citizen, but also highlight intense competition between countries. In support of this prediction, attitudes toward outgroups were negatively associated with international sporting events like the Olympics (Studies 1–2). Moreover, both behavioral intentions (Study 3) and actual behaviors (Study 4) toward outgroups were more negative during the Olympics than before the Olympics. During the Olympics, Koreans were less willing to donate money to help migrant workers and showed a tendency to discriminate against Southeast Asian job applicants. Interestingly, the association was observed for negatively stereotyped outgroups (e.g., Southeast Asians and Chinese), but not for favorably stereotyped outgroups (e.g., Canadians). © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - What are the microlevel mechanisms that explain citizens’ support of populist social movements? We address this question by focusing on the ‘PEGIDA’ (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident) protest groups in Germany, which became particularly prominent by attracting large numbers of attendees in street protests during the years 2015/16. We develop and test an integrative theoretical model that points to the key roles of anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction as mediators linking subjective socioeconomic deprivation with citizens’ support of the ‘Pegida’-movement. Equally important, this model holds that citizens’ political dissatisfaction moderates the nexus between anti-immigrant attitudes and support for ‘Pegida’. The results based on data from seven cross-sectional general population surveys provide clear support for these predictions. Combined, these efforts help to advance scholarly understanding of not only why, but also how and under what conditions non-activist citizens support anti-immigrant collective action as exemplified by the ‘Pegida’ movement. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Why is migration unpopular? A vast literature argues that voters oppose immigration because of threatened interests and prejudice. This paper is among the first studies of opposition to emigration–the other side of the issue salient in many countries. Departing from existing public opinion research, I develop a number of tests comparing emigration and immigration attitudes and then exploit relevant survey data from 30 countries, as well as original experimental and qualitative evidence. Overall, I document high opposition to both emigration and immigration in many countries and show that respondents are unlikely to confuse these issues. I then show that individual emigration and immigration attitudes are significantly correlated and have similar predictors, which is reflected in respondents’ own open-ended explanations. While consistent with sociotropic accounts, this new evidence suggests that many natives may exhibit an aversion to human mobility between countries in general, not immigration or emigration in particular. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Bisexual individuals not only experience instances of invisibility and erasure within various social systems and structures but also encounter prejudice and discrimination that is fuelled by stereotypes. While gay men and lesbian women tend to only experience homonegativity from heterosexual individuals, bisexual persons are subject to binegativity from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian groups. Only recently has there been a concerted effort to increase the amount of research conducted on binegativity among heterosexual and gay/lesbian groups. However, since this body of research is only recently growing, it seems prudent to identify the binegativity measures currently available and evaluate how well each adheres to best practices regarding their psychometric properties. In the current study, 82 scales were identified and their adherence to best practices in psychometric assessment was examined. Most measures lacked sufficient details attesting to item development/refinement, factor structure, scale score reliability, and construct validity. No measure was found to follow best practices for all psychometric properties; those that were close are identified and recommendations are made for improving future binegativity scales. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Fictional narratives can serve as an indirect contact strategy when direct contact between two groups is not feasible. This study investigated whether exposing cisgender individuals to transgender-related fiction was associated with reduced transnegativity. Two emotion-related mediators were examined in this relationship: transportation into the story (proximal to fiction exposure) and intergroup anxiety (proximal to contact theory). Cisgender participants (N = 84) viewed or read stories involving transgender characters or read a science article. Those who encountered transgender characters reported lower transnegativity than those who read the control story. Transportation into the story and intergroup anxiety serially mediated this relationship. The findings suggest conditions under which a fictional story can expand an audience’s social world and thereby serve as a strategy for prejudice reduction. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We used data from the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey to evaluate factors associated with anaemia (World Health Organization cut-points using altitude- and smoking-adjusted haemoglobin [Hb]) among nationally representative samples of adolescents 10–19 years. Hb, biomarkers of micronutrients, infection and inflammation were assessed from venous blood. Sociodemographic and household characteristics, dietary diversity, pica and recent morbidity were ascertained by interview. We explored bivariate relationships between candidate predictors and anaemia among boys (N = 967) and girls (N = 1,680). Candidate predictors with P < 0.05 in bivariate analyses were included in sex-specific multivariable logistic regression models. Anaemia prevalence was 20.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [17.1, 24.1]) among girls and 10.9% (95% CI [8.2, 13.6]) among boys. Among girls, living in the Mountain and Hill ecological zones relative to the Terai (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.28, 95% CI [0.15, 0.52] and AOR 0.42, 95% CI [0.25, 0.73], respectively), ln ferritin (μg/L) (AOR 0.53, 95% CI [0.42, 0.68]) and ln retinol binding protein (RBP) (μmol/L) (AOR 0.08, 95% CI [0.04, 0.16]) were associated with reduced anaemia odds. Older age (age in years AOR 1.19, 95% CI [1.12, 1.27]) and Janajati ethnicity relative to the Muslim ethnicity (AOR 3.04, 95% CI [1.10, 8.36]) were associated with higher anaemia odds. Among boys, ln RBP [μmol/L] (AOR 0.25, 95% CI [0.10, 0.65]) and having consumed flesh foods (AOR 0.57, 95% CI [0.33, 0.99]) were associated with lower anaemia odds. Open defecation (AOR 2.36, 95% CI [1.15, 4.84]) and ln transferrin receptor [mg/L] (AOR 3.21, 95% CI [1.25, 8.23]) were associated with increased anaemia odds. Anaemia among adolescents might be addressed through effective public health policy and programs targeting micronutrient status, diet and sanitation. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Contemporary literature reflects a newly emerging paradigm of the Arab Muslim refugee’s identity. The current conflict in the Middle East created a surge of migrants to European nations. The resulting social phenomenon enforces a series of interpersonal and international struggles for both the refugees and their hosts. In this paper, I carry out a comparative interpretation of Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire and Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West in order to demonstrate the Arab Muslim refugee’s identity reinvention and metamorphosis in Britain, particularly in London. As I demonstrate in this paper, the many protagonists in both literary works allude to specific phases of the naturalization process, as social group’s prejudiced and stereotypical conceptualization of the ‘other’ is identified. Paradoxical accounts of empathy and apathy are recorded and conflicting social roles are highlighted. The literary works suggest the genesis of new multi-national Arab Muslim identities as potential (re)solution to the interpersonal struggles of integration. © 2020 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.

AB  - Dust samples from roads classified based on traffic volumes (low, medium and high traffic) were collected from Muscat, Oman, and then analyzed for a dozen heavy metals. Their contents varied widely with mercury and iron, having the lowest and highest concentrations (0.59–0.80 and 406.10–429.00 ppm, respectively). Contrary to most metals detected, mercury and arsenic did not only exhibit increasing trends from low to high categories, but they also were significantly correlated to each other and traffic volumes, suggesting that both might originate from vehicular emissions. While the calculations revealed that the potential ecological risk index (RI) for selected metals in the dust samples was at a considerable level, the hazard index (HI) was within the safe threshold value (HI < 1). Overall, our findings imply minor prejudicial health risks to the general public nevertheless, children would be relatively more vulnerable to the impact of metals associated with dust. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Drawn by the allure of “ancient cultures,” tourists inadvertently consume deauthenticated indigenous practices, including ethnomedical traditions such as midwifery. This is especially true in the case of “Traditional Mexican Midwifery” since stark differences exist between how midwifery practices unfold in indigenous contexts and how they are represented to global tourists. “Traditional Mexican Midwifery” tourism is a unique lens for examining some of the underlying, intersectional issues threatening “sustainability” in ethnomedical tourism. When nonindigenous individuals position themselves as representatives of “Traditional Mexican Midwifery” and indigenous midwives are excluded from profit chains, this type of tourism not only fails to meet the needs of the indigenous people it fetishizes, it actually excludes them from the equation entirely. While overt prejudice and racial discrimination of the colonial era no longer exist, neocolonial tourism in the form of “Traditional Mexican Midwifery” tourism subtly reinforces romanticized stereotypes of the indigenous “Other.” Ethnographic examples, gleaned from multi-sited research in Mexico and Brazil, demonstrate the usefulness of “Traditional Mexican Midwifery” for critiquing existing misapplications of responsible tourism and proposing more sustainable futures. Tourism can be an indigenous process (in which local residents both motivate and reap the benefits of tourism), or it can serve a neocolonial agenda (in which tourism development and profits unequitably favor transnational elites). Current forms of “Traditional Mexican Midwifery” tourism are unsustainable due to intersectional exclusion of indigenous women based on race, class, and gender. To dismantle intersectional inequality in “Traditional Mexican Midwifery,” coordinated efforts by Mexican Secretary of Health’s Traditional Medicine and Intercultural Development (TMID), Mexican Midwifery Association, and critical tourism scholars and activists are required. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Students’ attitudes towards native English speaking teachers (NESTs) and local English teachers has been a fertile area of research for many years, but the commonly used surveys focusing on students’ explicit attitudes have been criticised because of the influence of prejudice. An alternative is to use social psychology instruments such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate both explicit and implicit attitudes as in Watson Todd and Pojanapunya (2009. “Implicit Attitudes Towards Native and Non-native Speaker Teachers.” System 37: 23–33. doi:10.1016/j.system.2008.08.002). This article is a direct replication of Watson Todd and Pojanapunya (2009), but, because the sociolinguistic context in Thailand has changed with greater use of English as a lingua franca (ELF) since the original study, we aim to look for differences between the findings of the original study and those of the current study rather than confirm the original, a process we term elaborative replication. Using an IAT with 439 Thai university students, the results show that, in contrast to our expectations, students’ implicit and explicit attitudes towards NESTs have become more positive in the ten years since the original study, a finding that casts doubt on the wider social impact of the ELF movement. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We examined when and why individuals spontaneously used shared humanity arguments. Participants (undergraduate college students in the U.S. around 20 years of age) writing in support (vs. non-support) of gays and lesbians (Study 1), writing in support of a marginalized (vs. dominant) group (Study 2), and writing in support of a marginalized group for an audience who disagrees (vs. agrees) with one’s argument (Study 3) showed greater usage of shared humanity arguments. In Study 4, we assessed shared humanity arguments when writing in support of refugees in the U.S. along with measures of motivation to control prejudiced reactions, fear of negative evaluation, and social desirability (self-deceptive enhancement, impression management). The results showed that only fear of negative evaluation and self-deceptive enhancement predicted usage of shared humanity arguments. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Social affiliation in humans is ubiquitous and adaptive, albeit bounded. For example, crowding is experienced as aversive, and fosters reticent behaviors to mitigate contact with potentially threatening conspecifics. Given the integral role of physical proximity in disease transmission, crowd salience could activate pathogen-avoidant motives in response to personal space violations from others. Three preliminary studies investigated how crowd salience heightens pathogen-avoidant motives and shapes interpersonal perceptions. Crowd salience heightened preferences for good genes cues (facial symmetry; Study 2), but not aversion to bad genes cues (obesity; Study 1). Crowd salience was additionally unrelated to anti-immigration attitudes (Study 3). Although crowd salience elicited no significant differences in pathogen-avoidant motives in Studies 1 and 2, it significantly heightened perceived infectability, but not germ aversion, in Study 3. Study 4 was a preregistered, high-powered replication and demonstrated crowd salience heightened both state levels of perceived infectability and germ aversion, necessitating consideration for subtlety in detecting state-level differences. We discuss potential bases for inconsistencies in the findings while offering recommendations for future research. © 2019. American Psychological Association

AB  - Islamist terror is one of the most terrifying threats worldwide. However, there is no common model about the mechanisms underlying the complex process of radicalization and research is usually undermined by a lack of empirical data. Therefore, we aimed to compose a comprehensive model of radicalization, and test it empirically collecting and analyzing data on Islamist radicals in Western Europe. In Study 1, police professionals assessed seventy-five subjects under investigation for being in the process of radicalization. In Study 2, data from open source news articles about eighty six radical Muslims were evaluated by psychologists. Specific individual preconditions including young age, male gender, migration background, and biographical cuts were consistently found among radicals. Fueling the actual radicalization process, a gradual increase of individual, group and catalyst processes was observed from early (Study 1) to late stages of radicalization (Study 2). These included pursuing individual needs (transcendence, significance, self-esteem, control); processes in the course of a strong group commitment (group identification, prejudice, polarization, perceived group threat, collective emotions, informative influence); and cognitive adaptions to get increasingly comfortable with applying violence (desensitization, dehumanization). The current work may be a solid basis for further empirical investigations and for creating means of prevention and deradicalization. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Perceived threat is a central feature of theories of intergroup behaviour, such as the minority threat perspective. Studies have linked perceptions of Latinos as threatening the interests of Whites to Whites’ support for more punitive policies in the U.S., especially in areas experiencing a recent growth in the Latino population. This research, however, is limited in that researchers rarely measure perceptions of Latino threat directly and have yet to expand on the limitations of existing measures. To this end, this study was designed to develop a 20-item Perceived Latino Threat Scale (PLTS) and assess its association with relevant external criteria, including several vehicles for the social control of Latinos. The scale was administered to students attending a Southwestern university during the Republican Party presidential primaries (Study 1: N = 332) and just prior to the 2016 election (Study 2: N = 259). Bifactor analyses indicated that perceptions of Latino threat can be subdivided into four dimensions: economic, political, criminal, and opportunity threat. Higher perceptions of Latino threat, especially economic threat, were associated with support for Donald Trump, being a Republican and politically conservative, and harbouring punitive attitudes toward crime and border control. Implications for theory and research are discussed. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
