AB  - In the framework of linguistic or national minorities in Europe, the Friulian case can be considered, from several points of view, an exemplary one. This applies not only to the historical development of its minoritisation and to the steadiness of its claims to recognition and protection but also to the way, during the last decades, that the community has been trying to promote its language and concretely affirm those fundamental rights related to the use of the language itself, through laws and actions of language policy and planning. The contribution aims to present the Friulian case, illustrating the evolution of legislation and policies and identifying their impact on the language itself, its formal and informal use, its social presence, the community’s legitimation, self-representation and delimitation, and the establishment of language rights. It is an interesting path with noteworthy results. It is also a discontinuous itinerary, with ups and downs, in which most of the protection rules (Law 482/1999 and the Regional ones 15/1996 and 29/2007) have not found real application. Therefore, the language is still excluded from several fundamental contexts and, despite some encouraging data coming from the most recent sociolinguistic research, its public use and its presence in education and in the media are still victims of old prejudices, which inspire the contradictory choices of political and institutional decision-makers. Friulian is at the same time a resistant and emerging language and a strongly minoritized one. © John Benjamins Publishing Company

AB  - Background: People identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) have been shown to experience more trauma and poorer mental health than their heterosexual counterparts, particularly in countries with discriminatory laws and policies. Northern Ireland is a post-conflict region with high rates of trauma and mental health problems, as well as significant levels of prejudice against the LGB community. To date, no studies in Northern Ireland have compared trauma exposure, social support and mental health status of LGB students to their heterosexual peers. Objective: The present study aimed to assess whether LGB status was associated with more trauma exposure and poorer mental health, and whether social support mediated these associations. Method: The sample was comprised of 1,116 university students. Eighty-nine percent (n = 993) identified as heterosexual and 11% (n = 123) identified as LGB. Path analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Results: LGB status was significantly associated with increased trauma exposure and with symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety, but not with problematic alcohol use. These associations were mediated by social support from family only. Conclusions: These results evidence vulnerabilities among Northern Irish students identifying as LGB in relation to trauma and mental health compared with their heterosexual peers. However, social support from family has the potential to mitigate risk. Educational initiatives should raise awareness of the importance of familial support for LGB youth, and those young people who lack family support should be considered an at-risk group, warranting particularly intensive targeting by relevant supports. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the food groups consumed by students and the dietary habits and life satisfaction. Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out with 811 students studying in Balıkesir University, Faculty of Health Sciences in January 2018 in Turkey. In this study, Personal Information Form, Survey of Eating Habits and Satisfaction with lifeScale that included the socio-demographic characteristics and the frequency of food consumption of the students were used. Kolmogorov Simirnov test, mean, standard deviation, number, percentage, Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis test, Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used in the evaluation of the data. Results: Satisfaction with lifescores of students who often consume grains, fruits, meat and its derivatives were found to be high.It was determined that as self-perception against being overweight and eating habits scores increase, lifesatisfaction decreases in students. Prejudice score against being overweight was found to be high in students studying nursing care, whose BMI is normal and who rarely consume vegetable. The positive and negative thought scores caused by being overweight were found to be high in overweight/obese students who often consume dairy product and legume. The self-perception score against being overweight was found to be high in students who are obese and often consume dairy products. Eating habits score was found to be high in weak students who rarely consume dairy products and fruit (P<0.05). Conclusions: It was found that while the consumption of foods with high quality and high calorie value by students increases satisfaction with life, perceiving himself/herself to be overweight reduces satisfaction with life. It was found that BMI affects thoughts on being overweight. It was determined that the students who receive dietary education, who perceive themselves to be overweight and who have excessive positive-negative thoughts about being overweight have high awareness of being overweight and prefer healthy diet practices. Based on these results, an increase in satisfaction with life can be achieved by providing proper dietary habits and receiving dietary education. © Mattioli 1885

AB  - BACKGROUND: Responses to anticipateddiscrimination are common among mental health service users and can have adetrimental impact on their recovery. Since 2009, the Time to Change (TTC)anti-stigma program in England has aimed to improve service users' empowerment,reducing public stigma and discrimination. In this paper, we aim to evaluatewhether service users' awareness of TTC is associated with fewer responses toanticipated discrimination. METHODS: We used data collected for the evaluation of TTC from samples of mental health service users interviewed by telephone in annual surveys 2009-2014. RESULTS: Five thousand and nine hundredand twenty-three participants completed the survey, mainly suffering from mooddisorders (depression, 28.4%, n = 1,681) and schizophrenia related disorders(15.4%, n = 915).In 23.2% of cases,participants were aware of any aspects of the TTC program, while participationin TTC was reported by 2.6%. Being aware of the TTC program was notsignificantly associated with responses to anticipated discrimination, exceptfor those participating in the TTC campaign in 2013. Stopping oneself fromapplying for work was significantly associated with experienced discriminationin both finding (p &lt; 0.001) and keeping (p &lt; 0.001) a job.Concealing mental health problems was associated with a general experience ofbeing shunned (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of a nationalanti-stigma program may not be sufficient to encourage people to seek work/educationor to be open about their illness in situations in which they currentlyanticipate discrimination. There is the need to identify new multi-levelstrategies for challenging anticipated discrimination, even focusing ondifferent target groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In light of current economic prosperity and subsequent attainment of upper-middle-income country status, Botswana attracted nurse educators from other African countries. Within this cross-cultural environment, anti-immigrant sentiments have catalysed incidents of incivility, affecting the quality of teaching and learning outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore experiences of incivility amongst foreign nurse educators and how it impacts their work and livelihood. METHOD: This study employed a qualitative approach, using interpretive phenomenology. In-depth interviews using a developed guide were conducted with 13 foreign nurse educators working as nurse educators in Botswana. Thematic analysis was conducted in accordance with interpretive phenomenology, where transcriptions were drafted after each interview. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the study findings: hostile behaviour, discrimination and inequitable application of procedures and processes. Discrimination as a theme has two sub-themes, namely, workplace injustice and individual injustice. CONCLUSION: The study found that foreign nurse educators working in Botswana experience incivility. From the findings, the study strongly recommends application of equitable job opportunities to all employees, including foreign nurse educators who are employed to meet the shortage of nurse educators in Botswana. The researchers are of the opinion that the nurse educator shortage will persist in Botswana, partly because of the nursing profession rendered unattractive by hostile social interactions amongst nurse educators' exclusion of foreign nurses from benefits enjoyed by local nurse educators, workplace injustice targeting foreign nurse educators, as well as inequitable application of policies and processes that affect foreign nurse educators.

AB  - In this paper, I investigate intergroup relations between natives and asylum seekers during the European refugee crisis, and contribute to the reemerging methodological debate on the measurement of stereotypes and prejudices as individual and collective constructs. Drawing on data from the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP; N = 1,062), I examined how Norwegians stereotyped asylum seekers at the height of the refugee crisis and the emotional prejudices asylum seekers as a group elicited. By experimentally manipulating the survey question format, I examined whether and how stereotypes and emotional prejudices toward asylum-seekers differed depending on their measurement as individual or collective constructs. A subset of respondents (n = 228) had reception centers for asylum-seekers established in their local community during the crisis. These participants reported their behaviors toward the asylum seekers in their neighborhood. In this subsample, I investigated how individual facilitating and harming intergroup behavior was related to individual and collective conceptualizations of stereotypes and prejudices. The results showed that both low warmth and low competence stereotypes, as well as negative emotions toward asylum seekers, were rated as stronger when measured as collective as compared to individual-level constructs. In the individual condition, respondents reported feeling more admiration and sympathy than respondents in the collective condition attributed to others. Individual stereotypes and prejudices correlated systematically with individual facilitating and harming intergroup behaviors. The perception that others hold more negative stereotypes of asylum seekers, and the perceived anger and fear of others, did correlated with individual harming behaviors. Perceptions of others’ anxiety correlated negatively with facilitating behaviors. Implications and future directions for the conceptualization and measurement of stereotypes and emotional prejudices are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Bye.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The presence of discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment, and harassment (DBSH) in the healthcare workplace negatively affects the health and well-being of providers and is associated with poor mental health, low self-esteem, high levels of absenteeism, and low levels of productivity. METHODS: The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) developed and distributed a survey to a subset of AAOS members to assess the climate of workplace safety and overall workplace culture. Women and underrepresented minority (URM) AAOS members and an equal number of randomly selected non-URM men were invited to participate in the survey. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-seven of 5,638 (16.4%) members responded to the survey. Sixty-six percent of respondents reported experiencing DBSH behavior with specific exposures to DBSH of 79%, 55%, 47%, and 40%, respectively. Women (81%) were more likely than men (35%) to have experienced these behaviors. Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported that their workplaces were equipped to deal effectively with DBSH behaviors. DISCUSSION: DBSH behaviors occur in the orthopaedic workplace. More attention to these issues is necessary to ensure that all orthopaedic surgeons in training and in practice have a safe work environment that is inclusive, equitable, and health-promoting.N/A.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the factors impacting information poverty in western China and investigate to what extent these determinants contribute to information poverty in these areas. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to analyze 232 valid responses collected from a survey to examine the research model and hypotheses in this study. Findings: The results indicate that information literacy, information supply and information and communication technologies (ICTs) positively and significantly affect information poverty, while social prejudice and information orientation had no significant effects on information poverty. Practical implications: Public libraries, government departments and other institutions should pay attention to the significant impact of information literacy, information supply and ICTs on information poverty and formulate corresponding systems and policies to alleviate or reduce information poverty. Originality/values: In the past, few studies have focused on information poverty in western China and most of the existing research on information poverty adopts qualitative research methods, such as interview, systematic literature review and so on, while quantitative research is rare. In addition, the focus of these research studies was on one or two aspects, and a few of them can systematically study the influencing factors of information poverty. Inspired by the theories of information literacy, social prejudice and information poverty, this study comprehensively used a questionnaire survey and SEM to investigate the influences of information literacy, social prejudice, information supply, information orientation and ICTs on information poverty. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Latin-American immigration has transformed Chilean schools into new multicultural scenarios. Studies about intergroup dynamics among students from different cultural backgrounds and their psychological consequences are still limited in south–south migration contexts. Literature has suggested that intergroup relations influence students’ satisfaction with school, and they could be improved by the development of competences to cope with cultural differences. This study aims to verify if cultural self-efficacy and its dimensions mediated the influence of prejudice on satisfaction with school, in a sample composed by N = 690 Chilean and Latin-American immigrant secondary students. Results showed that cultural self-efficacy reduced the effect of prejudice in satisfaction with school, in the cases of both immigrant and Chilean students. The dimensions of cultural self-efficacy in processing information from other cultures and mixing with different others make the difference. Findings’ contributions for the understanding of adolescents’ intergroup relations and psychosocial interventions at school are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Mera-Lemp, Bilbao and Basabe.

AB  - Muslims in the U.S. have been politically targeted as a threat to the nation. Yet, little is known about how most Americans’ attitudes are formed toward this growing group. While often othered in terms of their religion, race-ethnicity, and national background, Muslims also constitute the latest minority group in America’s racialized landscape. This study draws on theories of race-ethnicity, intergroup relations, and religious exclusion to situate Muslims relative to existing intergroup relations in the United States. Using four waves of the American National Election Survey, the study finds little evidence for affective solidarities between America’s largest racial-ethnic groups and Muslims. Instead, intergroup boundaries tend to predict lower levels of Muslim favorability. Further, the study uncovers a religious dimension concentrated among largely White evangelical Protestants. Findings are discussed within the context of sociodemographic changes in the U.S., and the prospect for shifting colour lines in the wake of increasing immigration-led diversity. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Although sexuality is a ubiquitous human need, recent empirical research has shown that people without disabilities attribute fewer sexual rights and perceive sexual healthcare to benefit fewer people with disabilities, compared to non-disabled people. Within a global context, such misperceptions have tangible, deleterious consequences for people with disabilities (e.g., exclusion from sexual healthcare), creating an urgent need for effective strategies to change misperceptions. Methods: To lay the groundwork for developing such strategies, we examined predictors of the recognition of sexual rights of people with physical disabilities within the South African context, derived from three key social psychological literatures (prejudice, social dominance orientation and intergroup contact), as well as the relationship between sexual rights and beliefs about sexual healthcare. Data were obtained through a cross-sectional survey, given to non-disabled South Africans (N = 1989). Results: Findings indicated that lack of recognition of the sexual rights for physically disabled people predicted less positive beliefs about the benefits of sexual healthcare. In turn, high levels of prejudice (both cognitive and affective) toward disabled sexuality predicted less recognition of their sexual rights, while prejudice (both forms) was predicted by prior contact with disabled people and possessing a social dominance orientation (cognitive prejudice only). Evidence was also obtained for an indirect relationship of contact and social dominance orientation on sexual healthcare beliefs through prejudice, although these effects were extremely small. Conclusion: Results are discussed in terms of their implications for rehabilitation, as well as national-level strategies to tackle negative perceptions of disabled sexuality, particularly in contexts affected by HIV.Implications for rehabilitation Findings demonstrate an empirical link between prejudice toward disabled sexuality, lack of recognition of sexual rights and viewing sexual healthcare of less benefit for disabled people. Consequently, there is need for increased attention to these dimensions within the rehabilitative context. Contact with disabled people, including dedicated interventions, is unlikely to meaningfully impact beliefs about the benefits of sexual healthcare. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rejection of Muslim religious practices in West European societies is typically explained by prejudicial feelings towards Muslims as a group. However, although people can oppose Muslim religious practices because they feel negatively towards Muslims as a group, they might also have more general reasons for doing so. By simultaneously considering multiple religious acts (wearing religious symbols and following religious education in public schools) and multiple religious actors (Muslims and Christians), we theoretically differentiate between individuals who apply a double-standard by rejecting Muslim but not Christian religious practices (discriminatory rejection) and those who reject practices independently of the religious group engaged in them (equal rejection). Among majority members in five West European countries, the findings support the existence of equal rejection next to discriminatory rejection with both patterns of responses having different associations with people's prejudices towards Muslim, their endorsement of civil liberties and secular values, and their religious affiliation. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Dalit Literature is mainly the result of socio-cultural changes that took place in Maharashtra in India after independence. Silenced for centuries by caste prejudice and social oppression, Maharashtra’s Dalits registered their protest in the form of short stories, poetry, novels, and autobiographies. The volatile surroundings made the autobiographical narratives depict through realistic and effective writing, the inhumanity, lawlessness, and cruelty. The autobiographies were written from the author’s direct experiences in life, and they celebrate the fighting spirit in their characters who work against all the odds in life and struggle for marginalized existence in the caste-based society in India. Voicing of issues such as subjugation, oppression, violence, and the transformation of the stigmatized identity is the primary concern of these writers. Copyright © Archana Parashar.

AB  - In our society of growing complexity, education is a fundamental strategy to reduce social vulnerability, transform inequalities, and contribute to the peaceful empowerment of groups at risk of social exclusion. Creative and effective educational intervention strategies are needed based on dialogue with the real interests of young offenders. This could enable the Freirean “viable unknown,” that in this context would suppose the recognition of the potentialities of the group and the transformation of prejudices about them. This study examines the possibilities of rap and the audio-visual media as social-educational tools, based on an ethnographic study of a workshop developed with young offenders who fulfilled measures in an open environment in the northern Spanish city. In this context, rap music and audiovisual creation functioned as devices for peaceful empowerment and for free expression and self-affirmation of the group. Achieving positive visibility for the group reinforced the prosocial behavior of adolescents, which are essential factors of protection against maladaptive behavior that leads to the prosecution of young people. This was only possible by establishing a dialogical link between educators and learners, listening to the centers of interest of the participants and applying participatory methodologies of creation. © Common Ground Research Networks, Belén Massó-Guijarro, Ramón Montes-Rodríguez, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The opioid crisis represents one of the largest failures of our current health care system as it continues to claim lives at an unprecedented rate and has caused a devastating range of preventable morbidity. Although the availability of highly potent synthetic opioids has amplified the urgency of the crisis for patients and communities, this problem has evolved over several decades. Pharmacists are in a position to offer many potential solutions due to their widespread accessibility, extensive drug knowledge, and integration into various health care settings. This opinion paper challenges the status quo by calling on all pharmacists to embrace evidence-based opioid stewardship and harm reduction practices, contribute to the medical management of opioid use disorder, and address the misconceptions and prejudices that serve as barriers to effective, compassionate patient care. Regardless of practice setting or available resources, pharmacists can take deliberate and impactful steps to address the opioid crisis. Some pharmacists may be positioned to implement innovative and far-reaching pharmacist-led clinical services, while others may simply begin with careful consideration of the language they use when speaking to and about patients with substance use disorders. To optimize patient outcomes, the ineffective laws, regulations, and policies that negatively impact pain and addiction care must be addressed so that evidence-based solutions can be widely disseminated. Pharmacists must aggressively advocate for the removal of barriers preventing high-level clinical practice or policies that perpetuate patient harm and abandonment. Finally, there must be support for continued research on pain and opioid use disorder treatments and services, as well as the impacts of harm reduction practices and pharmacist-led clinical services, so that resources can be allocated effectively. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

AB  - Nowadays, society assumes interactions and relationships between cultures, between members of different peoples or states. Intercultural communication is the basis of creating such connections and contacts, especially in the context of migration. The present research identifies the Romanians level of cultural adaptation and their ability in taking on new communication paradigms in the migration process, but it also notices the existence of some obstacles/barriers and Romanian migrants` attempt to exceed them with a view to integration into the new country. We will start with conceptual identifications and specialists` opinions in the field. The main part of the study is built on research realized as an investigation based on a questionnaire addressed to the Romanians abroad. This research lays on observing the perceptiveness of strangers over Romanians, on identifying prejudices and discrimination, the difficulties in adapting to the new economic, social, and cultural environment. As well, it lays on establishing the methods of accepting and tolerating intercultural differences. © 2020 PROUniversitaria Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on a hemerographic investigation, this article constitutes an initial look at events held by guitarists Antonio Jiménez Manjón, Miguel Llobet and Agustín Barrios in Chile between 1893 and 1918. In the case of Manjón, the positive reception his concerts received went against some of the discourse in the local media, which considered the guitar vulgar and expressionless. For his part, Llobet made the ‘Tárrega School’ known in Chile in 1912. This proved a relevant milestone in the study of that school in our country. His technique was praised and, as with Manjón too, led to a questioning of the prejudices against the guitar. The case of Agustín Barrios is noteworthy since, as far as we know, he did not gain the same recognition and success as his predecessors, even though he was an outstanding guitarist and composer. Going over the events held by these artists shows that negative discourse about the guitar was widespread, leading to a specific way of understanding the development of the instrument in our country. © 2020, Revista Musical Chilena, Año LXXIV, julio-diciembre.

AB  - The Black Lives Matter campaign has highlighted issues of race and racism that are present in all parts of our communities and organisations. We stand in solidarity against racism in all forms and acknowledge that organisations, including those within the publishing world, need to do more. BJGP Open must ensure that ethnic minority voices are heard and represented within our leadership, board members, fellows, editorial staff, readers, and authors.1 The statistics on under-representation of ethnic groups at all levels of publication and academia make uncomfortable reading, and the reluctance to openly acknowledge this is delaying progress.2,3 The tokenistic phrases and well-intended platitudes on the need for greater diversity must be matched with measurable action. As a journal, we need to play our part and demonstrate a commitment to meaningful progress on this issue. Accordingly, BJGP Open has set out an ambitious programme of work on race and diversity. It starts with this special issue, in which we have collated individual and collective experiences on racism in primary care alongside relevant policy and practice submissions. GPs, trainees, medical students, and academics have shared their recent lived experiences of the everyday racism that ethnic minorities face in our discipline today.4 These challenging experiences range from a GP being doused in alcohol by a patient;5 a medical student repeatedly overlooked due to race;6 and a GP required to ignore racial slurs at the request of a senior partner.7 Where is the accountability, they ask? Hartland and Larkai describe in their article the concept of decolonisation in reforming the medical school curriculum, and explain why this is important in addressing unconscious biases.8 They highlight their approach to bringing about long-term institutional change, which they suggest is necessary to equip medical students with the tools to manage an increasingly diverse population. Bhatti and colleagues in their viewpoint provide us with another historical perspective, emphasising the substantial contribution of migrant labourers to different roles in primary care.9 The authors highlight the Medical Workforce Race Equality Standard (MWRES) in narrowing the gap in workplace experiences and opportunities, and call for the inclusion of general practice to bring about sustainable change. Sarfo-Annin takes this further in a commentary that outlines the case for affirmative action in reducing racial exclusion by enabling structural changes to achieve representative diversity, especially for leadership positions.10 They argue that the term ‘BAME’ (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) had too broad a definition to be useful as a metric for ethnic inclusion because of significant heterogeneity in the experiences of different minority ethnic groups. While acknowledging the complex challenges, they call for more detailed data on the ethnicity of GPs to raise awareness, generate dialogue, and enhance the organisational accountability that might improve inclusivity. Ikpoh's article then presents a very personal trainee perspective.11 Next, Gopal and colleagues contribute a discussion on the effect of racial disparities on GPs, and question whether the non-minority workforce needs to go further in acknowledging personal prejudices and implicit biases.12 The authors suggest that improvement will come in the form of greater diversity in leadership and governance structures. Their suggestions on the importance of diversity in leadership and governance have not gone unheard. At our journal, we have made strategic appointments, including a new Editorial Board which represents one of the most diverse in the history of our larger journal family. Similarly, our team of editorial fellows and medical students reflects racially diverse voices. Led by our Editorial Board, we © 2020. The Authors. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Based on a diachronic case study of history textbooks used in Slovak primary and secondary schools since 1918, this article discusses the roles biographies of historical heroes can play in school education. The case study analyses history textbook narratives about the medieval ruler Svätopluk published during three different political regimes, tracing their heritage up to present-day history textbooks. The text argues that the presentation of Svätopluk's qualities, talents and achievements has been used not only in depicting him as a representative of the community, and as a desired prototype of a good citizen, but also in the formation of negative stereotypes about the representatives of the Other. This excluded significant segments of pupils of certain national minorities from the mainstream narrative and labeled them as enemies. An examination of the images of Svätopluk in history textbooks confirmed that these were politically motivated and influenced by current ideologies. However, it also showed that 19th century Romanticist ideals, resulting in apologetic and nation defending narratives, remained an integral part of history textbooks throughout the 20th century, prevailing over the narratives offered by official contemporary historiography. © 2020 Slávka Otčenášová, published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - In the last presidential election, Latino populations were the target of prejudicial language and discriminatory rhetoric. Experiences of discrimination may impact adolescent mental health, but little is known about the impact of the election cycle on Latino youth perceptions of discrimination and related emotional outcomes. The aim of this study was to understand Latino youths’ experiences, emotional reactions, and coping responses to discrimination surrounding the 2016 Presidential election. To do this, this study employed a qualitative approach that en-gaged 30 Latino youth ages 8 to 16 years old from Latino-serving social services agencies in the creation of art based on prompts, dialogue based on that art, and the completion of a demographic survey at the begin-ning of the study period. Qualitative analysis of the dialogues revealed that youth experienced direct peer discrimination that they attributed to anti-immigrant and anti-Latino political rhetoric and their emotional responses included anger, sadness, and powerlessness. Youth utilized coping responses to discrimination that included direct confrontation to discrimination and utilizing their imagination to respond to discrimi-nation. The results of this study suggest that youth perceived and were impacted by discrimination resulting from anti-immigrant rhetoric that was present during the 2016 presidential election. © 2020, Western Michigan University.

AB  - As of August 12, 2020, there are over 20 million confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide with over 744,000 deaths.1 Due to existing disparities in health outcomes, the consequences of this pandemic for LGBTQ+ individuals could be magnified in scope and severity.2 Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly those who inhabit multiple minority identities (that is, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants), are already at greater risk for suicide, HIV, and unemployment, and commonly face systematic, institutional discrimination in the form of criminalization and other human rights violations.3 Vulnerable subgroups, such as unstably housed or informally employed LGBTQ+ individuals, may struggle to practice social distancing and prescribed sanitation measures. The recommen-dations presented here are data-driven and informed by a cross-sectional survey implemented by the free gay social networking app, Hornet, from April 16 to May 4, 2020. Hornet has over 25 million global users, and over 4,000 users from more than 150 countries completed this survey.4 The most responses were from Brazil, France, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia, and Mexico; the largest number of MSM responses were from Brazil, France, Mexico, Taiwan, and Russia. © 2020, Harvard School of Public Health.

AB  - In the Northern Caucasus, political elites traditionally play a key role in managing political processes, prevent and resolve conflicts, counter sociocultural threats, terrorism, and political extremism. The stability of the political system depends on the degree of political elites’ responsibility and their ability to negotiate with the federal political and administrative elite and to relay the interests of society. New threats to the normal functioning of state authorities are currently emerging, indicating the inefficiency of Russia’s policy aimed at preventing information security threats. In recent years, active social strata (mainly young people) have been mobilized with the aim of overthrowing legitimate authori ti es and obj ecti onabl e pol i ti ci ans, changing regimes, etc., using modern network technologies, disinformation and fake news. Due to its historical and socio-cultural characteristics, as well as poly-confessional structure, the population of the Northern Caucasus is highly sensitive to territorial issues, as well as issues of religion, culture, ethnic relations, etc. In many respects, information technologies determine the position and power of high-status actors, primarily political elites, within the political system. © 2020, CA and C Press AB.

AB  - Objective: Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder and characterized by dysmorphic features, intellectual disability and frequent developmental abnormalities. Though the syndrome is a lifetime health issue for society, the awareness of our community on the syndrome is not sufficient. Methods: This study is planned to define the level of awareness of our population on simple Down syndrome facts. A questionnaire consisting sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and Down syndrome facts was applied to 283 randomly selected participants. Results: The majority of the participants (89.8%) have heard of Down syndrome and 70% of the participants were aware that Down syndrome can be diagnosed during pregnancy. Even though less than half of them (42.4%) was clued in frequent association of congenital malformations with the syndrome, more participants (55.1%) knew that the advanced maternal age was a risk factor. There were statisticially significant differences between different sociodemographic groups on awareness of particular subjects. Conclusion: Even though the certain demographics were well informed about the syndrome, there are still excessive amount of prejudice against Trisomy 21 patients; and therefore, more social projects are needed to raise the awareness. © Copyright 2021 by Gazi University Medical Faculty

AB  - Background: Combination prevention, which includes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is essential for achieving the zero HIV infections target in the UK by 2030. It is important to assess attitudes towards PrEP in at-risk populations. This study focuses on the effect of discrimination and HIV conspiracy theorising on attitudes towards PrEP in gay men in the UK. Methods: In total, 244 White British gay men completed a survey that included demographic questions and measures of sexual health screening, hypervigilance, sexual orientation discrimination, quality of contact with healthcare professionals, belief in conspiracy theories and attitudes towards PrEP. Data were analysed using multiple linear regression and mediation analysis. Results: Discrimination was positively correlated with HIV conspiracy beliefs and negatively correlated with PrEP acceptance. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the relationship between discrimination and attitudes towards PrEP was explained by HIV conspiracy theorising. Gay men who had attended a sexual health screening (vs never attended) reported higher belief in HIV conspiracy theories. A further mediation analysis showed that reported poor contact with a healthcare professional was associated with an increased belief in HIV conspiracy theories, which was associated with negative attitudes towards PrEP. Both perceived discrimination and poor contact with a healthcare professional were exacerbated by hypervigilance. Conclusions: HIV conspiracy theorising is an important variable in understanding attitudes towards PrEP among gay men. Its roots are in adverse social experiences (e.g. discrimination, poor contact with healthcare professionals) and its consequences may be the rejection of PrEP. HIV prevention and PrEP campaigns must focus on prejudice reduction and on challenging conspiracy beliefs. © 2020 CSIRO.

AB  - This study examined the interrelations among political attitudes and negative stereotypes in U.S. undergraduates. Participants answered questions measuring conservatism, social dominance orientation, Global Belief in a Just World, and religiosity. This research employed two measures of stereotypes: modern sexism and feelings about 15 social groups. It was hypothesized that conservatives would show more evidence of negative stereotypes than liberals would. The study revealed that indeed conservatives show stronger evidence of negative stereotypes, but that liberals also harbor some biases. Importantly, the social groups against whom conservatives and liberals are stereotyped differed greatly. Conservatives showed considerably more negative stereotypes against racial and religious minorities, and particularly against those who do not identify with the cis-gender, heterosexual norm. Thus, the targets of conservatives’ stereotypes were groups that have traditionally been subject to discrimination. Liberals held stronger stereotypes against groups that are more politically powerful, such as Caucasians and Christians. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In their target article, Anne Charity Hudley, Christine Mallinson, and Mary Bucholtz (2020) have challenged linguists to constructively engage with race and racism. They suggest three core principles for inclusion and equity in linguistics: (i) ‘social impact’ as a core criterion for excel-lence; (ii) the acknowledgment of our field’s ‘origins as a tool of colonialism and conquest’; and (iii) the elimination of the ‘race gap’ that ‘diminishes the entire field … by excluding scholars and students of color’. Here I amplify Charity Hudley et al.’s challenges through some of my own critiques of Creole studies. These critiques serve to further analyze institutional whiteness as, in their terms, ‘a structuring force in academia, informing the development of theories, methods, and models in ways that reproduce racism and white supremacy’. The latter is exceptionally overt in the prejudicial misrepresentations (a.k.a. ‘Creole exceptionalism’) that we linguists have created and transmitted, since the colonial era, about Creole languages and their speakers. One such mis-representation, whose popularity trumps its dubious historical and empirical foundations, starts with the postulation that Creole languages as a class contrast with so-called ‘regular’ languages due to allegedly ‘abnormal’ processes of emergence and transmission. In effect, then, Creole studies may well be the most spectacular case of exclusion and marginalization in linguistics. With this in mind, I ask of Charity Hudley et al. a key question that is inspired by legal scholar Derrick Bell’s ‘racial interest-convergence theory’, whereby those in power will actively work in favor of racial justice only when such work also contributes to their self-interest. Given this theory, how can we sustainably implement any agenda, including Charity Hudley et al.’s, that stands to under-mine the ‘structuring power of white supremacy’, including the power to choose whose research gets funded or whose subfield is included in ‘core’ linguistics? Bell’s theory might also bear on my proposed funder principle for the intellectual history of Creole studies. I suggest that it is out of self-interest that the European funders of the colonial enterprise in Africa and the Americas helped create the power-knowledge structuring force that accounts for the genesis and transmission of Creole exceptionalism through centuries—in spite of mounting evidence against it. I end with an optimistic note about what might constitute ‘success’ in linguistics. © 2020, Linguistic Society of America. All rights reserved.

AB  - Why do some upper caste respondents view Dalit socio-economic conditions as a consequence of a lack of effort by Dalits, while others see it as a consequence of systematic discrimination and exclusion of Dalits from opportunities across generations? What explains this variation? This forms the central question I explore in this article. Two commonly held explanations for much of the observed upper caste behaviours towards Dalits also explain the divergent opinions held by upper caste respondents on the reasons for current Dalit socio-economic conditions. Using individual level data from the Politics and Society between Elections survey, I find that a negative bias toward Dalits that arises when upper caste respondents perceive themselves as more hardworking than Dalits and a perception of the relatively favourable treatment of Dalits by government officials significantly explain differences in upper caste opinions. Persistent inequalities reinforced by denying the historical burden borne by Dalits over centuries ultimately renders social change meaningless and democratic deepening a pipe dream. © 2020 Lokniti, Centre For The Study Of Developing Societies.

AB  - Indirect questioning techniques such as the crosswise model aim to control for socially desirable responding in surveys on sensitive personal attributes. Recently, the extended crosswise model has been proposed as an improvement over the original crosswise model. It offers all of the advantages of the original crosswise model while also enabling the detection of systematic response biases. We applied the extended crosswise model to a new sensitive attribute, campus islamophobia, and present the first experimental investigation including an extended crosswise model, and a direct questioning control condition, respectively. In a paper-pencil questionnaire, we surveyed 1,361 German university students using either a direct question or the extended crosswise model. We found that the extended crosswise model provided a good model fit, indicating no systematic response bias and allowing for a pooling of the data of both groups of the extended crosswise model. Moreover, the extended crosswise model yielded significantly higher estimates of campus Islamophobia than a direct question. This result could either indicate that the extended crosswise model was successful in controlling for social desirability, or that response biases such as false positives or careless responding have inflated the estimate, which cannot be decided on the basis of the available data. Our findings highlight the importance of detecting response biases in surveys implementing indirect questioning techniques. © 2020 Meisters et al.

AB  - Scholarship produced by psychologists typically focuses on one area of social identity and oppression per study (e.g., only sexism) with very little intersectional analysis across systemic oppression and privilege. To better understand the intersecting patterns of ally behavior, we examined online confrontation behavior by privileged individuals in response to antigay, antitransgender, and racist comments. Study 1 explored rates and types of confrontation during encounters with anti-Mexican and antigay comments. Study 2 used an experimental design to assess rates and types of confrontation of anti-Arab and antitransgender comments in the presence of a second confederate who either confronted the prejudice or remained silent. When exposed to anti-Mexican bias, men were initially more likely to speak up than women, whereas women were more likely to respond to antigay comments. In terms of anti-Arab and antitransgender bias, social influence resulted in more direct confrontation for anti-Arab statements and higher rates of confrontation for antitransgender bias. Applying an intersectional lens, patterns of power and privilege reveal gender socialization may impact ally responses to racism and antigay bias. For example, gender socialization and stereotypes equating femininity with gay men may both decrease ally behavior among men and increase confrontation of antigay bias among women. When another potential ally is present, social influence appears to become the most powerful predictor of both whether or not a participant confronts bias and how direct they are with the perpetrator. Intersectional examination of invisible norms for promoting ally confrontation informs development of effective equity and justice interventions. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - The linkage between political right-wing orientation and climate change denial is extensively studied. However, previous research has almost exclusively focused on the mainstream right, which differs from the far right (radical and extreme) in some important domains. Thus, we investigated correlates of climate change denial among supporters of a radical right-wing party (Sweden Democrats, N = 2216), a mainstream right-wing party (the Conservative Party, Moderaterna, N = 634), and a mainstream center-left party (Social Democrats, N = 548) in Sweden. Across the analyses, distrust of public service media (Swedish Television, SVT), socioeconomic right-wing attitudes, and antifeminist attitudes outperformed the effects of anti-immigration attitudes and political distrust in explaining climate change denial, perhaps because of a lesser distinguishing capability of the latter mentioned variables. For example, virtually all Sweden Democrat supporters oppose immigration. Furthermore, the effects of party support, conservative ideologies, and belief in conspiracies were relatively weak, and vanished or substantially weakened in the full models. Our results suggest that socioeconomic attitudes (characteristic for the mainstream right) and exclusionary sociocultural attitudes and institutional distrust (characteristic for the contemporary European radical right) are important predictors of climate change denial, and more important than party support per se. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Sexual violence against women is a major public health issue and a breach of human rights. Although various consequences of sexual violence on health have been described in a large number of scientific publications, very little is known about this topic in Estonia. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of sexual violence and associations between exposure to sexual violence and risky health and sexual behaviours among women in Estonia. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Estonia in 2014. Self-reported data regarding selected indicators of risky health and sexual behaviours were collected from 1670 women, aged 18–44 years, via a self-administered questionnaire. To measure the prevalence of sexual violence, questions from the NorVold Abuse Questionnaire were included. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results: Of the respondents, 22.7% (n = 379) reported being exposed to sexual violence during their lifetime, and over half of these women had had these experiences before the age of 18. Statistically significant associations were found between sexual violence and smoking (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.03–1.70), alcohol consumption (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.18–1.95), illicit drug use (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.70–2.89), sexual intercourse for money or other material reward (AOR 3.51, 95% CI 1.62–7.61), concurrent sexual relationships (AOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.80–3.86), and being diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (AOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09–2.01). Conclusions: In Estonia, sexual violence against women is widespread and is associated with several risky health and sexual behaviours. Efforts should be made, both among the general public and professionals, to raise awareness regarding the prevalence and negative impact of sexual violence. Women who have been exposed to sexual violence are in need of professional medical, legal and psychological help free from prejudice to help them recover from such traumatic events. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Theories of recognition have received increasing attention in studies of children, young people and social care. However, the concept of misrecognition, as the opposite of recognition, is less featured. This article studies the experiences of misrecognition using evidence from the lived experience of underaged unaccompanied asylum-seeking boys in Finland. Drawing from conceptualizations of (mis)recognition and qualitative data created with 18 unaccompanied asylum-seeking boys living in residential care, we firstly look at how the boys articulate their experience of being seen as ‘refugees’. Secondly, we study how they respond to the refugee label. The findings show that the refugee stigma is mainly experienced as misrecognition, which influences the ways the young asylum-seekers strive to construct agentic identities. Four ways of responding to this misrecognition are identified: adopting a diminished identity (resigning), standing up against misrecognition (resisting), acting to prove the prejudice they encounter wrong (conforming), and claiming ordinariness (performing). We argue that the misrecognition experiences of unaccompanied asylum seeking minors offer a valuable lens for deepening our understanding of young people's responses to adverse conditions. Their varying responses to misrecognition provide important insights into how social work and the care system can be more attentive to the experiences of marginalized children and young people. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Radicalization and violent extremism leading to violent protests, repression, and terrorist attacks constitute important issues in our world. Social psychological group processes and intergroup dynamics play a key role in creating resilience against or facilitating the path towards violent extremism. The present body of work brings together and furthers our understanding of these factors by integrating insights from other fields, most centrally political science. In this introductory article, we summarize the state of the literature and suggest a social psychological research agenda for studying radicalization and violent extremism. This agenda (a) focuses on how the radicalization process commences and festers in ordinary people; (b) is ambitious in bringing research into the real world with protesters, the repressed, and groups engaged in conflict; (c) is pragmatic in measuring outcomes of interest; and (d) applies field experimental methodology, among other methodologies. With this perspective, we argue, social psychology is ideally positioned for a new decade of impactful research into radicalization and violent extremism. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The migrant population has increased in recent years and, as a result, so has cultural diversity. Universities are incorporating specific modules addressing cultural diversity. However, the native population has negative attitudes towards immigrants, as they believe that immigrants receive more social benefits and abuse healthcare services. Nurses may have these attitudes too, which may affect the way they treat patients. The objective of this study was to determine nursing students’ attitudes towards the rights of the migrant population. This is a descriptive ex post facto study using a cross-sectional design, with 821 nursing students in Melilla, Ceuta, and Almeria, Spain. An anonymous questionnaire was used for data collection. Students recognize the same rights for both the immigrant and native populations. More than 80% of the sample upholds the right of undocumented immigrants and their families to access publicly funded healthcare. Attitudes were more positive among students with a Berber background and first-year students. Students approved of the right of immigrants and their families to healthcare and education. The students’ negative attitudes towards the social rights of immigrants need to be addressed with intercultural training to reduce their prejudices as future professionals in a multicultural society. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Students perceive bias in learning environments. Curricula targeting implicit bias recognition and management increase student awareness and achieve strategy identification, but fall short of actual skill development to address bias. In light of this gap, the authors developed and evaluated a skills-based elective to recognize and manage implicit bias in the learning environment. METHOD: Nine 1.5-hour sessions were delivered to 15 first-year medical students from 2017 to 2019. An evidence-based conceptual framework and transformative learning theory informed the instructional design; it incorporated active learning exercises. Skills assessment occurred through direct observation of student performances in role-play exercises. Using thematic analysis, the authors conducted a program evaluation based on focus groups with students and data from notes taken by the investigative team. RESULTS: Students engaged with all aspects of instruction, including role-plays. Authors identified 3 themes from the program evaluation: (1) Student engagement can be enhanced, (2) Instruction is empowering, and (3) It (addressing bias in one's own and witnessed encounters) can be done! Analysis additionally highlighted opportunities for improvement and lessons learned. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative course achieved skill development and practice for medical students in implicit bias recognition and management as it pertains to 3 facets of clinical care present at every stage of a health professional's career. These include interpersonal encounters, advocating for patients when bias is perceived in witnessed encounters with peers and supervisors, and addressing comments made by others within the learning environment. Outcomes could inform novel, skills-based curricula across the spectrum of health professions training and practice.

AB  - In this paper, I argue that so called “systematic critiques” of the liberal conception of law in Catherine MacKinnon and Critical Race Theory which have traditionally been seen to reject liberalism should really be understood as subjecting the liberal conception of law as impartial and just to an immanent critique. Critical Race Theory and MacKinnon both seek to unmask the seemingly neutral subject which authorizes law as in reality a hegemonic and oppressive subject. They also employ the tools of liberalism, demanding justice and equal protection under the law. I argue that the apparent contradiction of their demands can be understood by seeing the subject itself as combining these contradictions at the level of the relation between the unconscious and consciousness. The ego strives for rational self-organization while the unconscious contains sedimented socially transmitted prejudice. There is thus room within both for the struggle for freedom and justice espoused by liberalism at the conscious level as well as for the unconscious perpetuation of prejudice and domination. I conclude that MacKinnon’s work and that of CRT show that liberalism must not be abandoned as post-structuralism does, but that liberals is in fact aided by its critics. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Colorism has a deleterious effect on cognition and health impacting populations. Among African Americans, colorism and social stratification based on skin complexion, has profound sociological effects. These social relationships in daily living show the health burden associated with colorism is enormous. Dark-skinned African Americans have lower socioeconomic status, diminished prestige, and are less likely to hold elected offices compared to their lighter skin counterparts. This systematic review critically examines a wider scope of effects colorism has on African American adults, a topic not well understood and underexplored. To what extent does colorism impact the psychosocial, educational, and economic outcomes of African Americans? What is the evidence for the efficacy of colorism research associated with poor health? PRISMA guidelines, which consisted of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram, were used to evaluate research studies. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify and summarize qualitative and quantitative studies. The findings illustrate that African Americans with darker skin are significantly impacted by prejudice solely because of the color of their skin. The multidimensionality of colorism within society for African Americans delineates further damaging impacts on human health. Implications for social and policy changes are discussed. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Despite the common belief that sport is an excellent instrument to promote social inclusion, distal minority stressors, such as homophobic slurs and insulting or degrading comments, are frequently reported in sport contexts. The aim of this contribution was to expand previous knowledge on negative attitudes toward sexual minorities (gay and lesbian people) in sport-related contexts, by examining how staff employed in organizational sport contexts scored on three different dimensions of sexual prejudice toward sexual minority athletes: open rejection (i.e., blatant prejudice), denial of visibility (i.e., negative attitudes toward the coming out), and gendering performance (i.e., gender stereotypes about sport performance and skills). Furthermore, we examined the relationship between traditional norms of masculinity and dimensions of sexual prejudice. The sample consisted of 178 Italian sport directors and coaches who were asked to complete an online survey (70 women and 108 men, mostly aged from 38 to 65 years old). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that participants scored higher on denial of visibility, with respect to open rejection and gendering performance, independently of gender and sport role. The structural equation model showed that endorsing traditional male role norms was significantly associated with open rejection and gendering performance, whereas no significant association was found with denial of visibility. The findings provide further evidence that sexual prejudice is prevalent in sport organizations, supporting the importance of raising awareness among sports personnel about prejudiced beliefs that may lead minority people to experience severe stress-inducing situations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Conflation of sex and gender is implicated in the development of essentialist thinking, which has been linked to the justification of systems of prejudice in modern society. This exploratory study presents findings from a person randomized control trial conducted with 460 students in 8th–10th grade that investigated the extent to which students conflate sex and gender in their writing about genetics. Students were randomly assigned to one of three short readings that either (1) explained the genetics of sex in plants; (2) explained the genetics of sex in humans; or (3) refuted neuro-genetic essentialism, offering instead a social explanation for why women receive fewer PhDs in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering than men. While previous findings from the authors suggest links between the condition students were assigned to and psychological indicators related to essentialist thinking, no work was done to investigate how students’ use of language might implicate cognitive conflation as a possible factor in understanding these results. In this study, student responses to a constructed response writing task given after the reading were analyzed to investigate the use of sex and gender language. Students in all three conditions used both sex and gender language. However, students in the refutational text condition tended to use sex and gender language deliberately in order to explain PhD attainment, while students in the traditional genetics conditions used the terms interchangeably, suggesting subconscious conflation. Students in the genetics of human sex condition were more likely to manifest this conflation than students in the genetics of plant sex condition. Implications for instruction are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to characterize equity and inclusion in acute care surgery (ACS) with a survey to examine the demographics of ACS surgeons, the exclusionary or biased behaviors they witnessed and experienced, and where those behaviors happen. A major initiative of the Equity, Quality, and Inclusion in Trauma Surgery Practice Ad Hoc Task Force of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma was to characterize equity and inclusion in ACS. To do so, a survey was created with the above objectives. METHODS: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods anonymous online survey was sent to all EAST members. Closed-ended questions are reported as percentages with a cutoff of α = 0.05 for significance. Quantitative results were analyzed focusing on mistreatment and bias. RESULTS: Most respondents identified as white, non-Hispanic and male. In the past 12 months, 57.5% of females witnessed or experienced sexual harassment, whereas 48.6% of surgeons of color witnessed or experienced racial/ethnic discrimination. Sexual harassment, racial/ethnic prejudice, or discrimination based on sexual orientation/sex identity was more frequent in the workplace than at academic conferences or in ACS. Females were more likely than males to report unfair treatment due to age, appearance or sex in the workplace and ACS (P ≤ 0.002). Surgeons of color were more likely than white, non-Hispanics to report unfair treatment in the workplace and ACS due to race/ethnicity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first survey of ACS surgeons on equity and inclusion. Perceptions of bias are prevalent. Minorities reported more inequity than their white male counterparts. Behavior in the workplace was worse than at academic conferences or ACS. Ensuring equity and inclusion may help ACS attract and retain the best and brightest without fear of unfair treatment.

AB  - Background: Literature, film and news media reflect and shape social perceptions of dementia which in turn impact on dementia stigma. The aim of this paper is to systematically review papers on the depiction and frames for dementia in literature, film, mass media and social media in order to better understand cultural stigma related to dementia. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was undertaken combining phrases relating to dementia, popular culture and representations, and phrases relating to dementia and stigma. We searched for scientific English language papers which included original analysis on the representation or depiction of dementia in popular culture (i.e. in film and television, literature, news, social media and language). Articles published between 1989–2018 were included. The search was conducted in December 2017 and updated in January 2019. Inductive thematic synthesis was undertaken. Results: A total of 60 articles were included from an initial sample of 37022. Dementia was almost always depicted in conjunction with ageing, and often equated with Alzheimer’s disease. Common frames for dementia were biomedical - dementia involves the deterioration of the brain for which there is no current cure; natural disaster or epidemic - dementia is a force of nature which will overwhelm mankind; and living dead – people with dementia lose their brains, memories, minds and consequently their personhood and human rights. There were examples of more positive depictions of dementia including expressing love and individual agency and experiencing personal growth. Feelings commonly associated with dementia were fear, shame, compassion and guilt, and depictions often resulted in a sense of social distance. Conclusions: Depictions of dementia in popular culture are associated with negative images and feelings, and social distance between people with dementia and those without. These correspond to dementia stigma in the public and as experienced by people with dementia. Further research is needed into the impact of literature, news and social media on dementia stigma and these cultural mediums might be used to reduce stigma. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Co-participation in physical activity may be important for helping families with young children meet physical activity recommendations. Yet, little is known about what families perceive to be the benefits, barriers and facilitators of co-participation. This study explored (i) parents' perceptions about physical activity and possible benefits of family-based co-participation in physical activity, (ii) their perceived facilitators and barriers to co-participation and (iii) their recommendations for improving co-participation within their community. Fifteen parents (14 mothers, 1 father) of 2- to 4-year-old children residing in Western Sydney, Australia, participated in one-on-one interviews between September 2016 and January 2017. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Four main themes and seven sub-themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the interview data. When parents were asked to reflect on their understanding of physical activity, they discussed a range of well-known activities (e.g. active play, active transport) and also reported 'anything but screen time'. The major benefits parents reported about co-participation were spending quality time together, improving children's general health and well-being and the development of physical skills. Social (e.g. social networks, negative stereotypes) and environmental (e.g. home space, neighbourhood design, shading) facilitators and barriers were identified, yet their impact on co-participation often varied depending on the presence (or lack thereof) of other factors in the physical or social environment. Key recommendations suggested by parents included improvements to home outdoor spaces, neighbourhood design and play spaces and community services. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Intergroup relations are fundamentally based on the idea of ‘us’ and ‘them’, and this categorization has driven political loyalties and social ties in India, particularly the relations between Hindus and Muslims. Contemporary nationalist politics have often combined patriotic love for the country along with suspicion of minorities, particularly the Muslims. Given the history of tense relations between the Hindus and Muslims, the role of positive intergroup relations becomes paramount in sustaining peace among the groups. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact hypothesis, this article tests whether having a Muslim friend reduces prejudicial attitude among Hindus. Additionally, the article also tests the notion of education being a harbinger of liberal values and its role in reducing prejudice. The results indicate that having a Muslim friend is significantly correlated with a more positive outlook towards the Muslim community, but education does not reduce prejudice. © 2020 Lokniti, Centre For The Study Of Developing Societies.

AB  - This study models cross-national attitudes towards immigrants in East and Southeast Asia as a signed and weighted bipartite network of countries and evaluative reactions to a variety of political issues, or determinants. This network is then projected into two one-mode networks, one of countries and one of determinants, and community detection methods are applied. The paper aims to fill two deficiencies in the current research on attitudes towards immigrants: 1) the lack of cross-national studies in Asia, a region where migration is growing, and 2) the tendency of researchers to treat determinants as uncorrelated, despite the interdependent nature of evaluative reactions. The results show that the nine countries in the sample are a cohesive clique, showing greater similarities than differences in the determinants of their attitudes. A blockmodeling approach was employed to identify eight determinants in attitudes towards immigrants, namely views on independence and social dependencies, group identities, absolute or relative moral orientation, attitudes towards democracy, science and technology, prejudice and stigma, and two determinants related to religion. However, the findings of this survey yielded some surprising results when compared with the literature review. First, education was not found to be a significant determinants of attitudes towards immigrants, despite its strong and consistent predictive power in European models. Second, prejudice appears to be mediated in part by religion, especially in religious identification and belief in God. Group identity and prejudice also appear to be related, though only weakly. Finally, anxiety appears in clusters related to social norms, suggesting that fears regarding immigrants relates closely to expectations of others’ behavior. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Racial apathy is a socially desirable and contemporary form of white racial prejudice that resonates with color-blind ideologies. Survey researchers assert it indicates whether whites do not care about racial equality. Deviating from prior studies, we investigate racial apathy among black teenagers. Specifically, we examine racial apathy’s prevalence and correlates, and associations with emotional well-being and alcohol use. Analyzing data from the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR, n = 3290), we find one in four black teenagers does not care about racial equality. In terms of correlates, we find daily importance of faith links negatively with racial apathy. Low grades and school difficulties directly predict racial apathy among black teenagers. Living in the West, compared to other regions, associates with larger odds of expressing racial apathy. Finally, black teenagers’ expressions of racial apathy do not predict their emotional well-being or alcohol use. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This essay spans a long and somewhat unconventional arc–from Goethe’s 1795–6 Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship Years to Lena Dunham’s recent television series Girls. On the one hand, it focuses on the question of collectivity and coercion in Goethe’s Ur-Bildungsroman, set initially among itinerant actors, joined and then partly led by a bourgeois scion escaping from his upbringing. Yet the novel differs in important ways from the picaresque. The essay argues, moreover, that Dunham’s Girls, in the plural, with its collective protagonists, is only the latest iteration in a long tradition of female Bildungsromane (from Austen’s 1813 Pride and Prejudice to Louisa May Alcott’s 1868–9 Little Women, the widely-popular 1890s Australian girls’ novels of Ethel Turner and Louisa Mack, and subsequent family books by E. Nesbit, Noel Streatfeild, etc.) featuring a small sibling or friend group in lieu of a single protagonist. These grouped characters, traversing trials and incidents together, or in contrast to one another, enabled a more faceted account of female social models, developmental variables, and struggles for agency. To chronicle one’s own life, on film, as fiction, and as part of a generational plural, is to reground the Bildungsroman itself as a thoroughly self-interrogatory and feminist practice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Muslim Americans constitute one of the United States' most vulnerable minority groups, facing frequent discrimination from both the public and the government. Despite this vulnerability, few studies evaluate interventions for reducing prejudice against Muslim Americans. Building from an insightful literature on the sources of prejudice against Muslim Americans, this paper tests whether attitudes can be improved with information countering misperceptions of the community as particularly foreign, threatening, and disloyal to the United States. The experimental treatment modestly improved attitudes, including among some subgroups predisposed to prejudice against Muslim Americans. However, the treatment struggled to change policy views, and it demonstrated some vulnerability to social desirability bias and priming on terrorism threats. The findings suggest that information campaigns addressing misperceptions can help to reduce prejudice on the margins, but primarily in less politicized contexts. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the frequency of sexual issues during cancer care, the majority of nurses do not bring up the topic with their patients. The purpose of this study is to encourage nurses in oncology and hematology units on how to better participate in the assessment of the well-being of cancer patients as part of their sexual health. Methods: Using an interview guide, we conducted a qualitative study by interviewing twenty nurses working in the Oncology and Hematology Units of four Belgian hospitals. The twenty semi-structured interviews were transcribed, and we performed a content analysis of the data collected. Results: Sexuality is still a taboo topic, sexual dysfunction is undervalued, nurses lack knowledge on the topic which create many barriers to sexual health assessment. Obstacles are intrinsic or extrinsic towards nurses: prejudices, embarrassment, lack of evaluation tools, lack of support, resources, the environment is not always adequate. This is linked to the lack of knowledge of side effects of treatments, the lack of know-how, well-being and reflexivity. The assessment of sexual health is however part of their role. Nurses would like to have tools and better education to address the various shortcoming on how to address sexual health. Conclusion: Nurses must acknowledge the existence of sexual health issues in cancer patients by rectifying their perceptions of sexuality, improving their knowledge and management of care, by addressing the issue of sexual health early enough. © 2020

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative pilot study was to investigate the role of race (and racism) and sense of belonging for Black men in medical school. A single research question guided this exploratory project: How do Black men in medical school describe their experiences? Analyzing interview data from 8 Black male medical school students revealed frequent encounters with racial discrimination and prejudice. Results show that race adversely affected their academic and social experiences and diminished their sense of belonging in medical school. Consequently, they faced difficulty connecting with White peers and faculty, racist stereotypes, and racial microaggressions that stigmatized them as "out of place," unqualified, or unusual. Implications for policy, practice, and minority medical student success are highlighted. © 2020, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - In many educational systems, students from families with low socioeconomic status (SES) often score lower in academic achievement than their high SES peers. Even though this effect is well-documented and research on teachers’ stereotypical beliefs and attitudes is steadily increasing, the studies so far did not specifically focus on students’ SES. In the current study, we explored preservice teachers’ implicit attitudes and their stereotypical and prejudiced beliefs toward low SES students as well as their causal attributions for the low educational success of low SES students. Results showed that teachers had negative implicit attitudes toward low SES students and that they more strongly associated competences and good learning and working habits with high SES students. The correlations highlighted the role that stereotypes play in causal attributions. Participants who more strongly associated low SES with competence and good working and learning behaviors were less likely to endorse internal attributions but were more likely to emphasize external attributions. Hence, when preservice teachers see low SES students as having high ability, they also strongly view the educational system as a source of the disadvantages that low SES students experience in school. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - People are prone to dividing others into the categories of ‘us’ and ‘them’. This can be particularly detrimental to minorities who may experience social exclusion, prejudice, and reduced access to equal opportunities. One method of improving intergroup relations is to create opportunities for contact. Common contact interventions have members of different groups meet and engage in conversation. There are also non-verbal embodied intergroup activities that produce the same effects. Previous work has shown that the pro-social effects of coordination may be linked to whether co-actors are classed as in or out-group members. The current study explored whether imagining walking in synchrony with in- or out-group members changed majority members’ attitudes towards those individuals. Imagining walking in synchrony fostered greater increases in empathy and decreases in negative attitudes only towards minority group members following imagined coordination (not in-groups). Implications and future directions are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how older LGTBQ adults were portrayed in mainstream Canadian newspapers and popular magazines. Our sample included stories that were published in English between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 in three national newspapers, 13 provincial newspapers, one national online news website, and the five most widely-read popular magazines whose readerships included or catered to the mature market. Our content and thematic analyses of our sample of 190 stories resulted in three overarching findings: a) older LGBTQ adults were largely invisible; b) older LGBTQ persons were often depicted as victims of historical and ongoing discrimination and social exclusion; and c) older LGBTQ individuals were frequently portrayed as extraordinary role models and icons who demonstrated resilience and had paved the way for the younger generations. We discuss our findings in light of the extant research and theorizing concerning the role of the media in reflecting, reproducing, and/or challenging dominant social norms and ideologies, including heterosexism, homophobia, and age-based prejudice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There is an achievement gap between students of different ethnic groups. An important alterable contributor to academic achievement is teacher expectations—the beliefs teachers hold about their students’ academic capabilities. Teacher expectations affect students’ academic performance—high expectations are associated with higher academic performance and low expectations are associated with lower academic performance. Using a survey, we collected data from 140 teachers at a teacher conference in March 2017. In addition to demographic questions, the survey had two scales that gathered information about teacher expectations and behaviours. Differential item functioning analyses showed that teachers had higher expectations for Asian Canadian students and lower expectations for Indigenous students compared with European Canadian students. Explanatory item response modeling showed teachers with six or more years of teaching experience, and teachers above 35 years old, had higher expectations for their students. Teachers did not report behaving differently towards different groups of students. Therefore, there appears to be a discrepancy between teacher expectations and their reported behaviours toward students from various ethnic groups. Implications for future research include exploring if reported behaviours can be observed in the classroom. In addition, there may be a need to modify teacher expectations within teacher education programs. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Pipelines are the most important part of oil and gas production and transportation processes. Protective coatings are tremendously important to maintain the pipelines body; it works like our human skin forming the physical and chemical barrier which is always ready and prepared to defend the body from prejudicial materials. Nowadays, the ongoing trend on protective coatings industry is heading to gradual substitution of the coatings containing hazardous materials by eco-friendly ones. The main stream in this context is to develop a new eco-friendly water-based coating for protection of steel pipelines from corrosion. This coating includes blends of acrylic emulsion (AC) with different dosages of polyurethane (PU) polymer (7 %, 15 % and 30 %) using traditional physical blend method. Moreover, the modified acrylic emulsion (AC-PU) was then enriched with novel mixed metal pigment of (CoO.ZnO.Al3O4) based on bauxite ore as natural source of alumina. The used polymers and the prepared pigment were subjected to comprehensive characterization methods to evaluate their chemical structure and morphology. After that, the anticorrosive performance of the formulated coatings containing the modified acrylic emulsions and prepared pigment was investigated in 3.5 % NaCl and 10 % HCl solutions. The results showed that, the coating formulated with acrylic emulsion mixed with 15 % polyurethane in presence of the prepared pigment offered higher corrosion protection compared to the other formulations and the parent polymers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Social media has been integral for the organization and success of right-wing populist movements in the United States and Europe. Within online communities, discussions take place in which ideologies are formulated, iterated upon, and disseminated. One particular forum, hosted on the popular website reddit.com, r/The_Donald, has received media attention for its political influence. Despite the influence of online spaces in populist, far-right movements, relatively little attention has been paid to qualitative content of discussions that take place within such spaces, including r/The_Donald. Guided by a social representations approach, we analyzed how discussions on r/The_Donald represent sociopolitical groups. We focused on discussions of political affiliations, race relations, immigration, and culture. From a dataset of 8,198 posts, we selected 1,292 segments from 883 unique Reddit usernames and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the majority of posts discussed liberals, race relations, and conspiracy theories, and in these posts, liberals and liberal ideas were delegitimized and mocked through their representations. These posts represented conservatives through antinomic contrast and comparison to liberals and liberal policies. The meanings of those representations in intergroup relations are discussed. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Belief in genetic determinism (BGD) has been associated with increased social stereotyping and prejudicial views and consequently is of significant concern to science educators. The Public Understanding and Attitudes towards Genetics and Genomics (PUGGS) instrument was developed to measure relationships among BGD, genetics knowledge, and demographic variables. PUGGS validity evidence has relied primarily on Classical Test Theory frameworks and Brazilian samples. Using a more advanced psychometric framework (Rasch analysis) and a large North American undergraduate sample (n > 800), we further evaluate validity claims by studying (1) dimensionality and function of PUGGS item sets; (2) magnitudes of item endorsement across human traits (social, biological) and taxonomic (animal, plant) categories; and (3) degree of trait-level genetic overattribution. Similar to Gericke et al. (Sci Educ 26:1223–1259, 2017), we identified a two-dimensional structure for the BGD scale (i.e., social, biological) and the genetics knowledge scale (i.e., gene-environment interactions [GEI], genetics and genomics knowledge [GGK]). However, there were several problems with the functioning of the item sets (e.g., low reliability for GEI, problematic rating scale for BGD biological). We report that the magnitudes of GEI and GGK did not differ by taxonomic context. Finally, genetic over- (and under-) attribution was identified for both biological and social traits, indicating that students harbored considerably diverse and frequently non-normative conceptions about genetic contributions to traits. Importantly, psychometric and theoretical concerns reported here raise questions about the operationalization of the PUGGS BGD construct. Recommendations for PUGGS revisions and educational implications are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper describes an innovative just-in-time health humanities programme to educate and provide support to COVID-19 frontline doctors-in-training. The programme incorporates small-group screening of the Netflix documentary, The Next Pandemic from the Explained series, followed by a one-hour facilitated discussion to explore themes surrounding the current pandemic and its impact on frontline doctors in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Singapore. Themes derived from the film included preparedness, blame, and the impact on healthcare workers and public, which were further discussed to include concerns regarding current local readiness levels given global connectivity, the need for international cooperation, and the effects of blame such as racism and prejudice. The association with culture; the current impact on healthcare workers, physician-patient relationships, and the public including the role of social media, the government and associated public reactions were also explored. These rich discussions demonstrate the pivotal role health humanities has in times of uncertainty such as an emerging infectious disease outbreak by providing timely pandemic education and supporting reflective learning. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a serious social and public health problem. Social stigma and prejudice reduce the accessibility of mental health care services for high-risk groups, resulting in them not receiving interventions and committing suicide. A suicide prediction model is necessary to identify high-risk groups in the general population. Methods: We used national medical check-up data from 2009 to 2015 in Korea. The latest medical check-up data for each subject was set as an index point. Analysis was undertaken for an overall follow-up period (index point to the final tracking period) as well as for a one-year follow-up period. The training set was cross-validated fivefold. The predictive model was trained using a random forest algorithm, and its performance was measured using a separate test set not included in the training. Results: The analysis covered 372,813 individuals, with an average (SD) overall follow-up duration of 1.52 (1.52) years. When we predicted suicide during the overall follow-up period, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.849, sensitivity was 0.817, and specificity was 0.754. The performance of the predicted suicide risk model for one year from the index point was AUC 0.818, sensitivity 0.788, and specificity 0.657. Conclusions: This is probably the first suicide predictive model using machine learning based on medical check-up data from the general population. It could be used to screen high-risk suicidal groups from the population through routine medical check-ups. Future studies may test preventive interventions such as exercise and alcohol in these high-risk groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Amidst growing societal tensions, social media platforms become hubs of heated intergroup exchanges. According to social identity theory, group membership and the value we assign to it drive the expression of intergroup bias. Within the blooming scholarship on social and political polarization online, little attention has been paid to interreligious deliberations, despite the well-established relationship between religion and intergroup grievances. The present studies are designed to address the void in the scholarship of social identity and online religion by examining how religious identities, or the lack thereof, affect intergroup biases in the form of identity-specific topic preferences and topic-sentiment polarization. Drawing from social identity theory, five hypotheses were tested. The data for the study, a product of a natural experiment, are YouTube commentary sections featuring videos on two cases of interreligious debates between (1) Christian and Muslim or (2) Christian and atheist speakers. Using topic-sentiment analysis, a multistage method of topic modeling with latent semantic analysis and sentiment analysis, 24,179 comments, for the Christian–Muslim debates, and 52,607 comments, for the Christian–atheist debates, were analyzed. The results demonstrate normative content and identity-specific instances of topic-sentiment polarization. In terms of content, Christian–Muslim and Christian–atheist discussions are nearly completely preoccupied with theological or intellectual concepts. While interreligious polarization is robust in both debates, it appears more normative among Christians–Muslims and deeper among Christians–atheists, possibly indicating the higher stakes in the battle for moral authority. Interreligious debates on YouTube serve to uplift and defend the in-group and to delegitimize the outgroup in a broader battle for moral authority. Regardless of group affiliation, these debaters were concerned with ‘big picture’ questions of meaning and how best to address them. Stereotyping and cultural altercations appear mostly as a reaction to challenged identity characteristics, suggesting that issue-based social differences and cultural incompatibilities, often emphasized in self-report research, may be evoked as rationalizations of interreligious prejudice. Last, the successful application of topic-sentiment analysis lends support for the more systematic utilization of this method. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - As work increasingly transcends organizational boundaries, employee psychological empowerment benefits from resources provided by others outside of the employee's own team, department, or organization. These intergroup collaborations, however, may be inhibited by social identity and social categorization processes, so that the empowerment potential of these relations remains largely untapped. In this study (N = 213), we demonstrate that intergroup leadership is linked to employee psychological empowerment via intergroup relational identification and access to resources. In this way, this study demonstrates the empowering potential of intergroup leadership and intergroup relational identification for employees who collaborate across group barriers. We finish this paper by discussing the main implications for both empowerment and intergroup leadership theory, suggesting fruitful avenues for future research and highlighting the practical value for those who are motivated to increase psychological empowerment among boundary-spanning employees. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - We aimed to assess associations between parental social media comparison (PSMC)—the degree to which individuals compare their parenting with others on social media (SM)—and depressive symptoms. In March 2018 we conducted a survey of 528 parents ages 18-30 with children under the age of 18. Participants were asked about SM use, PSMC, and depressive symptoms. PSMC was measured with 7 Likert-type items that asked participants the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements such as “Based on their posts, other parents on social media appear to provide a better social life for their children than I do.” Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Multivariable ordered logistic regression models were used to assess the association between PSMC and depressive symptoms while controlling for SM use, parent adverse childhood experiences, parent age, gender, race/ethnicity, relationship status, employment status and household income, age of oldest child, and number of children. The PSMC was internally consistent (α = 0.94). In multivariable models, after adjusting for all covariates, there was 51% greater odds of elevated depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.33, 1.71]) for every one-point increase on the PSMC scale. In conclusion, the PSMC is independently associated with elevated depressive symptoms among parents. Future research should assess directionality of these associations and further explore parents’ experiences of comparison with others on SM. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the loss of a spouse everyday commensal routines can be disrupted or discontinued. This may challenge both the rhythm and organization of daily life, and it can be the first step of many impacting negatively on the widow's, or widower's, health status. Entering new commensal circles could offer a remedy here, helping widow(er)s to forge new social relationships through the sharing of meals. In this paper, we explore how old widows and widowers deal with the disruption of their commensal routines, and how they perceive community-based social meal arrangements for older adults. Qualitative interviews with 31 widow(er)s with different educational backgrounds confirm that many widow(er)s see eating alone as problematic, yet the majority prefer not to attend community-based meals. Reasons given for this often mention the other attendees. Widow(er)s describe the “segment” of people they take to be attending community-based meals as “old” in purely negative and stereotypical ways. We found, however, that when the community-based meal was based on a theme – a “shared third” – it was perceived more positively: the widow(er)s were then able to distance themselves from the negative stereotypes of old age and create a positive self-identity in which they were living up to societal norms of successful, active aging. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background Prejudice and stigma against patients with depression may lead to adverse clinical consequences, such as delayed initiation and premature termination of therapy. However, available survey results on pharmacists’ awareness showed a lack of confidence in dealing with patients with depression. Until recently, few studies addressed the relationship between pharmacists’ perceptions of their social distance from and confidence in interacting with patients with depression. Objectives To determine pharmacists’ social distance from patients with depression, and investigate the factors that influence and are influenced by it. Methods The target population of this survey study included 161 pharmacists employed at a drug chain who had participated in the Effects of Community Pharmacists’ Medication Assistance for the Patients Taking Antidepressant study. The questionnaire included six questions on social distance, which were adopted from a previous nation-wide survey of mental illness stigma in Japan. Other questions related to the respondents’ attributes, personal experience (living with depression, abusive behaviors inflicted by patients with depression), and confidence in interacting with patients with depression. Results Valid responses were obtained from 77 study participants. The mean total social distance score was 12.49. Greater total social distance scores were associated with greater difficulty in relationship building, information provision, and comprehension of condition. Pharmacists’ personal experience of living with depression decreased their social distance from patients with depression, whereas their experience of being verbally or physically abused by patients with depression increased their social distance. Conclusion This study showed that community pharmacists in Japan had less social distance from patients with depression than the general population. A significant negative correlation was observed between community pharmacists’ social distance from and their confidence in interacting with patients with depression. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Discrimination is nowadays more frequently perceived, whilst not always readily identifiable. This study extends previous research on perceived discrimination by examining, simultaneously, the effects of both direct and indirect personal experiences of discrimination, together with sociodemographic variables (conservatism and social status), on the perception of group-based discriminations; in addition to the mediating role of discriminatory outgroup attitudes. All of this comparing discriminations that are not understood as equally tolerable (race–nationality vs. age–disability discriminations), in two different nationwide surveys (2013 and 2016), and applying multigroup structural equation modelling. The final models showed different patterns, depending on the type of perceived discrimination. Whilst the effects of experiences were similar in both models, those as a result of sociodemographic variables differed, coupled with the interrelation between outgroup attitudes and perceived group-based discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes showed to be what most affected both types of perceived discrimination, although in opposite directions. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - HIV stigma has a profound impact on clinical outcomes and undermines the quality of life of people living with HIV (PLWH). Among HIV-negative individuals, misinformation and prejudicial attitudes about HIV can fuel stigma and contribute to discrimination against PLWH. Antenatal care (ANC), with its focus on universal HIV testing, provides a unique entry point to address HIV stigma. This study describes the development of a counseling intervention to address HIV stigma among women and their partners attending a first ANC appointment in Tanzania. Formative work to inform the intervention consisted of qualitative interviews with 32 pregnant and postpartum women (both women living with HIV and HIV-negative women) and 20 healthcare workers. Data were analyzed iteratively, using a thematic analysis approach, to identify intervention targets. The resulting intervention, Maisha (Swahili for “Life”), includes three sessions informed by the HIV Stigma Framework and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: a video and brief counseling session prior to HIV testing and, for those who test seropositive for HIV, two additional sessions building on the video content. A pilot test of the intervention is in process. Addressing HIV stigma at the first ANC visit can help individuals living with HIV to overcome stigma-related barriers to the initiation and maintenance of HIV care, and can reduce stigmatizing attitudes among those who test negative for HIV. © 2020

AB  - This paper applies the Minority Stress framework to data collected from an ongoing community-based participatory research project with health and social service agencies in Southeast Michigan. We examine the stressors and coping strategies employed by undocumented Latinx immigrants and their families to manage immigration-related stress. We conducted in-depth interviews with 23 immigrant clients at Federally Qualified Health Care Centers (FQHC) in Southeast Michigan and 28 in-depth interviews with staff at two FQHC's and a non-profit agency serving immigrants. Findings suggest that immigrants face heightened anxiety and adverse mental health outcomes because of unique minority identity-related stressors created by a growing anti-immigrant social environment. Chronic stress experienced stems from restrictive immigration policies, anti-immigrant rhetoric in the media and by political leaders, fear of deportation, discriminatory events, concealment, and internalized anti-immigrant sentiment. Though identity can be an important effect modifier in the stress process, social isolation in the immigrant community has heightened the impact of stress and impeded coping strategies. These stressors have resulted in distrust in community resources, uncertainty about future health benefits, delayed medical care, and adverse mental health outcomes. Findings provide a framework for understanding the unique stressors experienced by immigrants and strategies for interventions by social service agencies. © 2020 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - We challenge the common interpretation of targets’ immediate confrontation in reaction to discrimination as self-serving behavior and propose different underlying motivations for this phenomenon. In five online scenario studies (Noverall = 1,447), we demonstrate across different samples and contexts that targets indicate a distinct pursuit of the following self-reported confrontation goals: individual-benefit (e.g., perpetrator apologizes); group-benefit (e.g., prejudice reduction); and distancing (e.g., demonstrating that one is different from typical group members). Furthermore, meaningful associations of the pursuits of individual-benefitting goals and group-benefitting goals with group identification, disidentification, and further collective action intentions indicate that they represent different confrontation motivations: Individual-benefitting confrontation serves to cope with the individual mistreatment of discrimination, whereas group-benefitting confrontation represents a form of collective action. Distancing goals were associated with disidentification and—unexpectedly—group identification. Our results show that the phenomenon of confrontation in reaction to discrimination can be the result of different underlying psychological processes. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This study examines ethnic integration in secondary school. Social identity theory suggests that perception of relevant individual attributes plays a crucial role in defining ingroups and outgroups, contributing to befriending, and disliking others. Therefore, we analyze the role of peer-perceived ethnicity in social ties. Networks of friendship, dislike, and perceived ethnicity were modeled together using dynamic stochastic actor-oriented models, separating the effect of perceived ethnicity on social ties from that of social ties on perceived ethnicity. Data came from a Hungarian sample of 12 school classes with one minority group: the Roma. Treating friendship and dislike as mutually exclusive and comparing them to neutral relations, we found evidence for the role of perceived ethnicity in dislike—majority students disliked those they perceived as minority peers. However, we saw no direct effect of ethnicity on the friendship network. Implications of the joint modeling of mutually exclusive relationship aspects are discussed. © American Sociological Association 2020.

AB  - The community health delivery system (CHDS) are vital agencies to the success of integration and the provision of services to improve the health and well-being of justice-involved women. Many agencies face barriers and challenges in providing services to vulnerable populations, such as justice-involved women, and, as a result, often offer individual rather than coordinator care. Thus, it is necessary to explore CHDS systemic barriers and challenges to identify opportunities for coordinated care. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 CHDS directors or designees to identify systemic barriers and challenges, organizational processes, experiences with vulnerable populations, services and programs, and care coordination and perceived women’s barriers and challenges to the provision of services including decision-making processes and access. Qualitative analyses were used to construct thematic descriptions in five areas: (1) mental health as an unmet need, (2) financial constraints, (3) limited organizational capacity, (4) implicit bias, and (5) minimal cultural support of vulnerable populations. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper investigates the effectiveness of a small experimental pilot addressed to foreign adolescents with low language skills and high dropout risk in lower secondary school in Turin, North-West Italy. The intervention aims at reducing Early School Leaving while supporting standard school curricula. In order to facilitate students’ re-motivation and their attachment to the school environment, the pilot proposes an original VET approach that alternates standard school activities to innovative vocational training. In particular, treated students substitute 290 h VET courses for 10 standard school weeks along a scholastic year. First of all, the analysis aims at evaluating effects on Early School Leaving. Then, since the pilot requires a long period in VET away from school, the study evaluates effects on educational outcomes. Oltre I Muri is a very small pilot experiment, involving seven schools and offering 11 VET positions to migrant students. We investigated the effectiveness of the program by an experimental counterfactual approach: participants have been randomly assigned to a treated and a control group with similar characteristics. They are adolescent migrants attending the 2nd year of lower secondary school and manifesting very high drop-out risk. Treated students attend the alternating VET/school pilot, while control students attend standard school classes. Randomization inference allows assessing average treatment effects, but the very small sample size does not guarantee statistical significance at standard levels. Results anyhow suggests some effectiveness of the project in contrasting Early School Leaving. In particular, while some non-treated students dropped out from school during the pilot, all treated students regularly completed their scholastic year. This can be interpreted as a 20% increase in school attendance, with an 80% confidence level assessed by Montecarlo randomization. Finally, extreme value bound techniques applied to test scores suggest that treated students do not prejudice their learning by attending VET instead of standard school classes during the pilot. On the contrary, their school attachment is reinforced. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background and objectives: Misperception of other people's intention and emotions could cause and worsen interpersonal problems, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing depression and anxiety disorders among individuals who are already at risk for those conditions. Although multisensory emotional information is ubiquitous in the real world, most previous research focused exclusively on processing facial expressions. Addressing this gap, the current study examined the association between behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivity and audio-visual emotional information processing. Sensitive BIS suggests heightened sensitivity to anxiety provoking stimuli and is a known risk factor for developing emotional disorders. We hypothesized that higher BIS levels would be associated with inefficient multisensory emotional processing, which might be pronounced for neutral stimuli. Methods: Seventy-six undergraduates (40 women) completed a task while target faces (disgusted, happy, and neutral) were rendered invisible, and a voice (disgusted, happy, and neutral) or no voice was presented simultaneously. Participants' reaction times to indicate the location of the interocularly suppressed faces were measured. Results: Individuals with lower BIS levels detected neutral faces faster when accompanied by neutral voices than by no voice; individuals with higher BIS levels, however, did not benefit from congruent auditory information when processing neutral faces. Limitations: The current study cannot address whether the finding is due to attentional biases, interpretation biases, or both in individuals who are prone to become anxious. Conclusion: Multisensory processing of neutral information is modulated by individuals' propensity to become anxious. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prior research in Europe and North America demonstrates that religious discrimination against Muslim people, commonly known as Islamophobia, results in many negative mental health impacts, including depression, anxiety, isolation, and feelings of exclusion (Awan & Zempi, 2015). In Canada, Muslim women face a unique form of discrimination based on their religious, racial, and gender identities (Helly, 2012; Zine, 2008). Grounded in feminist intersectional theory and practice (Hill Collins & Bilge, 2016), the present manuscript emerges from a community-based project centered on Muslim women’s experiences of discrimination and resulting adverse mental health impacts. Through a series of five focus groups (N = 55), the research team engaged with Muslim women from diverse backgrounds in order to gain a more complete understanding of mental health inequities in Canada. Thematic analyses of focus group data revealed that Muslim women participants regularly experience Islamophobic discrimination and face multiple barriers when attempting to access culturally relevant and responsive supports. Results illuminate the potential of reciprocal, community-based research to investigate and respond to mental health disparities experienced by Muslim women in Canada. © 2020 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - Purpose: Dimensions of HIV Stigma perceptions have not been examined in medical providers in the southern U.S. This study examined the prediction of HIV knowledge on multiple dimensions of stigma beliefs. Methods: We assessed clinical staff (N = 153) in rural clinics (2017) HIV stigma beliefs and knowledge. Using multiple regression, we examined the ability of knowledge to predict stigma beliefs organized into meaningful dimensions. Results: There was high variability in HIV knowledge among the medical professionals surveyed with a score of 70/100 (i.e., a ‘C’). Of the five stigma factors explored, only two had a score greater than 80 (ie., a ‘B’ score on the ‘test’). Controlling for demographic factors, there was a significant effect of HIV Knowledge on Discrimination (F (4,146) = 2.02, p = 0.03), Prejudice (F (4,146) = 2.13, p = 0.04), Service Provision (F (4,145) = 2.30. p = 0.02), and Perceived Risk in Practice (F (4,91) = 5.75, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The relatively low knowledge score and link between knowledge and stigma beliefs indicated a need for continued basic HIV education. Increased education around HIV risk is critical in the eradication of HIV given the link between high stereotyping beliefs and low testing rate. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Background: Perception of psoriasis in the general population is characterized by knowledge deficits and prejudice against those affected. The extent and possible predictors of stigmatizing attitudes remain unclear. Objectives: The aim was to assess prejudices and stigmatization of people with psoriasis and to identify sociodemographic and attitude-related variables accounting for stigmatization. Methods: Representative telephone surveys of 2004 (in 2017) and 2001 (in 2018) adults using a standardized questionnaire. Descriptive analyses were applied to living area, age, gender, educational status, general knowledge and attitudes about psoriasis. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine which variables are associated with the assessment of prejudices of ‘others’ against people with psoriasis. Those prejudices were specified by the following statements: ‘they should take better care of themselves’, ‘don’t want to touch people with psoriasis’ and ‘disgusted by psoriasis’. Results: The majority of those surveyed (74%) believe that people with psoriasis are disadvantaged. Similarly, a majority (69%) said that most people find psoriasis disgusting, do not want to touch people with psoriasis (59%) and think that people with psoriasis need to take better care of themselves (45%). ‘Willing to enter a relationship with an affected person’ (OR = 0.330, P = 0.029), higher age (OR = 1.027, P <0.001) and male gender (OR = 1.263, P = 0.034) proved to be significantly associated with ‘psoriasis is disgusting’. Education (OR = 1.648, P = 0.016) and lower age (OR = 0.847, P <0.001) are significantly associated with ‘they need to take better care of themselves’. Conclusions: Data suggest that stigmatization of skin diseases is still entrenched. This overview shows the need for interventions against stigmatization of those affected. Results imply that gender, age and education level and related health literacy of the target groups of respective interventions should be taken into account. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To analyze and compare how performance of the health system are linked to the self-reported quality of life (QOL) of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in 22 countries participating in the International Spinal Cord (InSCI) community survey. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Twenty-two countries representing all 6 World Health Organization regions, community setting. Participants: Persons (N=12,591) with traumatic or nontraumatic SCI aged ≥18 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main outcomes: Self-reported satisfaction on several indicators that include: health, ability to perform daily activities, oneself, personal relationships, and living conditions. A total score of QOL was calculated using these 5 definitions. Results: The most important indicators for self-reported QOL of persons with SCI were social attitudes and access to health care services, followed by nursing care, access to public spaces, the provision of vocational rehabilitation, transportation, medication, and assistive devices. In general, persons with SCI living in higher-income countries reported a higher QOL than people in lower-income countries, with some exceptions. The top performing country was The Netherlands with an estimated median QOL of 66% (on a 0%-100% scale). Conclusions: The living situation of people with SCI is highly influenced by the performance of the health system. Measuring and comparing health systems give accountability to a country's citizens, but it also helps to determine areas for improvement. © 2020 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB  - Prejudices against the unemployed pose an enormous threat to their self-confidence and can make it difficult for them to re-enter the labour market, resulting in further long-term unemployment. Given these high costs for the unemployed and for society as a whole, our knowledge of prejudices against the unemployed is surprisingly scarce. We focus on the question of what determines the strength of prejudice among employees. By applying social identity theory, we assume that people who are disadvantaged in the labour market in general, also hold stronger prejudices. In addition, we assume that social status mediates this association and that self-efficacy moderates it. We use data from the German panel study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS) and show that some groups of people who are themselves disadvantaged in the labour market (women and first-generation immigrants) have more prejudices against the unemployed; however, people with poor mental health have even fewer prejudices. Low social status (in terms of educational background, income, and job status) is associated with strong prejudices; however, social status does work as mediator to a minor degree only. People with low self-efficacy in general (main “effect”) and first-generation immigrants in particular (moderating “effect”) have stronger prejudices. These results can be a starting point for developing measures to reduce prejudice and for the onset of a debate about the origins of prejudices against the unemployed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the United States more than 8 million adults currently are covered by the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, with enrollment projected to increase in the coming decades. This qualitative study explores views on work disability in the United States, and specifically on the SSDI program, among the general public. Six focus groups with a convenience sample of nonbeneficiary adults (N = 41) were conducted in Los Angeles. We found that in spite of low levels of familiarity with the program, suspicion and prejudice against people claiming disability benefits and against the program itself were widespread among our participants. Specifically, participants argued that (a) there is a high prevalence of “scammer” disability applicants, and (b) the program fails to adequately safeguard against nondisabled claimants. Moreover, they viewed disability benefits as a symbolic admission of weakness, contrary to the U.S. ethos of hard work and against “government handouts,” and expressed a preference for claiming disability benefits as a last resort if they were ever to develop a disabling condition. Exploring public perceptions of disability and disability benefit programs helps us shed light on current cultural narratives around these topical issues. Future research could examine the impact of stigma of beneficiary status on beneficiaries’ wellbeing. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2020.

AB  - Research in the social cure tradition shows that groups can reduce members' stress by providing support to cope with challenges, but it has yet to consider how this applies to the anxiety occasioned by outgroups. Research on intergroup contact has extensively examined how reducing intergroup anxiety improves attitudes towards outgroups, but it has yet to examine the role of intragroup support processes in facilitating this. The present article takes the case of residential contact, in which the impact of diversification upon neighborhood cohesion is hotly debated, but the role of neighborhood identification and social support from neighbors in facilitating residential mixing has been largely ignored. Our surveys of two geographically bounded communities in England (n = 310; n = 94) and one in Northern Ireland (n = 206) show that neighborhood identification predicts both well-being and more positive feelings towards outgroups, with both effects occurring via increased intragroup support. In studies 2 and 3, we show that this positive effect on feelings towards the outgroup occurs independently of that of intergroup contact and is further explained by the effect of neighborhood support in reducing intergroup anxiety. This suggests that social cure processes can improve intergroup attitudes by supporting group members to deal with the stress of intergroup interactions. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This essay uses the case of the fin-de-siècle Vienna embryologist Samuel Leopold Schenk to analyze the factors at play in allegations of misconduct. In 1898, Schenk published a book titled Theorie Schenk. Einfluss auf das Geschlechtsverhältnis (Schenk’s theory. Influence on the sex ratio). The book argued that, by changing their diet, women trying to conceive could influence egg maturation and consequently select the sex of their offspring. This cross between a scientific monograph and a popular advice book received enormous publicity but also spurred first the Vienna Medical Association and then the Senate of the University of Vienna to accuse Schenk of poor science, self-advertisement, quack medical practice, and wrong publisher choice. Formal proceedings against Schenk ended in 1900 with the unusually harsh punishment of early retirement. Schenk died two years later. I examine the elements of the case, from the science of sex determination and selection, to the growth of print media and advertising within the changing demographic and political landscape of Vienna. I argue that the influence of the public, via the growing media, upon science was the main driver of the case against Schenk, but also that the case would have had a more limited impact were it not for the volatile political moment rife with anti-Semitism, nationalism, and xenophobia. I draw the attention to the importance of setting cases of misconduct in the broader political history and against the key social concerns of the moment. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This article explores the gender and sexual diversity perceptions of teachers in a support unit at a South African school. The School Based Support team (SBST) is a formal structure that consist of selected teachers who are responsible for creating enabling, inclusive and safe learning environments for all students who experience barriers to learning. South African literature shows that school youth who do not conform to heteronormative expressions are subjected to homophobic violence, discrimination and excluded from academic activities. Through purposive sample individual interviews were conducted with ten SBST members, the three themes generated illustrate that teachers in the SBST continue to ‘other’ learners with non-heterosexual expressions and fail to uphold a social cohesive learning environment. The first theme found that the SBST members do not perceive learners with diverse sexual orientations in need of care and support. The second theme shows that the support structure is nonresponsive in the event of discrimination and prejudice faced by learners with diverse sexual orientations. Then the third theme discovered that some educators within the school are perpetrators of homophobia and violence. These results call for a comprehensive in-service teacher training on aspects of sexual diversity. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background and Aims: Our ability to combat the opioid epidemic depends, in part, on dismantling the stigma that surrounds drug use. However, this epidemic has been unique and, to date, we have not understood the nature of public prejudices associated with it. Here, we examine the nature and magnitude of public stigma toward prescription opioid use disorder (OUD) using the only nationally representative data available on this topic. Design: General Social Survey (GSS), a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of public attitudes. Setting: United States, 2018. Participants/Cases: A total of 1169 US residents recruited using a probability sample. Measurements: Respondents completed a vignette-based survey experiment to assess public stigma toward people who develop OUD following prescription of opioid analgesics. This condition is compared with depression, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and subclinical distress using multivariable logistic or linear regression. Findings: Adjusting for covariates (e.g. race, age, gender), US residents were significantly more likely to label symptoms of OUD a physical illness [73%, confidence interval (CI) = 66–80%; P < 0.001] relative to all other conditions, and less likely to label OUD a mental illness (40%, CI = 32–48%; P < 0.001). OUD was significantly less likely to be attributed to bad character (37%, CI = 30–44%; P < 0.001) or poor upbringing (17%, CI = 12–23%; P < 0.001) compared with AUD. Nonetheless, perceptions of competence associated with OUD (e.g. ability to manage money; 41%, CI = 33–49%; P < 0.01) were lower than AUD, depression and subclinical distress. Moreover, willingness to socially exclude people with OUD was very high (e.g. 76% of respondents do not want to work with a person with OUD), paralleling findings on traditional targets of strong stigma (i.e. AUD and schizophrenia). Conclusions: US residents do not typically hold people with prescription opioid use disorder responsible for their addiction, but they express high levels of willingness to subject them to social exclusion. © 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction

AB  - Ideological attitudes supporting group-based dominance (i.e., social dominance orientation, SDO) and in-group authority (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism, RWA) are well-established dual antecedents of prejudice. We extend classic perspectives of prejudice as an attitudinal outcome by testing this dual-antecedent model with prejudice operationalized as inclusive behavioral intentions in a nationally-representative Australian community sample (N = 2,632). An exploratory structural equation model simultaneously derived three domains of behavioral intentions in the data: small, interpersonal gestures (e.g., saying hello to people from other groups), volunteering to help the disadvantaged (e.g., mentoring people from disadvantaged groups), and political action (e.g., organizing a demonstration). There was evidence for a dual-motivational basis of inclusive behavior intentions, with SDO negatively predicting all three categories of behaviors, particularly interpersonal gestures, while RWA showed a small negative relation only with political action. The findings suggest that motivations for group-based dominance are the primary barrier against behavioral intentions toward social inclusion, which can inform the design of public interventions for reducing prejudice and discrimination. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This article integrates the study of intergroup relations and social network cognition, predicting that women who occupy central (vs. peripheral) advice network positions are more likely to confront a coworker’s gender-biased comment. Study 1 offers correlational evidence of the predicted link between perceived advice network centrality and confronting among employed women, uniquely in advice (but not communication) networks. Study 2 replicates and investigates two possible mechanisms—perceptions of the situation as public and perceived risk of confronting. Study 3 rules out order effects and tests an additional mechanism (expectations of the network members). Study 4 is an experiment that shows people expect central (vs. peripheral) women to confront more, even when she is lower (vs. equal) power. Study 5 replicates the core hypothesis in retrospective accounts of women’s responses to real workplace gender bias. Study 6 compares multiple potential mechanisms to provide greater insight into why centrality reliably predicts confrontation. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - The current research examined accuracy and bias in racial metaperceptions—perceptions of others’ attitudes toward one's racial group—within the context of interracial relationships, as well as implications of these metaperceptions for the quality of interracial relationships. Two dyadic studies of interracial relationships involving Black and White participants suggest that racial metaperceptions were partly accurate, related to relationship partners’ racial attitudes. In addition, 3 distinct biases in racial metaperceptions were identified, including assumed reciprocity (i.e., perceivers assuming their attitudes toward their partners’ racial group are reciprocated by those partners), projection (i.e., perceivers assuming their attitudes toward their own group are shared by partners), and confirmation bias (i.e., perceivers viewing partners’ racial attitudes in ways that are consistent with their chronic expectations about being the target of prejudice). In turn, both accurate and biased racial metaperceptions appeared to have implications for the quality of interracial relationships, including relationship satisfaction, perceived regard, relationship commitment, and prosocial behavior. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - The burgeoning literature on skin color stratification highlights how skin color is associated with disparities in outcomes such as socioeconomic status, health, and intergroup relationships among ethnoracial minorities. However, there is a limited body of work that suggests that darker skin color is also associated with differing outcomes among whites in spite of their position as the socially dominant group of the U.S. This study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen to examine how skin color, among whites, relates to their likelihood of dating ethnoracial minorities. The results show that darker skin color is associated with greater odds of dating Latinos and Asians. The results also suggest that there is a non-linear relationship between whites’ skin color and their likelihood of dating blacks. The author argues that because darker skin color connotes lower status due to its affiliation with non-whiteness, darker skin color among whites can lead to greater interactions with ethnoracial minorities. However, there may be an exception when dating blacks. This study highlights a possible underlying mechanism, ethnoracial ambiguity among whites, that shapes current ethnoracial relations, which has long-term implications for the future of intergroup boundaries. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study addresses antecedents and consequences of attitudes towards collaboration in the context of World War II (WWII) in Belgium. A survey conducted on 922 Belgian French- and Dutch-speaking participants shows that, on overall, Dutch-speakers perceive collaboration as more moral and support amnesty of the former collaborators at a higher level than their Francophone counterparts. In addition, we show that these attitudes are predicted by the generational belonging, linguistic and national identification of the participants. Finally, we find that attitudes towards WWII collaboration are linked to specific political prospects for the future of the country only among Dutch-speakers. These findings suggest that, 75 years after its end, the issue of collaboration during WWII still divides the Belgian society. Furthermore, they underline the added value of a multilevel approach in the understanding of social psychological phenomena. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The primary aims of this project were to estimate levels of agreement or opposition with immigrant family separation at the U.S.–Mexico border and to identify psychological variables that account for variability in attitudes toward immigrant family separation. In Study 1, a sample designed to be representative of Americans in the United States responded to a question about the zero-tolerance policy that resulted in immigrant family separation. In Study 2, participants in two convenience samples completed online surveys with measures of perceived threat posed by immigrants, dehumanization, social dominance, political ideology, religiosity, and immigrant family separation. Across samples, the majority of respondents opposed separating immigrant families. Conservative political ideology was a consistent correlate of support for immigrant family separation. Dehumanization of immigrants and social dominance orientation also accounted for unique variability in support for immigrant family separation. Given the potentially harmful effects of extended parent-child separation caused by the zero-tolerance policy, it is important to understand the roles of dehumanization, social dominance, and ideology in attitudes toward immigration policies. Predictors of support for restrictive policies could be targets of individual or community-level interventions designed to reduce immigrant prejudice. Directions for future research and implications for U.S. communities and policies affecting immigrants are discussed. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Patterns of kinship among individuals in different groups have been rarely examined in animals. Two closest living relatives of humans, bonobos and chimpanzees share many characteristics of social systems including male philopatry, whereas one major difference between the two species is the nature of intergroup relationship. Intergroup relationship is basically antagonistic and males sometimes kill individuals of other groups in chimpanzees, whereas it is much more moderate in bonobos and copulations between individuals of different groups are often observed during intergroup encounters. Such behavioural differences may facilitate more frequent between-group male gene flow and greater between-group differentiation in male kinship in bonobos than in chimpanzees. Here we compared differences between average relatedness among males within groups and that among males of neighbouring groups, and between-group male genetic distance between bonobos and chimpanzees. Contrary to expectation, the differences between average relatedness among males within groups and that among males of neighbouring groups were significantly greater in bonobos than in chimpanzees. There were no significant differences in autosomal and Y-chromosomal between-group male genetic distance between the two species. Our results showed that intergroup male kinship is similarly or more differentiated in bonobos than in chimpanzees. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: The intergroup contact variable has been widely studied in the literature, and it has been shown to be closely related to less prejudice. The present article analyzes the role of an affective mediator in the relationship between the degree of contact-rejection of the outgroup (same-sex parents) variables, linked to the variable quality of contact or satisfaction with contact with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Methods: The sample is composed of 401 Spanish university students (67 males, 16.2%, and 347 females, 83.8%) with a mean age of 21 years (SD = 3.20). The data collection took place between November 2016 and March 2017. Results: The results show a complete mediation effect in the case of open or traditional prejudice (individual opposition), and partial mediation when analyzing modern or subtle rejection of same-sex parents (normative opposition). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce the rejection of same-sex parents must take into account the individual’s positive evaluation of the contact because it is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between degree of contact and rejection. Social policy implications: Homophobia intervention programs must consider the intergroup contact variable, taking into account that it is also necessary to act on positive emotions and affectivity toward relationships with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Increasing positive contact with same-sex parents could be a key element in reducing rejection toward the effects of their child-rearing on their children. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the legal recognition of gay men’s right to marry and form families in numerous countries, they remain at risk of mental health impacts from prejudice. This novel experimental study aimed to harness social influence theory to improve heterosexuals’ attitudes towards gay parents. Method: Three hundred and forty-seven community members (Mage = 38.7 years, 52% male) and 249 university students (Mage = 19.9 years, 42% male) volunteered for an online quasi-experiment in mid-2018. Participants were randomly allocated to reading a vignette that contained either a highly supportive group attitude about gay parents, a less supportive group attitude about gay parents or an unrelated filler-task. Results: The study found that (i) exposure to a high-support condition improved individuals’ attitudes towards the social context of gay parents, compared to baseline, within the student sample; (ii) males reported significantly less positive attitudes towards gay parents than females in the community sample; and (iii) religiosity significantly moderated attitudes towards gay parents’ parenting skills among those in the baseline condition and not among those the high-support condition, in both samples. Conclusion: The findings suggest that group attitudes can be harnessed to mitigate the negative relationship between higher religiosity and individual attitudes towards gay parents. The findings are important in the aftermath of divisive debates about legalising same-sex marriage and parenting. The study findings point to the potential for religious groups to share overtly supportive group messages about gay parents, rather than staying silent, in order to prevent the harms of prejudice towards this vulnerable population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Certainly one of the first things that we notice when meeting someone new is how physically attractive that they are. Although the vast majority of studies in the literature suggest favoritism for physically attractive humans, some research indicates that negative biases may occur as well. This discrepancy in the literature may simply indicate the failure of differing experimental methods to adequately tap the same construct; however, it is also a likely indicator of moderating factors at work. This study employs an episodic memory task to demonstrate the moderating effects of self-esteem threat on physical attractiveness attributions. Furthermore, results indicate that attractiveness-based stereotypes are susceptible to fluctuations in self-esteem, such that individuals experiencing a threat to self-esteem become more reliant on stereotyping. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Based on the Dual Process Model (DPM), this study investigates the relationship among the perception of in-group threats, conservative ideologies (social dominance orientation, SDO, and right-wing authoritarianism, RWA), prejudice, and prosocial behavioural intentions (PBI) towards asylum seekers. A sample of 200 people living in Italy answered an anonymous questionnaire administered using a cross-sectional design. The results partially supported the DPM’s expectations while also showing, however, some unexpected effects with respect to behavioural intentions to help asylum seekers. As predicted by the DPM, the perception of in-group threats, whether realistic or symbolic, directly and indirectly (via SDO and RWA) affected prejudice against asylum seekers. SDO and RWA did not have a direct effect on behavioural intentions but their effects were totally mediated by prejudice. This is a novel finding and suggests that conservative ideologies can positively affect people’s behaviour but only through a decreased attitudinal disposition towards asylum seekers. The theoretical and practical implications derived from the data are discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Given the persistence of oppression in contemporary society, social workers may expect to encounter social bias in the clinical setting. On the one hand, clients who identify as a member of a disadvantaged social group may report experiences of oppression accompanied by emotional, behavioral, and physical responses (Carter in Couns Psychol 35(1):13–105, 2007; Sue in Microaggressions and marginality: manifestation, dynamics, and impact, Wiley, Hoboken, 2010). On the other hand, those who are members of a historically privileged social group may present with negative affective and behavioral responses associated with prejudicial ideations towards disadvantaged social groups (Sullaway and Dunbar in Clin Psychol 3(4):296–309, 1996). This paper provides evidence from my field experiences that directly confronting social bias encountered in the clinical setting promotes client wellbeing and social justice with diverse clients. In doing so, I respond to the call for front line practitioners to share their perspectives regarding the integration of social justice and social work (Maschi et al. in J Soc Work Pract 25(2):233–253, 2011). I also elaborate on Howard University School of Social Work’s Black Perspective as a theoretical orientation for clinical social work with diverse populations (Gourdine and Brown in Howard University School of Social Work in the 1970s: social action, advocacy, and agents of change, Black Classic Press, Baltimore, 2016). Because Black perspectives are often marginalized in scholarship and practice, I hope to shed light on their critical role in addressing contemporary clinical issues (Bent-Goodley et al. in J Hum Behav Soc Environ 27(1–2):27–35, 2017; Graham in Soc Work Educ 28(3):268–280, 2009). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Age-gap couples often elicit negative stereotypes and prejudice. According to social exchange and equity theories, we predicted that prejudice towards age-gap couples may stem from perceived relational inequity. We hypothesized that age-gap, as compared to age-matched, couples were perceived as less equitable and, as a result, less liked. To test these hypotheses, people evaluated, and inferred the equity of, age-gap and age-matched relationships. We found that age-gap, as compared to age-matched, couples were more disliked and perceived as less equitable. Within age-gap relationships, older men and women were perceived as reaping greater rewards than their younger partners. Importantly, perceived inequity predicted prejudice towards age-gap, but not age-matched, couples. In exploratory analyses, age-gap couples consistently elicited significantly more prejudice than other types of couples. Implications for age-gap relationships and future research are discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Behavioral immune system (BIS) describes psychological mechanisms that detect cues to infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, trigger disease-relevant responses and facilitate behavioral avoidance/escape. BIS activation elicits a perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) which can result in conformity with social norms. However, a response to superficial cues can result in aversive responses to people that pose no actual threat, leading to an aversion to unfamiliar others, and likelihood of prejudice. Pathogen-neutralizing behaviors, therefore, have implications for social interaction as well as illness behaviors and responses to health communications. In this study, we investigate how PVD influences conformity, attitudes to other people and to lockdown regulations through the lens of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). RST describes personality in terms of biologically-driven approach and avoidance motivations which support personal goals. Participants from the United Kingdom public (N = 605) completed an RST personality questionnaire and then read either (a) coronavirus morbidity-mortality statistics and current United Kingdom government lifestyle regulations, (b) just the regulations (as presented in most government publicity materials), or (c) no information at all. They all completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale to assess BIS-relevant Germ Aversion and Perceived Infectability, followed by questions measuring social conformity, warmth toward others and attitudes toward lockdown measures. Significantly lower PVD scores were observed in the no-information condition, with the other conditions showing no difference. In terms of RST, approach behaviors related to goal-drive persistence work alongside fear in explaining conformity to social norms. Reward related approach behaviors partially explained warmth toward others, indicating that social rewards gained through interaction continue to be strong drivers of behavior. We found no role for RST traits in attitudes toward lockdown. Overall, coronavirus-related behavior is not driven purely by fear, but also by social and/or protection goals regulated by approach motivation. This study presents new insights into public perceptions of coronavirus and government regulated lifestyle restrictions, helping to explain social behaviors in terms of biologically driven mechanisms. Such understanding is vital if we are to successfully motivate public behavior to constrain spread of the virus. © Copyright © 2020 Bacon and Corr.

AB  - Today’s urban schools provide a unique intergroup context in which the students vary not only by race/ethnicity but also by the relative representation of their racial/ethnic groups. In two studies, we examined how this diversity aligns with intersectionality and multiple identities perspectives to affect the power and status associated with each group to shape intergroup dynamics. Study 1 focused on the perception of intergroup bias to investigate how perceived presence of same-race/ethnicity peers affects middle school students’ intersectional intergroup attitudes based on race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. Middle school students (N = 1,107; Mage = 12.10; SD = 0.99) were randomly assigned to view Facebook-like profiles of peers that varied by gender (boy, girl), race/ethnicity (African American, Latinx), and sexual orientation (straight, lesbian, gay) and offered their first impressions as a way to assess various domains of intergroup attitudes. The perceived presence of same-race/ethnicity peers influenced intersectional intergroup attitudes, however, differentially so depending on stereotypes, prejudice, and behavioral tendencies. Study 2 focused on the experience of intergroup bias and simultaneously examined race, gender, and weight discrimination and its consequences among middle school students (N = 4,172; Mage = 13.5; SD = 0.87). Using latent profile analysis, five profiles of youth based on the pattern of perceived discrimination due to gender, race/ethnicity, and weight were identified. Being African American, Latinx, and male with a high body mass index (BMI) and few same-race/ethnicity peers at school predicted membership in a race profile, whereas being White or Asian with high BMI and more same-race/ethnicity peers predicted membership in a weight profile. Perceiving oneself as gender atypical was associated with all discrimination profiles. © Copyright © 2020 Ghavami, Kogachi and Graham.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a chronic systemic pain disorder. Among the common treatments, moxibustion has an irreplaceable therapeutic effect and is an effective Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy for MPS. However, the lack of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has prompted the publication of guidelines on the use of moxibustion in the treatment of MPS. METHODS: The clinical practice guideline will base on the Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization guideline handbook, the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II, Reporting Items for practice, Guideline in Healthcare and recommendations thereof will be made on the basis of systematic reviews. We will establish a guidelines development team that will draft clinical questions in the form of population, intervention, comparison, results and conduct a literature search and quality of evidence assessment. The experts will make recommendations after 2 or 3 rounds of Delphi investigations. We will carefully consider the patient's values and preferences and conduct a peer review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The guidelines will not contain any personal data and will not prejudice individual rights, so no ethical approval will be required. The guidelines will be subject to rigorous peer review and may be published in a journal or circulated at relevant conferences. RESULTS: The guidelines will be published in relevant peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSION: This guideline will make it easier for clinicians to treat MPs in the clinical setting and improve the effectiveness of treatment for MPS. STUDY REGISTRATION: The study is registered with the International Practice Guideline Registry Platform (IPGRP): IPGRP-2020CN030.

AB  - Social factors play a significant role in the health outcomes of those struggling with mental or physical health issues. People with mental illness experience more social stigmatization and receive less concern for their welfare than do those with physical illness. However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which such a bias in attitude arises remain unclear. This functional MRI study examined whether a lack of self-other similarity during mental state attribution affects perceivers’ theory of mind and, subsequently, how they value a patient’s welfare. During scanning, participants were asked to respond to an expression of caring and sympathetic concern from either their own perspective or while adopting the perspective of patients labeled physically ill or mentally ill. Participants reported that physically ill patients would share their affective responses to the situations, but mentally ill patients would not. Furthermore, mentalizing about physically ill patients was associated with increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a critical region for empathic concern and value-based decisions. In contrast, mentalizing about mentally ill patients preferentially engaged the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula, regions previously implicated in empathic distress, in which activity correlated with individual differences in prejudice control. The findings indicate that a lack of perceived self-other similarity poses a challenge to the theory of mind and thus requires greater cognitive resources and neural computations. This might give rise to stereotyped beliefs about and prejudice against the mentally ill and failure to respond with appropriate empathy and care. © Copyright © 2020 Shin, Woo, Jung, Kim, Lee, Decety and Kwon.

AB  - Purpose: In recent times, several instances of anti-immigration-related hate crimes and religious bullying have been reported where South Asian expatriates have been victimized. The accompanying children of such expatriates may find such hostile perceptions very difficult to deal with due to their tender age and sensitive ego, which may also lead to the premature return of the expatriate. In this study, a qualitative investigation is conducted to understand the specific problems faced by South Asian expat kids with respect to religious stigma and anti-immigration sentiments. Design/methodology/approach: A latent thematic analysis was adopted as the research method in this study. Responses were obtained from 27 South Asian adolescent expat kids through audiovisual interviews. Findings: A total of three central themes were identified from the analysis: (1) coping against social stigma, (2) dealing with social isolation and (3) assimilating with host culture. The findings indicated that the expat kids from South Asia were mentally well prepared to cope with bullying related to the religious or political sentiment using several self-reflective orientations and through optimal use of technical resources. Research limitations/implications: This study applies a qualitative exploratory design. Hence, a follow-up study backed by quantifiable data is needed to enhance generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Corporate practitioners may develop dedicated social media page for expat kids or an online community of such individuals as a support system. Originality/value: The paper applies a critical lens on some deep-rooted sociopolitical issues which have not been addressed in extant literature on expat adjustment. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to look at parents' perceptions of a number of different toy prototypes that represented physical impairments and predictors of these perceptions. Design/methodology/approach: A correlational survey design was used. Parents of children aged 4–10 years who identified their child as having a disability (n = 160) and not as having a disability (n = 166) took part. They rated a number of prototypes for likelihood that their child would enjoy playing with them and completed measures of their responses toward children with disabilities and of their own and their child's direct contact with people with disabilities. Findings: It was found that, among parents of children who did not declare that their child had a disability, the more open the parents were toward disability, the more contact the children had with other children with disabilities and the more likely they were to consider that their child would like to play with a toy prototype representing a physical impairment. This pattern of results was not found among parents who identified their child as having a disability, where instead positive friendship intentions of parents mediated this association. Research limitations/implications: These findings have implications for theories informing the positive benefits of disability representation. Practical implications: These findings indicate different paths through which parents might be moved to purchase toys that represent physical impairments for their children. Social implications: These findings suggest that representative toys might be associated with an open dialogue around the topic of disability. Originality/value: This is the first study of the responses of parents to toys that represent physical impairments known to the authors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A universal formula is shown to predict the dynamics of public opinion including eventual sudden and unexpected outbreaks of minority opinions within a generic parameter space of five dimensions. The formula is obtained by combining and extending several components of the Galam model of opinion dynamics, otherwise treated separately, into one single update equation, which then deploys in a social space of five dimensions. Four dimensions account for a rich diversity of individual traits within a heterogeneous population, including differentiated stubbornness, contrarianism, and embedded prejudices. The fifth dimension is the size of the update groups being discussed. Having one single formula allows one to explore the complete geometry of the underlying landscape of opinion dynamics. Attractors and tipping points, which shape the topology of the different possible dynamics flows, are unveiled. Driven by repeated discussion among small groups of people during a social or political public campaign, the phenomenon of minority spreading and parallel majority collapse are thus revealed ahead of their occurrence. Accordingly, within the opinion landscape, unexpected and sudden events such as Brexit and Trump victories become visible within a forecast time horizon, making them predictable. Despite the accidental nature of the landscape, evaluating the parameter values for a specific case allows one to single out which basin of attraction is going to drive the associate dynamics, and thus, a prediction of the outcome becomes feasible. The model may apply to a large spectrum of social situations including voting outcomes, market shares, and societal trends, allowing us to envision novel winning strategies in competing environments. © Copyright © 2020 Galam and Cheon.

AB  - Purpose: This article is a commentary on the structure, context and unsettling circumstances of prejudice, discrimination, racial violence and injustice in the contemporary US. Design/methodology/approach: Using the narrating voices of victims of authority violence in part, the author presents a sociological analysis of the patterns of racial injustice, borders and racialized police violence. The author uses tenets of C.W. Mill's Sociological Imagination to dissect these patterns historically and social structurally. Social implications: Using contemplative narrative, the author stimulates reflection on the social structural forces that perpetuate racial injustice. The author deliberates on the role and responsibilities of universities and the broader community in the struggle for a just society. Echoing societal calls to tackle and eliminate systemic subjugation, the author reiterates the need for reformist advocacy, for civility and the preservation of the human rights of all citizens. Originality/value: The author offers principles of reflective action to chart a pathway for a just and equitable society; ultimately shaping a mature system of democracy and collective liberation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to summarize the author’s negative experiences with police. The author seeks to enlighten readers to the differential experiences of blacks and whites in police interactions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is an essay that details the author’s negative experiences with police, while living in a mid-sized Midwestern city. Research limitations/implications: The key research implication of the paper is that whites and blacks often have qualitatively different experiences with the police in local communities. While black professionals may be experiencing professional success at work, they may also grapple with racial slights and harassment that undermine their overall physical and psychological wellbeing. Practical implications: Practically, this paper highlights the needs for police departments to train police on unconscious biases that lead to potential violence against black people. Prospective police officers should be screened on their racial attitudes and ideology to ensure they are equipped to police a broad array of citizens. Social implications: Socially, the paper underscores the unique experiences of black people with police compared to their white counterparts. To reduce cultural mistrust among blacks against whites, the latter must show empathy and understanding when blacks report instances of racial harassment and mistreatment. Also, whites who witness racial harassment perpetrated by their families, friends, and people in general, should speak out against such practices. Originality/value: The author thinks the paper is original in that it chronicles his unique, negative experiences with police as a black man in America. The author provides a theoretical background to understand the recent uptick in police violence against blacks and provide helpful tips for moving forward to improve intergroup relations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Iran is the fourth refugee-hosting country and Afghanistan is the second refugee-source country in the world. This research is qualitative and conducted with content analysis method. Twenty-seven individuals participated in the study. They were recruited from two midterm residential drug treatment centers in Tehran. Afghan refugees who use drugs felt and experienced stigma in five areas: family, friends, workplace, neighborhood, and treatment center. The consequences include frequent treatment failure, family relationship disruption, superficial conformity with the host society, and self-stigma. It is necessary to design interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination attached to refugees. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Weight stigma is a pervasive issue promoting significant adverse health and psychosocial consequences. Preconception, pregnant, and postpartum women are particularly vulnerable to weight stigma, which can directly impact their health and that of the next generation. Of note, weight stigma affects women living with obesity who are already at risk for developing gestational diabetes and experiencing associated stigmas. This narrative review aimed to examine the literature on weight stigma across the preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum periods, specifically to (1) synthesize the evidence using a socioecological lens; (2) develop a conceptual model of weight stigma tailored to women across this life phase; and (3) provide recommendations for future research. To date, weight stigma research across the preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum periods has focused predominately on pregnancy and antenatal care. The drivers and facilitators of this stigma are pervasive, occurring across various contexts and settings. Manifestations of weight stigma include decreased reproductive healthcare quality, mental health symptoms, poorer health behaviors, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Future research should further investigate the experiences of women preconception and postpartum, and health/social impacts beyond healthcare. The model herein will guide such research to ultimately identify opportunities for stigma reduction and improve multigenerational health and well-being outcomes. © 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - When the Australian Association of Adult Education (AAAE) was established in 1960, Australia was locked into a global conflict between capitalism and communism, known as the Cold War. With anticommunism at fever pitch, AAAE’s founders who were fighting to retain some influence with Australian universities and with government funding authorities needed an origin story which would appeal to these prejudices. Not surprisingly, therefore, histories of ‘the profession’ produced in the first decades largely dismissed the role of the many radical adult educators and left-wing organisations which had been instrumental in extending adult education to the working class in the first half of the twentieth century. One of the main sources for these early histories was a memoir of David Stewart, founder of the Workers Education Association, written in 1957 by a university adult educator, Esmonde McDonald Higgins. In this paper, I tell a different story, through a close examination of Higgins’ own role in this early history, to show how 1960s ‘official’ adult education lost touch with its own roots in radical working class politics, roots which are only now re-emerging, through the study of popular education and social movement learning. © 2020, Adult Learning Australia.

AB  - Introduction: Weight-related social stigma is associated with adverse health outcomes. Health care systems are not exempt of weight stigma, which includes stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. The objective of this study was to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) class and experiencing discrimination in health care. Methods: We used data from the 2013 Canadian Community Health Survey, which included measurements of discrimination never collected previously on a national scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk of self-reported discrimination in health care in adults (≥18 years) across weight categories: Not obese (BMI&lt;30 kg/m2), obese class I (BMI=30-&lt;35 kg/m2) and obese class II or III (BMI≥35 kg/m2). Results: One in 15 (6.4%; 95% CI: 5.7-7.0%) of the adult population reported discrimination in a health care setting (e.g. physician’s office, clinic or hospital). Compared with those in the not obese group, the risk of discrimination in health care was somewhat higher among those in the class I obesity category (odds ratio [OR]=1.20; 95% CI: 1.00-1.44) and significantly higher among those in class II/III (OR=1.52; 95% CI: 1.21-1.91), after controlling for sex, age and other socioeconomic characteristics. Conclusion: Quantified experiences of weight-related discrimination underscore the need to change practitioner attitudes and practices as well as the policies and procedures of the health care system. More research is needed on the social and economic impacts of weight stigma to inform focused investments for reducing discrimination in the health care system as a microcosm of the society it reflects. © 2020, Public Health Agency of Canada.

AB  - Many healthcare disparities studies use the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess bias. Despite ongoing controversy around the IAT, its use has enabled researchers to reliably document an association between provider implicit prejudice and provider-to-patient communication (provider communication behaviors and patient reactions to them). Success in documenting such associations is likely due to the outcomes studied, study settings, and data structure unique to racial/ethnic healthcare disparities research. In contrast, there has been little evidence supporting the role of providers' implicit bias in treatment recommendations. Researchers are encouraged to use multiple implicit measures to further investigate how, why, and under what circumstances providers' implicit bias predicts provider-to-patient communication and treatment recommendations. Such efforts will contribute to the advancement of both basic social psychology/social cognition research and applied health disparities research: a better understanding of implicit social cognition and a more comprehensive identification of the sources of widespread racial/ethnic healthcare disparities, respectively. © 2020 Guilford Publications, Inc.

AB  - In the wake of the Covid-19 phenomenon, a new world economic order is emerging. This upheaval is unprecedented in the collective memory with as a result, profound social changes. The first sign appears in human behaviour, lucidity is increasingly an elite sport that few people practice. This leaves more and more room for conformism, the illusion of free will, and the irrational and impulsive crowd reasoning that was exploited during this pandemic by politicians and pharmaceutical industries. Strong and strange correlations result, on which we shed light in this work and that links the prescription of hydroxychloroquine, the behaviour of populations, their political prejudices, and their fatality rates. The urgency imposes rigid communication between rulers and governed. The pandemic brings to light the contradictions of this liaison. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Beyond Words: Engaging Young Children and Families in Gallery Education at Tate Liverpool, is a three-year ethnographic case study that explores what happens when preschool children, parents and nursery practitioners from a Sure Start Children’s Centre, visit Tate to participate in an extended series of gallery visits and workshops with artists. This article explores the potential value and tensions of those creative and cultural experiences, particularly for young children and families, by critically examining different perspectives, discourses and possible constructs of effective creative engagement. This research contributes to the debate on ways of engaging children and families from marginalised communities in cultural visits and creative practices by opening up existing discussions on poverty, matters of inclusion, negative stereotypes and dominant educational discourses. Insights from parents are included and their feelings are related to the ‘symbolic violence’ often felt by parents and children throughout their education from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This research explores how Tate Liverpool developed relationships with a diverse family audience, through developing relationships with children and adults over repeated visits, as an important way for offering continuity and a sense of belonging, particularly for families who may not traditionally visit art galleries. In doing so, it makes a case for galleries to be considered as democratic, inclusive and rhizomatic learning environments, where artist educators act as ‘dreamkeepers’. Dreamkeepers can offer the space for extra emotional, social and intellectual support needed for healing from educational injury and for restarting a learning journey. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: People of minority ethnic backgrounds may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19. Whether this relates to increased infection risk, more severe disease progression, or worse in-hospital survival is unknown. The contribution of comorbidities or socioeconomic deprivation to ethnic patterning of outcomes is also unclear. Methods: We conducted a case-control and a cohort study in an inner city primary and secondary care setting to examine whether ethnic background affects the risk of hospital admission with severe COVID-19 and/or in-hospital mortality. Inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 872 cases) were compared with 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people residing in the same region. For the cohort study, we studied 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical variables. Findings: The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63–3.71] and 2.97 [2.30–3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.24 [1.83–2.74] for Black, 2.70 [2.03–3.59] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (adjusted OR 1.01 [0.70–1.46]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4–16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 1.06 [0.82–1.37]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.72 [0.47–1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality but with a large confidence interval (adjusted HR 1.71 [1.15–2.56]). Interpretation: Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease, but do not affect in-hospital mortality risk. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.

AB  - What If Learning is a pedagogical approach that allows teachers to deliver traditional content, as prescribed by national curricula, while at the same time promoting character virtues fundamental to Christian ethos. It encourages teachers to present topics from a different perspective, which shapes understanding through the lenses of cooperation, coaching or hospitality. What If Learning reframes ‘how’ to teach rather than changing ‘what’ to teach. This study tested the effects of a three-months-long What If Learning intervention which reshaped the delivery of lessons to reflect values of hospitality and welcome in twenty schools across five dioceses in the United Kingdom. Four hundred and seventy-four pupils and 198 of their teachers filled in online surveys presenting implicit and explicit measures of intergroup attitudes adapted from the existing literature to reflect our operationalisation of tolerance as the Christian virtue of hospitality or welcome. Data were collected from all participants at three time points: before and after the intervention and then again three months later. Analyses of variance revealed a pattern of answers largely supportive of the positive effect of the proposed pedagogical approach, although not always consistent with the hypotheses. Teachers report overwhelming positive effects of the intervention on several aspects of pupils’ behaviour and flourishing potentials. The discussion focuses on the widespread implications of these findings while acknowledging the need for additional research to strengthen our conclusions and promote the approach even further. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Media coverage and scholarly research have reported that Asian people who reside in the United States have been the targets of racially motivated incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to examine the types of discrimination and worries experienced by Asians and Asian Americans living in the United States during the pandemic, as well as factors that were associated with everyday discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination that the Asian community may face. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. A total of 235 people who identified themselves as Asian or Asian American and resided in the United States completed the questionnaire. Results: Our study suggested that up to a third of Asians surveyed had experienced some type of discrimination. Pooling the responses “very often,” “often,” and “sometimes,” the percentages for each experienced discrimination type ranged between 14%-34%. In total, 49%-58% of respondents expressed concerns about discrimination in the future. The most frequently experienced discrimination types, as indicated by responses “very often” and “often,” were “people act as if they think you are dangerous” (25/235, 11%) and “being treated with less courtesy or respect” (24/235, 10%). About 14% (32/235) of individuals reported very often, often, or sometimes being threatened or harassed. In addition, social media use was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination (β=.18, P=.01) and having concerns about future episodes of discrimination the community may face (β=.20, P=.005). Use of print media was also positively associated with experiencing discrimination (β=.31, P<.001). Conclusions: Our study provided important empirical evidence regarding the various types of discrimination Asians residing in the United States experienced or worried about during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between media sources and the perception of racial biases in this group was also identified. We noted the role of social media in reinforcing the perception of discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination among Asians during this outbreak. Our results indicate several practical implications for public health agencies. To reduce discrimination against Asians during the pandemic, official sources and public health professionals should be cognizant of the possible impacts of stigmatizing cues in media reports on activating racial biases. Furthermore, Asians or Asian Americans could also be informed that using social media to obtain COVID-19 information is associated with an increase in concerns about future discrimination, and thus they may consider approaching this media source with caution. ©Nan Yu, Shuya Pan, Chia-chen Yang, Jiun-Yi Tsai.

AB  - Increased migration has led to increased prejudice towards immigrant populations. This study aims to analyse attitudes towards immigration among student nurses in three universities, two in Spain and one in Portugal. Methodology: A descriptive, transversal, prospective study was carried out among student nurses (n = 624), using the Attitude towards Immigration in Nursing scale. Results: Nursing students showed some positive attitudes towards immigration, such as that immigrants should have the right to maintain their customs or that immigrants should have free access to healthcare and education, in contrast to some negative attitudes, such as that crime rates have increased due to immigration or that immigrants receive more social welfare assistance than natives. Significant differences in attitudes were revealed between students from the three universities. Discussion: Training in transcultural nursing is necessary for all nursing students in order to reduce negative attitudes towards the immigrant population and increase the awareness and sensitivity of future healthcare staff in caring for patients of all backgrounds. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Black physicians' and trainees' experiences of racism are not well documented in Canada, reflecting a knowledge gap needing correction to combat racism in Canadian health care. The authors undertook a descriptive study of Black physicians and trainees in the Canadian province of Ontario. The goal of this study was to report upon racism experienced by participant Ontarian physicians to challenge the purported rarity of racism in Canadian health care. METHOD: An anonymous online survey of physicians and trainees who self-identify as Black (African/Afro-Canadian/African American/Afro-Caribbean) was administered in March and April 2018 through the Black Physicians' Association of Ontario (BPAO) listserv. The survey was modeled on qualitative interview guides from American studies. Snowball sampling was employed whereby BPAO members forwarded the survey to eligible colleagues (non-BPAO members) to maximize responses. Survey data were analyzed and key themes described. RESULTS: Survey participants totalled 46, with a maximal response rate of 38%. Participants reported positive experiences of collegiality with Black colleagues and strong bonds with Black patients. Negative discrimination experiences included differential treatment and racism from peers, superiors, and patients. Participants reported race as a major factor in their selection of practice location, more so than selection of career. Participants also expressed a lack of mentorship, and there was a strong call for increased mentorship from mentors with similar ethno-racial backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study challenges the notion that racism within Canadian health care is rare. Future systematic collection of information regarding Black physicians' and trainees' experiences of racism will be key in appreciating the prevalence and nature of these experiences.

AB  - Within the framework of sustainable development, the concept of cultural heritage is linked to the heritage awareness of a specific spatial context, and to the conservation of collective memory. Despite the clear interest in cultural sustainability, the lack of research devoted to interpreting different teaching methods for transmitting patrimonial assets and preserving natural heritage is noteworthy. For this reason, the present study takes various scientific contributions as the background for considering sustainable education as a fundamental instrument to recover and conserve heritage resources, both from an informative and educational point of view. The aim of this study was to assess the training of new teachers in terms of the particular skills needed to develop active learning methods related to the teaching of heritage sustainability. The research sample consisted of 488 students in the Degree in Primary Education program. The methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative techniques, to obtain information from both observation and an opinion survey given to the students. The results show several opinions related to achieving and facilitating the implementation of innovative methodologies, due to a lack of initial university training. Generally speaking, this work provided an opportunity for students to analyze a series of prejudices regarding their working methods, and to overcome excessive theorization in their university studies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Having an Anglican affiliation is known to be associated with support for leaving the European Union (EU) in Britain. Religiosity, conceived as strength of religious attachment, has received comparatively little treatment. We investigate religiosity via electoral, household, and attitudinal surveys, distinguishing the effects of “behaving” and “believing.” The association between religiosity and EU Referendum vote choice and position is identified before and after inclusion of values, attitudinal, and civic engagement measures. Consistent with established findings, in socio-structural models Anglicans are more likely to support Brexit than religious Nones. More frequent church attendance is associated with being more pro-Remain. The Anglican effect is primarily mediated by anti-immigrant attitudes, authoritarianism, and salience of ethnic identity, suggesting a Christian nationalist aspect to Leave support. The attendance effect is mediated by warmer attitudes toward immigrants, and social capital. Notably, those exhibiting stronger orthodox belief tend to feature a stronger attachment to “Leave,” with this partly mediated by authoritarianism. To evaluate the net effect of religion on civic life, we should pay more attention to the cultural content of religious beliefs, and how they structure other values and attitudes. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2020

AB  - In the Czech Republic, a number of strategy papers and policy documents are guiding the direction of Roma inclusion, including in the area of health. The conceptualization of Roma and how mainstream political and public discourse operate with the term “Roma” contribute to a mistakenly homogenous and harmful image of Roma that conforms to negative stereotypes. The aim of our study was to examine the conceptualization of Roma in policy documents related to social inclusion and health in the Czech Republic. Relevant political, strategic and project documents were selected for analysis. Emphasis is placed in them on individual responsibility in relation to health, while structural conditions and discrimination are mentioned less often. Roma are described in relation to health primarily as people who should be educated. More emphasis is placed on the economic benefits of eliminating health inequalities than on citizens’ rights and the importance of inclusion. When “participation” or “empowerment” is mentioned, it is done vaguely, usually in addition to references to completely non-participatory practices. The majority is the primary actor in the field of eliminating health inequalities, as it defines the “path” that Roma need to be shown or determines what is needed to “stimulate” citizens. Although the political discourse concerning Roma has shifted more towards human rights, equity and combating discrimination in the Czech Republic, subtle forms of anti-Gypsyism still seem to be present. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: In early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand implemented graduated, risk-informed national COVID-19 suppression measures aimed at disease elimination. We investigated their impacts on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country and response performance measures. Methods: We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. We extracted data from the national notifiable diseases database and the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository. Demographic features and disease outcomes, transmission patterns (source of infection, outbreaks, household transmission), time-to-event intervals, and testing coverage were described over five phases of the response, capturing different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Risk factors for severe outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were examined with multivariable logistic regression and time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation. Findings: 1503 cases were detected over the study period, including 95 (6·3%) hospital admissions and 22 (1·5%) COVID-19 deaths. The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked at 8·5 (95% CI 7·6–9·4) during the 10-day period of rapid response escalation, declining to 3·2 (2·8–3·7) in the start of lockdown and progressively thereafter. 1034 (69%) cases were imported or import related, tending to be younger adults, of European ethnicity, and of higher socioeconomic status. 702 (47%) cases were linked to 34 outbreaks. Severe outcomes were associated with locally acquired infection (crude odds ratio [OR] 2·32 [95% CI 1·40–3·82] compared with imported), older age (adjusted OR ranging from 2·72 [1·40–5·30] for 50–64 year olds to 8·25 [2·59–26·31] for people aged ≥80 years compared with 20–34 year olds), aged residential care residency (adjusted OR 3·86 [1·59–9·35]), and Pacific peoples (adjusted OR 2·76 [1·14–6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10–4·20]) ethnicities relative to European or other. Times from illness onset to notification and isolation progressively decreased and testing increased over the study period, with few disparities and increasing coverage of females, Māori, Pacific peoples, and lower socioeconomic groups. Interpretation: New Zealand's response resulted in low relative burden of disease, low levels of population disease disparities, and the initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.

AB  - Head lice are exclusive human parasitic blood-sucking insects. Distributed worldwide among school-age children, this parasitosis generates scalp irritation and sometimes social prejudice. Understanding how head lice detect and perceive their human hosts is crucial to control transmission. Here, we describe the sensory structures present on the mouthparts of Pediculus humanus capitis and their possible contribution to the feeding decision-making process. On the anterior zone of the clypeus around the haustellum two morphological types of sensilla, invariable in location and number, were identified: fourteen short clypeus bristles (SCB) and six long clypeus bristles (LCB). During feeding these structures contact the host skin but not its blood. Located antero-dorsally on the everted haustellum and between the epipharyngeal teeth, a third sensillar type was identified: about four short peg epipharyngeal (SPE) sensilla. These structures are bathed with the incoming blood, when head lice feed, so may have a gustatory role. In behavioural experiments antennectomy of lice did not interfere with feeding behaviour, suggesting that the sensory structures on the mouthparts could be involved in host assessment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - I shall discuss, from a personal perspective, research on risk perception that has created an understanding of the dynamic interplay between an appreciation of risk that resides in us as a feeling and an appreciation of risk that results from analysis. In some circumstances, feelings reflect important social values that deserve to be considered along with traditional analyses of physical and economic risk. In other situations, both feelings and analyses may be shaped by powerful cognitive biases and deep social and partisan prejudices, causing nonrational judgments and decisions. This is of concern if risk analysis is to be applied, as it needs to be, in managing existential threats such as pandemic disease, climate change, or nuclear weapons amidst a divisive political climate. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - This paper studies whether exposure to anti-immigrant sentiment in the online context affects the willingness to support an openly anti-immigration party, and shows how gender moderates the effect. We designed an online experiment in which participants were invited to an online forum to discuss immigration issues. We manipulate the social acceptability of xenophobic views by exposing participants to an increasing proportion of comments with anti-immigrant content. As a proxy for open support for anti-immigrant policies, we ask participants to donate to a well-known German party with a strong anti-immigration discourse: Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany). We find no evidence that exposure to increasing social acceptability of xenophobic content affected the willingness to donate. In an exploratory analysis, we find that women are particularly reluctant to donate after the anti-immigrant comments raised normative concerns. The results can shed light on the heterogeneous effect of counter-normative discourses on support for anti-immigrant parties. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Family courts have rarely considered how their decisions are perpetuating domestic violence and child abuse in the many cases where custody disputes are before them. Rather than judges playing King Solomon themselves, they frequently leave the decision making to mental health professionals and lawyers whose credentials rarely include an understanding of what is needed to recognize, stop current abuse and prevent future violence. This article employs a literature review to examine the consequences of this decision making. Research shows that both male and female judges are skeptical of mothers’ claims of abuse and that their opinions contain negative stereotypes of women on which theories of parental alienation are based. More frighteningly, when guardians-ad-Litem or Custody Evaluators were entrusted with these decisions, research shows an intensification of the courts’ skepticism toward mothers’—but not fathers’—claims of abuse. Traditional family court procedures continue the serious risk of harm to women and children by minimizing domestic violence and child abuse, often using unproven and unscientific alienation theories as an excuse not to protect them. The article concludes with a discussion of the role specialty courts that employ therapeutic jurisprudence can play in improving this process for children. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

AB  - People overestimate the risk of some events, such as terrorist attacks and immigrant crimes, but not of others. Stereotype amplification theory indicates that politicized, out-group stereotypes may be to blame. We examine Americans' perceptions of the risk that different forms of violence-out-group, in-group and non-racialized-will occur in their local communities. We hypothesize that negative stereotypes of immigrants and Muslims will increase the perceived risk of out-group violence but not of other forms of violence. Analyses of original survey data from a sample of 1,068 Americans reveal four findings: (1) most Americans accurately perceive home-grown violence to be more likely than violence by foreigners, (2) political identification and ideology strongly predict out-group stereotypes, (3) out-group stereotypes strongly predict the perceived risk of out-group violence but are not significantly associated with risk perceptions for other forms of violence and (4) vulnerability factors predict risk perceptions for all forms of violence. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Research on the union formation of the children of immigrants, the so-called second generation, focusses primarily on marriage and cohabitation. Even though dating relationships are often the first romantic relations and lay the foundation for more committed relationships, very little is known about dating among second-generation young adults. This is unfortunate because dating across different origin groups may point to changing or shifting group boundaries, that may only later be reflected in interethnic marriages. In this paper we aim to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the dating behavior of Turkish second-generation young adults in five European countries (the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, France) using the comparative TIES survey data. Our results show that it is common for the Turkish second generation to date a partner with a non-Turkish background. And, moreover, that it is important to distinguish between different types of intra-ethnic partnerships. Although only few parents are reported not to approve of the relationship of their child, a substantial part of the second generation seems reluctant to inform their parents about their dating life. With regard to the role of parents, it seems that their influence on the origin of dating partners is limited. In order to enhance our understanding of the meaning of (intergroup-) dating, its determinants and outcomes, future data may focus more on meeting places and the role of peers in a longitudinal way. We argue that dating is an important indicator for intergroup relations that deserves further attention in increasingly diverse societies. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Our aim was to examine the role of parents in the transmission of weight bias to young children. Specifically, we assessed mothers’ and fathers’ weight bias and beliefs about the controllability of weight, and fear of fat in relation to their children’s weight bias. Eighty-three mothers, 57 fathers, and their children (4- to 7-year-olds) participated. We failed to find any significant associations between children’s weight bias, maternal responses, and most paternal responses. Only fathers’ dislike of adults with overweight had daughters with more positive views of overweight figures. These results suggest that parents do not appear to contribute to the weight bias of preschoolers and their influence may only emerge in middle childhood. The present study also suggests that more work on the psychometric properties of weight bias scales and tasks to measure weight bias in children is vital to accurately evaluate interventions to decrease weight bias. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Social science researchers are predominantly liberal, and critics have argued this representation may reduce the robustness of research by embedding liberal values into the research process. In an adversarial collaboration, we examined whether the political slant of research findings in psychology is associated with lower rates of scientific replicability. We analyzed 194 original psychology articles reporting studies that had been subject to a later replication attempt (N = 1,331,413 participants across replications) by having psychology doctoral students (Study 1) and an online sample of U.S. residents (Study 2) from across the political spectrum code the political slant (liberal vs. conservative) of the original research abstracts. The methods and analyses were preregistered. In both studies, the liberal or conservative slant of the original research was not associated with whether the results were successfully replicated. The results remained consistent regardless of the ideology of the coder. Political slant was unrelated to both subsequent citation patterns and the original study’s effect size and not consistently related to the original study’s sample size. However, we found modest evidence that research with greater political slant—whether liberal or conservative—was less replicable, whereas statistical robustness consistently predicted replication success. We discuss the implications for social science, politics, and replicability. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Across four studies, we tested whether the content of collective nostalgia has untapped utility for understanding intergroup relations. In Study 1a, we demonstrated variance in the content of the nostalgizing American Christians report—variance that influenced attitudes towards outgroups. Participants who reported longing for a more open society expressed less anti-immigration sentiments and less blatant prejudice against Muslims compared to those longing for a more homogeneous society. In Study 1b, we replicated these results using a representative sample of Poles, thus extending them to a different socio-political context. In Study 2, we demonstrated that the content of collective nostalgia experienced can be experimentally manipulated. Specifically, experimentally primed openness-focused nostalgia (relative to a control condition) weakened American Christians' anti-immigration sentiments (but not blatant prejudice against Muslims). Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2 with an improved experimental manipulation. Overall, the findings show significant effects that content of collective nostalgia has on anti-immigration sentiments as well as some indication that the content of collective nostalgia influences blatant intergroup prejudice. These results have theoretical relevance for the study of collective nostalgia (i.e., content matters) as well as practical relevance in demonstrating that variations in nostalgia-inducing rhetoric can shape intergroup attitudes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Psoriasis patients experience negative attitudes and behaviors exhibited by people who have insufficient knowledge about psoriasis. In this study, the knowledge level of the society about psoriasis; people's attitudes toward such patients were investigated. A questionnaire that investigates the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to psoriasis according to age, gender, and education levels was applied to the participants. About a quarter of participants in the study did not have any knowledge about psoriasis, 22.9% participants who thought that they knew about psoriasis believed that psoriasis was an infectious disease, 34.2% indicated that they were afraid of shaking hands with patients who had psoriasis, 45.4% did not wish to eat any food prepared by such patients, and 13.4% did not want to work with them in the same workplace. Female participants were more concerned that psoriasis was contagious (P =.030) than male participants, and they were more concerned about shaking hands (P =.022) and eating food prepared by psoriasis patients (P =.009). Both the psoriasis is little known and the level of knowledge of the participants who think they have knowledge about psoriasis was insufficient and prejudiced attitudes and behaviors are common in patients with psoriasis. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This study examined the effects of racial/ethnic segregation (i.e., overrepresentation) in academic classes on belonging, fairness, intergroup attitudes, and achievement across middle school (n = 4,361; MageT1 = 11.33 years), and whether effects depended on numerical minority status in school and race/ethnicity. Latent growth curve models revealed that experiencing more segregation than usual predicted less belonging and fairness than usual for all youth in the numerical minority, and greater in-group preference for numerical minority Whites. Academic classroom segregation throughout middle school predicted less steep declines in in-group preference for adolescents in the numerical minority, and declines in achievement for African American numerical minority youth. Results highlight the need to treat the racial/ethnic context as a structural and dynamic construct. © 2020 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Payne, Vuletich, and Lundberg’s bias-of-crowds model proposes that a number of empirical puzzles can be resolved by conceptualizing implicit bias as a feature of situations rather than a feature of individuals. In the present article we argue against this model and propose that, given the existing evidence, implicit bias is best understood as an individual-level construct measured with substantial error. First, using real and simulated data, we show how each of Payne and colleagues’ proposed puzzles can be explained as being the result of measurement error and its reduction via aggregation. Second, we discuss why the authors’ counterarguments against this explanation have been unconvincing. Finally, we test a hypothesis derived from the bias-of-crowds model about the effect of an individually targeted “implicit-bias-based expulsion program” within universities and show the model to lack empirical support. We conclude by considering the implications of conceptualizing implicit bias as a noisily measured individual-level construct for ongoing implicit-bias research.

AB  - Theorizing from humanistic and motivational literatures suggests attitude change may occur because high quality listening facilitates the insight needed to explore and integrate potentially threatening information relevant to the self. By extension, self-insight may enable attitude change as a result of conversations about prejudice. We tested whether high quality listening would predict attitudes related to speakers' prejudices and whether self-insight would mediate this effect. Study 1 (preregistered) examined scripted conversations characterized by high, regular, and poor listening quality. In Study 2, we manipulated high versus regular listening quality in the laboratory as speakers talked about their prejudiced attitudes. Finally, Study 3 (preregistered) used a more robust measure of prejudiced attitudes to test whether perceived social acceptance could be an alternative explanation to Study 2 findings. Across these studies, the exploratory (pilot study and Study 2) and confirmatory (Studies 1 & 3) findings were in line with expectations that high, versus regular and poor, quality listening facilitated lower prejudiced attitudes because it increased self-insight. A meta-analysis of the studies (N = 952) showed that the average effect sizes for high quality listening (vs. comparison conditions) on self-insight, openness to change and prejudiced attitudes were, ds = 1.19, 0.46, 0.32 95%CIs [0.73, 1.51], [0.29, 0.63] [0.12, 0.53], respectively. These results suggest that when having conversations about prejudice, high-quality listening modestly shapes prejudice following conversations about it, and underscore the importance of self-insight and openness to change in this process. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite the increasing popularity of video games and the diversity of people who play, prejudice remains common in online gaming. In the current study, we use structural equation modeling to test the role of social norms, individual differences, and gamer identification as predictors of how likely someone is to report engaging in prejudiced behavior while playing online video games. We also test the relative importance of these predictors to assess how likely people are to confront prejudice when it occurs in online video games. Participants (N = 384) completed a series of questionnaires to assess their attitudes and perceptions of online gaming norms, as well as to report their own prejudiced and confrontation behavior in video games. We found that both social norms and individual differences are significant predictors of behavior in online gaming. The more normative people report prejudice to be, the more they report making prejudiced comments. Similarly, the more normative confrontation of prejudice is reported to be, the more likely people are to report confronting prejudice. The more people endorsed generally prejudiced attitudes, the more likely they were to report making prejudiced remakes in online gaming and the less likely they were to report confronting prejudiced remarks. These results provide a foundation to inform interventions to reduce prejudice in gaming and indicate that both individual differences and norms are important to consider when designing interventions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The current study examines how gender discrimination by adults in school is linked with depressive symptoms and sleep duration over time in middle school. The main goal is to test one psychological mechanism that can account for such associations: perceived school unfairness. Relying on a racially-ethnically diverse sample of girls (N = 2,718, Mage = 13.01, SDage = 0.39) from 26 middle schools, multilevel mediation analyses revealed that girls who experienced school-based gender discrimination by an adult in seventh grade reported higher levels of perceived school unfairness in eighth grade. Moreover, perceived unfairness, in turn, was associated with more depressive symptoms and shorter sleep durations by eighth grade. Implications of changes in adolescent girls’ sleep and mood related to their experiences of gender discrimination are discussed. © 2020 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - The effects of verbal accents on intergroup attitudes are well documented. This study aims to enrich our understanding by exploring how those effects vary according to the speaker's gender and the political context. We conducted two online survey experiments in which South Korean citizens were randomly exposed to speakers exhibiting one of four accent conditions – South Korean male and female accents and North Korean male and female accents – a week before and two days after the 2018 Singapore summit between North Korea and the United States, in order to test hypotheses based on literatures from political science, social psychology and evolutionary biology. The results indicate that only exposure to a North Korean male accent, not a North Korean female accent, strengthened stereotypes about North Koreans among South Koreans prior to the summit. Further, this negative effect disappeared immediately after the summit. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate the relations between White parents’ implicit racial attitudes and their children's racially based bias in empathic concern toward White and Black victims of injustice as well as the moderating role of children's age in this relation. Children aged 5–9 years (N = 190) reported how sorry (i.e., sympathy) and nervous (i.e., personal distress) they felt after watching sympathy-inducing videos in which either a White (non-Hispanic) child or a Black child was teased by peers. Participants’ primary caregivers (mostly mothers) completed a computerized Implicit Association Test to assess their implicit racial attitudes. Parents’ implicit race bias was associated with their children's reported sympathy toward Black victims and their sympathetic bias (i.e., relative sympathy toward White vs. Black victims); however, results were moderated by children's age. Specifically, parents with higher implicit race bias tended to have children with lower levels of sympathy toward Black victims for younger children and higher levels of sympathetic bias for younger and average-aged children but not for older children. Older children tended to report relatively high levels of sympathy toward Black victims and low levels of sympathetic bias regardless of their parents’ implicit attitudes. The importance of parents’ implicit attitudes in understanding young children's race-based moral emotional responses and the implications for intervention work are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Theory suggests that teachers’ implicit racial attitudes affect their students, but large-scale evidence on U.S. teachers’ implicit biases and their correlates is lacking. Using nationwide data from Project Implicit, we found that teachers’ implicit White/Black biases (as measured by the implicit association test) vary by teacher gender and race. Teachers’ adjusted bias levels are lower in counties with larger shares of Black students. In the aggregate, counties in which teachers hold higher levels of implicit and explicit racial bias have larger adjusted White/Black test score inequalities and White/Black suspension disparities. © 2020 AERA.

AB  - Background Weight stigma impairs health. Few studies have disentangled the associations of experienced versus internalized stigma with weight-related outcomes. Purpose To examine weight and health variables associated with weight stigma experiences and internalization in the largest-to-date sample of adults in weight management. Methods WW (formerly Weight Watchers) members (N = 18,769, 94.6% female, 91.1% white) completed an online survey from 2017 to 2018. Participants reported whether they had experienced weight stigma and, if so, the onset, past-year frequency and distress, and interpersonal sources of stigma. Participants completed the Modified Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS-M) and self-reported: past-year weight and lifetime weight cycles; current self-monitoring behaviors; eating self-efficacy; physical activity; perceived stress; eating to cope; body image; and mental and physical health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL). Participants reported their demographic characteristics, including height and weight to compute body mass index. Results In logistic and linear regression analyses (controlling for participant characteristics), WBIS-M scores were negatively associated with weight loss, self-monitoring, eating self-efficacy, body image, and mental HRQOL and positively associated with weight gain, weight cycling, perceived stress, and eating to cope (p <.001). Experiencing weight stigma was associated with greater weight loss and less weight gain, although associations with other variables had small effect sizes (absolute β values < 0.10). WBIS-M scores remained significantly associated with all variables when including stigma onset, frequency/distress, and sources. Conclusions Internalized, but not experienced, weight stigma was consistently associated with adverse weight and health factors. Developing and testing interventions targeting internalized stigma in the context of weight management should be a research priority. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - Democratic legitimacy is often grounded in proceduralist terms, referring to the ideal of political equality that should be mirrored by fair procedures of decision-making. The paper argues (§1) that the normative commitments embedded in a non-minimalist account of procedural legitimacy are well expressed by the ideal of co-authorship. Against this background, the main goal of the paper is to argue that structural forms of epistemic injustice are detrimental to the overall legitimacy of democratic systems. In §2 I analyse Young’s notion of political powerlessness and claim that in structurally unjust social contexts members of powerless groups often are not properly acknowledged as functioning members of the polity, hence being jeopardized in their ability to develop part of their personal identity. In §III, I define gerrymandering as an example of political disempowerment that involves an epistemic harm for oppressed citizens, namely, to be prejudicially excluded from the community of epistemic trust. My thesis is that being epistemically disempowered has a negative impact on the way in which citizens understand themselves as political actors, since they suffer a lack of social recognition that may impede a proper development of their reflexive agency. In §IV, I discuss the proposal of granting epistemic privilege to members of oppressed groups, given their specific experience of social injustices. I introduce two concerns about this proposal, one morally grounded and one pragmatically oriented. Finally, in §V, I briefly sketch some institutional remedies that can be employed in order to politically fight systemic forms of epistemic injustice. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - There are two classes of explanations of prejudice: situational and personality. In a sample of Polish community members (n = 394), we tried to understand individual differences in prejudice towards refugees (i.e., classical and modern prejudice along with social distance) by considering the role of individual differences in the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), collective narcissism (i.e., agentic and communal), social dominance, and authoritarianism. Both the Dark Triad traits and collective narcissism were associated with prejudice towards refugees among Poles, but the association for the former was fully mediated by social dominance—an effect that was stronger in men—whereas the association for the latter was partially mediated by authoritarianism—an effect that was stronger in women. We discuss our findings referring to a dual process model of prejudice. © 2020

AB  - This article contests the view that the strong positive correlation between anti-immigration attitudes and far right party success necessarily constitutes evidence in support of the cultural grievance thesis. We argue that the success of far right parties depends on their ability to mobilize a coalition of interests between their core supporters, that is voters with cultural grievances over immigration and the often larger group of voters with economic grievances over immigration. Using individual level data from eight rounds of the European Social Survey, our empirical analysis shows that while cultural concerns over immigration are a stronger predictor of far right party support, those who are concerned with the impact of immigration on the economy are important to the far right in numerical terms. Taken together, our findings suggest that economic grievances over immigration remain pivotal within the context of the transnational cleavage. © European Consortium for Political Research 2020.

AB  - Previous research on youth attitudes towards immigration has tended to focus on explaining why young people are more accepting of immigrants than their elders. In this article, therefore, we focus on the young people that are opposed to immigration. First, we use nationally representative survey data from young adults in England to highlight that a substantial minority hold negative attitudes towards immigrants. In the second half of the article, we then turn to qualitative data (in-depth interviews) to explore how young people talk about and justify holding these negative attitudes. Both the qualitative and the quantitative data suggest that anti-immigrant attitudes among young people are linked to the perception that immigrants pose an economic and cultural threat, and to the spread of culturalised forms of citizenship. What the qualitative data also reveal, however, is how these distinct discourses reinforce one another and how they intersect with other types of prejudice. We will argue that the idea of Hard Work is central to understanding anti-immigrant attitudes, as this has become a deeply-embedded cultural norm that is being used to include and exclude (immigrants and others), and to distinguish between who is deserving of membership of British society and who is not. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Group-based emotions can shape group members’ behaviors and intergroup relations. Therefore, we propose that people may try to regulate emotions of outgroup members to attain ingroup goals. We call this phenomenon “motivated intergroup emotion regulation.” In four studies, conducted in both hypothetical and real-world contexts, we show that deterrence and reconciliation goals influence how fearful or calm people want outgroup members to feel, respectively. We further show that such motivated intergroup emotion regulation can guide behavior toward the outgroup, influencing how outgroup members feel (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and behave (Study 4). We demonstrate how affiliation with the ingroup, which renders ingroup goals more salient, shapes what ingroup members want outgroup members to feel (Studies 3 and 4) and subsequently how outgroup members feel and behave (Study 4). Finally, we discuss how motivated intergroup emotion regulation might contribute to understanding motivation in emotion regulation, group-based emotions, and intergroup relations. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) predict prejudice and discrimination in adults. To create analogous scales for children, we carried out four studies. First, we gave 112 adults from New Zealand (Study 1) and 146 adults from Turkey (Study 2) novel child-appropriate measures of RWA and SDO, along with the standard adult measures. The two RWA measures correlated more highly with each other than with the SDO measures, and the two SDO measures correlated more highly with each other than with the RWA measures. Study 3 tested 75 children aged 6 to 12, finding acceptable to good reliability for the two child scales. Child RWA (RWAc) and SDO (SDOc) decreased significantly over age. SDOc correlated with maternal SDO and RWA, and RWAc correlated with children's racial bias. Study 4 examined the RWAc scale with 39 children aged 5 to 11 years. There was good reliability for the RWAc scale and a correlation with anti-fat prejudice. Overall, the findings indicate that: (a) the scales are reliable, (b) SDOc correlates with parental attitudes, (c) RWAc correlates with children's prejudice, and (d) RWA and SDO are present early in life and decline with age. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Advances in molecular technologies have the potential to help remedy health inequities through earlier detection and prevention; if, however, their delivery and uptake (and therefore any benefits associated with such testing) are not more carefully considered, there is a very real risk that existing inequities in access and use will be further exacerbated. We argue this risk relates to the way that information and knowledge about the technology is both acquired and shared, or not, between health practitioners and their patients. A healthcare system can be viewed as a complex social network comprising individuals with different worldviews, hierarchies, professional cultures and subcultures and personal beliefs, both for those giving and receiving care. When healthcare practitioners are not perceived as knowledge equals, they would experience informational prejudices, and the result is that knowledge dissemination across and between them would be impeded. The uptake and delivery of a new technology may be inequitable as a result. Patients would also experience informational prejudice when they are viewed as not being able to understand the information that is presented to them, and information may be withheld. Informational prejudices driven by social relations and structures have thus far been underexplored in considering (in)equitable implementation and uptake of new molecular technologies. Every healthcare interaction represents an opportunity for experiencing informational prejudice, and with it the risk of being inappropriately informed for undertaking (or offering) such screening or testing. Making knowledge acquisition and information dissemination, and experiences of informational prejudice, explicit through sociologically framed investigations would extend our understandings of (in)equity, and offer ways to affect network relationships and structures that support equity in delivery and uptake. ©

AB  - The establishment of international colleges in public universities has been part of a deliberate national strategy to modernize higher education in Thailand since the 1990s. These colleges use English as the medium of instruction, employ many international faculty, and promote more Western approaches to teaching and learning such as student-centered education. In addition, international colleges have served a more symbolic role. They serve as markers of civilization and sophistication, a symbol to be cultivated for the purpose of elevating one’s status in an already deeply divided Thai society. This narrative case study aims to situate Thailand’s first public university international college in a long-standing historical framework characterized by paradoxes and prejudices deeply rooted in Thai society. Stories are collected from members of the executive leadership of the college. It is argued that the themes emerging from the leadership narrative are consistent with the historical framework. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore athletes’ perceptions of how coaches shaped their experiences in disability sport throughout development. Athletes with physical disabilities (N = 21) participated in life history interviews. Participants outlined their sport history and responded to questions targeting the roles that coaches played in their development, which laid the foundation for broader conversations about how coaches shaped the disability sport experience. Using thematic analysis, patterns in coach knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors were captured in 4 themes. Three themes were discussed in relation to positive experiences in disability sport (consideration, collaboration, professionalism), and 1 theme was related to negative disability sport experiences (prejudice). The findings of this work are analyzed through the lens of the social-relational model of disability, thus challenging the dominant discourse that underpins understandings of (dis)ability in the sport context. Practical recommendations for disability sport coaches include reflective practice and introspective examination of implicit biases and assumptions, as well as a focus on interpersonal skills that assist coaches in collaborating with athletes—thus encouraging the integration of sport- and disability-specific knowledge. Lay Summary Athletes with physical disabilities were interviewed about how coaches shaped their experiences in sport over time. Differences in how coaches created positive experiences were identified at each stage of development, reflecting varied combinations of knowledge and behaviors. Negative experiences stemmed from perceptions of unfair treatment and inequality. ©, Copyright © Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

AB  - The present study aims at explaining individual differences in self-reported political violence. We integrate key concepts from the field of criminology that are conceptually related to social identity theory (Flemish identity, feelings of group superiority, and ethnocentrism) and the dual process model on prejudice (perceived injustice, perception of threat, and right-wing authoritarianism). In our model, social identity concepts are hypothesized to play a mediating role between mechanisms derived from the dual process model and political violence. To test the integrated model, a model was run for testing the strength of direct and indirect effects of perceived injustice, authoritarianism thrill-seeking behavior, feelings of superiority, Flemish nationalism, ethnocentrism, right-wing extremist beliefs, and exposure to racist peers on political violence. The analyses are based on a web survey (N = 723) among adolescents and young adults in Flanders, Belgium. Results indicate that social identity variables play an important mediation role between perceptions and ideological attitudes related to injustice, and political violence. The main path revealed by our study is that perceived injustice may result in heightened perceptions of threat, which in turn positively influence levels of right-wing authoritarianism. Mediated by ethnocentrism, this variable has a significant and positive effect on right-wing beliefs, which in turn has a positive effect on political violence. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Based on a survey of 593 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the United Kingdom, this study shows that direct anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by direct experiences of victimization) and indirect anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by personally knowing other victims of hate crime) are highly prolific and frequent experiences for LGBT people. Our findings show that trans people are particularly susceptible to hate crimes, both in terms of prevalence and frequency. This article additionally highlights the negative emotional and (intended) behavioral reactions that were correlated with an imagined hate crime scenario, showing that trans people are more likely to experience heightened levels of threat, vulnerability, and anxiety compared with non-trans LGB people. The study found that trans people are also more likely to feel unsupported by family, friends, and society for being LGBT, which was correlated with the frequency of direct (verbal) abuse they had previously endured. The final part of this study explores trans people’s confidence levels in the Government, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in relation to addressing hate crime. In general, trans people felt that the police are not effective at policing anti-LGBT hate crime, and they are not respectful toward them as victims; this was especially true where individuals had previous contact with the police. Respondents were also less confident in the CPS to prosecute anti-LGBT hate crimes, though the level of confidence was slightly higher when respondents had direct experience with the CPS. The empirical evidence presented here supports the assertion that all LGBT people, but particularly trans individuals, continue to be denied equal participation in society due to individual, social, and structural experiences of prejudice. The article concludes by arguing for a renewed policy focus that must address this issue as a public health problem. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The growing use of machine learning for the data-driven study of social issues and the implementation of data-driven decision processes has required researchers to re-examine the often implicit assumption that datadriven models are neutral and free of biases. The careful examination of machine-learned models has identified examples of how existing biases can inadvertently be perpetuated in fields such as criminal justice, where failing to account for racial prejudices in the prediction of recidivism can perpetuate or exasperate them, and natural language processing, where algorithms trained on human languages corpora have been shown to reproduce strong biases in gendered descriptions. These examples highlight the importance of thinking about how biases might impact the study of educational data and how data-driven models used in educational contexts may perpetuate inequalities. To understand this question, we ask whether and how demographic information, including age, educational level, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geographical location, is used in Educational Data Mining (EDM) research. Specifically, we conduct a systematic survey of the last five years of EDM publications that investigates whether and how demographic information about the students is reported in EDM research and how this information is used to 1) investigate issues related to demographics, 2) use the information as input features for data-driven analyses, or 3) to test and validate models. This survey shows that, although a majority of publications reported at least one category of demographic information, the frequency of reporting for different categories of demographic information is very uneven (ranging from 5% to 59%), and only 15% of publications used demographic information in their analyses. © 2020 FISHTAXA.

AB  - Background: Functional mobility (FM) is the person's ability to move to accomplish daily living tasks and activities. FM limitations are common in Parkinson's disease, increase with disease progression, and can be highly disabling. Although several studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) field use this concept, only recently, a formal definition has been proposed. Objective: We aimed to explore patient's and health professional's perspectives of FM in PD. Methods: A focus group methodology has been used. Four focus groups, with a total of 10 patients and 10 health professionals, were performed. Six patients were early stage and four advanced stage. The health professional's group was composed of five neurologists and five physiotherapists. The suitability of the new concept, the impact of FM limitations in PD patient's daily routine, and the potential benefit of walking aids have been discussed. Results: All participants were able to provide a spontaneous definition of FM, matching with the proposed concept. All agreed that PD affects patient's FM, increasing the limitations with disease progression, and with the existence of a serious prejudice with walking aids that hinders its use. Early-stage patient's perspective seems to be more in line with neurologist's perspective, while the views of advanced-stage patients were closer to physiotherapist's views. Conclusion: FM concept was considered as intuitive and useful. FM limitations have an important physical and social impact in the advanced stage of the disease. Although patients and health professionals acknowledge walking aid's benefit improving patient's FM, the prejudice associated with this type of tools limits its recommendation and use. © Copyright © 2020 Bouça-Machado, Gonçalves, Lousada, Patriarca, Costa, Nunes, Dias, Caldas, Valadas, Lobo, Guedes, Rosa, Coelho and Ferreira.

AB  - Exploitative familiarity (‘mate crime’) is a recently-identified phenomenon. Available evidence suggests that exploitative familiarity has a significant impact on the lives of some disabled people, not only in terms of the breadth of offences committed using this form of insidious exploitation but also because of the potential grave consequences. Often, isolated disabled people are victimised in their homes by locals who may use the effects of victims’ impairments to manipulate and betray purported friendships. Exploitation can continue unchecked, particularly where there is lack of institutional involvement. Based on a case study of police records and drawing upon the fields of hate crime and disability studies, this article provides an explanation of how and why exploitative familiarity occurs. The evidence appears to suggest that oppression and stigmatisation of disabled people lead to relational disadvantages such as poverty and isolation. However, it is the ‘individual vulnerability’ of victims which directly influences targeting. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Brazilian University for International Integration of the Afro-Brazilian Lusophony (UNILAB) was created to host students from Portuguese-speaking Africa and Brazil. In this article, we look at the aims and objectives of UNILAB, which include the social integration of these students at the university. We present results from interviews conducted at UNILAB in 2018 with 63 international and domestic students. Analysis of this material shows that despite acknowledgement of the value of internationalisation at UNILAB, the social integration level of Portuguese-speaking students from outside Brazil at the university is characteristically weak among the interviewees, a situation they attribute to a lack of suitable preparation for staff at the host institution and prejudice towards African students in the local community. We consider what these findings mean for the future of UNILAB and the development of Global South-South student migration. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this paper, a reflective account of a community-based methodology will be provided which targeted families in poverty who did not engage with the school system. The research discussed provides a phenomenological understanding of how these parents perceived their role in their child’s education, and what challenges they felt they faced, both at home and in school. This community-based methodology proved effective in recruiting and obtaining data from five focus groups (n = 27) and a series of in-depth interviews (n = 50). The perceived positionality of the gatekeeper is discussed, explained using Tajfel and Turner’s social identity theory [(1979). An Integrative Theory of Intergroup Conflict.’ In The Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations, edited by W. G. Austin, and S. Worchel, 33–37. Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole], with particular focus on in-group/out-group identity perceptions. The efficacy of the strategies used are discussed and recommendations for a community-based methodology for educational research is provided. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Transgender women from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are understudied, their coping strategies and struggles underrecognised. Aims: This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of transgender women from two major cities located in Brazil and India, LMICs with high rates of transphobia and gender-based violence. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods, exploratory study, including focus group discussions (FGDs) and brief survey interviews with 23 transgender women from Hyderabad, India and 12 transgender women from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Herein we present the combined (qualitative and quantitative) results related to discrimination, stigma, violence, and suicidality in transgender women’s lives. Results: Three major themes emerged from FGDs: stigma and discrimination; violence, and suicidality. Lack of education and working opportunities influence high levels of poverty and engagement in survival sex work by transgender women in both cities. Study participants live in large cities with more than 6 million inhabitants, but transgender women reported chronic social isolation. Participants disclosed frequent suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Brief surveys corroborate FGD findings, identifying high prevalence of discrimination, intimate partner violence, suicidality and low social support. Discussion: Multiple layers of stigma, discrimination, violence and social isolation affect transgender women’s quality of life in Hyderabad and Rio de Janeiro. Strategies sensitive to gender and culture should be implemented to tackle entrenched prejudice and social exclusion reported by transgender women. Additional social support strategies, better access to education and employment opportunities are also urgently needed. Improving the availability of evidence-based mental health interventions addressing the high prevalence of suicidality among transgender women from Hyderabad, India and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil should be prioritized. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of intergroup relations in light of Władysław Witwicki's cratism theory. His theory allows social relations to be explained in light of the pursuit for a sense of power, although this has never been verified in the psychological laboratory. Because the cratism theory is largely based on the analysis of social relations described in historical documents, this paper presents an attempt to use its basic assumptions to describe the linguistic behavior (and linguistic picture of the world) of a threatened group. The examined material consisted of religious documents of the first Christians, created before and during the growing conflict with an unfriendly/ antagonistic environment. Frequency analysis shows significant changes in the cratic orientation as well as emotions and the evaluation of the social world in conflict conditions. © 2020 Towarzystwo Naukowe Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego.

AB  - Background: Previous research has highlighted widespread public mis/perceptions that portray women with disabilities (WWDs) as asexual, less likely to marry, and often not interested in childbearing. However, evidence from high-income settings shows that many WWDs are sexually active and do have or want to have children. Notwithstanding this, very few studies have focused on understanding childbearing desires and motivations among WWDs in low-income settings. This qualitative research explored childbearing desires and motivations among WWDs in Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted with WWDs aged 18-49 years in Northern Ghana. The distribution of participants by disability types were as follows: Physical disability/impairment (n = 37); visual impairment (n = 11); speech and hearing impairment (n = 14); epilepsy (n = ten); and albinism (n = five). A pre-tested open-ended thematic topic guide was designed and used to conduct in-depth interviews. Interviews were tape-recorded and later transcribed for analysis. Transcripts were coded using QSR NVivo 11 software. Thematic content analysis techniques were used to analyse and present the data. Results: Nearly all the WWDs interviewed were sexually active, desiring to have children, and intended to have as many children as they could support. Strong desire to experience the joy of motherhood; fear of social insecurity; fear of old age economic insecurity; desire to challenge stigma and negative stereotypes about disability, sexuality and motherhood; and desire for self-actualisation, were key motivations for childbearing. Conclusion: Our findings challenge existing negative public perceptions about the status of WWDs in relation to sexuality, childbearing and motherhood. More importantly, our findings suggest that if the Sustainable Development Goals related to universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare are to be attained, WWDs must be targeted with quality sexual and reproductive healthcare information and services. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect the relationship among social, economic, and environmental aspects of society. Massive online open courses (MOOCs) represent an opportunity to promote lifelong learning (SDG 4), complementing university education or providing knowledge to society free and openly. The objective of this work is to analyze experiences in one MOOC about wastewater treatment applied to higher education in civil engineering (SDG 6). The proposed educational methodology and the achieved participation results are studied. The MOOC had three editions and was hosted on the Miríadax platform. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, initial motivation, and satisfaction level were collected from questionnaires. The results highlighted the importance of design decisions to obtain a high completion rate: defining a target audience, without prejudice to the course’s open character, where the prior knowledge of students is crucial. The teaching methodology is based on autonomous and progressive learning, with short and direct master classes, social support, with the motivation of students to continue their training with opening complementary topics in the forums, following up on their doubts, and their combination with social networks. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Besides having lower rates of technology adoption than the general population, older adults are commonly stereotyped as lacking technological ability. Stereotype threat, the fear of confirming negative stereotypes targeting their social group, may lead individuals to distance themselves from the stereotyped domain. This suggests that older adults may underuse computer technology due to stereotype threat. A sample of 86 community-dwelling older adults (Mage = 78.47, SDage = 7.92) participated in a two-wave longitudinal study aiming to examine the relationship between stereotype threat and computer use in this age group. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling. As expected, stereotype threat predicted lower levels of computer use a year and a half later. In turn, computer use was unrelated to the later experience of stereotype threat in this domain. These findings suggest that stereotype threat may undermine computer adoption in late adulthood, thus contributing to perpetuate the digital inequalities between younger and older generations. © Copyright © 2020 Mariano, Marques, Ramos, Gerardo and de Vries.

AB  - Background: HIV-related stigma, or the degree to which people living with HIV endorse negative stereotypes associated with HIV, is associated with poor continuum of care outcomes. We translated the 12-item Short HIV Stigma scale and evaluated its psychometric properties in a Brazilian context with regard to construct validity and reliability. Methods: The first step included translation, back-translation, evaluation, peer review, and pre-testing of the Short HIV Sigma scale developed by Reinius et al. (Health Qual Life Outcomes 15(1):115, 2017). The second step involved piloting the scale in three convenience samples of adults recruited online through advertisements on different platforms: Grindr (October/2019) and Hornet (February-March/2020), geospatial network apps for sexual encounters for gay, bisexuals and other men who have sex with men, and social media apps (Facebook and WhatsApp, October/2019). The psychometric evaluation included confirmatory factor analysis, differential item functioning using the Multiple-Indicator Multiple-Cause model, and correlations between subscale scores and antiretroviral treatment use and adherence. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and ordinal alpha and omega from the polychoric correlation matrix. Results: In total, 114, 164, and 1824 participants completed the measure items through Grindr, social media, and Hornet, respectively. We confirmed a 4-factor structure with factors for personalized stigma (3 items), disclosure concerns (3 items), concerns with public attitudes (3 items), and negative self-image (3 items). Small differential item functioning with respect to sample was found for one item ("I feel guilty because I have HIV"), which did not substantively influence estimates of latent factor scores. Grindr and Hornet's participants scored significantly higher than social media participants on all factors except personalized stigma. Higher subscale scores correlated with antiretroviral treatment use among participants from Hornet and with lower treatment adherence in participants from Grindr and Hornet. Reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha, ordinal alpha and omega were 0.83, 0.88 and 0.93 for the entire scale. Discussion: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the Short HIV Stigma scale had satisfactory psychometric properties with present results suggesting that scores from different samples may be compared without concern that measurement differences substantively influence results though further studies with greater representation of women and heterosexual men are warranted. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Worldwide, Brazil has the highest prevalence of violence and hate crimes against sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) among countries with available data. To explore the impact of this scenario, we conducted a qualitative study with 50 SGMs from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Among the participants, 66% screened positive for generalised anxiety disorder, 46% for major depressive disorder and 39% for PTSD. A third reported low self-esteem (32%) and one quarter low social support (26%). Experiences of interpersonal discrimination were highly prevalent ('60%), while institutional discrimination related to employment or healthcare was reported by 46% of participants. Verbal abuse is very common (80%), followed by physical assault (40%). Sexual violence is highly frequent among women. Focus groups analysis highlighted three major domains: (1) stigma and discrimination (family, friends and partners, in schools and health services, influencing social isolation); (2) violence (bullying, harassment, physical and sexual violence); and (3) mental suffering (alcohol and drug abuse, depression, suicidality, anxiety). Our findings suggest a close synergy between experiences of discrimination and violence with selected mental disorders. This complex synergy might be better addressed by longer-term individual and group-level interventions that could foster social solidarity among the different groups that comprise SGMs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In rural Southern Chile, native Mapuche families receive care mostly from non-indigenous clinicians. Parents and doctors alike orient to the importance of timely medical care, but clinical and communication norms also result in misunderstandings and tension. Parents find it hard to communicate about structural obstacles, and valued practices of care in families may conflict with normative expectations for timely presentation. Parents’ disclosures about the duration of their children’s illnesses can expose them to clinical censure, which in turn reinforces pernicious negative stereotypes about this racialized and marginalized community. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The paper explores how youth engagement (i.e. organised social participation in a group, club, or activity) can impact young people’s interethnic attitudes, via pathways of positive and negative interethnic contact. To do so, it examines processes of interethnic cohesion occurring on a large-scale, nationally-implemented UK youth engagement scheme. Employing a quasi-experimental approach, using pre-test/post-test data on a sample of participants and a (propensity-score matched) control-group, analyses demonstrate that participation leads to positive changes in young people’s interethnic attitudes, evident at least 4–6 months after participation ended. This improvement in attitudes is driven primarily by increases in young people’s positive interethnic contact, while participation has no impact on young people’s levels of negative interethnic contact. However, the impact of participation on interethnic attitudes depends on how much positive contact young people had prior to taking part: young people who joined the scheme with less frequent positive contact see substantially larger improvements in their levels of positive contact which, in turn, drives even greater improvements in their interethnic attitudes. These findings provide encouraging evidence that sites of youth engagement, especially national engagement schemes, can foster intergroup cohesion among adolescents; especially among those with less frequent positive contact in their daily lives. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This study describes the development of a violence prevention educational program for elementary school children using empathy (VPEP-E) that teachers can use during class. Methods: Hoffman's theory of empathy and Seels and Richey's (1994) ADDIE model were applied to develop this program. Results: The developed program consisted of eight sessions: "Orienta-tion/definition of violence and empathy", "Types and boundaries of violence", "Look into my feelings", "Say it with a facial expression", "Preventing non-empathic violence due to social prejudice", "Preventing physical violence", "Verbal and online violence prevention: empathic conversation", and "I can do well: review of the whole curriculum". The program was evaluated by 15 elementary school teachers, who considered it to be easily accessible to elementary school students. The final VPEP-E, which will be provided in eight times for 40 minutes each for fifth-grade students, will provide a basis for preventing violence by fostering empathy. Conclusion: We expect the developed educational program to be effective in preventing violence among elementary school students. However, further research involving children from various age groups is needed. © 2020 Korean Academy of Child Health Nursing. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Four decades of radical criticisms against eurocentrism in historical sociology manifest today through a side effect: the allergy to elaborate a more adequate method enabling global studies to cope with multiplex challenges coming from heterogeneous geohistorical as well as epistemological standpoints. To be sure, the task of placing new methodological cornerstones urges, even though it remains inexplicit. For it solicits automatic suspicion of neo-positivist «conspiracies» or «neo-colonialism» of knowledge whereas scrutinized from postcolonial, decolonial or post- Western perspectives. In turn, these same critical perspectives do not acknowledge their own inability to steam an appropriate methodology out of a pressing demand: struggling against the prejudice that the instances they express are in fact exclusively confined to provincial, exotic or solipsistic particularisms; therefore never as universalistic as the dominant ones. Here contradiction arises that calls for theoretical formulation in terms of methodological problem. The problem is enunciated as follows: how should research about large-scale/long-term processes of social change be conducted once agreed upon the world as a single yet multi-layered spacetime of analysis, in order to cope with the asymmetrical power relations that materialize colonial history through heterarchies of class, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, knowledge, cosmology and ecology? To answer this question, the paper herewith faces one major issue among the many this formulation raises: concept formation. The argument develops in four steps: formulating the limits of Eurocentrism in terms of methodological issues within the social sciences at large; unthinking conceptualization in historical sociology; exploring heuristic pathways in postcolonial and decolonial thinking; formalize six methodological directions toward a protocol of concept formation for global social sciences. © 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

AB  - Sugar eating is highly prejudiced by several social cultures, activities, biological and ecological factors which results to be the leading risk factor for dental caries as well as other oral diseases. A diet has a complete consequence on the veracity of the oral cavity that includes oral mucosa, alveolar bone, teeth,and periodontal tissue. It is ahead of our debate that the sugar-rich foods consumed can result ina risk on the integrity of our teeth. There is a direct impact on oral health because of the consumption of sugar. There has to be a noteworthy impact on serving to restrain the global outbreak of dental caries if we can reduce the amount of sugar consumption that has been extensively ignored compared to other health issues and is a foremost global public health problem distressing individuals, health systems as well as economies. This review article discusses the consumption of sugars, various forms of sugary diets in our daily intake, and its effect on oral health. © 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications.

AB  - Nowadays, movie streaming is ubiquitous amongst the younger population, and it is a supposed substitute for movie piracy. Without prejudice to the previous, reasons of various kinds may cause users to download their favorite movies illicitly. The objective of this study is to identify if movie streaming increases movie piracy. For this purpose, an online survey of potential users of movie streaming services was conducted in Chile. The sample was divided into students and not students, and logit models were used to analyze the data obtained. The results indicate that, on one hand, movie streamers are intentions to engage the download movie illegally, and on the other hand, peer pressure explains movie piracy among students. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent serious neurological diseases. It is unique, being the only severe and disabling neurological disease that is fully treatable in the majority of cases, but on the other hand, associated with stigma, prejudice and discriminatory practices, which negatively impact people's everyday life in important areas, such as access to education, employment, marriage and social integration. For centuries, people with epilepsy (PWE) were stigmatized in all societies, with the consequences of prejudice and discrimination adding to the medical burden of the disease. Myths and misconceptions about this disease still occur, mostly in low-resources settings, however, in many industrialized countries, the knowledge regarding epilepsy is still limited in the population. The stigma is perceived as a negative attribute that is undesirable for the community to which the individual belongs. PWE are intrinsically undervalued, both by themselves (“felt stigma”) and by the others. Actual discrimination by peers and institutions generates what is referred to as “enacted stigma”. Misconceptions, stigma and negative attitudes towards PWE dramatically decrease quality of life, affecting the most sensitive areas, such as marriage, employment and driving. The Resolution 68.28 of the World Health Assembly (2015), the WHO-ILAE-IBE Global Report “Epilepsy: a public health imperative”, advocates for strengthening and implementing national policies and legislation to promote and protect the rights of PWE, reducing misconceptions about epilepsy and improving access to care. Consolidated efforts are required from different organizations, public health managers, healthcare providers, PWE and their families to work together to improve socialization and quality of life of PWE. Educational programs and awareness to support activities among the general population, health service providers and PWE are the best way to reduce all types of stigma and discrimination. © 2020 Epileptic Disorders

AB  - The news sociology and news determinism perspectives do project both the integrationist and disintegrative capabilities of the media. This projection is premised on their agenda-setting tradition, meaning that the social responsibility performance credential of the reporter can help build a nation or be a factor of the collapse of social control. This work explores this oxymoron by examining terrorism reporting and how it impacts on ethnic relations among the three dominant regions in Nigeria. A total of 400 respondents from Southeast and Southwest Nigeria respond to seven items on their relationship with the Northern Region that has been affected by the activities of the terror group Boko Haram. The findings portray a violent nature of the Northern Region. However, they do not support six of the media-framed and widely-held assumptions by the southerners about the conflict, including the statement that the insurgents represent northerners' interest. The media can scale down ethnic tension by publishing and framing stories that promote de-escalation. © 2020, IGI Global.

AB  - Objective. To analyze pharmacy students’ views of societal stigmas often facing persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods. A 20-item survey conducted across a dual-campus school of pharmacy examined students’ approval of societal aspects of the lives of persons living with HIV. Pharmacy students anonymously exchanged completed survey instruments to learn about peers’ viewpoints. Survey instruments were analyzed and ranked by most commonly occurring responses and gender designations. Chi square tests were used for statistical analyses, with p<.05 considered significant. Results. Over three years, 260 female students and 104 male students (364 total) completed the survey. Approximately one fifth of the study sample stated that they did not have a problem placing their children (if applicable) in a daycare center with children who were living with HIV. Greater than one third of the students in the study sample were not opposed to placing their elderly parents (if applicable) in a facility that included residents living with HIV. Fewer female than male students had reservations about couples living with HIV being allowed to have children. Male students were less averse than female students to having their name and picture associated with HIV prevention on the internet. Conclusion. This study revealed that some pharmacy students held stigmatizing beliefs regarding persons living with HIV. The discriminatory views of participants in this study sample may directly or indirectly affect health outcomes of persons living with HIV. To better address health care chal-lenges within this community, Doctor of Pharmacy programs should provide sustainable opportunities for students to explore their own HIV biases and additional education about the difficulties that persons living with HIV encounter. © 2020 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

AB  - As educational institutions, Spanish universities today involve a diversity of subjects inhabiting them, which supports the imperative of turning schools into more inclusive communities. This study attempts a preliminary determination of the existence of racial and cultural prejudices and stereotyped beliefs about African immigrants in a sample of education students at the Autonomous University of Madrid. A quantitative, non-experimental, descriptive-exploratory study was performed with a sample of education students. Subtle and manifest racism scales and the scale of stereotyped beliefs about Africa and Africans were administered. The statistical analysis shows that people who identify with left-wing political ideologies have fewer stereotypes about Africa and less manifest and subtle racism, while people with right-wing or centre ideologies, or who argued that they do not identify with any ideology, revealed similar levels of subtle racism. The results of the study highlight the fact that education students have subtle and manifest prejudices, as well as stereotyped beliefs about African immigrants. © 2020 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between interpersonal/ intrapersonal mindfulness, contact anxiety, and attitudes toward students with visual impairments among certified adapted physical educators. Participants included 115 certified adapted physical educators who completed a 31-item online survey, composed of a 10-item demographic questionnaire, a 14-item mindfulness in teaching scale, a four-item intergroup anxiety scale, and a three-item attitude scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that intrapersonal mindfulness was a negative predictor of contact anxiety (β = −0.26, p = .007) and contact anxiety negatively predicted attitudes (β = −0.22, p = .02). A mediation analysis revealed that intrapersonal mindfulness had an indirect effect on attitudes through contact anxiety, b = 0.09, SE = 0.05, 95% confidence interval [0.006, 0.22]. Collectively, both intrapersonal and interpersonal mindfulness appear to be responsible for the formation of attitudes, but with different underlying processes involved. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Article 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities requires governments around the globe to raise awareness on issues of disability in their societies, com-batting stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices. Little comparative data is available on lay people’s social representations of intellectual disability and associated stigma, which could inform actions in line with the convention. The present study compared intellectual disability literacy and stigma among adults in the general population in the UK, Austria and Germany (N = 1046), and examined the effects of providing an intellectual disability label on these outcomes. Although participants came from highly developed European countries and prior contact with people with intellectual disabilities was common, the findings pointed to some striking differences between countries. Participants in Austria and Germany were much less likely than those in the UK to identify symptoms of a possible intellectual disability in an unlabelled vignette. They were also much more hostile towards social contact, a difference that was maintained when participants were informed of the intellectual disability label. Labelling showed controversial effects on stigma, both in its effects on social distance and on beliefs about suitable causes and interventions. Overall, the social acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities appears to be much less advanced in Austria and Germany than in the UK, and awareness of intellectual disability much lower, indicating a need for action at societal level.

AB  - Biases perpetuate when people think that they are innocent whereas others are guilty of biases. We examined whether people would detect biased thinking and behavior in others but not themselves as influenced by preexisting beliefs (myside bias) and social stigmas (social biases). The results of three large studies showed that, across demographic groups, participants attributed more biases to others than to themselves, and that this self-other asymmetry was particularly salient among those who hold strong beliefs about the existence of biases (Study 1 and Study 2). The self-other asymmetry in bias recognition dissipated when participants made simultaneous predictions about others' and their own thoughts and behaviors (Study 3). People thus exhibit bias in bias recognition, and this metacognitive bias may be remedied when it is highlighted to people that we are all susceptible to biasing influences. © 2020 Wang, Jeon.

AB  - Emergence of extremism in social networks is among the most appealing topics of opinion dynamics in computational sociophysics in recent decades. Most of the existing studies presume that the initial existence of certain groups of opinion extremities and the intrinsic stubbornness in individuals' characteristics are the key factors allowing the tenacity or even prevalence of such extreme opinions. We propose a modification to the consensus making in bounded-confidence models where two interacting individuals holding not so different opinions tend to reach a consensus by adopting an intermediate opinion of their previous ones. We show that if individuals make biased compromises, extremism may still arise without a need of an explicit classification of extremists and their associated characteristics. With such biased consensus making, several clusters of diversified opinions are gradually formed up in a general trend of shifting toward the extreme opinions close to the two ends of the opinion range, which may allow extremism communities to emerge and moderate views to be dwindled. Furthermore, we assume stronger compromise bias near opinion extremes. It is found that such a case allows moderate opinions a greater chance to survive compared to that of the case where the bias extent is universal across the opinion space. As to the extreme opinion holders' lower tolerances toward different opinions, which arguably may exist in many real-life social systems, they significantly decrease the size of extreme opinion communities rather than helping them to prevail. Brief discussions are presented on the significance and implications of these observations in real-life social systems. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - Objective Although previous studies have shown the linkage between pain sensitivity and pain-related cognitions, this study investigated whether individual variation in pain sensitivity is related to implicit negative bias toward pain. Methods Two groups of participants with low (LPS) or high (HPS) pain sensitivity (LPS group: N = 33; HPS group: N = 31) were recruited based on their scores on pain sensitivity questionnaires. This categorization was later confirmed via pain ratings to electrical stimulations. Implicit negative bias toward pain was assessed using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) involving target (pain and nonpain) and attribute (negative and neutral-affect) concept words. Behavioral and event-related potential responses for congruent and incongruent pairings during the IAT were compared between the LPS and HPS groups. Results Relative to the LPS group, participants in the HPS group exhibited greater D-score (Cohen's d = 0.364, p =.004). Event-related potential results showed that, although P3 amplitudes to congruent and incongruent pairings differed significantly for the HPS group (Cohen's d = 0.757, p <.001), this difference was not observed for the LPS group (Cohen's d = 0.089, p =.29). Mediation analysis further revealed that the IAT effect on P3 responses accounted for 17.58% of the association between pain sensitivity and D-score (confidence interval = [0.009-0.051]). Conclusions Individual variation in pain sensitivity relates to implicit negative bias. This linkage is partially accounted for by the electrophysiological response that has been related to cognitive process of stimulus evaluation and categorization. Pain treatment might benefit from techniques designed to alter implicit bias. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Purpose: People who stutter are susceptible to discrimination, stemming from negative stereotypes and social misattributions. There has been a recent push to evaluate the underlying explicit and implicit cognitive mechanisms associated with social judgments, moving away from only evaluating explicit social bias about people who stutter. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate how listeners change their implicit and explicit social (mis)attributions after hearing a people who stutter produce disfluent speech. Method: The current project was an adaptation of the Byrd et al. (2017) study to evaluate listener implicit/ explicit social judgments of stuttered speech across five categories (i.e., confidence, friendliness, intelligence, distractibility, and extroversion) before and after a stuttering self-disclosure. This was done by implementing a modified version of the Ferguson et al. (2019) computer mouse-tracking paradigm. Results: Consistent with previous findings, participants made more explicit positive social judgments of confidence, friendliness, extroversion, and intelligence after a stuttering self-disclosure, but the distractedness category was resistant to change. Also consistent with previous findings, participants experienced a higher degree of cognitive competition (i.e., higher area under the curve) shortly after self-disclosure, which lessened over time. Conclusions: Explicit and implicit biases exist, but selfdisclosure significantly impacts the cognitive system of listeners. Specifically, self-disclosure may reduce explicit bias through experience and explicit belief updating, but when cognitive heuristics are strong, implicit bias may be slower to change. © 2020 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

AB  - The use of humor may affect how bystanders respond to slurs. Undergraduates (N = 192) completed a measure of prejudice towards people with intellectual disabilities and were randomly assigned to read a scenario in which a peer uses a slur either as part of a joke (humor condition) or a statement (control condition). Participants responded to measures of intent to assertively respond and their evaluation of the speaker. Humor inhibited intent to nonverbally disagree and to verbally confront. Bystanders’ own prejudicial attitudes moderated the effects of humor on intent to verbally confront and negative evaluation. In the humor condition, compared to those with lower prejudice, those with higher prejudice showed less intent to confront and less negative evaluations. In the control condition, intent to confront, and negative evaluation were high, regardless of prejudice. These results suggest that humor inhibits assertive responses to slurs, particularly among people without highly favorable attitudes about the targeted social group. © 2020 De Gruyter Mouton.

AB  - As any other locality a road is a place with sense of road as place among people experiencing it. Roads in peripheral areas are a scarce social resource over which people compete. When a periphery is an internal ethnic frontier, competition between the local/Indigenous people and the settlers over accessibility/connectivity afforded by a road reflects not only hegemonic cultural and identity differences but also contradicting spatiality temporality and dimensionality related to sense of road as place. These mobility-related differences are a neglected area of ethnic relationships. We analyze Indigenous Bedouin's and Jewish settlers’ sense of Road 31 as place in Israel as an infrastructure for understanding ethnic relationships resulting from co-using it. We surface relationships at various times scales and spatial dimensions revealing the contrasting and dynamic dimensionality of mobility, accessibility regimes, and informal mobility emanating from both cultural and political ethnic relationships. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study uses data from consecutive England and Wales censuses to examine the intragenerational economic mobility of individuals with different ethnicities, religions and genders between 1971 and 2011, over time and across cohorts. The findings suggest more downward and less upward mobility among Black Caribbean, Indian Sikh and Muslim people with Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani ethnicities, relative to white British groups, and more positive relative progress among Indian Hindu people, but also some variation in the experiences of social mobility between individuals even in the same ethnic groups. For some groups, those becoming adults or migrating to the UK since 1971 occupy an improved position compared with older or longer resident people, but this is not universal. Findings suggest that these persistent inequalities will only be effectively addressed with attention to the structural factors which disadvantage particular ethnic and religious groups, and the specific ways in which these affect women. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Interracial interactions are occurring more frequently in virtual reality (VR) environments (e.g., multiplayer games, virtual classrooms, medical appointments). Individuals bring their biases and prejudices with them as they enter virtual spaces. Drawing from theories of real-world interracial interaction, predictable affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes undermine the quality of live interracial interactions. Emerging research using VR suggests that these same challenges occur in virtual social interactions. These challenges can be addressed using evidence-based best practices and policy recommendations: Improving racial/ethnic representation in VR, regulating codes of conduct, ensuring transparency about privacy/consent, and reducing explicit and implicit racist behavior. Following these recommendations can improve VR interracial contact and, in turn, real-world interracial interactions. While VR can serve as a unique tool to bring people together, carefully considered policies must mitigate the negative effects of racial bias that can hinder the progress of improved interracial interactions. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Police killings of unarmed African Americans, such as George Floyd in 2020, continue to cause nationwide protests and calls for change. Psychological science knows much about biased policing and can inform policy to promote equitable policing. Social psychology’s extensive findings on stereotyping, attitudes, and intergroup relations help clarify the role of officer racial bias. This article reviews implicit and explicit bias, race-crime stereotypes, intragroup bias, ingroup favoritism, stereotype threat, and dehumanization in policing interactions, all of which can lead to racially disparate use of force. Based on this science, some policy responses can mitigate bias: Officer level de-biasing training, body-worn cameras, automatic license plate readers, and federal policing reform legislation are discussed. The lack of a coordinated, national effort to collect and analyze police use of force data undermines tracking fatal incidents and bias therein, which are therefore harder to remediate. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Despite recent strides toward equality in the United States, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people continue to report experiences of sexual stigma and psychological and physical health problems. This article reviews empirical evidence of sexual stigma and sexual orientation-based health disparities. The current framework proposes that sexual orientation does not cause health disparities; homophobic individuals and societies do. Social psychology, recognizing the power of the situation, suggests that changing the stigmatizing environments for LGBTQ people can effectively reduce health disparities. The science has policy implications—notably, for audiences at three levels (intraindividual, interpersonal, and institutional)—and provides recommendations for mitigating sexual stigma and improving health. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background Compared to White and high socioeconomic status (SES) patients, Black and low SES patients receive less adequate pain care. Providers may contribute to these disparities by making biased decisions that are driven, in part, by their attitudes about race and SES. Purpose We examined the effects of patient race and SES on providers' chronic pain decisions and the extent to which providers' implicit and explicit attitudes about race and SES were related to these decisions. Methods Physician residents/fellows (n = 436) made pain care decisions for 12 computer-simulated patients with chronic back pain that varied by race (Black/White) and SES (low/high). Physicians also completed measures assessing implicit and explicit attitudes about race and SES. Results There were three significant race-by-SES interactions: (a) For high SES patients, Black (vs. White) patients were rated as having more pain interference; the opposite race difference emerged for low SES patients. (b) For high SES patients, Black (vs. White) patients were rated as being in greater distress; no race difference emerged for low SES patients. (c) For low SES patients, White (vs. Black) patients were more likely to be recommended workplace accommodations; no race difference emerged for high SES patients. Additionally, providers were more likely to recommend opioids to Black (vs. White) and low (vs. high) SES patients, and were more likely to use opioid contracts with low (vs. high) SES patients. Providers' implicit and explicit attitudes predicted some, but not all, of their pain-related ratings. Conclusion These results highlight the need to further examine the effects of patient race and SES simultaneously in the context of pain care. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2020.

AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019-June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3,300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The research aimed to identify managers’ conceptions of disability and the relationship that was established between these conceptions and their perception of the persons with disabilities (PWD) performance, bond, benefits of hiring, and training needs. 257 managers answered a questionnaire in order to identify conceptions of disability in organizations. Descriptive statistics, factorial analysis, and hierarchical analysis of grouping were performed while using IBM Statistic 20.0.0. The results show that managers who have the spiritual and the conception based on inclusion perceive the insertion of PWD as beneficial to the organization. Those who conceive disability as a question of normality perceive the PWD performance as inferior to those without disabilities, which implies that PWDs should be segregated; and, the managers who perceive disability as a social problem are likely to place PWDs in the workplace according to their potential. The results can be fruitfully used by managers, human resources’ professionals, academics, and the society to promote inclusion. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The reception and study of pre-Conquest legal texts can never be fully disentangled from the historical and political contexts within which they transpired. Indeed, the historiography of early English law has been shaped as much by the desires, prejudices and ideological commitments of its historians as it has by the texts themselves. Modern scholarship has not ‘risen above’ its predecessors but is instead guided (and at times governed) by the history of the laws' reception from the post-Conquest period onwards. The boundaries of the Old English legal corpus are far more fluid than often recognized and its survival has been determined by political forces and social trends that reshaped and recontextualized it in ways that those involved in its composition may not have intended or even understood. To better understand how the modern study of Anglo-Saxon legal culture has been and continues to be shaped by these influences, this article first outlines a brief history of the reception of early English legal texts from the Conquest onwards before turning to a review of the major themes and trends in contemporary scholarship. As will become apparent, for modern scholars, the interpretation of legal records, the historical narrative they appear to construct and even the parameters of the corpus itself have all been shaped by the nostalgia, biases and scholarly priorities of their predecessors. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Members of stereotyped groups are vigilant to situational cues signaling threats to their social identity. In one psychophysiological experiment, we examined whether mere exposure to a watching male face would increase attentional vigilance among female STEM students due to the activation of math-gender stereotypes. Male and female students performed an alleged math intelligence task while being primed with male faces or control images. Automatic responses to errors were captured with error-related negativity (ERN), a neural index of error vigilance. Women showed larger ERN upon making errors when primed with male faces compared to control images, whereas no such priming effect occurred among men. Moreover, this face priming effect was pronounced only among women highly invested in pursuing STEM careers. These findings suggest that minimalistic social cues may activate negative stereotypes early in informational processing, thereby selectively shunting attention on errors in stereotype-relevant tasks among individuals invested in the performance domain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a worldwide problem associated with severe health risks. In the UK, preventative public health campaigns have been developed to eradicate FGM. The aim of the present study was to elicit the views about FGM public health campaigns from the perspective of a UK Somali community. Study design: Three focus groups and one interview were conducted with 16 community members. Methods: Using posters and leaflets focused on UK FGM prevention, photo-elicitation was used to encourage participants to discuss the usefulness and implications for national public health messages aimed at eradicating FGM. Data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis. Results: Participants were positive about the aims of the campaigns presented within the research, believing such campaigns were necessary and increased awareness of FGM. However, participants felt the campaigns also carried risks of enhancing stereotypes in terms of ethnicity, gender and religion. For example, some images were perceived to suggest that FGM was only relevant to Sub-Saharan women, although it is also prevalent in other populations. Some fathers reported feeling unfairly targeted in campaigns that focused on the role of mothers in protecting daughters from FGM. Participants were also concerned that some poster images may suggest that FGM was associated with Islam and perceived as a religious issue, rather than a cultural one. Fears were identified that this could lead to stigmatisation and hostility towards those affected. Conclusions: The research findings suggested that actively working with affected communities to develop messaging that counters negative stereotyping and associated hostility should be a priority. © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Introduction: Jim Crow laws in the United States promoted racial prejudice, which may have reduced social capital. Our study tests the relationship between Jim Crow laws and social capital. Methods: We conducted 3-level multilevel hierarchical modeling to study differences in the stock of social capital for 1997, 2005, 2009 in Jim Crow states compared to states without Jim Crow laws. We examined the moderation effects of county level median income, percent Black and percent with high school education and Jim Crow laws on social capital. Results: Jim Crow laws significantly reduced stock of social capital across 1997, 2005, 2009. The model was robust to the inclusion of random county, states, time and fixed county and state level covariates for median income, percent Black and percent with high school education. The largest percent of between state variations explained for fixed variables was from the addition of Jim Crow laws with 2.86%. These results demonstrate that although Jim Crow laws were abolished in 1965, the effects of racial segregation appear to persist through lower social connectiveness, community and trust. A positive moderation effect was seen for median income and percent Black with Jim Crow laws on social capital. Discussion: Our study supports a negative association between Jim Crow laws and reduction in the stock of social capital. This may be attributed to the fracturing of trust, reciprocity and collective action produced by legal racial segregation. Findings from this study offer insight on the potential impacts of historical policies on the social structure of a community. Future research is necessary to further identify the mechanistic pathways and develop interventions to improve social capital. © 2020

AB  - Neuroscientific evidence identifies the brain networks and cognitive processes involved in people’s thoughts and feelings about their behavior. This helps individuals understand the judgments and decisions they make with regard to their own and others’ moral and immoral behavior. This article complements prior reviews by focusing on the social origins of everyday moral and immoral behavior and reviewing neuroscientific research findings related to social conformity, categorization, and identification to demonstrate (a) when people are motivated by social norms of others to follow particular moral guidelines, (b) what prevents people from considering the moral implications of their actions for others, and (c) how people process feedback they receive from others about the appropriateness of their behavior. Revealing the neural mechanisms involved in the social processes that influence the moral and immoral behaviors people display helps researchers understand why and when different types of interventions aiming to regulate moral behavior are likely to be successful or unsuccessful. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Aims: Diabetes stigma and weight stigma have been identified as important but neglected issues that warrant attention among people with type 2 diabetes. This study assessed associations of diabetes stigma and weight stigma with diabetes self-care behaviors and health care in adults with type 2 diabetes. Methods: U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes (N = 1,227) completed self-report questionnaires to assess their experiences of weight stigma, diabetes stigma, diabetes self-management, diabetes-specific distress, healthcare utilization, perceptions of diabetes-specific health care. They also provided sociodemographic information. Linear regressions examined relationships among stigma and diabetes self-care and related health care, controlling for participants’ age, education, income, gender, race/ethnicity, and body mass index. Results: Internalized weight stigma and diabetes self-stigma were both significantly associated with higher diabetes-specific distress. Adults who expressed self-stigma for their diabetes reported less diabetes self-management and lower self-efficacy, and those who reported being judged about their weight by a doctor exhibited greater diabetes-specific distress. While a history of experienced weight stigma (in general) did not reduce frequency of seeking health care, lower quality interactions with health care professionals were reported by adults who expressed diabetes self-stigma and those who experienced weight stigma from a doctor. Conclusions: Self-stigma for diabetes and body weight, as well as experiencing judgment about weight from doctors, may have negative implications for diabetes-specific self-care behaviors and perceived quality of health care. Efforts to promote wellbeing in individuals with type 2 diabetes need to consider reducing both diabetes and weight stigma and their potentially harmful consequences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous research has found that gender-atypical males are evaluated more negatively than gender-atypical females. According to the sexual orientation hypothesis, this asymmetry in evaluations occurs because the feminine characteristics taken on by males when they violate gender roles are more closely tied to perceived sexual orientation than are the masculine characteristics of gender-atypical females. The current series of studies were designed to confirm the existence and generality of the asymmetry phenomenon (Study 1), the preconditions for testing the sexual orientation hypothesis (Study 2), and then to test the hypothesis itself (Study 3). Study 1 found that, as predicted, adults (N = 195, females = 97) displayed more intolerance of males than of females committing gender-role violations across a wide variety of characteristics within multiple domains, although the existence of asymmetry varied somewhat depending on the domain. Study 2 revealed that, as predicted, adults (N = 196, females = 117) believed that gender-role violations indicate homosexuality more so for males than for females overall and across all four domains studied (occupation, activity, trait, and appearance). Study 3 directly tested the sexual orientation hypotheses by examining the relationship between intolerance of specific gender-role violations (scores from Study 1) and the perceived homosexuality associated with those violations (scores from Study 2). Overall, there was a positive relationship between intolerance and perceived homosexuality, indicating that the more a given gender-role violation is thought to implicate homosexuality, the more negatively/less positively people tend to react to the violation, consistent with the sexual orientation hypothesis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In Western society, there has been a history of perceiving adolescence as a time of “storm and stress,” during which youth may go through heightened negative experiences such as conflict with parents, disengagement from school, and emotional dysfunction. Despite increasing attention to positive youth development, such negative stereotypes of adolescence may be held by youth themselves, which undermine their behavioral and neural development. However, youth’s stereotypes of teen emotionality in particular (i.e., beliefs that teens typically experience greater emotionality than younger children) and the role of such stereotypes in youth’s emotional functioning have not been examined. This longitudinal study investigated the reciprocal relations between youth’s negative stereotypes of teen emotionality and their emotional functioning (i.e., emotional expressivity and emotion regulation) in Hong Kong and Mainland China, two regions in China sharing Chinese cultural traditions but differing in the extent of exposure to Western influence (N = 1269; 55% girls; M age = 12.86 years). Although youth in Hong Kong saw the teen years as a time of heightened emotionality more than did their counterparts in Mainland China, such stereotypes predicted youth’s greater emotional expressivity and less emotion regulation over the 7th grade in both regions. Moreover, in both regions, youth’s negative expressivity reciprocally predicted their stronger stereotypes of teen emotionality over time. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the role of youth’s stereotypes of teen emotionality in shaping their emotional expressivity and emotion regulation during early adolescence, and also the role of youth’s negative expressivity in reinforcing their stereotypes. Moreover, these findings highlight the relevance of the Western-popularized perception of adolescence as a time of “storm and stress” in non-Western regions in a world of increasing globalization and societal change. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Why do some heterosexual people react in a negative manner when pondering or experiencing romantic or sexual overtures from persons of their same-sex, whereas other heterosexual people react more positively? To answer this question, this cross-sectional, correlational study examined individual difference predictors of heterosexual people’s responses to romantic or sexual overtures from same-sex persons. Our sample comprised 306 men and 307 women, ages 18–35 years, who were recruited from Mechanical Turk and identified as cisgender and heterosexual. Our hypotheses were premised on the theoretical construct of reactive group distinctiveness. Specifically, we explored predictors of heterosexual individuals’ negative perceptions of same-sex overtures. We found that more negative reactions to same-sex overtures were uniquely predicted by old-fashioned sexual prejudice, modern sexual prejudice, and desire to be perceived as gender conforming, via the mediators of social distance from same-sex sexual minority individuals and desire to be perceived as heterosexual. Gender moderated these relationships inconsistently. These findings indicate that two classes of individual differences—sexual prejudice and gender conforming reputation desire—are uniquely associated with heterosexual persons’ reactions to overtures from same-sex persons. We explain how these findings evidence the process of reactive group distinctiveness. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study explored workplace social networks in order to understand practices of inclusion and exclusion in the context of an increasingly diverse workplace in post-apartheid South Africa. We found that the ways in which space is occupied shows marked continuities with the era of formalised segregation during the preceding periods of colonialism and apartheid. We contend that intergroup relations theory and homophily assist in providing a partial understanding of the pervasive microsegregation observed within a South African organisation. We offer that a historied account of the continuing race-based accounts of microsegregation is more productive for understanding this phenomenon in a country with a past that formalised segregation across all areas of social life. We explore the meanings that people assign to segregation patterns within the workplace based on data emerging out of 54 interviews, nine naturalistic observations and a group discussion conducted within the headquarters of a major bank in Johannesburg. Discourses of linguistic and cultural differences were used to rationalise segregation and naturalise racialised differences. The material effects of segregation were noted to be particularly onerous for Black bankers. As a capitalist class, we however found that Black bankers resist, adapt, subvert and reinscribe power relations in ways that simultaneously serve their interests while also potentially limiting their opportunities. We point to the agentic aspects of social networks for marginalised groups and contend that representation is not sufficient to ensure inclusion. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) adolescents are at increased risk of poor mental health due to minority stress, a chronic stress associated discrimination, social rejection, and victimization brought on by prejudicial attitudes towards LGBQ individuals. To improve understanding of the differential impact of various kinds of victimization on mental health outcomes for LGBQ adolescents, we analyzed data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) for victimization and mental health symptom clusters and associations high school youth and compared by sexual orientation and gender. METHODS: Separate Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify profiles of both victimization and mental health symptoms for participants (N = 15,624). Subsequently, stratified weighted logistic regression models were used on an eligible analytic sample of 11,458 to assess differences in the association of victimization and mental health between LGBQ and heterosexual high school students. RESULTS: In each LCA, participants were assigned to one of 3 classes for victimization (minimal, 81.3%; bullying, 12.5%; or physical/sexual violence, 6.2%) and 1 of 2 classes for mental health symptoms (minimal, 81.2%; severe, 18.8%). LGBQ participants were overrepresented in physical/sexual violence and bullying victimization profiles. Both bullying and physical/sexual violence profiles were associated with almost 5 times the odds of endorsing severe mental health symptoms. Conclusions: This study expands our understanding of the relationship between types and effect of peer victimization for LGBQ and heterosexual youth with implications for school health and prevention efforts through increased positive school climate for LGBQ students. © 2020, American School Health Association

AB  - Purpose: The goal of the research was to describe discrimination, both actual and perceived, that has occurred against younger individuals with cancer (i.e., 35 years of age and under) in comparison with older individuals with cancer (i.e., over age 35) through analysis of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Integrated Mission System (IMS) database. Methods: An ex post facto, causal comparative quantitative design was used to examine Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) Title I complaints received by the EEOC from younger people with cancer from 2009 through 2016 (n = 1001) in comparison with older people with cancer over the same time period (n = 8874). Results: Results revealed statistically significant differences in the patterns of issues alleged by the two groups. When compared with older charging parties with cancer, the younger charging parties with cancer had proportionally more individuals who were male and who identified as African American and proportionally fewer individuals who identified as Caucasian. Conclusions: Younger people with cancer were more likely to allege discrimination in the areas of promotion, training, reinstatement, and referrals to other employers. They were less likely to allege discrimination in the area of benefits. The younger group was also significantly less likely than the older group to find that EEOC investigations of their allegations resulted in merit-based case resolutions, that is, discrimination had indeed occurred. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Psychosocial programs and vocational programming assisting young adults with career development should focus on the types of discrimination that young adults experience, which is unique compared with older adult cancer survivors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - What impact do advantaged group allies have within social movements? Although solidarity between advantaged and disadvantaged group members is often encouraged to achieve long-term social change, allies run the risk of being ineffective or counterproductive, therefore making it important to shift our focus towards understanding the impact of allies. We propose an integrative theoretical framework describing the positive and negative impact of allies based on their distinct identity-based needs: advantaged group members’ need for moral acceptance and disadvantaged group members’ need for empowerment and respect. By consolidating extant literature and identifying gaps in prior research, we propose a set of hypotheses concerning (a) tensions that arise within intergroup solidarity efforts for social change between advantaged group allies and disadvantaged group members, and (b) the role of allies in influencing broader public opinion to advance the psychology of social change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The present study examined the effectiveness of a novel 6-session, prejudice-reduction group for Greek preadolescents. The sample consisted of 106 elementary school students aged 10–12 years, allocated to the intervention (n = 55) or control group (n = 51). Results indicated that, compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group showed more positive attitudes toward refugees as well as an increase in their general capacity for empathy. In addition, intervention group participants showed more tolerance and less xenophobia. Practical implications for the design and implementation of classroom-based, prejudice-reduction programs for older children are discussed. © 2020 ASGW.

AB  - Terman’s study was the first to systematically document the lives of the intellectually gifted. This cross-sectional study replicates and extends some of Terman’s findings on characteristics of the gifted in childhood, comparing largely unselected samples of gifted (n = 50) and average-ability (n = 50) adolescents matched by means of propensity score matching. Students were compared on their school performance (standardized math and reading tests and grades), motivation (math ability self-concept, intrinsic motivation, vocational interests, and educational aspirations), parental educational expectations, students’ evaluation of school instruction (perceived quality and pressure), and subjective well-being. The gifted scored higher on math performance (rank-biserial r =.66/.81), math ability self-concept (.71), intrinsic motivation (.62), and investigative vocational interests (.65). Some smaller differences were found for realistic (.42) and social interests (–.37) and for pressure in math lessons (–.52). Results support Terman’s findings on gifted individuals’ psychological functioning and contradict negative stereotypes about the gifted. © 2020 National Association for Gifted Children.

AB  - Given the long history and pervasive nature of racism in medical culture, this essay argues that diversifying efforts alone cannot address systemic racism in medical education. Positive affirmation of anti-racist values and racial consciousness in the admissions process is necessary to create a truly inclusive culture in medical education and begin to undo centuries of racial prejudice in medicine. Drawing from historic examples, scholarship on the sociology of racialized space, recent research on race and medical education, and personal experience, we propose that medical educational institutions make a more concerted effort to consider racial attitudes and awareness as part of the admissions process as well as curricular reform efforts. We also provide examples of potential ways to practically implement this proposal in the admissions process. © 2020, Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Republican or Democrat participants imagined how they would respond upon learning about the political group membership of a potential or established friend. Four vignettes (friend political in-group; friend political out-group; potential friend political in-group; potential friend political out-group) were presented in a random order. After each, participants provided expected reactions. Overall, reactions (e.g., hope of the relationship lasting, intentions to engage in friendship maintenance behaviors, trust) were most positive toward the established in-group friend, followed by potential in-group friend, then the established out-group friend, and lastly the potential out-group friend. That is, participants expected to be more positive toward a person they just met than an established close friend, simply due to knowing these individuals’ political group memberships. Some of these differences were moderated by intergroup attitudes or political identification. Discoveries of political group membership may influence the development or maintenance of friendships. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The ability to deceive others is an early-emerging and socially complex skill, but relatively little is known about when and how a social partner's identity affects young children's willingness to lie. To understand how group membership affects children's lying, we used a minimal group paradigm to examine children's willingness to deceive in-group and out-group members across varied contexts that systematically varied in their costs and benefits. A total of 69 children aged 4 to 7 years played three versions of a sticker-hiding game: a Self-Benefit scenario (child could lie for personal gain), an Other-Benefit scenario (child could lie to help someone else), and a No-Benefit scenario (child could lie to spite someone else). Children lied the most in the Self-Benefit scenario, lying equally to in-group and out-group members in this context. When the potential for self-gain disappeared, however, in-group bias emerged. In the Other-Benefit scenario, children lied more to out-group members in order to help in-group members. Even when the potential to help another was removed (the No-Benefit scenario), children still engaged in more lie telling to out-group members. Results suggest that children's lying is sensitive to group membership, but only in certain social situations, as children's desire to benefit themselves may outweigh in-group bias. Future research should examine alternate contexts, such as lying to avoid punishment, to determine when group membership is most salient. Overall, results indicate that young children are able to flexibly apply a complex social cognitive skill based on group membership and contextual demands, with implications for social behavior and intergroup relations throughout development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A central question in the growing field of intraminority relations is how best to promote solidarity among marginalized groups. The current article reviews existing social psychological theories of intraminority relations, with a focus on barriers to, and facilitators of, intraminority solidarity. In particular, we explore the roles of competition and identity threats in eroding solidarity, and examine how similarity perceptions, a common identity of stigma, and structural and historical attributions generate solidarity. We then suggest that critical consciousness, a theory of sociopolitical development prominent in the developmental and community psychology literatures, can integrate disparate findings and extend our understanding of solidarity among marginalized groups. Borrowing from the critical consciousness literature, we outline new theoretical predictions for fostering intraminority solidarity. This exploration furthers existing theoretical work on intraminority solidarity and intergroup relations more broadly. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Living in a diverse world requires the ability to navigate intergroup contexts. However, interacting with outgroup members can cause anxiety that leads to lower-quality interactions and avoidance of future contact. One reason people experience this anxiety is the concern that others will judge them on the basis of an identity. These concerns may be reduced among people who believe the identity is unperceivable by others. The belief that one's identity is concealable may therefore reduce intergroup anxiety and ease people's experiences in intergroup contexts. The present work tests this proposition in two studies and finds that individual differences in concealability beliefs are negatively associated with intergroup anxiety and positively associated with the propensity to initiate intergroup contact and with the quantity and quality of people's cross-group friendships. Materials, data, and code for both studies and a pre-registration for Study 2 are available online (https://osf.io/4cjhg/). © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We conducted a qualitative study aiming to understand the process of diagnosis disclosure in a group of HIV-infected adolescents/young adults, aware of their serological ‘status’, and among their caretakers, as well as its possible consequences. Data collection were carried out through semi-structured interviews with 40 adolescents/young adults, and with the caretakers of the patients under 18 years old, in a referral hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. Results signalized that the HIV diagnosis disclosure was made usually by a close relative. Most of the adolescents/young adults claimed that they feel ‘normal’, despite the difficulties in sharing the diagnosis outside the family, and report feelings of rejection and social prejudice. The caretakers’ points of view coincided with the adolescents’ observations. We suggest that the diagnosis disclosure should not be postponed, since patients who underwent an adequate process of disclosure may more likely complied to treatment and experienced a better social insertion. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Structural balance theory is a foundational theory of social network research. Despite enduring interest in seeking network evidence for the theory, the fundamental question of why people care about structural (im)balance has received relatively little attention. The original answer to the question, dating back to Heider's work six decades ago, is that structural imbalance causes a person to experience cognitive dissonance and sentimental disturbance. In this paper, we used a state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique to test the argument. Our study shows that individuals’ psychological states, evidenced by the activation of brain areas, are different when they are situated in unbalanced rather than balanced triads. More specifically, the differences in the brain activation between triadic imbalance and balance were found in brain regions known for processing cognitive dissonance, as discovered by previous research. Our study provides novel brain evidence in support of Heider's original account for the psychological and biological foundations of structural balance theory in the formation of social networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For nearly 75 years, scholars of American public opinion have sought to measure whites' attitudes toward blacks: social scientists have invented and revised ways to measure what we could refer to as racial prejudice. With each revision, scholars who believe they have captured new forms of racial animus are met with opposition from those who believe that old-fashioned anti-black affect is a thing of the past. We directly answer these claims by collecting a surfeit of attitudinal measures to simultaneously estimate the relationship between cognitive beliefs about the racial status quo and emotional reactions to racism. First, we uncover that two higher-order dimensions undergird whites' racial attitudes. Second, we validate a four-item version of our new battery using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. © 2020 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three studies (N1 = 1,019; N2 = 312; N3 = 494) tested whether seeing intergroup relations as inherently antagonistic shaped advantaged social groups’ allyship intentions. More specifically, we tested whether endorsing zero-sum beliefs related to their willingness to support system-challenging and system-supporting collective action. Zero-sum beliefs were negatively correlated with system-challenging and positively correlated with system-supporting collective action intentions. Zero-sum beliefs were more common among advantaged than disadvantaged groups and translated into lower allyship intentions. Advantaged group members with higher levels of zero-sum beliefs were also more likely to experience anger and fear when considering the demographic racial shift in the United States. Increased fear was associated with greater support for system-supporting and lower support for system-challenging collective action. We find consistent evidence that advantaged group members see intergroup relations as a zero-sum game and that these beliefs are negatively related to their intentions to become allies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We study the behaviour of individuals with different geographic origins interacting in a same public good game. We exploit the peculiar composition of the experimental sample to compare the performance of groups where individuals have mixed origins to homogeneous groups. We find that, despite the absence of any geographic framing, mixed groups exhibit significantly lower contributions. We also find that cooperation levels differ significantly across geographic origins, in line with the existing literature. This is explained by a different impact of coordination opportunities, such as communication, as we show by manipulating them. Our results point towards integration as a crucial aspect for the economic development of intercultural societies. They also confirm that, rather than being explained just by the differences in institutions and economic opportunities, the Italian North–South divide embeds elements of distrust, prejudice and a consequent path dependence in the level of social capital © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Many individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and with other non-heterosexual orientations (LGBQ+) experience stigma, prejudice, and/or discrimination because of their sexuality. According to minority stress and identity development theories, these experiences can contribute to difficulties with self-acceptance of sexuality. Lower self-acceptance is considered a risk factor for adverse mental health outcomes. The current review aims to investigate whether self-acceptance of sexuality is associated with minority stressors or difficulties with mental health in LGBQ+ individuals, as well as whether there are differences in self-acceptance between different sexual orientations. Five bibliographic databases were searched. Thirteen studies were identified which used quantitative methodology to investigate associations between self-acceptance, minority stressors, and/or mental health within LGBQ+ samples, or differences in self-acceptance between different sexual orientations. The results from these cross-sectional studies suggested that lower self-acceptance of sexuality was associated with higher levels of self-reported minority stressors, including a lack of acceptance from friends and family, a lack of disclosure to others, and internalized heterosexism. Lower self-acceptance of sexuality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes, including greater global distress, depression symptoms, and lower psychological well-being. There was no significant relationship with suicidality. Studies also found that LGBQ+ individuals had lower general self-acceptance compared to heterosexual participants, bisexual individuals had lower sexuality self-acceptance compared to lesbian/gay individuals, and lesbian women had lower sexuality self-acceptance compared to gay men. Given the potential importance of self-acceptance for LGBQ+ populations, further research is required with more robust methodology. Self-acceptance could be a potential target in clinical interventions for LGBQ+ individuals. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the last decade, socio-spatial segregation of different population groups in activity spaces has attracted considerable attention from geographers and sociologists. A careful examination of such activity-space segregation can provide a more comprehensive description of dynamic intergroup relations in society than conventional residential segregation, as its measurement is not limited to a particular place. However, the evaluation of activity-space segregation is a challenging task because it requires the manipulation of large spatiotemporal data sets. The lack of software tools that can assist researchers in exploring and analyzing individuals’ travel trajectories is one of the significant impediments to empirical studies. To address this practical limitation, this article proposes a combined use of two R packages, namely, slice and seg: the former provides tools for storing and manipulating activity-space data, and the latter implements several existing measures of segregation that can be applied to various social places. The proposed approach is applied to the measurement of activity-space segregation between high- and low-income groups in Seoul to illustrate the key features of the packages. The results demonstrate that the use of these packages would make it more convenient to conduct activity-space segregation research and enhance our understanding of the complex socio-spatial phenomenon. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Aim: This study was aimed at describing Norwegian women's motivations and preparations for freebirth. Methods: This qualitative study involved 12 individual interviews conducted face to face or via Skype with women from different parts of Norway. The material was analysed using qualitative content analysis inspired by Graneheim and Lundman. Results: Three categories describing the women's motivations and preparations for freebirth were identified. Unsatisfied with the care offered today described how the women thought that hospitals did not support normal birth and made an inadequate homebirth offer. The category earlier uncomplicated and traumatic births influence freebirth choices described two different dimensions of motivations for freebirth. Trust in one's own knowledge and capacity referred to how women viewed birth as a natural process, their faith in themselves, how this view and faith influenced their preparation and how they gained knowledge about the birth process to prepare. An overall theme emerged: deep trust in birth as a natural process and the women's own capacity to give birth embedded in distrust of the maternity care system. Conclusion: This study showed that motivations for freebirth were embedded in overall dissatisfaction with today's maternity care, the inadequate homebirth offer and deep trust in the women's own capacity to give birth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The devaluing of femininity is a social problem with serious consequences. Violence against women, men, transgender people, and racial minorities is often exacerbated when elements of femmephobia are present. Femmephobia refers to the devaluation and regulation of femininity and suggests a separate, perhaps overlapping, phenomenon specific to gender (e.g., femininity), rather than gender/sex (e.g., woman) or sex (e.g., female). Yet, despite growing evidence warranting the consideration of femmephobia, little research has considered femininity as an intersectional axis. Femmephobia has been examined in a fractured manner, isolating its various manifestations in specific, rather than overarching ways. The current paper explored how these systems are interrelated and argues that sources of oppression underlying many forms of violence today (e.g., anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes, Incel attacks, sexual violence, transgender murders) are all symptoms of the same underlying social prejudice: femmephobia. While sexism, transphobia, homophobia, and racism also play a role, previous research tends to overlook or conflate the role of femmephobia in fueling prejudice and violence. Using in-depth interviews and thematic analysis, the current paper explored the intersecting role of femmephobia in experiences of oppression among sexual and gender minorities (N = 38). Two thematic networks are presented. The first network pertains to masculine themes: masculine privilege, masculinity as protective, and masculinity as the norm. The second network pertains to femininity: feminine inferiority, femininity as target, and femininity as inauthentic. The connection between these two thematic networks illustrates the symbiotic relationship between femmephobia and the gender binary. Finally, patterns identified from the thematic analysis were used to generate a model of femmephobia. This paper suggests that the gender binary is not merely a division; it is also hierarchical and regulated by femmephobia. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article analyzes the impact of socio-cultural integration on migrants’ intention to return to their country of origin. It distinguishes between the potential effects of inter-ethnic relations, language proficiency and perception of discrimination as components of integration. It uses individual-level data collected through an original survey among Romanian migrants in January 2018. It aims to test the effects of socio-cultural integration against those of alternative explanations provided in the literature. The findings indicate that the perception of discrimination, assessment of public institutions’ performance and belonging feelings are important predictors for return intentions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Allport’s intergroup contact theory outlines four conditions for effective contact: equal status between participants within the contact situation, cooperation, common goals and institutional support. While the literature indicates that institutional support may be a particularly important condition for effective contact, its role and impact remain under-researched, particularly in studies of contact within real-world contexts. This article seeks to address this gap through a study of institutional support within a school-based contact initiative operating in two countries, Northern Ireland and North Macedonia. Known as ‘shared education’, this promotes inter-school collaboration as a means of fostering contact between pupils from different ethnic or religious backgrounds. Adopting a qualitative approach and using data collected through interviews with staff involved in four shared education projects, this study explores three aspects: the extent to which shared education demonstrates support for contact; the factors that encourage or impede supportive contact norms; and the relationship between the norms of the school and those of other authorities, particularly parents and the community. © 2020 British Educational Research Association

AB  - In five experiments, we examined the stereotypes, emotions, and behavioural intentions associated with a Spanish working-class group, known as chonis. We described a student (Experiments 1–3) or job candidate (Experiments 4–5) and presented participants with a picture showing a woman characterized either as choni or posh (an upper-class group, Experiments 2–4) or with no picture (Experiments 1, 3–5). Depending on the condition, explicit information about her high social class (Experiment 1), performance (Experiment 3), or category (Experiment 5) was provided. Participants evaluated the candidate more negatively, felt less admiration, and were less willing to interact with her or to recommend her for a job when she was categorized as choni as compared to the other categories. These effects disappeared if the student/candidate had high socioeconomic status or performed excellently in the academic domain, but they were magnified for highly (vs. weakly) materialistic individuals. Class prejudice apparently has harmful effects on disadvantaged individuals, but can be mitigated by explicit information. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Social change does not always equal social progress—there is a dark side of social movements. We discuss conspiracy theory beliefs – beliefs that a powerful group of people are secretly working towards a malicious goal – as one contributor to destructive social movements. Research has linked conspiracy theory beliefs to anti-democratic attitudes, prejudice and non-normative political behavior. We propose a framework to understand the motivational processes behind conspiracy theories and associated social identities and collective action. We argue that conspiracy theories comprise at least two components – content and qualities—that appeal to people differently based on their motivations. Social identity motives draw people foremost to contents of conspiracy theories while uniqueness motives draw people to qualities of conspiracy theories. © 2020

AB  - Anti-Semitism represents one of the most penetrating forms of prejudice, yet social research has failed to address the causal underpinnings of the phenomenon. To this end, we empirically test the notion that anti-Semitism builds on the legacy of the Holocaust. Standing as the benchmark for collective suffering, the Holocaust creates competition over recognition of the status of the victim. Upward comparisons between victimized ingroups with other victimized outgroups trigger social prejudice. Victimhood, thus, creates an antagonistic view of the Jews that, in turn, fuels anti-Semitic prejudice. We test this theory using data from Greece—the European nation with the highest proportion of anti-Semites—leveraging two survey experiments and a natural experiment. Our results confirm our theoretical expectations, showing that perceived victimhood fuels anti-Semitism. The findings of our research carry important implications for dealing with anti-Semitism and for combating various forms of outgroup prejudice. © 2020 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Diversity training is a popular strategy to reduce prejudice within educational settings. However, in practice, diversity training rarely relies on social-psychological theory, and research on its effectiveness in real-world settings is scarce. Previous research regarding diversity training has particularly neglected an important theoretical concept: privilege as the counterpart of discrimination. Therefore, we developed a diversity training aiming to increase awareness of ingroup privilege, using an intersectional approach to teach participants the complex interaction between privilege and oppression. We randomly allocated students of educational science (N = 112) to a repeated-measures (pre-test, post-test, follow-up) control-group design. Compared with the control group, training participants showed a significant increase in awareness of ingroup privilege 1 week after the training, whereas there was no change in awareness of discrimination. Furthermore, increased awareness of ingroup privilege 1 week after the training mediated improved outgroup attitudes (i.e., more positive outgroup feelings towards immigrants and refugees, reduced subtle prejudice towards immigrants and reduced homonegativity) 2 weeks after the training. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Though studies have shown that the sexual orientation of parents does not influence their parenting skills or the well-being of their children, prejudice against same-sex families is still very widespread. Research has not sufficiently explored the ways in which parents tackle this prejudice. Using qualitative methodologies, in particular textual analyses, this study has analysed the discourse used by same-sex families to handle the prejudices that they face. The results highlighted that conflicts, which may even be ideological in nature, are sometimes created between traditional families and “atypical” families. These often result in estrangement and isolation from their own family and the communities to which they belong, in turn damaging the growth of the children involved. Furthermore, means for moving beyond conflict, sharing experiences and effectively tackling prejudices are also discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hostile sexism expresses derogation of women’s competence and emphasizes that women will exploit men’s relational dependence. Men who endorse hostile sexism perceive their female partners more negatively, but do these negative perceptions stem from motives for dominance or insecurities about dependence? We tested both perspectives by assessing bias in perceptions of partners’ behaviors that challenge dominance (criticism, instruction, taking over) versus affirm partners are dependable (love, care, availability). Both members of 100 heterosexual couples reported how much they received and enacted these behaviors in (a) a lab-based discussion and (b) six monthly retrospective reports about an ongoing important goal. In both support contexts, men’s hostile sexism was associated with underestimating dependability-relevant support, particularly when partners reported providing low support. This pattern did not emerge for dominance-relevant behaviors. These results indicate that men’s hostile sexism involves insecurities about dependence, producing perceptions that female partners are less dependable than they actually are. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Research suggests that racial slurs may be “reclaimed” by the targeted group to convey affiliation rather than derogation. Although it is most common in intragroup uses (e.g., “nigga” by a Black individual toward another Black individual), intergroup examples of slur reappropriation (e.g., “nigga” by a Black individual toward a White individual) are also common. However, majority and minority group members’ perceptions of intergroup slur reappropriation remain untested. We examined White (Study 1) and Black (Study 2) individuals’ perceptions of the reappropriated terms, “nigga” and “nigger” compared with a control term chosen to be a non-race-related, neutral term (“buddy”), a nonracial derogative term (“asshole”) and a White racial slur (“cracker”) used by a Black individual toward a White individual. We found that the intergroup use of reappropriated slurs was perceived quite positively by both White and Black individuals. Our findings have important implications for research on intergroup relations and the reappropriation of slurs. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - We examined the associations between the need for personal control, different types of ingroup commitment, and group-related outcomes: (1) defensive responses to ingroup criticism, (2) ingroup disloyalty, and (3) outgroup attitudes. We assumed that collective narcissism (i.e., a belief in ingroup’s greatness which is contingent on external validation and stems from frustrated individual needs) should be concerned with defending the ingroup image and derogating outgroups, but not necessarily with being loyal to the ingroup. Secure ingroup identification (i.e., a confidently held ingroup evaluation, which stems from satisfied needs), in contrast, should predict greater ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. We expected these effects to be especially strong once we account for the overlap between collective narcissism and group-level self-investment – a key component of ingroup identification. In a nationally representative sample of Polish adults (n = 1,007), collective narcissism (net of group-level self-investment) mediated between low personal control and ingroup image defense, lower group loyalty, and less positive outgroup attitudes. Secure ingroup identification (group-level self-investment net of collective narcissism) mediated between high personal control and ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. It was not associated with ingroup image defense. Implications for understanding the role of identification in inter- and intra-group relations are discussed. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5-6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Although research on prejudice against gender and sexual minorities has been increasing in recent years, little attention has been paid to predictors for transprejudice and its potential culture-specific correlates in particular. This cross-sectional study addressed these gaps in the literature by exploring the relative contributions of social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, filial piety, and essentialist beliefs of gender to negative attitudes toward transgender people in 371 Chinese participants. Path analyses showed that (a) consistent with previous research, authoritarianism and social dominance orientation made independent contributions to explaining variance in transprejudice; (b) filial piety, as a culture-specific variable, was a unique predictor for transprejudice beyond the effects of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; and (c) these relations appeared to be mediated by gender essentialism. Our findings suggest that people with higher levels of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation tend to have stronger essentialist beliefs of gender, which may in turn contribute to the development of transprejudice. It also highlights the importance of identifying culture-specific predictors (e.g., filial piety in a Chinese context) when we attempt to understand transprejudice. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Few studies have examined to what extent commonly held stereotypes reflect real intergroup differences in motivational goals. Taking a values perspective (Schwartz et al., 2012), the study examines value preferences among Jews and Russians in Russia, to assess the extent to which commonly held stereotypes reflect values of group members. Results showed that Jews reported substantially higher levels of universalism-tolerance, benevolence (both caring and dependability), and tradition values, and lower levels of power (both dominance and resources), and universalism-nature values, than Russians. Results indicated that the widespread Jewish stereotypes of power, achievement, and rootlessness/cosmopolitanism are ungrounded, while the stereotypes of liberalism and particularism are upheld by the reported differences in the value preferences between Jews and the majority population in Russia. The present study underscores the importance of value comparisons between ethnic minority and majority groups for understanding their motivational goals and thus fighting prejudices and discrimination. © 2020 International Union of Psychological Science

AB  - A well-established body of research finds that racial resentment predicts support for punitive criminal justice policy. This article links racial resentment with punitiveness, expanding the existing research—a body of work that largely treats punitivity as a response to threat. Data for this study come from three nationally representative samples and incorporate individual and contextual factors. Key variables include Racial Resentment, Political Ideology, Punitiveness, Crime—both objective crime (i.e., county-level crime rates) and subjective crime (i.e., fear of crime), racial population characteristics, and theoretically relevant controls. Contextual factors help to clarify whether support for spending is a “rational” response to crime or a “nonrational” response to perceived racial threat as expressed through punitiveness. Findings indicate that, net of a host of factors, a punitive value orientation as well as racial resentment predicts support for increased spending on law enforcement. Our analysis also suggests that racial resentment and punitivity are more consistent and stronger predictors of support even when controlling for Crime. The article closes with a discussion of opportunity cost vis-à-vis law enforcement and other community needs. Implications for further study of race and criminal justice policy get discussed with suggestions for dealing with the future of identity-based politics. © The Author(s) 2020.

First, we test how attitudes toward blacks as coworkers and neighbors are correlated, and determine whether those attitudes are associated with commitment to the union and neighborhood attachment. Second, we address three timely issues in urban sociology and race relations: (1) how community efficacy is related to attitudes toward racial exclusion, (2) whether white homeowners are likely to oppose racial minorities as neighbors due to fears over property value decline, and (3) the “whitening” process by which people of southern and eastern European ancestry came to embrace a white racial identity. © 2020 Midwest Sociological Society.

AB  - Multicultural education is an emerging world model amid the thickening of multicultural networks of educational exchange, interaction, learning and instruction. In the Philippines, no studies analyzed the status of multicultural education, both at the micro- and macro-levels of an institution. This dearth may impede one’s understanding of the status of multiculturalism, which may result in poor implementation of policies toward reconfiguration of higher education institutions. Using sequential mixed-mode methods, this study analyzed the English teachers’ micro-level and a local university’s macro-level practices of multicultural education. Using Banks and Banks’ (Multicultural education: Issues and perspectives, Allyn and Bacon, Boston, 1993) dimensions of multiculturalism, an intact group of 49 second and third year foreign students answered a questionnaire, and joined in a focus group discussion to share their experiences related to content integration, knowledge construction, prejudice reduction, equity pedagogy and strengthening school culture. Results show that the practices of multiculturalism are excellent, except for knowledge construction and strengthening school culture. Moreover, micro- and macro-level dimensions are statistically different, resulting in the tension between the two levels if we use an excellent rating as a yardstick of fully multiculturalism. That is, English professors may have attained excellent multicultural practices, but their classroom practices may not have been fully complemented and supplemented with a much more strengthened wider school culture. Although conducted at the parochial level of one university, implications for policy-making, instructional preparation, academic reforms, faculty loading, inter-university partnership, and local and international benchmarking are seen to be national and universal. © 2019, De La Salle University.

AB  - In their theory of intergroup leadership, Hogg, van Knippenberg, and Rast proposed the novel concept of intergroup relational identity. An intergroup relational identity (IRI) refers to a form of social identity that is defined in terms of the cooperative and mutually promotive relationship between subgroups. This article outlines the development of a five-item scale to measure IRI. We conducted five studies with over 1,700 participants from different countries. The unidimensional factor structure of the five-item scale replicated across studies, and the latter three studies provided evidence of construct (convergent and discriminant) and criterion-related validity. Intergroup relations are often overlooked in organizational behavior and management research. However, our results support the idea that IRI affects intergroup or inter-team cooperation and collaboration, as well as leadership effectiveness—enhanced perceptions of an IRI is a promising way to reduce conflict between subgroups within a larger collective. To date, no measure of IRI has been published. These studies present the first empirical test of and support for the newly developed IRI measure, and provide evidence demonstrating the benefit of promoting an IRI for both leadership and intergroup relations more broadly. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The secondary transfer effect (STE), defined as contact with a primary outgroup improving attitudes towards a secondary outgroup uninvolved in contact, has mainly been studied with reference to direct contact and considering attitude generalization as the main mediating mechanism. Using a majority (422 Italians) and minority (130 immigrants) adolescent sample from high schools in Italy, we examined outgroup morality perceptions as a new mediating mechanism, and tested for the first time whether the STE emerges for extended contact. Results revealed that the STE emerged for direct contact among the majority group and for extended contact among the minority group, and it was sequentially mediated by perceptions of morality towards the primary outgroup, and by attitudes towards the primary outgroup and perceptions of morality towards the secondary outgroup. The STE also emerged for direct contact among the minority group, with morality perceptions towards the secondary outgroup and attitudes towards the primary outgroup being parallel mediators. We discuss the theoretical implications of the findings, arguing that it is important to identify the conditions and underlying processes of the STE in order to reduce prejudice in the case of both majority and minority groups. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Well-organized ethnic diversity plays a crucial role in performing quality environment and international trade. Discrimination, segregation and bigotry are escalating the pressure on world’s population and spreading prejudice, later as a consequence may lead to social exclusion. This study aims to investigate whether ethnic or religious diversity affects international trade and the environmental performance by using the data of 187-countries (including 56 high-income, 102 middle-income and 29 low-income countries) of the world. The results indicate that diversity (ethnic and religious) plays a significant positive impact on international trade and environmental performance of high- and middle-income countries and vice versa with low-income countries. This study further suggested that diversity cannot be abbreviated; however, its disastrous effects may be curtailed by providing equal opportunities and peace in society to ensure the well-being of people through cohesiveness. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Antiatheist prejudice appears to be common. This prejudice may stem from distrust. However, the factors influencing distrust are not fully understood. The current research identified common stereotypes about atheists, tested the intuitiveness of those stereotypes, and determined whether distrust toward atheists depends more on the label “atheist” or the attributes atheists are thought to possess. Study 1 (N = 100) and Study 2 (N = 149) identified several attributes thought to be most characteristic of atheists and least characteristic of Christians (or vice versa). Study 3 (N = 219) demonstrated that atheists and Christians are intuitively associated with the respective traits identified in Studies 1 and 2. Study 4 (N = 274) and Study 5 (N = 259) used fake social media profiles to manipulate target religious identification (atheist, Christian, or unspecified) and attributes (stereotypically atheist or stereotypically Christian) to determine the effect on trust ratings. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that atheists and Christians are explicitly and implicitly associated with different attributes and that, even when atheists possess stereotypically Christian attributes, Christians trust atheists significantly less than other Christians. These findings suggest that antiatheist prejudice is relatively insensitive to individual differences of the target. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - People are more willing to engage in collective action when they feel anger about collective disadvantage (van Zomeren, Postmes, & Spears, 2008). However, anger is often a fleeting emotion, whereas collective action is deliberate and sustained. Moreover, people cannot always engage in collective action on demand. We propose that rumination, or repetitive thoughts about negative emotions and experiences, may constitute a mechanism by which anger about collective disadvantage is sustained, and through it the motivation to engage in collective action. In three separate samples (128 students of color, 155 women, and 150 sexual minorities), we measured group-based anger about discrimination, group efficacy, group identification, rumination about discrimination, and collective action intentions. In all samples, rumination mediated the unique association between group-based anger and collective action intentions, controlling for group efficacy and group identification. Further, in an experimental study with 117 undergraduate women, we found that rumination, compared to distraction, sustained anger about collective disadvantage over a short period of time, and this sustained level of anger mediated the relationship between rumination and collective action intentions. These results lend support to conceptualizing collective action as a form of coping with collective disadvantage, and highlight the potential role of emotion regulation strategies like rumination in understanding intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Evidence of group bias based on race, ethnicity, nationality, and language emerges early in the life span. Although understanding the initial acquisition of group bias has critical theoretical and practical implications, precisely how group biases are acquired has been understudied. In two preregistered experiments, we tested the hypothesis that generalized social group biases can be acquired through exposure to positive nonverbal signals directed toward a novel adult from one group and more negative nonverbal signals directed toward a novel adult from another group. We sought to determine whether children would acquire global nonverbal signal-consistent social group biases that extended beyond their explicit social preferences, by measuring children's preferences, imitation, and behavioral intentions. Supporting our preregistered hypotheses, preschool-age participants favored small and large groups whose member received positive nonverbal signals, relative to groups whose member received more negative nonverbal signals. We also replicated prior work indicating that children will acquire individual target biases from the observation of biased nonverbal signals. Here we make the case that generalized social group biases can be rapidly and unintentionally transmitted on the basis of observational learning from nonverbal signals. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The research tests a model of reconciliation between authorities and communities. It expands past models of legitimacy to an intergroup dynamic model by identifying two community-level actions that legal authorities can undertake to build their popular legitimacy and promote cooperation. One type of action is a community-level reconciliatory gesture: an initiative that authorities make to communities to build trust by recognizing and trying to move beyond prior negative experiences. A second involves community-level opportunities for participating in decisions about how to manage social order. The results of this study with residents from a large metropolitan city suggest that both types of community-level gestures can make distinct contributions to building trust in and cooperation with the police. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - How do social and religious views influence attitudes of the capability and appropriateness of a prospective adoptive parent? The present experiment presents an investigation into the sources of attitudes and biases towards gay and lesbian couples and single parents in an adoption scenario. The author discusses existing theories of discrimination against LGBT populations and outgroups in general, including Social Dominance Orientation and Religious Fundamentalism, all highly predictive of LGBT bias. Current forms of adoption discrimination against nontraditional adopters from public policy makers and adoption agencies alike is explored and an empirical test of these discriminatory trends was created. Proposed adoption scenarios were presented and participant sentiments about the appropriateness of the adoption and prospective parent(s) were assessed. The direct and interactive effects of overt social and religious views were measured and these factors were clearly demonstrated to influence adoption attitudes. The present research aimed to uncover modern sources of prejudice towards gay and lesbian and single adoptive parents and offer new avenues of exploration into the foundation of such discrimination. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Mediating the Middle East engages social and political constructions that articulate sentiment within the United States, with consequences not only to foreign policies and relationships, but also to experiences of Arab and Muslim citizens. Engagement with media narratives is expected to become particularly relevant when people do not share a resonating identity or direct experience with the community being projected. I position this research as an entry into how we might understand the primacy of dominant media narratives in shaping norms that contribute to discriminatory practices. Through this analysis, I focus on the concerns of Arab and Muslim Americans, considering the consequences of negative media characterizations of Islam, of Arab communities, and of the Middle East. This study builds on a national survey of adult United States citizens (n = 1416), with a targeted proportion of Arab American residents. These attitudes toward fellow citizens as well as foreign countries are considered in relation to extent of engagement with popular culture, specifically action-adventure given its role in Hollywood narratives featuring the Middle East. Attitudes toward Arab and Muslim communities within the United States as well as in the Middle East are demonstrated to be related to this form of media engagement. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This article describes a new method of participatory arts-based research in which poets and social scientists form a collaborative research collective. This collaborative poetics method harnesses participants’ skills and knowledge to produce innovative, creative pieces, which can deepen understandings of social scientific issues and communicate this knowledge in engaging, accessible ways. The method was developed in a pilot study in which seven young spoken word poets and one poet/social scientist explored their lived experiences of discrimination. These experiences were elucidated through poetic autoethnographies, which were disseminated in a chapbook and live spoken word performance. Audience feedback indicated that the autoethnographies were powerful and thought provoking. For the co-researchers, the project was a transformative experience, facilitating changes in their focus, exploration, and communication of issues around discrimination and encouraging them to respond differently to instances of discrimination, prejudice, or abuse. The pilot study thus provides strong, preliminary support for the value of the collaborative poetics method. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Evolutionary anthropologists seek to understand the evolution of warfare across multiple timescales, from the roots of warfare in the intergroup aggression of our primate ancestors, to the causes of warfare among contemporary societies today. While warfare remains a contentious subject, considerable evidence supports the view that warfare is a strategy by which coalitions of males cooperate to acquire and defend resources necessary for reproduction. This strategy is not the result of a single “instinct” for war, but is instead an emergent property resulting from evolved psychological mechanisms (such as xenophobia and parochial altruism). These mechanisms are sensitive to ecological and social conditions, such that the prevalence and patterns of warfare vary according to subsistence strategies, military technology, cultural institutions, and political and economic relations. When economic conditions enable intergroup relations to change from zero-sum to positive-sum games, peaceful intergroup relations can emerge. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper aims at providing an overview of hate crimes through an interdisciplinary lens based not only on theories but also empirical research results. The paper first deals with the central components of hate crimes: prejudice and aggression. Not only the classical social-psychological theories of these phenomena are discussed but also some newer ones. As hate crimes do not occur in a vacuum, the next chapter of the paper deals with the social, political, cultural context and factors that facilitate or impede the occurrence of hate crimes. Community disorganization, urban ecology, racial balance, residential stability, economic conditions, and the role of the media and the internet are discussed in detail. The last chapter of the paper deals with the perpetrators of hate crimes, let them be lonely ones or members of organized hate groups. The paper demonstrates that the investigation of hate crimes can only occur in an interdisciplinary setting that can simultaneously take into account legal, social, cultural, and political factors. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Hate crimes poison societies by threatening individual rights, human dignity and equality. They effect private lives, or even victims' life and limb. Due to their ripple effect, they terrify whole communities, reinforce tensions between social groups, ultimately jeopardising peaceful coexistence. No society is immune from the signs of hatred, but whether they get tamed or whether prejudices are deepened, depends on the social measures that are applied vis-à-vis the phenomenon. The state's reaction creates norms and will informs society about the current acceptable standards. European expectations help forming these. Standards developed by the European Court of Human Rights include the obligations to ensure that hate against social groups as a motivation is considered an aggravating circumstance or leads to penalty enhancement. States must also ensure that national investigation authorities show special vigilance to explore and unmask the bias motives behind hate crimes. Such European expectations still leave a wide room of manoeuvre to respond to hate crimes efficiently and dissuasively. But irrespectively of the national codification method, for legal provisions to reach the desired outcome, certain social preconditions must be met. For hate crime laws or provisions to work, states must reach a certain level of maturity from the viewpoint of democracy, fundamental rights in general and the rule of law, where guaranteeing judicial independence is an absolute minimum. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The Roma have been and still are a target of prejudice, marginalization, and social exclusion across Europe, especially in East-Central European countries. This paper focuses on a set of stereotypical, emotional, and behavioral evaluative responses toward Roma people selected as representing the underlying components of anti-Roma bias. Employing network analysis, we investigated if attitude strength is associated with stronger connectivity in the networks of its constituent elements. The findings from representative surveys carried out in Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, France, and Ireland supported our assumption, as high attitude strength toward the Roma resulted in stronger connectivity in all pairs of high- versus low-attitude-strength networks. Our finding yields a solid theoretical framework for targeting the central variables—those with the strongest associations with other variables—as a potentially effective attitude change intervention strategy. Moreover, perceived threat to national identity, sympathy, and empathy were found to be the most central variables in the networks. © Copyright © 2020 Sam Nariman, Hadarics, Kende, Lášticová, Poslon, Popper, Boza, Ernst-Vintila, Badea, Mahfud, O’Connor and Minescu.

AB  - Background: Many migrants suffer from discrimination and poor health in China. We sought to examine the associations between experiences of discrimination and self-reported health among internal migrants in China, as well as the mediators of social integration and perceived stress. Methods: The data was obtained from a specific survey of migrants, as a part of the National Health and Family Planning Dynamic Monitoring for Migrants conducted in 2014. A total of 15,999 migrants aged 15 to 59 years were recruited by a stratified, multistage clustered sampling procedure in eight Chinese cities. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was conducted. Results: The results indicated that experiences of discrimination were associated with worse self-reported health (β = - 0.32, P < 0.001), less social integration (β = - 0.25, P < 0.001), as well as higher perceived stress (β = 0.21, P < 0.01). Both objectively measured socioeconomic status (β = 0.21, P < 0.001) and subjective social status (β = 0.21, P < 0.01) had significantly positive correlations with self-reported health. Conclusions: The discrimination, social exclusion and perceived stress experienced by migrants have significant implications on their health. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the psychological well-being of people living around landfills, which constitutes a preliminary case study localized in Samarinda city, Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This current study used a descriptive, participatory case study design. For data collection, interviews and participatory observation were used. Specifically, this case study took place in Samarinda City, Indonesia. Findings: The psychological well-being of the people living around landfills was indicated very low in the light of psychological well-being such as personal growth, life’s goals and self-acceptance dimensions. Research limitations/implications: Psychological well-being is part of an attitude of gratitude, thus making individuals happy and satisfied in life. The results of this study point to the fact that people who live around landfills have low psychological well-being due to lack of support from the community and government. In addition, with this research, people who live near landfills are very happy because they feel cared for and care about their condition. People who live near landfills expect the government and surrounding communities to know about their situation so that they become prosperous and well-being. In addition, providing medical team services, sending clean water and providing good solutions can help people who live near landfills. The limitation of this preliminary study was that researchers could deeply explore the lives of people in the next research. Besides, the next research can provide a camera or voice recorder in the state of only observation. In addition, the researcher can analyze more deeply in the next research. The final limitation was that participants could not have enough time to interact with, thus, the researcher could not collect the data to explore further. Practical implications: Base on the result in this study, the government needs to have the policy to take care of those people who stay near landfills, for example, improving drinking water, establish the health management and giving a right to people to stay near landfills. Social implications: By improving the growing environment, the people live near landfills can have some changes in their life. In addition, the negative stereotype and prejudice can be decreased and establish a more friendly society and increasing their well-being. Originality/value: The participants were found to be problematic, primarily in managing their environment and influencing their personal growth. On top of that, the participants appeared to possess a lack exposure of to social interaction with other communities, which might cause them social gap and lack of caring perceived toward the surrounding environment, lack of better life’s goals, the disappointment of current conditions due to low educational and skill backgrounds. Nonetheless, the participants were still of gratefulness upon the situation for they were still granted health for studies to support their families. Besides, the participants did not show any positive attitudes toward themselves because of the disappointment of their condition and personal qualities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Assessing attitudes toward same-sex parenting has important implications for both intervention and prevention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity. Few empirically validated measures of rejection of same-sex parenting have been developed. The current study examined the psychometric properties of an Italian translation of the Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale, a 14-item scale distributed in two subscales that measure direct and subtle rejection toward same-sex parenting, for its use in assessing heterosexual people’s attitudes toward same-sex parents in Italy. The sample consisted of 344 Italian heterosexual university students (113 men) with a mean age of 20.48 years (SD = 1.60). The results showed that the scale has a good factor structure (via confirmatory factor analysis) and satisfactory reliability and acceptable criterion-related validity. Therefore, the BCASSFS can be used to measure opposition toward gay and lesbian parenting in the Italian context. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There has been strong interest in intergenerational arts practice in the United Kingdom since the 1980s; however, there is a generally weak evidence base for the effectiveness of intergenerational practice regardless of the domain. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of an intergenerational arts project on participants’ social and psychological well-being using a mixed-methods, short-term longitudinal design. Generations Dancing brought together community artists with students (n = 25) and older adults (n = 11) living in Bedford. Over an 11-week period, participants worked together to produce a new dance performance and photography exhibition. Focus groups were conducted with the participants to explore their feelings about the collaboration across generations and communities. Participants also completed a battery of questionnaires preproject and postproject, to assess any change in their levels of well-being. Results indicate that the older adults showed increased confidence and willingness to connect with others; they got immense enjoyment from talking about their experience with others. Furthermore, the project helped to address negative stereotypes that the older adults had of working with the young people. The older adults enjoyed the students’ company and felt encouraged and supported by the young people. While a small number of challenges were identified, including difficulties in traveling to the workshops for vulnerable participants, most challenges were overcome through the older adults’ engagement in the project. For example, initial anxieties regarding the performance seemed insufficient to affect the participants’ overall enjoyment of the project. The findings were supported by the increased scores in relatedness, affect, and social well-being over time, but were not statistically significant. The results of this study indicate that intergenerational dance and arts projects can have wide-reaching positive impacts on both social and psychological well-being. However, there were a number of methodological challenges, including difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of both experimental and control groups for a robust quantitative evaluation of the data. These challenges highlight that “real life” settings and scenarios can influence the amount, nature, validity, and reliability of data collected. Going forward we encourage researchers to continue to consider innovative ways to address such methodological challenges. © Copyright © 2020 Douse, Farrer and Aujla.

AB  - When the state of emergency was declared in Tokyo, it was less a mandatory order than a request for cooperation and for jishuku (self-restraint). Along with the ambiguous status of such a request in a time of pandemic, this confusion was further compounded by uneven enforcement. While wealthier, middle class areas were left relatively unpatrolled, the areas around the redlight district of Kabuki-chō in Shinjuku, Tokyo, were very strictly monitored despite the lack of any conclusive data at that time regarding the infection patterns or rates. In targeting workers in the “night business,” the Tokyo Metropolitan Government reenacted centuries old prejudices against those working the sex trades. This paper focuses on how the advent of COVID-19 affected the lives of people working in the settai (business entertainment) industry, in particular hostesses in hostess bars, kyabajō (hostesses in clubs), and male hosts. Their voices tell us how, through the government’s actions as well as mass media and social media discourse surrounding their work, these laborers were stigmatized, resulting in a worsening of their already precarious positions as they have been expected to do difficult and increasingly dangerous work, almost always without any contract or insurance protection, in a time of pandemic. © 2020, Japan Focus.

AB  - Terrorist attacks often fuel online hate and increase the expression of xenophobic and antiminority messages. Previous research has focused on the impact of terrorist attacks on prejudiced attitudes toward groups linked to the perpetrators as the cause of this increase. We argue that social norms can contain the expression of prejudice after the attacks. We report the results of a combination of a natural and a laboratory-in-the-field (lab-in-the-field) experiment in which we exploit data collected about the occurrence of two consecutive Islamist terrorist attacks in Germany, the Würzburg and Ansbach attacks, in July 2016. The experiment compares the effect of the terrorist attacks in hate speech toward refugees in contexts where a descriptive norm against the use of hate speech is evidently in place to contexts in which the norm is ambiguous because participants observe antiminority comments. Hate toward refugees, but not toward other minority groups, increased as a result of the attacks only in the absence of a strong norm. These results imply that attitudinal changes due to terrorist attacks are more likely to be voiced if norms erode. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some patients engage in behavior or use language that demeans clinicians on the basis of their social identity traits, such as race, ethnicity, sex, disability, gender presentation, and sexual orientation, and some patients even request reassignment of involved clinicians. Despite the importance and prevalence of this problem, many medical centers lack an organizational approach for addressing patient conduct. Policy development can be daunting because organizations may encounter various barriers, including reluctance of staff to have difficult conversations about race or other identity traits; uncertainty about what constitutes an appropriate response to the spectrum of demeaning behaviors and who should make this determination; what, if any, support should be offered to targeted clinicians; whether these incidents should be reported and to whom; and whether the medical center's response should differ depending on whether nurses, trainees, or other clinicians are involved. These determinations have important implications for patients' informed consent rights, clinicians' employment rights, and medical centers' obligations to protect patients' health while adhering to workplace antidiscrimination laws and institutional commitments to diversity, equality, and inclusion. This article addresses these considerations and offers guidance to organizations on devising effective policies that meet the needs of medical centers, patients, and health care workers across services and roles, including physicians, nurses, and trainees. © 2020 American College of Physicians

AB  - For LGBT students in England, a curious contradiction exists between policy and practice. Within government policy, teachers have been discursively constructed as protectors and defenders of students’ rights. Yet, within everyday schooling, teachers might perpetuate or enable discrimination themselves. In order to explore this tension, this article creates four categories to deconstruct different motivations for, and manifestations of, teacher discrimination: ‘unaware’ teachers, ‘apathetic’ teachers, ‘reluctant’ teachers and ‘prejudiced’ teachers. It interrogates how ignorance, apathy, reluctance and prejudice become imbricated in complex social, historical and political legacies of identity erasure, normalised violence and moral discourses of young people's welfare and desexualised innocence. Seeking to apply international human rights law to the best of its (imperfect and ever-evolving) capacity, the article then evaluates how each category of teacher discrimination might be addressed by the text and jurisprudence of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The goals of the article extend beyond the British context: to generate new analytical tools for conceptualising and differentiating between diverse types of teacher discrimination and to utilise human rights frameworks in advocating for more inclusive classrooms. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Greater mobility in human societies has resulted in more interactions and contact with immigrants. In the current research, we investigated how viewing the world as flexible, changing, and paradoxical (i.e., naïve dialecticism and an incremental theory) may predict one’s authoritarian beliefs and in turn predict one’s attitudes toward immigrants. To test the generalizability of our findings, we recruit comparable samples (i.e., college students) from two societies that are largely different (Russia and Taiwan). Great cultural similarities were observed. Naïve dialecticism and an incremental theory appeared as two distinctive constructs. People who were higher on naïve dialecticism and an incremental over entity theory had lower support for authoritarian beliefs (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation) and, in turn, had more favorable attitudes toward immigrants. Some cultural differences were also observed. Taiwanese participants’ negative attitudes toward immigrants were entirely ideology-based, whereas Russian participants’ negative attitudes toward immigrants were partly based on presumably personal experiences.

AB  - Recent migration from Muslim-majority countries has sparked discussions across Europe about the supposed threat posed by new immigrants. Young men make up the largest share of newly arrived immigrants and this demographic is often perceived to be particularly threatening. In this article, we compare pro-sociality and trust toward immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, focusing on gender differences in treatment. We study these questions using behavioral games that measure strategic (trusting) and non-strategic (pro-social) behavior. Our data comes from measures embedded in a large survey of residents of Germany's eastern regions, where anti-immigrant sentiments are high. We find that Germans are similarly pro-social toward immigrant men and women in non-strategic situations, but are significantly less likely to trust immigrant men (but not women) in strategic encounters. These findings provide evidence that immigrants' gender can be an important factor conditioning the behavior of the majority population, but also caution that (gendered) ethnic discrimination may be situationally dependent. Future research should further examine the exact mechanisms underlying this variation in discriminatory behavior. © Copyright © 2020 Gereke, Schaub and Baldassarri.

AB  - This study aims to examine the differential effect of discrimination on stress between social-mix and independent public housing complexes. We analyzed the 2017 Seoul Public Housing Residents Panel Study data that were collected from public housing residents living in Seoul, Korea by running ordinal logit analyses. The empirical analysis shows that discrimination has a lower effect on stress in social-mix housing complexes than in independent public housing complexes. In addition, the moderating effect of community-based activities on the relationship between discrimination and stress was found in the independent public housing complex model. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The present study examined young group identification and young group motives (i.e., self-esteem, distinctiveness, belonging, meaning, efficacy, and continuity) as predictors of ambivalent ageism, stereotyping of older people, aging anxiety, and life satisfaction among Turkish university students. Participants (N = 226) completed scales measuring age group identification, social identity motives, ambivalent ageism, stereotyping of older people, aging anxiety, and life satisfaction. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that belonging to a young group was a significant predictor for ambivalent ageism. Young group identification and meaning were significant predictors for negative stereotyping of older people. Young group self-esteem was a significant predictor for aging anxiety. Young group identification, self-esteem, and meaning were significant predictors for life satisfaction. None of the independent variables was a significant predictor for positive stereotyping of older people. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Approximately 2,000 teams in the U.S. utilize Native American mascots, the majority of which are associated with schools. Across the nation there continue to be many intense conflicts over these mascots. Most conflicts focus on differences in opinion, rather than on the effects of these mascots. The purpose of this article is to provide educational decision-makers with a comprehensive review of research on the psychosocial effects of Native American mascots. This body of research suggests that these mascots generate undesirable effects. First, they are psychologically detrimental to Native American students. Second, for non-Native persons, they are associated with negative stereotypes of Native Americans. Third, these mascots undermine intergroup relations by increasing negative stereotyping of Native Americans. Lastly, supporters of these mascots are more apt to believe prejudicial ideas. We discuss these findings relative to broader societal contexts. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We examined perceptions of those without children in a pre-registered study. Women who made a conscious decision not to have children (i.e., childfree) and women without children for unknown reasons were evaluated more negatively than mothers and those unable to have children (i.e., childless). Few differences were observed in evaluations of male targets as a function of parental status. Although we expected gender differences whereby childfree women would be evaluated more negatively than childfree men, this was not observed. Evaluations also did not vary as a function of perceiver gender. Those higher in social dominance orientation had more negative evaluations of childfree and childless women operating through ascription to traditional gender roles. The same pattern existed for male targets but was no longer supported when statistically controlling for singlism. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Travel writing, an important influence on tourism, is often criticized as hegemonic/colonial by postcolonial studies. This study notes that postcolonial studies invariably solely search for such intentions in representations of societies. A critique of such approach is made by analysing travel writing texts where a postcolonial approach would find hegemonic/colonial intentions, while such intentions are likely absent. This is done by showing that travel writing representations of Portugal (an important tourist destination for tourism which tourism is very significant) are similar to social science representations of the country. These are to a great extent produced by Southern European and Portuguese scientists, making underlying hegemonic/colonial intentions unlikely. It is concluded that the attribution of such intentions to travel writing and other discourses by postcolonial studies should be rethought. One should therefore be careful in using postcolonial studies findings. An alternative mechanism underlying the production of unfavourable representations is proposed that may generate unfavourable representations even when producers of representations do not hold prejudiced views, with crucial implications on tourism and cultural identity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper uses the concept of epistemic injustice to shed light on the discriminatory treatment of experts in and by development aid. While the literature on epistemic justice is largely based on philosophical reasoning, I provide an empirical case study which substantiates theoretical claims with findings from social science research. Drawing on expert interviews conducted in South Africa and Tanzania, I reveal how epistemic injustice is experienced, practiced and institutionalised in a field which claims to work towards global justice. Focusing on aid-related advisory processes, the paper highlights how epistemic authority therein is tied to identity-based prejudice. The systematic credibility deficit policy experts from aid-receiving countries suffer is closely interrelated with the credibility excess so-called ‘international’ experts profit from. Their privilege is backed by an imaginary that maintains the idea of Northern epistemic superiority and sustained by prevailing employment and procurement practices of donor organisations. The paper suggests that the concurrence of testimonial and hermeneutical injustice prevents experts from the Global South from taking the lead in interpreting their own societies’ realities. This, I argue, is not only detrimental to the countries whose knowers are marginalised but also a root cause of persisting global inequality. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Lack of sex education in schools has been an ongoing issue in Russia, mainly due to conservative opposition to providing accurate sexual health information openly. Many adolescents may be misinformed about contraceptive methods and may not have reliable access to effective contraception. This study assessed sexual behaviour and knowledge of contraceptives among Russian adolescents in the republic of Bashkortostan. Among a convenience sample of 716 Russian high school youth, 60% lacked information about modern contraceptive methods other than condoms. Being male, older, having had school disciplinary problems, and lifetime use of substances were associated with increased likelihood of having sexual intercourse in one’s lifetime. Of the sub-sample of participants who had engaged in sexual intercourse, 43.2% endorsed one or more items on an index of sexual risk taking (e.g. multiple partners, no condom use). Additionally, the use of hard drugs and being of other ethnicity relative to Russian (e.g., mixed, Bashkir, Tartar) was associated with risky sexual behaviour. Lack of knowledge of effective contraceptives and the high prevalence of risky sexual behaviours warrants further research into this topic, as well as a call for sexual education programmes in the country. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article examines the recent rise of Islamophobic narratives in the Chinese cyberspace. Using content analysis of social media headline articles, this article argues that key Islamophobic actors in the Chinese cyberspace have constructed a ‘victims and villains’ narrative to effectively ‘other’ Muslim populations in China. By implying that non-Sinicised Muslims are under Arab fundamentalist influences, religious autonomy becomes political betrayal and Islamophobia is legitimised. Elements of Islamophobia is then subsumed in the official narrative calling for ethnic loyalty to the Chinese nation, which presents a unique challenge to the Chinese Party-state as Islamophobic discourses both legitimises state-sponsored autocratic control in Muslim regions, but also could potentially bring destabilisation to an already fragile ethnic relationship between Muslim minorities and the Han majority. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Drawing from the literature on the psychological harm of hate speech and the source magnification framework, we investigated the effects of hate messages from multiple sources on target group members in the context of Twitter. An online experiment conducted with Black Americans living in the United States provided evidence for source magnification of anti-Black messages. In the experiment, participants were exposed to one of three sets of tweets: hate tweets from multiple sources, hate tweets (of identical content) from a single source, and non-hate (control) tweets. The results showed that hate tweets from multiple sources, when compared to the identical hate messages from a single source and to the non-hate tweets, led to greater emotional distress, which, in turn, resulted in greater likelihood of attributing ambiguous social situations to racial prejudice. The findings provide initial evidence for source magnification of hate messages in the context of communication based on social media where simultaneous exposure to asynchronously posted hate messages from multiple sources is likely to happen. The findings also suggest that multiple-source hate messages, when compared to single-source hate messages, are more likely to indirectly result in potential relational harm. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There is a growing recognition that in an increasingly differentiated social environment it is important for social workers to be prepared to intervene in multi-diversified and multicultural contexts, so as to promote inclusion, respect and empowerment. On this account, mobility and full immersion programmes appear to contribute the most promising professional learning opportunities. However, full immersion programmes are emotionally and cognitively very demanding, sometimes even exacerbating prejudice and racism; this has led to ongoing debates as to which strategies can safeguard the effectiveness of such programmes. This paper draws on the theory of acculturation to enable a deeper understanding of how full immersion programmes can educate to diversity in social work, and of the learning processes that can occur when confronting diversity. The reflection focuses on written feedback from, and focus groups with, students who participated in a short mobility project. Findings show how self-reflective practice, which acknowledges emotional journeys including what are usually considered negative reactions, is a necessary pre-condition for successfully transferring experiences of relating to cultural differences – as in the mobility programme – to professional skills. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Peaceful co-existence is a universal but elusive aspiration. Despite the search for tools to create a peaceful world, conflict remains between nations and within nations. The fostering of peace is a question to which scholars, religious leaders and politicians put their minds, but despite this attention the paradox remains that there is little evidence that local and global conflict have subsided. Ideally the key to providing solutions can be found in the tenets of the world's major religions and cultural traditions and in the musing of some of the great philosophy voices of past and modern times. Regrettably these tenets are often absent in education systems where there are limited endeavours to encourage young people to think locally and globally about social justice, peace and human rights. Many of the current ways of imparting knowledge of human rights and peace are limited, with the emphasis on the legal aspect alone and on international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Although the UDHR is an inspiring document given that its creation stemmed from a commitment to all humanity, its uncritical acceptance negates the critiques about western dominance. Arguably, unless humankind can find a way to grapple with the tension between universal and relativist approaches to human rights by acknowledging diversity, the search for peace and social justice will be limited. This paper contemplates the creation of human rights understandings beyond legal constructs to explore how human rights concepts can be invoked through education to reduce ignorance, prejudice, religious intolerance and fear that detracts from the goal of peaceful co-existence. It explores the question of responsibility to 'the other', a form of responsibility that is not apparent in the clash of cultures and the conflict between nations. The paper suggests a schema for human rights understandings based on philosophical, political, historical, anthropological, legal and practical approaches to human rights. This includes forging the connection between theory and practice; engaging in critical pedagogy through a process of collaborative dialogue and inquiry; being familiar with the historical origins of human rights and their application; and understanding that concepts of human rights are found in every cultural and religious tradition. In advocating such a schema it draws on examples that present barriers and prospects and in so doing outlines the endeavours that take place in the inter-disciplinary Master of Human Rights program at Curtin University in Australia as a model that may be adaptable to other contexts. The paper concludes by suggesting practical ways in which the schema could be enacted including through a lifetime educational commitment to human rights through historical and philosophical understandings, inter-faith dialogue and cultural exchanges. © 2020 Mofid University - Center for Human Rights Studies.

AB  - Multiculturalism has succeeded in bringing much-ne ded attention to historically neglected minority populations. Despite the gains that multiculturalism has facilitated, as presently implemented, it may inadvertently contribute to reduced social cohesion and declining intergroup relations. We draw from social-psychological, including attitudinal and social-cognitive, perspectives to provide a theoretically and empirically informed analysis of why, despite many of its successes, multiculturalism often struggles to deliver on some of its laudable promises. We highlight three areas of concern regarding contemporary presentations of multiculturalism: (a) a strong emphasis on intergroup differences rather than a more balanced emphasis between differences and commonalities; (b) majority group members‘ perceptions that multiculturalism excludes them; and (c) framings of multiculturalism that evoke extrinsic forms of motivation. Finally, we provide several recommendations aimed at a balanced and scientifically informed understanding of multiculturalism. Although these recommendations are theoretically grounded and empirically supported, the proposed benefits of our approach need to be tested against alternative approaches. © 2020 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois

AB  - This article explores the relationship between hermeneutical injustice in religious settings and religious trauma (RT) and spiritual violence (SV). In it I characterize a form of hermeneutical injustice (HI) that arises when experiences are obscured from collective understanding by normatively laden concepts, and I argue that this form of HI often plays a central role in cases of religious trauma and spiritual violence, even those involving children. In section I, I introduce the reader to the phenomena of religious trauma and spiritual violence. In section II, I describe the role normatively laden concepts play in shaping our social experience. I then elucidate how they can contribute to HI. In section III, I provide a brief overview of the history of some significant identity prejudices in the history of Christianity and argue that children can properly be understood as victims of HI within some religious communities. I then return in section IV to the examples of religious trauma and spiritual violence offered throughout the article and demonstrate that HI plays an important causal role in each of them. HIs sometimes constitute spiritual and religious harms; at other times they create an epistemic environment conducive to spiritual abuse. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - This article considers the millenarian disposition among the Buton of North Seram sub-district, Maluku. Particular focus is paid to how the Buton interpret their inclusion in indigenous cosmologies, given their current precarious and humiliating existence. In Maluku, the Buton have long been regarded as lower-class people, outsiders who are excluded from local cultural schematics and are both socially and legally vulnerable. Instead of simply seeing their aspiration for a new and perfect social order as something springing from their desire to end their predicament, and rather than viewing their belief as something invented for this end, I suggest that the incongruent communication of cosmological tropes is important in the formation of their millenarian framework. The Buton understand the presence of their mythical representations in the indigenous cosmologies as evidence of the original order, which inspires them to believe that the Seram people are concealing the truth and that its revelation will upturn the current oppressive order. For the often referred Seram communities, however, the inclusion of Buton mythical representations is a way of assimilating a powerful, dangerous stranger and perpetuating the wholeness of their cosmology. The emphasis on the productivity of the misunderstanding rather than the creative act of expanding symbolic frameworks helps explain the peculiar relationality which grounds Buton millenarianism. © 2020 Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.

AB  - This essay argues that the discrimination that fat patients face is an issue of health justice. Insofar as this is the case, bioethicists and health care providers should not only care about it but also work to dismantle the systematic, institutional, social, and individual factors that are contributing to it to ensure that fat patients receive high-quality health care, free of stigma and discrimination. The essay discusses a variety of ways in which fat patients are discriminated against and considers the false assumptions that fuel such discrimination. It concludes by considering the structural and social issues that contribute to fatness and pushes health care providers to abandon the assumption that being fat is an individual moral failing. Ultimately, the paper argues, “fat” is not necessarily a bad word, nor one that health care providers should avoid. © 2020 The Hastings Center

AB  - Background: An angiogenic imbalance is among the theories for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE) which is a health issue that is predicted to be cause of significant maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. The PE clinical pattern is variable and its course is unpredictable and may end with a disastrous but a preventable result; henceearly diagnosis of PE and prediction of its morbiditiesare valuable and warrants a workthat enables a clinicianto interfere early before a significant prejudice results. Objective: To evaluate the role ofsoluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1(sFlt), placental growth factor (PlGF) serum levels and their ratio in the diagnosis of PE. Patients and methods: This randomized case-control study hasinvolved eighty pregnant women, 40 of them werediagnosed to have PEand 40 apparently healthy pregnant womenas a control group. It was conducted at twoteaching hospitals in Baghdad city-Iraq. For all participants, serum levels of the twoangiogenic markers were measured and the ratio of their levels was calculated. Results: In PE women, mean serum level of PlGF was significantly lower than that in the control group (87.75 versus 284.2 ng/l) while mean level of sFlt-1 and mean value of s-Flt/PlGF ratio were significantly higher(5.45 versus 2.89 ng/l and 78.29 versus 12.31,respectively). A cut-ff value of 35 for sFlt-1/PlGF ratiohasachieved a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 100% and a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. Conclusion: The study angiogenic markers and particularly their ratio have a significant diagnostic performance in PEthat may warrant their clinical use. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - The increasing presence of robots in society necessitates a deeper understanding into what attitudes people have toward robots. People may treat robots as mechanistic artifacts or may consider them to be intentional agents. This might result in explaining robots’ behavior as stemming from operations of the mind (intentional interpretation) or as a result of mechanistic design (mechanistic interpretation). Here, we examined whether individual attitudes toward robots can be differentiated on the basis of default neural activity pattern during resting state, measured with electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants observed scenarios in which a humanoid robot was depicted performing various actions embedded in daily contexts. Before they were introduced to the task, we measured their resting state EEG activity. We found that resting state EEG beta activity differentiated people who were later inclined toward interpreting robot behaviors as either mechanistic or intentional. This pattern is similar to the pattern of activity in the default mode network, which was previously demonstrated to have a social role. In addition, gamma activity observed when participants were making decisions about a robot’s behavior indicates a relationship between theory of mind and said attitudes. Thus, we provide evidence that individual biases toward treating robots as either intentional agents or mechanistic artifacts can be detected at the neural level, already in a resting state EEG signal.

AB  - With the growing pervasiveness of social media in our daily lives has come a recognition that these platforms have an influence over societal standards. The way women are represented on social media may reflect how they are treated in real life. The purpose of this study was to identify common themes among social media posts about women from four Chicago neighborhoods-Little Village, Pilsen, South Shore, and Englewood-to learn about the acceptability of traditionally negative gender-specific language in these communities, and to determine their potential effects. Public posts were abstracted from four diverse Chicago neighborhoods and coded into six major themes: (1) pride for women by women, (2) pride for self, (3) positive depictions of women by men, (4) violent imagery, (5) sexually explicit imagery, and (6) aggressive sexual imagery. We found that the meanings of traditionally derogatory language have evolved. Our findings may contribute to research that can establish relationships between representations of women on social media and gender dynamics in urban communities. © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

AB  - With more people using social media on a daily basis and the prevalence of racial discrimination online, it becomes imperative to understand what factors impact minority individuals’ perceptions of these transgressions in an online context. Confrontation to discrimination in the form of comments on social media may meaningfully shape perceptions of racism online. Across three studies, we examine how confrontation type (aggressive vs. passive) and confronter group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) influence Asian Americans’ perceptions of online prejudice and attitudes towards the confronters. In Study 1, we find that aggressive confrontations alter perceptions of a racist online post to be more offensive as compared to passive confrontations. In Study 2, these findings extend to participants’ likelihood to report the content as offensive. Lastly, in Study 3, we find that aggressive confronters are evaluated more positively than passive confronters. These findings have important implications for understanding racial discrimination in an online context by demonstrating the impact of confrontation type on minority individuals’ perceptions and behaviors. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: The perceived threat of a contagious virus may lead people to be distrustful of immigrants and out-groups. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the salient politicized discourses of blaming Chinese people for spreading the virus have fueled over 2000 reports of anti-Asian racial incidents and hate crimes in the United States. Objective: The study aims to investigate the relationships between news consumption, trust, intergroup contact, and prejudicial attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans residing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare how traditional news, social media use, and biased news exposure cultivate racial attitudes, and the moderating role of media use and trust on prejudice against Asians is examined. Methods: A cross-sectional study was completed in May 2020. A total of 430 US adults (mean age 36.75, SD 11.49 years; n=258, 60% male) participated in an online survey through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Respondents answered questions related to traditional news exposure, social media use, perceived trust, and their top three news channels for staying informed about the novel coronavirus. In addition, intergroup contact and racial attitudes toward Asians were assessed. We performed hierarchical regression analyses to test the associations. Moderation effects were estimated using simple slopes testing with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval approach. Results: Participants who identified as conservatives (β=.08, P=.02), had a personal infection history (β=.10, P=.004), and interacted with Asian people frequently in their daily lives (β=.46, P<.001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Relying more on traditional news media (β=.08, P=.04) and higher levels of trust in social media (β=.13, P=.007) were positively associated with prejudice against Asians. In contrast, consuming news from left-leaning outlets (β=–.15, P=.001) and neutral outlets (β=–.13, P=.003) was linked to less prejudicial attitudes toward Asians. Among those who had high trust in social media, exposure had a negative relationship with prejudice. At high levels of trust in digital websites and apps, frequent use was related to less unfavorable attitudes toward Asians. Conclusions: Experiencing racial prejudice among the Asian population during a challenging pandemic can cause poor psychological outcomes and exacerbate health disparities. The results suggest that conservative ideology, personal infection history, frequency of intergroup contact, traditional news exposure, and trust in social media emerge as positive predictors of prejudice against Asians and Asian Americans, whereas people who get COVID-19 news from left-leaning and balanced outlets show less prejudice. For those who have more trust in social media and digital news, frequent use of these two sources is associated with lower levels of prejudice. Our findings highlight the need to reshape traditional news discourses and use social media and mobile news apps to develop credible messages for combating racial prejudice against Asians. © Jiun-Yi Tsai, Joe Phua, Shuya Pan, Chia-Chen Yang.

AB  - Black people are still considered to be one of the most stigmatized groups and have to face multiple prejudices that undermine their well-being. Assumptions and beliefs about other racial groups are quite pervasive and have been shown to impact basic social tasks such as face processing. For example, individuals with high racial prejudice conceptualize other-race faces as less trustworthy and more criminal. However, it is unknown if implicit racial bias could modulate even low-level perceptual mechanisms such as spatial frequency (SF) extraction when judging the level of trustworthiness of other-race faces. The present study showed that although similar facial features are used to judge the trustworthiness of White and Black faces, own-race faces are processed in lower SF (i.e. coarse information such as the contour of the face and blurred shapes as opposed to high SF representing fine-grained information such as eyelashes or fine wrinkles). This pattern was modulated by implicit race biases: higher implicit biases are associated with a significantly higher reliance on low SF with White than with Black faces.

AB  - Background I investigate the association of perceived discrimination based both on race and other attributes such as age, gender, and insurance status on self-reported health access and health outcomes in a diverse and densely populated metropolitan area. Methods Restricted data from the 2016 round of the New York City Community Health Survey was used to create prevalence estimates for both racial and non-racial discrimination. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of these discrimination measures with health access and health outcome variables. Results Among residents who perceived discrimination receiving health care during the previous year, 15% reported the reason behind such discrimination to race, while the rest chose other reasons. Among the non-race based categories, 34% reported the reason behind such discrimination to be insurance status, followed by other reasons (26.83%) and income (11.76%). Non-racial discrimination was significantly associated with the adjusted odds of not receiving care when needed (AOR = 6.96; CI: [5.00 9.70]), and seeking informal care (AOR = 2.24; CI: [1.13 4.48] respectively, after adjusting for insurance status, age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, nativity, and poverty. It was also associated with higher adjusted odds of reporting poor health (AOR = 2.49; CI: [1.65 3.75]) and being diagnosed with hypertension (AOR = 1.75; CI: [1.21 2.52]), and diabetes (AOR = 1.84; CI: [1.22 2.77]) respectively. Conclusions Perceived discrimination in health care exists in multiple forms. Non-racial discrimination was strongly associated with worse health access and outcomes, and such experiences may contribute to health disparities between different socioeconomic groups. © 2020 Prabal K.

AB  - This article begins with the view that the research of accessible tourism should not only find justification for increasing demand but also have the ultimate purpose of seeking justice for an equitable society. To this end, prior research on accessible tourism is theoretically outlined, and the concepts, causes, and aspects of disability discrimination are considered. In addition, cases of discrimination of customers with disabilities in the tourism and hospitality industries are investigated by an ethnographic approach. The findings are categorized into seven sections, depending on the type of lack of understanding of customers with disabilities. In other words, service providers have a stereotypical view that customers with disabilities have similar attributes, and they also fail to free customers with disabilities from the prejudice of customers with nondisabilities, who may generalize the group with disabilities with a negative and hostile attitude. Additionally, tourist attractions, lodging, and dining infrastructure have caused a stigma that lowers the activities of customers with disabilities to bystanders or makes customers with disabilities more recognized as a social protection target rather than members of society. Therefore, marketing implications can be discussed in terms of physical facilities and human services at the key points where discrimination against customers with disabilities occurs, as can be seen from the results of this study. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Native Americans are members of sovereign nations that pre-date colonial settler societies. In settler societies, inclusion has often meant assimilation, a form of forced or coerced participation in the larger society and loss of Indigenous identity. On the other hand, inclusion can counterbalance prejudice and bigotry, thus, helping reduce stereotypes and oppression. The challenge is to provide opportunities for inclusion without mandating incorporation at the cost of Indigenous distinctiveness and ways of being. This article explores how Indigenous Peoples can reap the benefits of social inclusion while avoiding its pitfalls, including loss of identity and legal status. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The minority stress model describes the unique stressors that impact sexual and gender minorities above and beyond general stressors and includes both external (distal) and internal (proximal) sources of stress. Proximal stressors are the thoughts and feelings that are elicited and maintained because of direct and indirect experiences with prejudice events and are typically conceptualized to include anticipated stigma, internalized transphobia, and gender identity concealment. Recently, gender dysphoria has been proposed as a proximal stressor due to its interactive nature with both external triggers and mental health symptoms. However, gender dysphoria has not been tested empirically in prior published models of gender minority stress. Trans and nonbinary participants (N = 297) over the age of 18 were recruited via postings on social networking websites. Participants identified as trans feminine (n = 128), trans masculine (n = 110), nonbinary (n = 49), and agender (n = 10), and ranged in age from 18 to 67 (M = 28, SD = 9.42). Through a confirmatory factor analysis, it was shown that internalized transphobia, anticipated stress, gender identity concealment, and gender dysphoria reflect the latent factor proximal stress. Findings from this study suggest that gender dysphoria should be understood as a proximal stressor. As such, clinical interventions that target how individuals internalize experiences in a cisnormative society could have a positive impact on the severity of gender dysphoria. Additionally, modeling gender dysphoria as a proximal stressor can help future research disaggregate gender dysphoria from negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety or rumination. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Transgender women share more in common with cisgender women, with respect to sociocultural context and factors influencing HIV risk and outcomes, than they do with "men who have sex with men", a behavioral risk category in which they often are included. However, it is not yet clear whether both transgender and cisgender women would find integrated, all-women HIV programs and services desirable and beneficial. We Are All Women was a qualitative study conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area from April 2016 to January 2017, using a conceptual framework based on gender affirmation and trauma-informed care, to explore barriers and facilitators to inclusion of transgender women in HIV treatment and support services traditionally focused on cisgender women. Thirty-eight women (10 trans, 25 cis, and 3 "other"gender) participated in six semistructured, facilitated focus groups. In addition, five HIV care providers participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Both trans and cis women identified the desire for gender affirmation, a feeling of safety (specifically space without men), and potential community building within a care and healing context as powerful facilitators of an inclusive all-women care environment. At the same time, they recognized that tensions do exist between idealized visions of such an environment, deep-seated sentiments and behaviors among some cis women toward trans women, and the practical realities of creating the optimal spaces for all women. Opportunities for dialog between trans and cis women to mitigate gender-associated phobias and misperceptions are a valuable first step in creating HIV care environments that serve all women. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Recent events encompassing social injustices, healthcare disparities, and police brutality against Black citizens highlight the continued need to strive toward unbiased and inclusive practices in all realms of the world. Our voices as cell biologists are powerful tools that can be used to combat inequities in the scientific landscape. In this inaugural Voices essay, we discuss how exclusion and inclusion events have contributed to our scientific journeys and how scientists can work to create an inclusive environment for our trainees and colleagues. As underrepresented minority scientists in the early and late stages of our scientific training, we frame the trainee experience to provide insight from unique perspectives. This essay also provides actionable items that the cell biology community can implement to promote inclusivity. We anticipate that initiating an open dialogue focused on diversity and inclusion will promote growth in the field of cell biology and enable scientists to assess and assume their role in creating welcoming environments. We believe that scientists at all stages in their careers can make meaningful and habitual contributions to supporting inclusivity in cell biology, thereby creating a future where diversity, equity, and inclusion are expected, not requested. © 2020 Termini and Pang.

AB  - To what extent are intergroup attitudes associated with regional differences in online aggression and hostility? We test whether regional attitude biases towards minorities and their local variability (i.e. intraregional polarization) independently predict verbal hostility on social media. We measure online hostility using large US American samples from Twitter and measure regional attitudes using nationwide survey data from Project Implicit. Average regional biases against Black people, White people, and gay people are associated with regional differences in social media hostility, and this effect is confounded with regional racial and ideological opposition. In addition, intraregional variability in interracial attitudes is also positively associated with online hostility. In other words, there is greater online hostility in regions where residents disagree in their interracial attitudes. This effect is present both for the full resident sample and when restricting the sample to White attitude holders. We find that this relationship is also, in part, confounded with regional proportions of ideological and racial groups (attitudes are more heterogeneous in regions with greater ideological and racial diversity). We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these relationships, as well as the dangers of escalating conflict and hostility when individuals with diverging intergroup attitudes interact. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi is a recently released Indian historical biopic of Rani Lakshmi Bai. Through historical re-imagining, the film renders several potential social and political issues, which are topical and timely in contemporary India. The present article attempts to examine the topicality of the film. First, it discusses how it rekindles the female heroic tradition of India, which has been overshadowed due to the patriarchal mindset and historiography. Secondly, it explores how, through cinematic liberties, issues like gauraksha, Hindutva, and patriotism have been propagated. Thirdly, it argues how by foregrounding Dalits and Muslims, the film attempts to neutralise extremist Hindu prejudices, dominant in the hyper-nationalist climate of India. The article concludes that by recreating a crucial historical epoch and a legend, the film attempts to reinstate a secular heritage of India’s heroic tradition to rekindle nationalistic and patriotic sensibility among the contemporary masses. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The importance of cultural processes to behavioural diversity in our closest living relatives is central to revealing the evolutionary origins of human culture. However, the bonobo is often overlooked as a candidate model. Further, a prominent critique to many examples of proposed animal cultures is premature exclusion of environmental confounds known to shape behavioural phenotypes. We addressed these gaps by investigating variation in prey preference between neighbouring bonobo groups that associate and overlap space use. We find group preference for duiker or anomalure hunting otherwise unexplained by variation in spatial usage, seasonality, or hunting party size, composition, and cohesion. Our findings demonstrate that group-specific behaviours emerge independently of the local ecology, indicating that hunting techniques in bonobos may be culturally transmitted. The tolerant intergroup relations of bonobos offer an ideal context to explore drivers of behavioural phenotypes, the essential investigations for phylogenetic constructs of the evolutionary origins of culture. © Samuni et al.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine whether listeners were less likely to believe a statement that is produced in an atypical voice, as compared to a typical voice. It was hypothesized that an atypical voice, characterized by abnormal roughness, strain, and pitch, would elicit increased skepticism. This hypothesis was based on previous evidence that there are negative stereotypes against individuals who have a voice disorder, and that increased difficulty processing an utterance can lead to disbelief. Methods: In Experiment 1, 36 listeners rated obscure trivia statements (such as “the elephant is the only mammal that cannot jump” and “the first public library was opened in Vienna in 1745”) as definitely false, probably false, probably true, or definitely true. The statements were produced by a speaker who used their typical voice and simulated an atypical voice (of severe deviance according to the CAPE-V), as well as two additional control speakers with typical voices. Experiment 2 was a replication of Experiment 1 with a new set of 36 listeners and a new set of speakers. In addition, Experiment 2 examined whether reduced credibility was due to negative stereotypes and/or processing difficulty, through questionnaire data and correlation analyses. Results: The results were largely consistent with the hypothesis that statements produced in an atypical voice would be perceived as less credible. In both experiments, the percentage of definitely false ratings was higher for the atypical voice than for the typical voice and control voices, with a large effect size in Experiment 1 and a medium effect size in Experiment 2. Further, Experiment 2 suggested that reduced credibility was due to negative stereotypes but not processing difficulty. Conclusion: The current study reveals a social consequence of having a voice disorder, i.e., decreased perceived credibility, with implications for job-related success. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and Objectives: This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (LTC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons. Research Design and Methods: This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages. Results: A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes. Discussion and Implications: Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it. © 2020 Gerontological Society of America.

AB  - Background and Objectives: While older adults' social participation has attracted sustained attention, the realities faced by seniors with impairments in this area are still understudied. Social representations are formed from socially constructed opinions regarding a given object and have four functions (knowledge, identity, orientation, justification). The purpose of this article is to document the social representations that exist within seniors' organizations regarding participation by older people with impairments. Research Design and Methods: In this mixed-methods study, an exploratory sequential design was applied. First, a qualitative phase involved meetings with five focus groups to explore how participants would manage difficult situations in which the inclusion of an older person with impairments must be addressed. Second, a quantitative phase consisted of a questionnaire administered to 86 respondents to examine the components of social representations about the participation of older people with impairments. Results: Results show that, although research participants acknowledge that all seniors have the right to participate, this right confronts a collective identity infused with aging model that demands a youthful, "un-disabled" appearance and activities. In terms of the orientation function, making participation a reality is seen as relying on the efforts of people with impairments, but when there is a failure of inclusiveness, the reasons offered to justify it concern the resources available, rather than possible prejudices. Discussion and Implications: Interpretation of the results leads to recommendations for both implementing an inclusion philosophy and practices in seniors' organizations and revisiting the view of impairment in old age as otherness. © 2020 Gerontological Society of America.

AB  - The field of acculturation spans a rich and broad spectrum of relevant topics, types of populations and geographic areas. It has, however, been slow in incorporating theoretical insights beyond the intergroup relations perspective, neglecting contributions from other social psychology areas, such as the socio-cognitive approach, and from disciplines such as cultural and personality psychology, and the social-network perspective. The main aim of this article is to inform and broaden the understanding of micro- and meso-level acculturation mechanisms (e.g., cultural frame switching, multicultural identity structure and dynamics, intra- and inter-personal interculturality). We argue that it is time for acculturation research to apply other methodologies, rely on new theoretical paradigms and move from predicting acculturation outcomes (e.g., psychological well-being) to modelling acculturation processes. The article closes with a discussion on potential future challenges and needed directions in the social psychological study of acculturation, interculturalism and migration. © 2020 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - Children begin displaying racial biases early in development, which has led many authors of popular-press articles to generate suggestions for preventing and decreasing such biases. One common theme in the popular press is that parents should play a role in addressing children’s biases. In the present article, we analyze the current recommendations parents receive about addressing their children’s biases and consider their utility. We conclude that the evidence base supporting the effectiveness of parental intervention to reduce children’s biases is scant. Next, we offer suggestions for how to construct a useful evidence base from which good recommendations could be drawn. In so doing, we issue a call to action for researchers to conduct research that will yield empirically supported, specific, shareable suggestions for parents who are seeking advice about how to engage with their children in this important domain. We also suggest that researchers become actively involved in the dissemination of the research findings so as to improve the lives of those who receive and express biases. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: People with albinism (PWA) are targets of prejudice and social exclusion and have limited access to specialized medical care and resources. Our study aimed to describe the epidemiological and dermatological profile of PWA in Togo. Method: We carried out a cross-sectional study of 294 medical records of PWA systematically examined during two mobile skin care clinics in 2019. Results: The mean age of the patients was 22 ± 16.5 years, and the gender ratio (M/F) was 1. A family history of albinism was reported in 27.9% of cases, and consanguinity between the parents was found in 24.1% of PWA. Dermatological lesions on physical examination were present in 95.2% of PWA. These lesions were elastosis/wrinkles (82.9%), ephelides (79.6%), actinic keratoses (60.0%), actinic cheilitis (50.0%), and cutaneous carcinomas (11.8%). The mean age of PWA with skin carcinomas was 38.6 years. Fifty-four cases of cutaneous carcinomas had been diagnosed (31 cases of basal cell carcinoma, 21 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and 2 cases of Bowen's disease) and were located mainly in the cephalic region (61.1%) and upper limbs (27.8%). Cryotherapy and/or excisional biopsies were the treatments for premalignant and malignant lesions. All PWA were sensitized on sun protection. Conclusions: This study shows the basic picture of dermatological characteristics of PWA with a high frequency of photo-induced lesions and skin cancers. The popularization and respect of photoprotection measures and regular skin examination of these PWA for early detection and management of lesions will reduce their morbidity and mortality. © 2020 the International Society of Dermatology

AB  - Research has shown that beliefs about sexual orientation, including the naturalness, discreteness, and informativeness of sexual orientation categories, are associated with varying levels of sexual prejudice. Less is known about how these and other sexual orientation beliefs may correspond with broader social and political attitudes, including party affiliation and voting behavior. The present study explored voting intention and political party affiliation, as well as other constructs not directly associated with sexuality, among a sample of emerging adults (N = 286) immediately prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Using a person-centered statistical approach, we replicated sexual orientation belief profiles found in prior research and observed significant associations between belief profiles and intentions to vote for certain candidates, as well as party affiliation, ambivalent sexist attitudes, and number of reported lesbian, gay, and bisexual friends. Notably, "born this way"-type beliefs in the innateness and immutability of sexual orientation did not significantly distinguish respondents' support for presidential candidates or political party affiliation. We situate these results within existing research on essentialist beliefs and point to implications of these findings for ongoing research, clinical work, and advocacy for sexual minority rights. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - A large literature has provided evidence that intergroup biases are common in facial recognition. In investigations of faces of different races, research has repeatedly demonstrated an Own Race Bias in which people are more accurate in recognizing racial ingroup compared to outgroup members. The primary goal of this research was to investigate whether participants from typically underrepresented populations in social psychological research (i.e., Blacks, South Asians, and East Asians) show biases in recognition accuracy when presented with ingroup faces and minority and majority outgroup faces. Not surprisingly, across three experiments, participants demonstrated superior recognition for faces of members of their own compared to other races. Although minority participants also demonstrated greater recognition accuracy for majority compared to minority outgroup faces, these effects were much smaller and typically nonsignificant. The implications of these findings for our understanding of basic processes in face perception, and intergroup relations, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - While rates of opioid overdose deaths in North American have increased exponentially in recent years, most overdoses are not fatal, especially when witnesses are present and can intervene. Previous research has found that some people who use drugs [PWUDs] trained in overdose response might cut social ties with frequent overdosers, leading to more solitary opioid use and risk of death if someone overdoses alone. To examine the phenomenon of social distancing of people who overdose frequently, we used data from fifty-two in-depth qualitative interviews collected in Southern California with PWUDs who had recently witnessed an opioid overdose. Transcripts were reviewed and coded thematically, using the Integrated Threat Theory (ITT) to conceptualize the observed phenomenon. ITT outlines how realistic and symbolic threats are experienced by a group. We found that while some participants acknowledged the role of adulterated street drugs in overdoses, individualized blame was nonetheless imposed. Accusations of careless drug use practices fostered negative stereotyping towards frequent overdosers. This was attributed to the need to summon 911 for rescue, which often resulted in police dispatch. The intergroup relationship between police and PWUDs is precarious as police pose realistic threats onto PWUDs - such as incarceration, eviction, and manslaughter - leading to intragroup anxiety among PWUDs about future overdose events, and labeled frequent overdosers as liabilities. These threats, and inter/intra-group conflict, explained one reason how and why non-fatal overdoses led to social distancing events. People who overdose frequently were also accused of breaking the norm of drug user surreptitiousness; a symbolic threat that endangered the group due to police exposure. Social distancing might dampen exposure to the protective effect of peer-led interventions such as take-home naloxone programs, increasing risk of overdose death. This phenomenon highlights how intergroup dynamics are driving intragroup processes. Suggestions for tailoring public health interventions are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: Peer review is a powerful tool that steers the education and practice of medical researchers but may allow biased critique by anonymous reviewers. We explored factors unrelated to research quality that may influence peer review reports, and assessed the possibility that sub-types of reviewers exist. Our findings could potentially improve the peer review process. Methods: We evaluated the harshness, constructiveness and positiveness in 596 reviews from journals with open peer review, plus 46 reviews from colleagues’ anonymously reviewed manuscripts. We considered possible influencing factors, such as number of authors and seasonal trends, on the content of the review. Finally, using machine-learning we identified latent types of reviewer with differing characteristics. Results: Reviews provided during a northern-hemisphere winter were significantly harsher, suggesting a seasonal effect on language. Reviews for articles in journals with an open peer review policy were significantly less harsh than those with an anonymous review process. Further, we identified three types of reviewers: nurturing, begrudged, and blasé. Conclusion: Nurturing reviews were in a minority and our findings suggest that more widespread open peer reviewing could improve the educational value of peer review, increase the constructive criticism that encourages researchers, and reduce pride and prejudice in editorial processes. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Recent research has shown the negative effect of meta-dehumanization: the perception that out-group members deny a fully human status to the in-group. So far, no strategies have been investigated that allow the improvement of humanity meta-attributions. In this work, we focused on the two mind perception dimensions: agency (e.g., the capacity of planning actions) and experience (e.g., the capacity of feeling emotions), and investigated whether direct and indirect intergroup friendships are associated with the expectation that the out-group will recognize our mental capacities. A survey was conducted considering the relationship between two regional groups in Italy (Northern and Southern Italians). Participants were Northern university students. A two-level mediation model was tested, in which the exogenous variables were cross-group friendship and extended contact, the first-level mediators were IOS (the inclusion of the out-group in the self mechanism), in-group and out-group norms, and the second-level mediators were anxiety, empathy, and trust toward the out-group. The dependent variables were the evaluations of agency and experience regarding one's group (Northerners) expected by Southerners. Models were estimated by path analysis with observed variables. To replicate prior findings, the attributions of agency and experience to the out-group (Southerners) were also assessed. Results showed that both direct and indirect friendships are related to more positive meta-attributions through the mediation of affective and cognitive factors. Findings have practical implications: contact may favor the expectation of being perceived both as moral agents and as moral patients, thus improving intergroup relations. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - From infancy, children display robust preferences for native-accented and local-dialect speakers over foreign or nonlocal counterparts. These accent- and dialect-based preferences continue to manifest in children’s friendship choices and intergroup behaviors across childhood, resulting ultimately in prejudice and discrimination in various settings in adulthood. In this article, we begin with a review of the burgeoning literature on infants’ and children’s accent- and dialect-based social preferences. We then adapt Bigler and Liben’s (2007) theory to discuss how developments in children’s perceptual discrimination, social categorization, and intergroup attitudes lead to shifts in the social meaning children attach to accents and dialects to guide their social preferences across childhood. We conclude by suggesting avenues for research that can inform efforts to reduce accent- and dialect-based prejudice and discrimination. © 2020 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Immigrant and minority youth are at risk of ethnic victimization. Despite an increasing number of studies that aim to understand the consequences of such negativity, relatively little attention has been paid to understanding who the perpetrators of ethnic victimization are. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study examined whether youth who victimize their peers due to their ethnic background are also those who engage in non-ethnicity-based victimization. The study also investigated the underlying factors, i.e., impulsivity, empathy, moral disengagement, and attitudes toward immigrants, that are common or specific to groups of youth. The sample included 949 adolescents residing in Sweden (Mage = 13.11, SD = 0.41; range: 12–15; 46% girls). Cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups of adolescents, based on their reports of ethnic and non-ethnicity-based victimization: (1) low on both forms of victimization, (2) high on ethnic victimization only, (3) high on non-ethnicity-based victimization only, and (4) high on both forms of victimization. The results showed that being morally disengaged is a common denominator of ethnic and non-ethnicity-based victimizers. Difficulties in regulating impulses and lack of perspective-taking skills trigger youth’s engagement in non-ethnicity-based victimization. Lack of empathic concerns and low levels of positive attitudes toward immigrants are the bases of ethnic victimization. Together, these findings suggest that the precursors of ethnic and non-ethnicity-based victimization have similarities as well as differences, which require further attention in developing programs aimed at preventing different forms of peer victimization. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - A vast research literature documents racial bias in teachers’ evaluations of students. Theory suggests bias may be larger on grading scales with vague or overly general criteria versus scales with clearly specified criteria, raising the possibility that well-designed grading policies may mitigate bias. This study offers relevant evidence through a randomized Web-based experiment with 1,549 teachers. On a vague grade-level evaluation scale, teachers rated a student writing sample lower when it was randomly signaled to have a Black author, versus a White author. However, there was no evidence of racial bias when teachers used a rubric with more clearly defined evaluation criteria. Contrary to expectation, I found no evidence that the magnitude of grading bias depends on teachers’ implicit or explicit racial attitudes. © 2020 AERA.

AB  - Introduction: Research shows that mainstream parenting and repeat pregnancy prevention programs generally do not effectively engage with fathers and that young men’s levels of participation in such services are low. To support practitioners in overcoming the barriers to recruiting and retaining young fathers, the current study aimed to gather lessons learned from one program’s state administrators, case managers, and young fathers about the most effective strategies for engaging this population in intensive case management. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted. One focus group was held with the creators and managers of the Michigan Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting Program MI-APPP at the state Department of Health and Human Services (n = 3). The other two groups were designed to jointly engage young fathers currently involved in intensive case management (n = 11) and their case managers (n = 5). A qualitative analysis of the focus group transcripts was conducted using a coding scheme developed from emerging themes in the transcripts and related literature. Results: The findings highlight a selection of those strategies that focus group participants perceived to be most successful in improving male recruitment and retention in intensive ongoing case management. Among these strategies were centralizing feedback from young fathers in program decision making, offering opportunities for young fathers to connect, and challenging staff’s negative stereotypes about young fathers. Discussion: Despite the small sample size, the results of this study nevertheless contribute to debates in the field regarding appropriate strategies for engaging young fathers by informing professional practice. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - There are 3+ million farmworkers in the 132.8-billion-dollar U.S. agricultural industry, most of whom are Latinx. Latinx farmworkers possess at least two marginalized identities, class and ethnicity, which expose them to prejudice and discrimination. Drawing from a critical race perspective, we proposed that prejudice and discrimination are experienced interpersonally and subtly embedded within the social and physical environments for Latinx farmworkers (i.e., environmental microaggressions (EMs)). Further, we hypothesized that farmworker-specific EMs would be associated with health. Data from 90 Latinx farmworkers (Mage = 46.09 years, 63.3% women) partly supported our hypotheses. Results revealed interesting patterns of association with depression and anxiety symptoms, and physical function. Findings underscore the need to examine classism and racism as intersecting systemic forces in the lives of Latinx farmworkers, some of the most vulnerable peoples within U.S. American society. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - While considerable knowledge exists about blatant gender discrimination and violence targeting women, less is known about gender microaggressions. To understand gender microaggressions’ frequency, prevalence, and effects, researchers need robust quantitative measures. To advance gender microaggressions scholarship and support researchers’ efforts to identify high-quality measures, we conducted a psychometric scoping review. We identified 24 original, quantitative, multi-item measures designed to assess gender microaggressions or related constructs. Included measures needed at least one item assessing gender microaggressions and be used with adult women in the United States. Results indicated an increase in the number of measures including gender microaggressions’ items in recent years, with a major expansion in the number of named gender microaggressions’ measures. We found limited reporting of demographic information. Psychometric testing and characteristics varied across measures. While most (n = 20) reported internal consistency reliability, only two-thirds (n = 16) reported undergoing validity testing. When examining microaggressions named measures (n = 10), we found inconsistent adherence to microaggressions’ theoretical and conceptual foundations. Substantial work remains to develop a “gold standard” measure that does not conflate subtle and blatant acts, assesses the full thematic range of gender microaggressions, and is psychometrically valid across different social contexts and diverse groups of women. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In Croatia, four minority groups practice their right to education in their respective mother tongues. Relations between the majority and minority groups in the four multiethnic communities have developed under different historical circumstances. Thus, in some regions the different language of the minority and the majority group can be perceived as a threat to identity and result in intergroup prejudice and discrimination, whereas in others it might not. In this study, we wanted to examine: (a) the mediating effect of perceived threat on the relationship between in-group identification and intergroup orientation, (b) whether those relationships are moderated by the group status, and (c) contextual specificities, that is, we wanted to test the model in four different contexts. Results showed that ethnonationalism (rather than ethnic identity) is detrimental for intergroup relations, partially due to its connection to the perception of the out-group as a threat. Model tests in different contexts revealed some contextual differences. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Code-mixing with a dominant language can appeal to members of linguistic minorities because it signals bilingual proficiency, modernity, and social mobility. However, it can also pose a threat to the minority’s group vitality and distinctiveness. In Study 1 (N = 208), Palestinian citizens of Israel (a linguistic and national minority) listened to a recorded message by a fellow group member, either in pure Arabic or in Arabic mixed with Hebrew or English. Code-mixing elicited negative evaluations. In Study 2 (N = 276), Arabic mixed with Hebrew was crossed with messages on the relations with the Jewish–Israeli majority. Speakers who advocated full independence from the majority or an impartial view, but expressed linguistic dependency on Hebrew through code-mixing lost credit. Identification with the national group affected the effects in both studies. The implications of code-mixing for identity-related processes and its potential use as a social barometer for intergroup relations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - As immigration and mobility increases, so do interactions between people from different linguistic backgrounds. Yet while linguistic diversity offers many benefits, it also comes with a number of challenges. In seven empirical articles and one commentary, this Special Issue addresses some of the most significant language challenges facing researchers in the 21st century: the power language has to form and perpetuate stereotypes, the contribution language makes to intersectional identities, and the role of language in shaping intergroup relations. By presenting work that aims to shed light on some of these issues, the goal of this Special Issue is to (a) highlight language as integral to social processes and (b) inspire researchers to address the challenges we face. To keep pace with the world’s constantly evolving linguistic landscape, it is essential that we make progress toward harnessing language’s power in ways that benefit 21st century globalized societies. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has a prevalence rate of 2.4 % among U.S. adults; however, little is known about BDD among sexual minority men. Minority stressors (fear of rejection, sexual orientation concealment, internalized homophobia, discrimination/prejudice) may be risk factors for BDD in this population. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to estimate the occurrence of BDD in a sample of sexual minority men and investigate associations between minority stressors and BDD. Participants were recruited via social media, and survey data were collected from 268 sexual minority adolescent boys and adult men (M = 24.59 years, SD = 5.37 years). Regression models included either positive BDD screen or levels of BDD symptoms as dependent variables and the four aforementioned minority stressors as explanatory variables. The occurrence rate of positive BDD screens was 49.3 %. Gay-related rejection sensitivity and sexual orientation concealment were uniquely associated with greater BDD symptoms, and sexual orientation concealment was uniquely associated with greater odds of positive BDD screens. Given the high occurrence of positive BDD screens in the current sample, compared to the national prevalence, sexual minority stressors may be worthy to explore in etiological models of BDD in this population. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Facebook’s rainbow profile filter represents a popular display of activism (“pictivism”) commonly used by women, yet little is known of pictivism’s potential for creating social change. We tested whether women’s group status (belonging to a dominant vs. marginalized group) and filter use influenced viewers’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. We conducted a series of 2 (target sexual orientation: queer or heterosexual) × 2 (filter use: filter or no filter) experiments with heterosexual (N1 = 198, N2 = 186) and LGBTQ (N3 = 290) participants. Participants rated women who used rainbow filters as more activist than women who did not engage in pictivism. Although neither target sexual orientation nor filter use influenced participants’ ally behavior (donations), heterosexual people who viewed a woman using a filter reported greater closeness to LGBTQ people and greater intentions of supporting LGBTQ people when the woman was queer than heterosexual. Exposure to rainbow filters caused LGBTQ participants to express greater online and societal belonging than when filters were absent. Taken together, women’s pictivism and the online visibility of queer women yielded some psychological benefits for heterosexual and LGBTQ viewers. If the goal of pictivism is to enhance marginalized groups’ feelings of support, it works as intended. We thus recommend that both heterosexual and LGBTQ people who care about LGBTQ rights and seek to affirm LGBTQ individuals’ sense of belonging embrace opportunities on social media, specifically through profile picture filters, to communicate their support.

AB  - Many creative art therapists have called for a greater awareness in our profession of social injustice and have cautioned against the invisibility of social privilege: be it by race, gender, sexual orientation or any other means. They have called for institutions to be more vigilant in including awareness of the unconscious nature of such prejudices in their art therapy training programmes and they have called on individual therapists to be more self-reflective in their practices. The author offers a response to this call and self-reflects on her own practice. She uses a series of case studies with LGBTQI clients to explore how questioning dominant narratives helped her respond more effectively to her clients' needs. The author challenges the phallocentric perception of the vagina as a hole and deconstructs the active-passive power dynamic so often attributed to penetrative sex. The author wishes to demonstrate how, despite her own LGBTQI identity, as a person who grew up within a heterosexual dominant narrative, she nevertheless introjected its values: the therapist's difficulty in negotiating this narrative can limit the potential space within the setting in terms of meaning and be detrimental to the client. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Access barriers are all situations or conditions that limit seeking, receiving or enjoying benefits offered by the health system. This set of situations translates into underutilization of the services offered. In Colombia, there is little information about barriers to accessing medical care in general, and even less in the specific field of mental health. Aim: To determine the barriers to accessing psychiatric care in outpatients in Santa Marta, Colombia. Methods: The authors designed a cross-sectional study with a non-probability sample of adult patients who consulted between August and December 2018. The barriers to access were measured with a 20-item version of the Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation (BACE) scale. Results: A total of 247 patients participated; they were between 18 and 82 years (mean (M) = 47.5, standard deviation (SD) = 13.9). A total of 69 (27.9%) patients classified as having major attitudinal barriers; 62 (25.1%) patients, major barriers related to stigma-discrimination; and 41 (16.6%) patients, major instrumental barriers. Concerning the associated variables, age less than 45 years was related to major attitudinal barriers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-5.5), major barriers related to stigma-discrimination (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 2.0-7.2) and major instrumental barriers (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.3). Men reported major instrumental barriers more frequently than women (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-5.8). Conclusion: The major attitudinal, related to stigma-discrimination and instrumental barriers to access frequently delay a consultation with mental health services. Actions are necessary to reduce barriers to accessing mental health care. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Attitudes toward ethnic and racial identity have been linked to both wellbeing and maladaptive outcomes that affect belonging at school. Further, relatedness (or connectedness) as an indicator of school belonging has been positively associated with adaptive forms of motivation, acceptance of school, protection against risk factors, and scholastic success. Feelings of school belonging have varied among individuals from different ethnic-racial group and genders. In the current study, we employed cluster analysis to investigate how New Zealand Adolescents’ ethnic-racial attitudinal profiles were associated with school relatedness for clusters overall, and among and within clusters by student gender. Differences were found for school belonging among the ethnic-racial cluster overall, with a notable advantage indicated for Multiculturalists (those accepting a diversity of cultural oeuvres). Notably, the adaptive role of identifying with at least one ethnic-racial identity and optimally, embracing other cultural outlooks too, was evidenced to enhance school belonging. Conversely, at least in the New Zealand context, eschewing ethnic-racial identity placed participants at risk of disengaging with school. In terms of within-cluster gender difference, in the Low Race Salience cluster (identified as maladaptive), males demonstrated a markedly lower sense of school belonging than females. Such findings have implications for teaching and learning, and future research to implement interventions enhancing school belonging. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Although there is evidence that peer-led HIV treatment interventions are effective in improving health outcomes of people living with HIV (PLWH), few studies have assessed the health and psychosocial benefits of being a peer living with HIV. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nine PLWH who were peers of an HIV self-management intervention, to examine how this experience was perceived to impact their health behaviors, social support, and professional development. Peers reported improved HIV self-management and reduced health risk behaviors, which were attributed to increased self-efficacy and the desire to be a role model for participants. Peers described the experience as an opportunity to expand social networks and develop professional skills that could be leveraged for future employment. Our findings suggested that the benefits of being a peer could be enhanced in trainings and supervision by linking the importance of health-promoting behaviors to being a role model for other PLWH. © 2019 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care

AB  - In four experiments, students read that their university was creating either an ethnic space (a space geared to people of particular ethnic groups) or a general space for students. In an internal meta-analysis, underrepresented students of color (N = 205), but not White students (N = 760), who read about the ethnic space reported greater belonging, value of underrepresented students by the university, support, and academic engagement compared to those who read about a general space. Ethnic spaces may hold broader psychological significance than that of mere gathering places, improving outcomes even for those who do not frequently use them. Creating ethnic spaces may be one strategy for making university environments more welcoming for underrepresented students of color. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Political solutions to problems like global warming and social justice are often stymied by an inability to productively communicate in everyday conversations. Motivated by these communication problems, the paper considers the role of the virtuous listener in conversations. Rather than the scripted exchanges of information between individuals, we focus on lively, intra-active conversations that are mediating events. In such conversations, the listener plays a participatory role by contributing to the content and form of the conversation. Unlike Miranda Fricker’s negative virtue of testimonial justice, which neutralizes the listener’s identity-prejudices in their credibility judgments of the speaker’s testimony, we consider the positive virtues of a good listener. These positive virtues enable listeners to productively contribute to the conversation by helping create the fertile epistemic space of a non-adversarial, caring relationship that facilitates critical and creative thinking. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Newborn screening (NBS) programmes utilise information on a variety of clinical variables such as gestational age, sex, and birth weight to reduce false-positive screens for inborn metabolic disorders. Here we study the influence of ethnicity on metabolic marker levels in a diverse newborn population. NBS data from screen-negative singleton babies (n = 100 000) were analysed, which included blood metabolic markers measured by tandem mass spectrometry and ethnicity status reported by the parents. Metabolic marker levels were compared between major ethnic groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White) using effect size analysis, which controlled for group size differences and influence from clinical variables. Marker level differences found between ethnic groups were correlated to NBS data from 2532 false-positive cases for four metabolic diseases: glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA-1), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD). In the result, 79% of the metabolic markers (34 of 43) had ethnicity-related differences. Compared to the other groups, Black infants had elevated GA-1 markers (C5DC, Cohen's d =.37, P <.001), Hispanics had elevated MMA markers (C3, Cohen's d =.13, P <.001, and C3/C2, Cohen's d =.27, P <.001); and Whites had elevated VLCADD markers (C14, Cohen's d =.28, P <.001, and C14:1, Cohen's d =.22, P <.001) and decreased OTCD markers (citrulline, Cohen's d = −.26, P <.001). These findings correlated with the higher false-positive rates in Black infants for GA-1, in Hispanics for MMA, and in Whites for OTCD and for VLCADD. Web-based tools are available to analyse ethnicity-related changes in newborn metabolism and to support developing methods to identify false-positives in metabolic screening. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - There's a growing recognition by scholars that local-indigenous knowledge can make important contributions to both disaster risk reduction and managing environmental change. This paper interrogated the local-indigenous knowledge and practices of the Mamanwa indigenous peoples in Basey, Samar, after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013. Data for this study were drawn from ethnographic fieldwork from late 2018 to early 2020. This paper is broken up into three parts. The first part presents how Mamanwas utilize their local-indigenous knowledge in times of disaster in relation to 1) emergency evacuation and post-Haiyan relocation; 2) food and livelihood security strategies; 3) weather forecasts from animals, and 4) celestial bodies, and 5) the role of community elders as local hazard forecasters. Next, the study analyzes the lack of regard to integrate local-indigenous knowledge into disaster risk reduction (DRR) state policies such as the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act and the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act as well as the low regard on local-indigenous knowledge of non-indigenous people manifested in social prejudice and discrimination. Despite these, local DRR practitioners find innovative ways to integrate local-indigenous knowledge in local programs and activities. Following Haiyan, the elderly Mamanwas also dedicated special activities to ensure the transmission and preservation of their local-indigenous knowledge in the younger members of their community. The authors argue that in addition to the inclusion and better articulation of local-indigenous knowledge in relevant State policies, the meaningful participation of local communities including Indigenous Peoples should be the focus of local DRR actors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Children generally favor individuals in their own group over others, but it is unclear which dimensions of the out-group affect this bias. This issue was investigated among 7- to 8-year-old and 11- to 12-year-old Iranian children (N = 71). Participants evaluated in-group members and three different out-groups: Iranian children from another school, Arab children, and children from the United States. Children’s evaluations closely aligned with the perceived social status of the groups, with Americans viewed as positively as in-group members and Arabs viewed negatively. These patterns were evident on measures of affiliation, trust, and loyalty. These findings, which provide some of the first insights into the social cognition of Iranian children, point to the role of social status in the formation of intergroup attitudes. © 2020 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Is announcing a commitment to diversity enough to activate attitudes toward diversity initiatives? And what are the spillover effects of these programs? To address these questions, we conduct an experiment imbedded in a nationally representative survey of non-Hispanic White Americans (n = 1,519). We inform respondents that the White actor who plays Captain America will be replaced, while varying whether there is a reference to a diversity initiative and whether the replacement is White or Black. We find that reference to diversity initiatives on its own has no effect but the action of displaying diversity affects marketplace preferences and attitudes toward diversity initiatives. © 2020 AEJMC.

The theoretical framework of critical media discourse analysis was used to frame the study, while Leximancer and content analysis were used to analyse data. Key results extended beyond specifying the need for halal food and included supporting female travel, and specifying quite specific Muslim-friendly requirements. Further, the desire to reduce negative stereotypes of Islam was identified and advocacy that Muslim women seize travel opportunities was highlighted. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Ethnicity-related dating preferences among Asian American adolescents and the links between preferences (i.e., for a same-ethnic dating partner) and ethnic identity centrality and regard, American identity centrality and regard, parent–adolescent closeness, and perceptions of discrimination were investigated. Data from 175 self-identified Asian American high school students were collected yearly for four consecutive years. Higher levels of ethnic identity centrality and regard and parent–adolescent closeness averaged across four years were associated with preferring a same-ethnic partner. Moreover, foreign-born adolescents were less likely to prefer a same-ethnic partner when they encountered a higher than average level of discrimination on any given year. Results highlight variability in the developmental and individual-level factors that shape how adolescents navigate their dating relationships. © 2020 Society for Research on Adolescence

AB  - Background and objectives: Interpretation bias modification can affect stress reactivity, yet results have not been consistent. This inconsistency may be partly due to variability in the degree to which training procedures alter interpretation at a more automatic, rather than strategic, level of processing, and a mismatch in available resources between the training and the stress situation. We tested this possibility by investigating whether imposing a secondary cognitive load during interpretation bias modification would strengthen training-induced effects on both interpretation bias and emotional reactivity. Method: We trained 71 participants in a single session to interpret ambiguity either positively or negatively. Half of our participants did so while performing a cognitively demanding secondary task. We assessed the effects of these different training regimes on interpretation bias and both self-reported and physiological indices of stress reactivity. Results: Positive and negative interpretation bias modification resulted in training-congruent changes in interpretation bias. There were no group differences in self-reported stress reactivity, but positive interpretation training did improve recovery from stress as indexed by the heart rate measurement. Countering our hypothesis, the addition of cognitive load during the training increased neither the induced interpretive change nor its emotional impact. Limitations: Sample size was relatively small, though sufficient to detect medium sized effects. Conclusions: Adding cognitive load to interpretation bias modification does not alter training-induced change in interpretation bias or emotional reactivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although stereotypes and prejudice are commonly regarded as conceptually distinct but related constructs, previous research remains silent on the processes underlying their relation. Applying the balance-congruity principle to the concepts (a) group, (b) valence, and (c) attribute, we argue that the valence of attributes contained in a group-stereotype shapes evaluations of the group, while prejudice toward a group influences which attributes are stereotypically associated with the group. Using fictitious (Experiments 1 and 3) and real (Experiments 2 and 4) groups, the current studies demonstrate that (a) experimentally induced changes in the valence of semantic attributes associated with a group (stereotypes) influence implicit prejudice toward that group (Experiments 1 and 2), and (b) experimentally induced changes in the valence of a group (prejudice) influence implicit stereotyping of that group (Experiments 3 and 4). These findings demonstrate a bidirectional causal relation between prejudice and stereotypes. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Background and objectives: Adopting an upright (vs. stooped) posture has been related to positive effects on emotional and cognitive processes. However, there is no evidence concerning the effect of posture on two key processes associated with the maintenance of depression: interpretation bias and vividness of mental imagery. The objectives were to investigate the effect of adopting an upright (vs. stooped) posture on interpretation bias and vividness of positive and negative mental imagery, and to explore the interplay between these processes and depression-related emotions. Methods: The sample consisted of 54 participants (Mage = 22.00, 64.8% women), who were randomly assigned to the upright or stooped condition. Participants answered self-report measures while they were adopting a specific posture. Posture was monitored through inertial technology. Results: Main results were that: upright (vs. stooped) posture led to more positive interpretations of ambiguous information and increased positive emotions related to depression (happiness, optimism and vigor); time in an upright position was associated with change in interpretation bias and vividness of positive mental imagery; and level of depressive symptomatology moderated the effect of posture on the change in interpretation bias. Limitations: Limitations are related to the use of non-clinical sample, the use of short-term measurements, and the lack of an experimental condition adopting the usual posture. Conclusions: Posture interacts with mechanisms involved in the maintenance of depression, as well as with depression-related emotions. This study has clinical implications that should be continued explored in order to clarify the role of manipulating the posture in individuals with depressive symptomatology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: Social stigma has had harmful impacts on same-sex families, and its ongoing perpetuation facilitates inequality in policy and practice. Research has consistently identified that people believe that there are negative developmental impacts on children raised by same-sex parent families. These misconceptions about same-sex parenting may be impacting attitudes toward same-sex family rights. Given the connection between marriage and family, the aim was to investigate the effectiveness of an educational intervention that presents factual information about same-sex parenting on attitudes toward sexual minority rights. Method: To investigate this proposition, participants (n = 629) responded to an online survey, where they were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in an intervention where they were given either facts about smoking or facts about parenting (i.e., removing misconceptions about same-sex parenting). Participants responded to pre- and post- items to assess the impact of the fact sheet attitudes toward same-sex parenting and same-sex marriage. Results: Educating people about the misconceptions of same-sex parenting significantly reduced prejudicial attitudes toward same-sex parenting but not prejudicial attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Post hoc analyses revealed that, after removing strong positive attitudes, a reduction in negative attitudes toward same-sex marriage occurred among those who received information about same-sex parenting. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the impact of educating people about same-sex parenting and illustrated the importance of targeting people who hold prejudicial attitudes, comparative to those who have pre-existing positive attitudes toward same-sex families. The results of this study support the idea that intervening societal attitudes toward same-sex parenting may reduce opposition to same-sex family rights. © 2020 The Australian Psychological Society

AB  - As organizations continue to pursue achieving diversity and inclusion goals, how to propose and present efforts so as to maximize support and minimize resistance remains a challenge. The present set of studies, grounded in theory on the Attributional Analysis of Persuasion, examined how the demographics of diversity promoters relate to supportive attitudes and behaviors of others through perceptions of promoter self-interest. Via an experimental paradigm (Study 1), we found that White promoters were perceived as less self-interested than Black promoters of a diversity initiative, which in turn predicted more positive attitudes and support for the promoted effort. Using a sample of workplace critical incidents (Study 2), we found that diversity promoters who were demographically matched to the group for which they were advocating were perceived as more self-interested than those advocating for causes for which they were not demographically matched. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as study limitations, are discussed. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The goal of the current study was to examine the role of racial attitudes, empathic concern, and prosocial behaviors among emerging adults. Research linking racial attitudes to emerging adults’ moral development and prosocial behaviors is limited, and therefore the current study aimed to assess the interrelations among racial attitudes and empathic concern and links to two forms of prosocial behaviors. The sample included 202 young adults (M age = 20.94 years; 76.5% women; 67.5% reported identifying as racially White) who reported on their racial attitudes, empathic concern, and prosocial behaviors at Time 1 and on their tendency to engage in two forms of prosocial behaviors at Time 2. Results demonstrated links between both racial attitudes and empathic concern predicting specific forms of prosocial behaviors over time. Additionally, racial attitudes and empathic concern interacted to predict changes in selfless helping behaviors. The current study has implications for practitioners such that promoting color-conscious racial attitudes and empathic concern simultaneously is important for shaping selfless helping behaviors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - European majority group members increasingly perceive threats to national continuity, which in turn leads to defensive reactions, including prejudice against Muslim immigrants. However, according to self-affirmation theory, individuals can respond in a less defensive manner if they have affirmed positive aspects of their self-concept (self-affirmation) or their social identity (group-affirmation). In the present research, we test the potential of affirmation procedures as tools for reducing prejudice towards Muslim immigrants when national continuity is threatened. We examine the impact of personal vs. normative attachment to Christian roots of national identity on the efficacy of affirmation procedures, and the congruence between the threatened and the affirmed domains of the self. Results show that group-affirmation reduced opposition to Muslims’ rights amongst participants personally attached to the idea that national continuity is based on Christian roots. The discussion stresses the importance of non-congruence between the threatened domain of the self and the affirmed domain for the design of affirmation procedures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cities worldwide face the challenge of persistent social polarisation that is exacerbated by the mass migration of populations. Scholars have debated whether the planning of public spaces, which presumably fosters inter-group encounter, potentially reduces prejudice against minorities such as migrants, and eventually promotes social inclusiveness. This research uses a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted in 36 neighbourhoods (estates) in Beijing, China, combined with field observations and interviews, to investigate whether the presence, perception and use of neighbourhood-scale spaces of encounter are relevant in predicting residents’ attitudes towards migrant social inclusion, particularly with respect to equal access to citizenship and government welfare. Qualitative and quantitative analyses found that residents’ inclusiveness attitude is less associated with the physical presence of public spaces and facilities in the neighbourhood, and more with actually using such spaces for neighbourly encounters in daily life. The findings echo recent critiques of the romanticised view of public spaces for urban encounters, and suggest that neighbourhood planning of public spaces should incorporate elements from social projects that facilitate meaningful interaction between native and migrant residents to achieve the goal of building an inclusive city. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.

AB  - We report 5 studies examining the unique role of felt understanding in intergroup relations. In intergroup terms, felt understanding is the belief that members of an outgroup understand and accept the perspectives of ingroup members, including ingroup members' beliefs, values, experiences, and self-definition/ identity. In Studies 1 (Scotland-U.K. relations; N = 5,033) and 2 (U.K.-EU relations; N = 861) felt understanding consistently and strongly predicted outcomes such as trust, action intentions, and political separatism, including participants' actual "Brexit" referendum vote in Study 2. These effects were apparent even when controlling for outgroup stereotypes and metastereotypes. Felt understanding was a unique predictor of outgroup trust and forgiveness in Study 3 (Catholic-Protestant relations in Northern Ireland; N = 1,162), and was a powerful predictor of political separatism even when controlling for specific, relational appraisals including negative interdependence and identity threat in Study 4 (Basque-Spanish relations; N = 205). Study 5 (N = 190) included a direct manipulation of felt understanding, which had predicted effects on evaluation of the outgroup and of ingroup-outgroup relations. Overall, the findings provide converging evidence for the critical role of felt understanding in intergroup relations. We discuss future research possibilities, including the emotional correlates of felt understanding, and its role in intergroup interactions. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - In this paper, we reject commonly accepted views on fundamentality in science, either based on bottom-up construction or top-down reduction to isolate the alleged fundamental entities. We do not introduce any new scientific methodology, but rather describe the current scientific methodology and show how it entails an inherent search for foundations of science. This is achieved by phrasing (minimal sets of) metaphysical assumptions into falsifiable statements and define as fundamental those that survive empirical tests. The ones that are falsified are rejected, and the corresponding philosophical concept is demolished as a prejudice. Furthermore, we show the application of this criterion in concrete examples of the search for fundamentality in quantum physics and biophysics. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Weight bias is a pervasive problem for adolescents in school contexts. Despite evidence of negative attitudes towards students who are overweight, comparatively little research has examined whether teachers provide biased assessments of student work. Aims: The purpose of this study was to experimentally test whether middle and high school teachers unfairly assess students who are overweight and perceive them to be less competent. Sample: Participants included 133 teachers from first-ring suburban middle and high schools (Mteaching experience = 16 years; 38% male). Methods: Teachers evaluated the quality of a bogus student essay assignment accompanied by photographs that portrayed the student as either not overweight or overweight. Weight bias was assessed by having teachers grade the essay and provide perceptions of student sufficiency (perceived effort, need for tutoring, and overall success in school). Opinions about bias in grading for other teachers and self were also assessed. Results: Essays for students who were overweight were judged to be similar in structural quality, but were assigned lower grades compared to their healthy weight counterparts. Further, teachers estimated that students who were overweight put forth more effort, needed more remedial assistance, and had lower overall grades in school. Teachers’ beliefs about grading bias showed low levels of supposed bias among other teachers and a significantly lesser degree for themselves. Conclusions: This study confirms prior research on anti-fat attitudes and provides new evidence of biased attitudes in school settings. © 2019 The British Psychological Society

AB  - This paper is the result of a research that evaluated the levels of prejudice against sexual and gender minorities within 28 Brazilian public schools. The research considered a sample of 413 teachers, 97 employees, and 1829 students from 28 public high schools, located in four Brazilian states: Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Ceará, and Pernambuco. All of them answered a questionnaire on sociodemographic data, the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. The resulting analysis highlighted that religious individuals and followers of the Neo-Pentecostal church in the three study groups presented higher levels of prejudice than the other groups involved. All groups that have done previous training in the subject of prejudice presented inferior scores to those that had not done. Individuals that stated they have gay man, lesbian woman, travestis persons, or transsexual persons as friends, relatives, and acquaintances in the groups of teachers and students presented a lower level of prejudice compared to those who did not have relationships with people with these characteristics. Our results suggest the need for methodological changes in schools so that institutions can prepare their curriculum and their pedagogical practices considering the current multiple existing sexual and gender orientations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Between 2015 and 2017, the European Union (EU) was confronted with a major crisis in its history, the so-called “European refugee crisis.” Since the multifaceted crisis has provoked many different responses, it is also likely to have influenced individuals’ assessments of immigrants and European integration. Using data from three waves of the European Social Survey (ESS) — the wave before the crisis in 2012, the wave at the beginning of the crisis in 2014, and the wave right after the (perceived) height of the crisis in 2016 — we test the degree to which the European refugee crisis increased Europeans’ anti-immigrant sentiment and Euroscepticism, as well as the influence of Europeans’ anti-immigrant attitudes on their level of Euroscepticism. As suggested by prior research, our results indicate that there is indeed a consistent and solid relationship between more critical attitudes toward immigrants and increased Euroscepticism. Surprisingly, however, we find that the crisis increased neither anti-immigrant sentiments nor critical attitudes toward the EU and did not reinforce the link between rejection of immigrants and rejection of the EU. These findings imply that even under a strong external shock, fundamental political attitudes remain constant. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Scholars and pundits have long debated whether religion helps new immigrants integrate politically in the United States. Those who see religion as an integrative institution cite the country’s history of vibrant religious congregationalism that supports connections between the native and foreign born, while critics point to anti-immigrant hostility, Christian nationalism, and patterns of religious membership that can reinforce social segregation. This article aims to adjudicate this debate, using a large sample of survey data, the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), fielded among new legal residents in 2003/2004. I find that religious membership is associated with increased probability of naturalizing in a short (3.5–7 years) timeframe and is stronger for those with greater human capital and income and longer tenure in the United States. Involvement in US-origin congregations also exhibits a stronger effect on naturalization than involvement in national-origin congregations. Additionally, I find that religious minorities, though less likely to be members of congregations, are independently more likely than Christian immigrants to naturalize in the same timeframe. These results are interpreted as support for a view of organized religion as a setting for American identity formation and a basis for mobilizing resources in response to anti-immigrant sentiment. For certain groups, organized religion seems to support a type of selective acculturation that combines American citizenship with the establishment and/or retention of a distinct ethno-religious identity. The article thus affirms, with caveats, the broader relevance of a long tradition of ethnographic scholarship on immigrant religion in the United States. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This research investigated civilian implicit attitudes toward police. Previous research has solely used explicit measures (or examined police officers’ implicit reactions to civilians). Two studies assessed the implicit activation of safety and fear when participants were primed with police using a Word Fragment Completion Task (e.g., Johnson and Lord 2010). In a college sample, police primes led to increased safety and decreased fear construct activation, whereas in an online sample, both safety and fear became more accessible. Overall, results indicated that a wide range of individual differences in implicit attitudes toward police exist, that implicit reactions to police officers might be distinct from explicit global evaluations, and that, despite the existence of negative police-civilian interactions, the appearance of police officers might still tend to activate safety-related thoughts. The findings prompt the need to further assess the underlying cognitive components of civilian attitudes toward police officers. © 2019, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.

AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Discrimination is associated with poorer mental and physical health outcomes. Taxi drivers have a higher risk of exposure to discrimination and higher rates of chronic conditions. A cross-sectional needs assessment was conducted with a multilingual group of 535 male taxi drivers in New York City. Drivers reporting higher discrimination were more likely to have higher perceived stress and were more likely to have anxiety/depression and chronic pain, adjusting for confounders. Workplace-based interventions designed to help drivers cope with discrimination, stress, and chronic health conditions, interventions to educate the taxi-riding public, and greater attention to these issues from administrative agencies are warranted. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The study of fire burned areas is very important, since they corroborate with control measures, prevention and monitoring of fires. Forest fires causes numerous impacts, among them, there is biodiversity lost and human health prejudice. So, it is a problem of environmental sphere as well as a social and political sphere. A way of monitoring this is using remote sensing techniques. So the propose of the present article is to use the Modis product (MCD45A1) to identify and evaluated the burned areas in metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, among the years of 2012 to 2016, which is validated with Landsat-8/OLI sensor data. With the use of Landsat data it is possible to define the size of the burned area with greater precision, but requiring technical operational knowledge and specialized technical staff for both, on the other side, Modis is easier to operate, and have direct application and higher availability. It was observed that the study area has high burned area occurrences, mainly in spring and winter. The results found here could be used for future studies to decrease the forest fires incidence in the region and thus preserve the biodiversity of important biomes present in it. © 2020 Universidade de Brasilia.

AB  - Background: Weight-related stigmatization is a widespread problem. Particularly the internalization of weight-related stereotypes and prejudices (weight bias internalization, WBI) is related to mental and physical health impairments. To date, little is known about the risk factors of WBI. Previous studies are mainly cross-sectional and based on adult samples. As childhood is a sensitive period for the development of a healthy self-concept, we examined predictors of WBI in children. Methods: The final sample included 1,463 schoolchildren (6-11 years, 51.7% female) who took part in a prospective study consisting of three measurement waves. The first two waves delivered data on objective weight status and self-reported weight-related teasing, body dissatisfaction, relevance of one's own figure, self-esteem and depressive symptoms; WBI was measured during the third wave. To examine predictors of WBI, we ran hierarchical regression analyses and exploratory mediation analyses. Results: Lower parental education level, higher child weight status, female gender, experience of teasing, higher body dissatisfaction, higher figure-relevance, and higher depression scores were found to be predictive for higher WBI scores. Body dissatisfaction (only for girls) and the relevance of one's own figure (both genders) mediated the association between self-esteem and WBI; no weight-related differences were observed. Conclusions: Our study offers longitudinal evidence for variables that enable the identification of children who are at risk for WBI. Thus, the findings deliver starting points for interventions aimed at the prevention of adverse health developments that come along with WBI. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In order to understand the problems related to equity and diversity, we can first recognize that school physical education potentializes processes of a cultural context that has, directly and indirectly, interfered with the body and its relationships. We live in a still retrograde society, which has its foundations established in hierarchical relations of power and that women are often devalued in many sectors, especially in contexts of deep social exclusion. However, the body is the result of cultural construction and the concept of “natural” coexists within the culture. Then, it is necessary to problematize and (de)construct concepts that reinforce prejudiced/discriminatory attitudes. Our objective in this article is to interpret how high school students’ relationship to knowledge allows situated interventions on gender issues by undergraduate students from one physical education teacher education program. Methodologically, we used a qualitative approach to develop interventions in one high school in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, in two stages: (i) questionnaire to consider the students’ knowledge related to gender issues; (ii) intervention to work on issues of gender and social inequality. As a result, we have identified as essential to list such issues in the school environment, because it is in the school that we live the plurality of being and establish various social relations, locating them critically. We recognize that the challenge of intervention is beyond problematizing classes, but in educating students as autonomous and emancipated individuals as they can construct their own (self) critique. In conclusion from the analysis of those interventions, it was possible to strongly observe the existing hierarchical relations. In this sense, we emphasize the importance of the teacher to address thematics that generate learning with respect to the male and female bodies in the classes, so that there is a better understanding of the differences to foster the critical and emancipatory expansion of gender equality. © Copyright © 2020 Lima, Ferreira, Sanches Neto and Venâncio.

AB  - Only since 2011 have sexual minorities been able to serve openly in the U.S. military. The previous anti-gay policies and culture of the military may have increased anti-gay beliefs among veterans. Using data from the 2010–2016 General Social Survey, we tested whether veterans more frequently endorsed anti-gay beliefs than their non-veteran peers. Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics with multiple logistic regression, we tested the associations of veteran status with five anti-gay beliefs (i.e., disallowing a gay person (1) from publicly speaking or (2) teaching at a university, (3) removing a gay-supportive book from a library, (4) whether same-sex sexual relations are wrong, and (5) support of same-sex marriage. Veteran status was associated with greater disagreement with same-sex marriage (B = 0.16, p = 0.033) but not with other anti-gay beliefs. Most anti-gay beliefs among veterans were explained by other sociodemographic factors and may not be inherent to veteran status. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Homophobia has decreased in past decades, but gut-level disgust towards gay men lingers. It has been suggested that disgust can be reduced by inducing its proposed opposite emotion, elevation. Research suggests elevation might reduce homophobia, but only general elevation (not elevation evoked by gay people) and general attitudes (rather than disgust) have been studied. Nor has elevation’s effect on homophobia been differentiated from effects of related emotions, such as admiration or surprise. We pretested a series of news stories featuring either a gay man or a man of unspecified sexuality that were intended to distinctly elicit elevation, admiration, or surprise. We pre-registered the prediction that an elevation-inducing story would reduce negative attitudes by reducing disgust. In Study 1 (N = 593), participants who read elevation-inducing stories did not express more positive attitudes or less disgust towards gay men than those who read stories inducing admiration or surprise. The admiration stories elicited similar or lower levels of disgust than the elevation stories. Study 2 (N = 588), replicated the findings of Study 1 with improved stimuli and measures. Both studies suggest that elevation may not uniquely reduce homophobia, as elevation and admiration have similar effects on this prejudice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Prior research on the acculturation processes of the children of Black immigrants has focused on adult children from middle-class backgrounds. This raises questions about the experiences of adolescent children of immigrants from low-income backgrounds. To address this gap, this article draws on interviews with 71 West African high school students from working-class backgrounds in New York City. I find that African immigrant youth selectively acculturate into their American communities and highlight three mechanisms driving this process; adoption of American cultural features, distinction from their non-African counterparts and addition to the American cultural pool. I offer three cultural features that elucidate each mechanism respectively; cuisine, language, and fashion. I also show that racism structures acculturation and limits cultural agency. These findings highlight that selective acculturation is not exclusive to the children of middle-class Black immigrants, but also occurs for their working-class counterparts. Moreover, I underscore the cultural contributions immigrants and their children make to their host society and the mutual cultural reconstitution that occurs such that both immigrants’ ethnic culture and the cultural landscape of their host communities are fundamentally transformed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Despite Brown vs. Board of Education, prejudice still exists in the American school system. These attitudes can give rise to negative social experiences for students of color (i.e., discrimination), negatively impacting their mental and physical health and creating disparities in educational outcomes. Rather than seeking to ameliorate these negative experiences, our approach attempts to address the underlying prejudices and, in so doing, reduce these disparities. Using 4 waves of data from a cluster randomized trial (N = 15 middle schools, 1,890 students, 47.1% female, 75.2% White), we hypothesized that cooperative learning, which has been shown to reduce prejudice in previous research, would create positive gains in peer relatedness, perceptions of academic support, and engagement in learning, and that gains would be larger for students of color; our results confirmed these hypotheses. Our findings highlight the potential role of cooperative learning in reducing disparities and creating greater equity in education. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Can intergroup contact build social cohesion after war? I randomly assigned Iraqi Christians displaced by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to an all-Christian soccer team or to a team mixed with Muslims. The intervention improved behaviors toward Muslim peers: Christians with Muslim teammates were more likely to vote for a Muslim (not on their team) to receive a sportsmanship award, register for a mixed team next season, and train with Muslims 6 months after the intervention. The intervention did not substantially affect behaviors in other social contexts, such as patronizing a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul or attending a mixed social event, nor did it yield consistent effects on intergroup attitudes. Although contact can build tolerant behaviors toward peers within an intervention, building broader social cohesion outside of it is more challenging. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - Objective To explore medical student perceptions and experiences of gender bias within medical education. Setting Gender bias-â € prejudiced actions or thoughts based on the perception that women are not equal to men'-is a widespread issue. Within medicine, the pay gap, under-representation of women in senior roles and sexual harassment are among the most concerning issues demonstrating its presence and impact. While research investigating experiences of clinicians is gaining traction, investigation of medical students' experiences is lacking. This qualitative study analyses medical students' experiences of gender bias within their education to discern any patterns to this bias. Illuminating the current state of medical education gender bias will hopefully highlight areas in which student experience could be improved. Constructivist thematic analysis was used to analyse data, informed by William's patterns of gender bias, intersectional feminism and communities of practice theory. Participants Thirty-two medical students from multiple UK medical schools participated in individual interviews. Nine faculty members were also interviewed to triangulate data. Results Gender bias has an overt presence during medical student education, manifesting in line with William's patterns of bias, impacting career aspirations. Physical environments serve to manifest organisational values, sending implicit messages regarding who is most welcome-currently, this imagery remains â € too male, too pale..too stale'. Existing gender initiatives require careful scrutiny, as this work identifies the superficial application of positive action, and a failure to affect meaningful change. Conclusions Despite progress having been made regarding overt gender discrimination, implicit bias persists, with existing positive action inadequate in promoting the advancement of women. Institutions should mandate participation in implicit bias education programmes for all staff and must strive to revise the imagery within physical environments to better represent society. Gender initiatives, like Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network, also require large-scale evaluation regarding their impact, which this work found to be lacking. © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - People may be sympathetic to violent extremism when it serves their own interests. Such support may manifest itself via biased recognition of hate crimes. Psychological surveys were conducted in the wakes of mass shootings in the United States, New Zealand, and the Netherlands (total n = 2,332), to test whether factors that typically predict endorsement of violent extremism also predict biased hate crime perceptions. Path analyses indicated a consistent pattern of motivated judgment: hate crime perceptions were directly biased by prejudicial attitudes and indirectly biased by an aggrieved sense of disempowerment and White/Christian nationalism. After the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, disempowerment-fueled anti-Semitism predicted lower perceptions that the gunman was motivated by hatred and prejudice (study 1). After the shootings that occurred at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice similarly predicted lower hate crime perceptions (study 2a). Conversely, after the tram shooting in Utrecht, Netherlands (which was perpetrated by a Turkish-born immigrant), disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice predicted higher hate crime perceptions (study 2b). Finally, after the Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas, hate crime perceptions were specifically biased by an ethnonationalist view of Hispanic immigrants as a symbolic (rather than realistic) threat to America; that is, disempowered individuals deemphasized likely hate crimes due to symbolic concerns about cultural supremacy rather than material concerns about jobs or crime (study 3). Altogether, biased hate crime perceptions can be purposive and reveal supremacist sympathies. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on coexistence and urban diversity (notably in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore) has demonstrated the ways individuals of diverse backgrounds routinely manage differences and interact meaningfully in multicultural societies, drawing on shared cultural knowledge and habits. This paper argues for a deeper exploration of societies where intercultural know-how is more limited and the capacity to negotiate difference has not been inculcated. This description fits several Southeast Asian societies wherein the politics of majority-minority is a dominant feature. This article investigates the possibilities of familiarity and friendship in a multiethnic town in southern Laos where the predominant ideology towards cultural diversity has been one of assimilation. In doing so, the paper reveals ways of creating a sense of belonging and community other than the practices of cultural accommodation. These processes draw on competences and dispositions which individuals have acquired through their mobility, producing a sense of togetherness, albeit contingent and fragmented. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It is usually accepted that Saracens are evil and Christians are good in medieval narratives. The common medieval thought towards binary opposition can be pointed out by the Chanson de Roland: ‘paiens unt tort e Chrestiens unt dreit’. However, it seems that there is religious prejudice and ignorance towards the Saracens and their geographical location, the East. The Anglo-Norman Boeve de Haumtone is an early medieval narrative that focuses on cross-cultural interaction within a framework that combines political, social and religious events with geographical exploration both in the East and the West. Similarly, Bevis of Hampton is the Middle English version that reshapes the socio historical and religious events on which their sources have focused. The aim of this article is to explore the idea that another East existed during the Middle Ages. This article will address the question of what relation Boeve de Haumtone and Bevis of Hampton might have to crusading geography. It will be argued how and why the East is not portrayed as a scary, evil place as it is in other contemporary romances, and the evidence for this may be presented by the hero’s preference for living in the East for the rest of his life. © 2018 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.

AB  - Mental illness remains as one of the most stigmatizing conditions in contemporary western societies. This study sheds light on how mental health professionals and rehabilitants perceive stigmatization. The qualitative study is based on stimulated focus group interviews conducted in five Finnish mental health rehabilitation centers that follow the Clubhouse model. The findings were analyzed through inductive content analysis. Both the mental health rehabilitants and the professionals perceived stigmatization as a phenomenon that concerns the majority of rehabilitants. However, whereas the professionals viewed stigma as something that is inflicted upon the mentally ill from the outside, the rehabilitants perceived stigma as something that the mentally ill themselves can influence by advancing their own confidence, shame management, and recovery. Improvements in treatment, along with media coverage, were seen as the factors that reduce stigmatization, but the same conceptualization did not hold for serious mental illnesses. As the average Clubhouse client was thought to be a person with serious mental illness, the rehabilitation context designed to normalize attitudes toward mental health problems was paradoxically perceived to enforce the concept of inevitable stigma. Therefore, it is important for professionals in rehabilitation communities to be reflexively aware of these tensions when supporting the rehabilitants. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Family composition is changing, as the rights of minority populations are acknowledged and legalized. The lesbian stepfamily is one such family. When people or systems outside the lesbian stepfamily question the family's existence, legitimacy is challenged. Using marginalization and its properties as a lens through which to view the experiences of the lesbian stepfamily we offer insight into how marginalization is operationalized and provide suggestions to address heterosexism in health care practice. Understanding the impact of marginalization on the health of vulnerable populations can assist health care providers to improve health outcomes, particularly in the area of mental wellness. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This descriptive qualitative study was developed to describe the actions of a therapeutic residential service regarding the rights to equality and freedom of its residents. Participant observation and life histories were used for the data collection and inductive thematic analysis was the method of analysis. The residence has internal dynamics permeated by friendship and by the exercising of the rights of equality and freedom; the residents feel welcomed and protected in this environment. However, it is still necessary to overcome the social prejudice that deprives them of equality and freedom in the social environment. Finally, it is important to work with society on the need to perceive people with mental disorders as subjects with rights and duties. © 2020, Springer Nature India Private Limited.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders have always been seen as character disturbances and hence have always bore higher stigma than many other physical illnesses. In most of the cases the stigma is seen as negative stereotype arising out of poor awareness about the condition. In that case the stigma should reduce with the increase in the awareness about the condition. The current study focused upon exploring the stigma towards psychiatric disorders in the mental health trainees. A sample of 50 students of various mental health care training programs; clinical psychology, psychiatry, psychiatric social work and psychiatric nursing, were evaluated for their perceived stigma of psychiatric disorders using three versions of a tool developed to compare self-stigma, family-stigma, and social-stigma. Our results show that participants experienced significantly different levels of stigma for these levels (F (1.65, 81.26) = 56.64, p &lt; 0.0001, ηp2 = 0.536), with highest level of stigma perceived in relation to self (M = 42.8, SE = 1.53) which was significantly more than both family (M = 30.78, SE = 1.19) and society (M = 29.76, SE = 1.24) conditions. The findings were same irrespective of the specialization i.e. clinical psychology, psychiatry etc. within mental health training programs. Further analysis about the group comparison among the mental health trainees suggested that psychiatric nursing group perceived significantly higher level of overall stigma than any other group of specialization. The findings indicate that better understanding of psychiatric condition alone might not eliminate the stigma attached to it. © 2020, Springer Nature India Private Limited.

AB  - In the 21st century, generic methods and synergetic learning have been widely embraced in the areas of pedagogical and professional studies. It is crucial, especially in school-activity environments that involve technology and digital knowledge. Those who are capable of studying in teams and who promote 'collective intelligence' are likely to become influential and inspiring students and teachers. By understanding aligned visions from different viewpoints, students and teachers can maximize their efforts and talents. The idea of collective teacher efficacy (CTE) positively affects student outcomes and therefore is an essential tool in teacher training and practices. We live in the ongoing dynamics of integrated diverse thoughts, methods, disciplines, and activities. To create a better ecology for qualitative existence, numerous scholars and teachers, seek to devise necessary changes in education and social initiatives. In a world split by regimes and values, dealing with conflictual dilemmas is inevitable: preserving classical methods on the one hand, and encouraging innovative attitudes on the other. These contradictory approaches raise critical didactical questions about training future teachers and educators without prejudicing their fundamental essence. This article presents a three-years research of a group of students, at the Kibbutzim College of Education, Tel Aviv, who were trained to become professional teachers in the humanities, and their pedagogical eco-systems. It discusses some dilemmas about progressive school methods and focuses on some of the advantages and disadvantages of the generical attitudes in their practical work, regarding the gap between their first year of studying and the first year of teaching. © 2020 The author and IJLTER.ORG.

AB  - An emerging theoretical framework suggests that neural functions associated with stereotyping and prejudice are associated with frontal lobe networks. Using a novel neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), during a face-to-face live communication paradigm, we explore an extension of this model to include live dynamic interactions. Neural activations were compared for dyads of similar and dissimilar socioeconomic backgrounds. The socioeconomic status of each participant was based on education and income levels. Both groups of dyads engaged in pro-social dialectic discourse during acquisition of hemodynamic signals. Post-scan questionnaires confirmed increased anxiety and effort for high-disparity dyads. Consistent with the frontal lobe hypothesis, left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), frontopolar area and pars triangularis were more active during speech dialogue in high than in low-disparity groups. Further, frontal lobe signals were more synchronous across brains for high- than low-disparity dyads. Convergence of these behavioral, neuroimaging and neural coupling findings associate left frontal lobe processes with natural pro-social dialogue under 'out-group' conditions and advance both theoretical and technical approaches for further investigation. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Literary studies could get the reset that many realize the field needs by a refreshed attention to language—language understood not through the lenses of philology, Saussure, structuralism, poststructuralism, speech act theory, or Chomsky, but through Daniel Dor’s bold, compelling, and generous new theory of language as “the instruction of imagination.” Literary studies have missed much through not having a sufficiently searching and comprehensive theory of language to work with, one that pays due attention to the phenomenology of experience, the centrality of imagination, and the frailty, the fallibility, and the ongoing social negotiations of language. The contrasting examples are familiar—the openings of Bleak House, Pride and Prejudice, and Shakespeare’s Sonnet 1—both to compensate for the novelty of the linguistic theory and to suggest how Dor’s account of language can open up new perspectives on and new implications of what we already know well.

AB  - Race-based biases appear very early in life and they can be consistently observed from about 3 years of age. It is currently still debated whether at younger ages children display a preference for their racial ingroup. In the present study, White children belonging to two age groups (i.e., 1-2 years old and 3-4 years old) were assessed in a paradigm that gave them the opportunity to grasp the food that was (allegedly) previously brought to the mouth by either a Black or White person. Whereas, the older group of participants significantly preferred the food associated to the ingroup member, no such preference was detected in the case of the younger group of participants. Overall, findings provide further support to the notion that social discrimination based on the color of the skin takes time to develop and it is not a default response among toddlers. © 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

AB  - Background/Aim To our knowledge, no case–control study has investigated the relationships between stealing, clinical implications, and psychiatric diagnosis among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with or without a history of stealing. Thus, the associations between child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and a history of stealing remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationships between stealing, clinical implications, and psychiatric diagnosis among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with or without a history of stealing. Methods In this retrospective case–control study, the proportions of clinical implications among child and adolescent psychiatric patients with and without a history of stealing were compared. Data regarding age, sex, primary diagnosis, junior high school student or not, both father and mother are the caregivers or not, family history, abuse history, school refusal, depressive state, and obsessive–compulsive symptoms were retrieved from medical records. Participants consisted of Japanese junior high school students and younger patients (maximum age, 15 years) at the first consultation. All patients were examined and diagnosed by psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, or the Fifth Edition. Stealing was reported by the patients or caregivers to the psychiatrist, or the psychiatrist had inquired about a history of stealing at the first consultation. Results Among 1972 patients who consulted the clinic, at the first consultation, 56 (2.84%) had a history of stealing (cases), and 1916 (97.16%) did not (controls). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the proportions of males, junior high school students, abuse history, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and conduct disorder were significantly higher, and the proportions of adjustment disorders and school refusal were significantly lower in cases than in controls. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio increased further when the two factors were considered together, such as ASD with abuse history and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with abuse history. Conclusions Children with a history of stealing were more likely to be diagnosed with ASD or ADHD with abuse history. Child and adolescent psychiatric outpatients with a history of stealing were more likely to be older and male. Our study should be understood without prejudice because this study is reporting associations, not causality. Therefore, a prospective study to investigate causality among ADHD, ASD, abuse history, and stealing is needed. If ADHD and ASD with abuse history can be correlated to a history of stealing, interventions can be more effective by understanding the mechanisms underlying these connections. © 2020 Sasaki et al.

AB  - Rape is the most demoralizing type of crime violating human rights worldwide. Research has primarily focused on children and women’s experiences of rape, even though victims include men and little documentation available concerning their experiences of reporting these incidents. The study aimed to investigate men’s experiences when reporting rape to the police. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to collect and analyze qualitative data from a purposive sample of eleven men who were rape victims. The findings of the study revealed three superordinate and twenty-two subordinate themes. First, motivation for reporting rape to the police included self-protection from re-victimization, being killed, and prevalent prison cultural practice, seeking justice and answers for rape, moral duty, family support, and encouraging reports of the crime. Second, perceived barriers for reporting rape included fear of stigmatization and ridicule, unknown perpetrators, internalized homophobia, men’s preconceived prejudices, perceived justice system delays, fear of being killed, and protecting their reputation. Third, negative experiences when reporting rape included a long waiting period at the reception before opening a case file and the delayed responses of police investigating the rape scene. Also, there was discouragement from the police, disparaging behavior of police, victim-blaming, lack of communication with the victim about case progress and experiences of police homosexual intolerance. The findings show that most men were motivated to report rape to the police despite the perceived barriers and negative experiences they had with the police. Thus, this provides baseline evidence for strategies to be developed to encourage the reporting of rape. Each police station must provide dedicated personnel for professional and sensitive handling of all rape victims, including men. Furthermore, future studies should be conducted to evaluate rape victims’ satisfaction with the services provided by the police. © 2020 Mgolozeli, Duma.

AB  - The objective of this research is to investigate discovery learning in the university student, to verify that these educational methodologies were also effective in teaching marketing and, in addition, could respond to a social challenge. For this, an investigation was carried out in which, the Degree in Marketing and the Research Chair on Immigration of the Francisco de Vitoria University, came together to apply the learning methodologies with 60 students who were studying marketing fundamentals in the 2017 courses -2018 and 2018-2019. The students, organized in teams, first investigated a social reality that they were unaware of and prejudiced about. The research method was quantitative, using a questionnaire, and the analysis technique was univariate, bivariate, and multivariate. The research results show that the student is more satisfied and values the discovery learning pedagogy more positively. The main conclusions show that the students expressed their understanding of the dignity of refugees and migrants and their satisfaction at having discovered that they could help them with their marketing knowledge. © 2020 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

AB  - Three studies (Ns = 350, 301 & 341) examined the reliability, validity, and correlates of a new measure of harm inflation, the individual differences counterpart of ‘concept creep’. The Harm Concept Breadth Scale (HCBS) assesses variability in the expansiveness of concepts of harm (i.e., bullying, mental disorder, prejudice, trauma), such that these concepts refer to a wider range of phenomena among people scoring high on the scale. Study 1 developed 66 vignettes representing potential instances of the four concepts, selected optimal subsets of 10 vignettes for each concept, and demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency of the subscales. Study 2 demonstrated that the HCBS had excellent internal consistency, and established construct validity through associations with measures of moral foundations, justice sensitivity, general category inclusiveness, and political orientation. Study 3 employed participants from a different national background and further clarified the correlates of the HCBS via measures of empathy, moral expansiveness, and the Big Five personality traits. The findings indicate that concept breadth is a reliably measurable individual difference variable with weak to moderate associations with harm-based morality, prosocial concern, political liberalism, female gender, and negative emotionality. The HCBS is a valid psychometric instrument for examining the causes and implications of harm inflation. © 2020 McGrath, Haslam.

AB  - Despite its implications for positive youth development, factors and processes that promote civic engagement are critically understudied, particularly among Muslim American adolescents for whom opportunities for civic engagement could be hindered by Islamophobia and hate crimes. Prior work has proposed that parents can strengthen adolescents' group belonging and motivate their civic engagement, but this mediating link has not been empirically tested. Moreover, parents' religious socialization and adolescents' religious identity remain understudied, especially with respect to possible daily fluctuations. We used experience sampling methods to: (a) explore momentary fluctuations and temporal relations between two dimensions of Muslim American adolescents' religious identity (i.e., private regard and centrality) over the course of 14 days (Phase 2), and (b) examine if Muslim American adolescents' momentary religious identity (Phase 2) mediated associations between their stable perceptions of maternal religious socialization (Phase 1) and subsequent civic engagement (Phase 3). Dynamic structural equation modeling revealed positive autoregressive and cross-lagged relations between religious private regard and centrality. Moreover, adolescents' momentary religious identities differentially mediated the associations between maternal religious socialization and civic attitudes and behaviors, suggesting specificity in these developmental processes. Our findings have important implications for programs and policies to support the self-empowerment and positive development of Muslim American adolescents. © 2020 american psychological association.

AB  - Introduction In order to foster dental and dental hygiene practices that are inclusive, sensitive to diversity, equitable, and without prejudice, a call to broadly teach cultural diversity within dental and dental hygiene education has been made. The research question of this study was “to what extent can an interactive and open dialogue about substance use, queer health, and social responsibility foster transformative learning?” Methods A collaborative and interdisciplinary project engaged the community as a teacher over the Summer and Fall of 2019 to address issues of substance use, queer health, and social responsibility and was delivered to 55 first-year undergraduate dental and 23 third-year dental hygiene students over three educational sessions. Dental and dental hygiene students were asked to reflect, in writing, on each session using between 200 and 400 words. Textual information from students' self-reflections and from the community's feedback were analyzed thematically for content (e.g., codes and themes). Results In total, 128 written reflections-for an average of 42 reflections per session-were gathered and analyzed interactively by the authors. Three major themes emerged: feeling privileged, breaking stereotypes, and coalescing learning. Feedback from the participating community members highlighted changes to be implemented in these sessions in the future, including more opportunities for small group activities in class. Conclusions The three major themes that emerged from the thematic analysis of the self-reflections and community member feedback (feeling privileged, breaking stereotypes, and coalescing leaning) further highlighted the impact of community-driven curricula on students' learning in regard to substance use, queer health, and social responsibility. Further work is critical to understand the impact of such a pedagogy on students' practices once they leave their undergraduate programs. © 2020 Brondani et al.

AB  - This article examines the mutual imbrication of gender and class that shapes how some transgender women seek incorporation into social hierarchies in postcolonial India. Existing literature demonstrates an association between transgender and middle-class-status in the global South. Through an 18-month ethnographic study in Bangalore from 2009 through 2016 with transgender women, NGO (nongovernmental organization) workers and activists, as well as textual analyses of media representations, I draw on “new woman” archetypes to argue that the discourses of empowerment and respectability that impacted middle-class cisgender women in late colonial, postcolonial and liberalized India also impact how trans women narrate their struggles and newfound opportunities. Trans woman identities are often juxtaposed to the identities of hijras, a recognized (yet socially marginal) group of working-class male-assigned gender-nonconforming people. Instead of challenging stereotypes of gender nonconformity most evident in the marginalization of hijras, some transgender women are at pains to highlight their difference from hijras. These trans women are from working-class backgrounds. It is partly their similarities in class location that propel trans women’s efforts to distinguish themselves from hijras. They employ the figure of the disreputable hijra to contain negative stereotypes associated with gender nonconformity, thus positioning their identities in proximity with middle-class respectable womanhood. © 2020 by The Author(s).

AB  - In this article, I review the ethical issues that arise in the allocation of deceased-donor organs to children and young adults. By analyzing the public media cases of Sarah Murnaghan, Amelia Rivera, and Riley Hancey, I assess whether public appeals to challenge inclusion and exclusion criteria for organ transplantation are ethical and under which circumstances. The issues of pediatric allocation with limited evidence and candidacy affected by factors such as intellectual disability and marijuana use are specifically discussed. Finally, I suggest that ethical public advocacy can coexist with well-evidenced transplant allocation if and when certain conditions (morally defensible criteria, expert evidence, nonprioritization of the poster child, and greater advocacy for organ transplantation in general) are met. © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics

AB  - We describe the evolution of a stereotype as it emerged in tweets about the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris in early 2015. Our focus is on terms associated with the Muslim community and the Islamic world. The data (400k tweets) were collected via Twitter streaming API and consisted of tweets that contained at least one of 16 hashtags associated with the Charlie Hebdo attack (e.g., #JeSuisCharlie, #IAmCharlie, #ParisAttacks), collected between January 14th and February 9th. From these data, we generated pairwise co-occurrence frequencies between key words such as “Islam”, “Muslim(s)”, “Arab(s)”, and “The Prophet” and possible associates such as: “terrorism”, “terror”, “terrorist(s)”, “kill(ed)”, “free”, “freedom” and “love”. We use changes in frequency of co-occurring words to define ways in which acute negative and positive stereotypes towards Muslims and Islam arise and evolve in three phases during the period of interest. We identify a positively-valenced backlash in a subset of tweets associated with the “origins of Islam”. Results depict the emergence and transformation of implicit online stereotypes related to Islam from naturally occurring social media data and how pro-as well as anti-Islam online small-world networks evolve in response to a terrorist attack. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Stigma, comprising negative stereotypes, prejudice (negative affective reactions) and discrimination towards a member of a particular group, is of increasing interest in the context of mental illness. However, studies examining clinical anxiety stigma are lacking, particularly with regard to generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). There is also a lack of research into adolescent anxiety stigma, despite adolescence being a key period for early intervention for anxiety disorders, and research showing that stigma has been implicated in low rates of help-seeking and problematic peer relationships among adolescents with mental illness. Stigma has also been negatively associated with help-giving responses toward those with mental illness. Initial studies suggest that the ‘weak-not-sick’ (WNS) stereotype may be central to anxiety stigma. The present study aims to examine the endorsement of the WNS stereotype in the context of GAD, and its relationship to prejudice, discrimination, and help-giving responses among adolescents. A vignette-based survey measure was completed by 242 adolescents (74 male, 165 female, and three participants who recorded their gender as “other”) in Ireland aged between 15 and 19 years. The results of the study found that endorsement of the WNS stereotype was significantly associated with higher prejudice and discrimination, as well as lower levels of help-giving intentions. A multiple mediator model is presented showing both a direct relationship between endorsement of WNS and help-giving, and an indirect relationship between WNS and help-giving mediated by the prejudicial components of anger, fear and pity, and discrimination as assessed by desired social distance. This study adds to the limited knowledge base on stigma towards GAD in adolescents and provides a model for how anxiety stigma may relate to help-giving. This has implications for interventions to reduce stigmatising and increase help-giving responses. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study intends to show the external perception that Primary Education students have of their schoolmates with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the perception of the student who has being diagnosed with ADHD himself/herself in order to analyse the differences between both perceptions. For that purpose, a questionnaire was e elaborated ad hoc, and the main results shown point to the fact that the external perception of the Primary Education student is more positive than the perception of the diagnosed student. Moreveover, the perception of the schoolmates of students diagnosed with ADHD tends to worsen in superior courses. This discovery invites us to reflect on and understand the more frequent attitudes and behaviours that develop in interaction situations as well as investigate those conducts related to social prejudice associated to their clinical characteristics and prevalent syntoms (attention déficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity), which develop an increase of the negative perception towards the student with ADHD. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: A number of studies have highlighted differences and even discrimination in health care offer according to social category, and shown that they contribute to the production of inequality. On the other hand, when the health care system treats every patient equally, and does not take personal difficulties into consideration, some authors have suggested inequality “by omission”. That is why public health actors at different levels have recommended systematic collection of information on patients’ social status. The objective of this article is to analyze data gathering on patients’ socio-economic condition and its repercussions. Methods: The survey is based on more than 50 semi-structured face-to-face interviews with doctors and dentists in private practice. Their answers were subjected to socio-anthropological analysis. Results: While some practitioners collect information on patients’ social status proactively by systematic interrogation, others proceed indirectly and in accordance with subjective criteria. Quite often, patient status remains ignored, usually due to lack of interest, and less frequently because practitioners wish to guard against any risk of stigmatizing underprivileged patients. Different rationales may explain these attitudes: need to prioritize relevant information, wish to observe equity and equality, determination to refrain from social labeling, desire to protect patient self-esteem and to reinforce the practitioner-patient relationship. When identification does occur, it is essentially justified by a desire to adapt the care pathway to potential socio-economic obstacles. Conclusion: When a patient's social situation is sought out by private doctors and dentists, they are mainly concerned with customizing care pathways by taking financial impediments into close consideration. In most cases, their justifications for asking questions are subjective; by doing so, they inadvertently introduce arbitrariness in an area where the French state endeavors to produce social justice via provisions such as “CMU” (“universal”, across the board health coverage). Systematic questioning on a patient's social status can represent a form of supplementary if unconscious symbolic violence toward frequently disqualified persons; what is more, it runs the risk of inducing stereotypes and manifesting prejudice. Only when contextualized does such questioning seem appropriate. On the other hand, when a practitioner misses out on social issues liable to impede care and treatment, he will probably have no “second chance” to address these concerns. Some practitioners have emphasized a need for suitable timing and contextualizing of questions on a patient's social status, and for putting them forward in a climate of trust. © 2020

AB  - Exposure to derogatory language about immigrants and minority groups leads to political radicalization and deteriorates intergroup relations. This article addresses the psychological processes responsible for these effects as well as those involved in hate-speech proliferation in contemporary societies and discusses the factors that constrain its growth. We propose that frequent exposure to hate speech has severe effects on emotional, behavioral, and normative levels. Exposure to hate speech results in empathy being replaced by intergroup contempt as a dominant response to others—it is both a motivator and a consequence of derogatory language. The increased presence of hate speech in one's environment creates a sense of a descriptive norm that allows outgroup derogation. This leads to the erosion of existing antidiscriminatory norms. Finally, through a process of desensitization, hate speech reduces people's ability to recognize the offensive character of such language. Based on empirical evidence from the fields of social psychology and psychology of emotion and aggression, we propose a model that explains the described processes, and we trace the dynamics of this model using an agent-based modeling approach. We show that the mechanisms potentially effective in constraining hate-speech proliferation (empathy, norms) are eroded by hate speech itself. We argue that through basic psychological dynamics, societies become more accepting of derogatory language and less accepting of immigrants, as well as religious, ethnic, and sexual minorities. © 2020 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Anti-immigrant sentiment, policy, and practice are deeply rooted in the US tradition. Because of this, a series of laws have been passed to restrict immigration, which has resulted in millions of children and families being designated as “undocumented”. These individuals reside in the US, yet do not receive the same protections as citizens. Schools, however, have historically been supportive institutions for undocumented children because of various laws and court decisions that uphold their access to a free and appropriate education. Various barriers exist to the successful implementation of these laws and they are often not followed. School psychologists, as professionals with an ethical responsibility to advocate for the well-being of all students and families—regardless of their immigration status—can help overcome these barriers. This article first reviews the historical and legal context surrounding undocumented immigration in the US as it impacts public K-12 education. Second, it details how ethical standards influence the applied practice of school psychology when working with undocumented students and families. Finally, it concludes with a brief discussion on resolving legal and ethical dilemmas. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - While much research provides evidence that gay men and lesbians are discriminated against in the U.S. labor force, the contexts in which such bias is enhanced or reduced, or the mechanisms behind it, are harder to pinpoint. This article puts forth that occupational context—and specifically, the stereotypes about gay men and lesbians evoked by certain occupational contexts—plays an important role in shaping bias against gay men and lesbians in the labor force. I argue that people are implicitly guided by cultural stereotypes about gay men and lesbians, which affects perceptions about whether they are suitable for specific occupations. This leads to penalties for being openly gay or lesbian in some occupational scenarios, but may lead to less or no penalties in others. This theory is tested empirically using a list experiment, a methodological technique designed to reduce or eliminate social desirability bias in responses. Results suggest that bias against gay men and lesbians is not standard across all occupations or subgroups of gay employees, but rather, is shaped by important contextual factors that can activate certain stereotypes about gay and lesbian individuals. © The Southern Sociological Society 2020.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this work was to determine how weight patterns together with blood glucose, BP and lipids vary at diagnosis of diabetes by age, sex and ethnicity. Methods: Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified people with type 2 diabetes (n = 187,601) diagnosed in 1998–2015 and compared their weights, HbA1c, BP and lipid levels at diagnosis with age-matched people without diabetes (n = 906,182), by sex and ethnic group. Results: Younger age at diagnosis was associated with greater adjusted mean difference (95% CI) in weight between those with vs without type 2 diabetes: 18.7 (18.3, 19.1) kg at age 20–39 years and 5.3 (5.0, 5.5) kg at age ≥ 80 years. Weight differentials were maximal in white women, and were around double in white people compared with South Asian and black people. Despite lower absolute values, BP differences were also greater at younger age of diabetes onset: 7 (6, 7) mmHg at age 20–39 years vs −0.5 (−0.9, −0.2) at age ≥ 80 years. BP differences were greatest in white people, and especially in women. Triacylglycerol level differences were greatest in younger men. Finally, HbA1c levels were also higher with younger onset diabetes, particularly in black people. Conclusions/interpretation: At diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, when compared with people without diabetes, weight and BP differentials were greater in younger vs older people, in women vs men and in white vs South Asian and black people. These differences were observed even though South Asian and black people tend to develop diabetes a decade earlier with either similar or greater dysglycaemia. These striking patterns may have implications for management and prevention. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Researchers have used social dominance, system justification, authoritarianism, and social identity theories to understand how monoracial perceivers’ sociopolitical motives influence their categorization of multiracial people. The result has been a growing understanding of how particular sociopolitical motives and contexts affect categorization, without a unifying perspective to integrate these insights. We review evidence supporting each theory’s predictions concerning how monoracial perceivers categorize multiracial people who combine their ingroup with an outgroup, with attention to the moderating role of perceiver group status. We find most studies cannot arbitrate between theories of categorization and reveal additional gaps in the literature. To advance this research area, we introduce the sociopolitical motive × intergroup threat model of racial categorization that (a) clarifies which sociopolitical motives interact with which intergroup threats to predict categorization and (b) highlights the role of perceiver group status. Furthermore, we consider how our model can help understand phenomena beyond multiracial categorization. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

We propose that one method of facilitating improved intergroup attitudes, a sense of community, and collective action intentions is Forum Theater (Boal, 1989); we tested this prediction in postwar Liberia. In 2 communities, 218 diverse Liberians participated in a field experiment evaluating 2 Forum Theater plays (one about rebuilding trust following intergroup conflict and one about a public health issue); we also included a control group that did not receive any intervention. Both Forum Theater interventions increased participants' sense of community and willingness to engage in collective action. Only the play about intergroup conflict increased intergroup trust and reduced social distance toward a disliked group. Specifically tailored Forum Theater thus has the potential to improve intergroup attitudes, sense of community, and collective action intentions in postconflict societies. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The low employment rates of persons with Autism Spectrum Conditions in the European Union (EU) are partly due to discrimination. Member States have taken different approaches to increase the employment rate in the recent decades, including quota and anti-discrimination legislation, however, the implications for people with autism are unknown. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the history of these employment policies, from seven EU Member States (Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom [prior to exit], Slovakia, Poland, and Romania), exploring the interdependence on international and EU policies, using a path dependency analysis. The results indicate that internationally a shift in focus has taken place in the direction of anti-discrimination law, though employment quotas remained in place in six out of the seven Member States as a means to address employment of people with disability in combination with the new anti-discrimination laws. Lay summary: Discrimination is partially responsible for the low employment of people with autism. Several approaches have been taken in recent years, such as anti-discrimination laws and setting a mandatory number of people with disabilities that need to be employed. This study finds that, internationally and in the European Union, the focus was initially on the use of quotas and gradually moved to anti-discrimination, with both being used simultaneously.

AB  - Study Objective: To determine the association of postpartum contraceptive use with repeat deliveries among adolescents and youth. Design: Retrospective, observational analysis of electronic health record data. Setting: Single, urban facility in Denver, Colorado, United States. Participants: Women aged 10-24 years who gave birth between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015. Interventions and Main Outcome Measures: Postpartum contraceptive use and time to subsequent delivery. Results: Among 4068 women, 1735 (43%) used postpartum contraception. In adjusted analyses, characteristics associated with contraceptive use included Hispanic ethnicity (relative risk [RR], 1.1; P = .03), incremental prenatal visits (RR, 1.01; P = .047), and attendance at postpartum care (RR, 1.60; P < .001). Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) use was higher among women younger than 15 years (reference: 20-24 years; RR, 1.12; P < .001) and lower among women aged 18-19 years (RR, 0.93; P = .009). Hispanic women had higher rates of LARC use than non-Hispanic women (RR, 1.07; P = .02). Compared with inpatient LARC placement, outpatient placement (1-4 weeks and 5 or more weeks) rates were lower (RR, 0.77 and RR, 0.89, respectively; P < .001). Time to subsequent delivery was shorter in non-LARC users (median, 659 days) and contraception nonusers (median, 624 days) compared with LARC users (median, 790 days; P < .001); non-LARC postpartum contraceptive use did not significantly alter time to repeat delivery compared with that in women who used no method (P = .24). Conclusion: Postpartum LARC use reduced the risk of repeat pregnancy with a significant increase in time to the next delivery. Non-LARC use was not different from no contraceptive use in terms of time to repeat delivery. © 2020 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

AB  - Cleanliness is universally valued, and people who are dirty are routinely marginalized. In this research, we measured the roots of negative attitudes toward physically unclean individuals and examined the differences that exist in these attitudes between childhood and adulthood. We presented 5- to 9-year-old children and adults (total N = 260) with paired photographs of a dirty person and a clean person, and we measured biases with a selective trust task and an explicit evaluation task. In Study 1, where images of adults were evaluated, both children and adults demonstrated clear biases, but adults were more likely to selectively trust the clean informant. Study 2 instead used images of children and included several additional tasks measuring implicit attitudes (e.g., an implicit association task) and overt behaviors (a resource distribution task) and also manipulated the cause of dirtiness to include illness, enjoyment of filth, and accidental spillage. Children and adults again revealed strong biases regardless of the cause of dirtiness, but only children exhibited a bias on the explicit evaluation task. Study 3 replicated these findings in India, a country that has historically endorsed strong purity norms. Overall, this research indicates that dirty people are targets of discrimination from early in development, that this is not merely a Western phenomenon, and that this pervasive bias is most strongly directed at individuals of similar ages. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma manifests both in prejudices and rejection from society towards patients who suffer from a specific pathology, and by patient’s internalization of this discrimination, with the consequent repercussions on their state of mind and quality of life. The aim of the study was to quantify the stigma associated with migraine and analyze whether it is related to the clinical-demographic characteristics of the patients, as well as the possible impact on their daily lives. Materials and methods: The stigma scale for chronic illness (SSCI) and other questionnaires were administered to 56 patients with episodic migraine (EM), 18 with chronic migraine (CM), and 21 with epilepsy, as a control group. Results: The mean SSCI score was higher (51.6 ± 15.0) in the CM group than in the EM (45.0 ± 13.5) and epilepsy (47.6 ± 15.5) groups, without reaching statistical significance. In addition, the score was higher in patients who were unemployed, divorced, and in those who had migraine with aura. A statistically significant correlation was found between the SSCI score and the impact of migraine on daily life, the presence of stress, anxiety and depression, and low self-esteem. Conclusions: There is a stigma around migraine in our society, which seems to be more prevalent in patients with certain socio-demographic characteristics, and that is related to stress, mood alterations, and low self-esteem. Trying to reduce stigma could contribute to improve the control of migraine and reduce the impact of the disease at a socio-economic level. © 2020, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.

AB  - "Critical thinking" is widely regarded as important, but difficult to define. This article provides an historical perspective by describing how "critical thinking" emerged as an object of psychological study, how the forms it took were shaped by practical and social concerns, and how these related to "critical thinking" as something that results in certain conclusions, rather than as a process of coming to conclusions. "Critical thinking" became a scientific object when psychologists attempted to measure it. The original measurement treated "critical thinking" as both an ability and an attitude. It measured logical abilities, and consistency and extremity of views, but it avoided making assumptions about the correctness of specific real-world beliefs. The correctness of such beliefs was, as problems with other related tests showed, open to dispute. Subsequent tests increasingly focused on logical abilities, and attempted to minimize further the relevance of what people believed about the real world, though they continued to depend on there being correct answers to test items, which privileged the outcome over the process. While "critical thinking" was primarily the domain of philosophers, there was renewed psychological interest in the topic in the 1980s, which increasingly presented "critical thinking" as incompatible with certain real-world ("unscientific") beliefs. Such a view more explicitly privileged the outcome over the process. It is argued that a more reflective approach, though it may be more difficult to measure, is essential if we wish to understand not only what critical thinking has been, but also what it is now. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Agency is a basic dimension of evaluations of social groups. More agency is assigned to in-groups than to out-groups, and verb intergroup bias (VIB) captures this tendency in language use. Four studies that performed large-scale quantitative analysis of natural language use, which covered more than 200 billion words, 20 countries, and various time spans, support the VIB model. Verbs, which are prototypically associated with actions, serve as agency indicators, and thus generic in-groups are more often described with verbs (we vs. they). Moreover, VIB is present in specific between-group comparisons: for Americans as an in-group reference and various out-groups (e.g., Mexicans, Russians, and Palestinians), as well as for Americans, Canadians, Britons, and Australians as in-group references and immigrants as a generic out-group. VIB is a useful tool in diagnosing intergroup discourses. Furthermore, VIB attests to the importance of analyzing language’s role in the formation and maintenance of social biases. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Australia is undergoing an energy transition, largely spurred by efforts toward decarbonisation prompted by climate change. The energy transition, though, is socially and politically complex, particularly where the transition is felt most viscerally such as in resource-dependent regional communities. In this paper, I explore the social-political dimension of the energy transition in Australia by analysing a specific episode of social-political conflict: a multi-week, moving protest against a large thermal coal mine currently planned for development in Queensland, Australia, Adani Mining's Carmichael Coal Mine. The contestation was related to an ‘Anti-Adani Convoy’ that travelled from the southern-most state of Australia, Tasmania, to the regional Queensland community, Clermont, nearest the proposed mine site in mid-2019. The analysis is grounded in the social psychology tradition of the Social Identity Approach, and applies a model for exploring how social context makes salient certain identities and norms (the Situated Identity Enactment model). Social identity dimensions are explored via qualitative coding of online news media reporting on the Convoy, and from this analysis identity-based insights are drawn regarding the social-political dynamics of the energy transition in Australia. The Convoy experience indicates that regional communities are unlikely to be convinced about the need for the energy transition––or decarbonisation specifically and climate action more broadly––by advocates from afar who adopt tactics that appear as a threat to one group from another group. Instead, the energy transition will be best served by place-based, bottom-up initiatives that are congruent with local identity, values, preferences, and priorities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: Discrimination and prejudice have significant implications for individuals and communities and are prevalent throughout the world towards marginalised groups. This study investigated the role of psychological sense of community (PSOC), values of self-transcendence and openness-to-change, and demographic variables, with attitudes towards two different groups in Australia. Method: A convenience sample of adults living in Australia (N = 396) was randomly assigned to complete one of two online surveys; reporting on their attitudes towards Australia's First Nations People (N = 198), or towards people seeking asylum (N = 198). The study assessed the extent to which a PSOC (in reference to local, national, and global communities), self-transcendence, and openness-to-change, predicted attitudes towards the two groups. Results: Self-transcendence and psychological sense of global community consistently predicted attitudes towards both groups, with psychological sense of global community partially mediating the relationship between self-transcendence and attitudes. Bivariately, those holding a stronger local psychological sense of community reported more positive attitudes towards people seeking asylum, whereas those holding a stronger psychological sense of national community reported more positive attitudes towards Australia's First Nations People. However, in multivariable regression models with self-transcendence and demographic characteristics, only a higher psychological sense of national community significantly predicted more negative attitudes towards people seeking asylum. Conclusions: This research suggests that where people have a strong sense they are part of a global community they hold more positive attitudes towards people from various cultures both near and far. The research has implications for social cohesion and social policy. © 2020 The Australian Psychological Society

AB  - The exposure in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-known intervention, widely investigated in scientific research. Several studies have shown the benefits of this intervention in the treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The different exposure techniques are mainly based on the emotional processing of fear theory and use an emotional stimulation of fear, following by its habituation. However, new approaches have emerged and are based on the inhibitory learning theory. The virtual reality technology allows emotional involvement from patients and represents a complementary approach to the classical modalities of exposure therapy (e.g., mental or in vivo expositions). This modern approach presents specific features that need to be taken into account by the therapist. Firstly, the presence feeling, which is defined as the “be there” feeling. This feeling is dependent on immersive technical features and personality factors. Secondly, virtual reality sickness, similar to motion sickness, represents a limitation that might prejudice a virtual therapy. The main scientific investigations of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) for treating social phobia, specific phobia, PTSD, and panic disorders are encouraging and demonstrate a similar effectiveness between both in vivo and in virtuo exposures. The scarce investigations on generalized anxiety disorders and OCD also suggeste a similar effectiveness between these exposures. However, further scientific investigations are needed to support these preliminary findings. The attrition rates and deteriorating states are similar to classical CBT approaches. Nevertheless, scientific literature presents several limits: 1) much of the research on this topic has interest conflicts (e.g., developers are also authors of a large number of studies); 2) there is a high heterogeneity of materials and virtual environments used; 3) important measures are not always taken into account in scientific research (e.g., the presence feeling); and 4) a massive use of waiting lists as a control measure. Despite these limitations, the VRET have strong silver linings: 1) the easy access to exposure (less limited than standard exposure techniques) and a cost reduction; 2) highly guaranteed security; 3) the anonymization of exposures (i.e., the patients do not risk meeting someone they know during the exposure therapy); 4) the therapist has a greater control of exposures; 5) a standardization of the exposures; 6) a greater involvement in therapy for technophile patients. Virtual exposure also seems to be generally more accepted by patients. © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris

AB  - This study explored the views of non-psychiatric medical specialists about people with schizophrenia and depression and examined whether specialists’ approach to these clients, and their perception of dangerousness and social distance, differed by disorder. Non-psychiatric medical specialists working in community centers in Italy read either a schizophrenia or depression description and then completed a questionnaire on their views about people with that disorder. The schizophrenia-group (N = 114) was more sure than the depression-group (N = 97) that the patients should be approached differently in outpatient specialized clinics like those where the respondents worked; are incapable of caring for their own health; and are kept at distance by others. Perceived dangerousness did not significantly differ between the two groups. These findings highlight the potential effects of attitudes on medical practice and outline the need to educate non-psychiatric medical specialists on stigma as a strategy to reduce health discrepancies, particularly toward people diagnosed with schizophrenia. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - For adopted individuals, understanding the role of birth family is an important part of developing a coherent life narrative. However, there is limited empirical research on this aspect of the adoption experience. We introduce a new construct, birth family thoughts, that captures a sense of curiosity about birth family, and describe the development of an accompanying brief self-report measure, the Birth Family Thoughts Scale (BFTS). Across 4 studies of transnationally adopted Korean American adolescents, emerging adults, and adults who were adopted before the age of 3 (ncombined = 546), we found strong support for a 1-factor structure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Convergent validity was generally supported. The BFTS was positively related to measures of adoption- and ethnicity-related constructs, although there were a few inconsistencies between studies and measures. Discriminant validity also was generally supported. We found no evidence for the BFTS being related to a poor adoptive family situation or an indication of psychopathology. We did find some evidence of the BFTS relating to internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, while the BFTS was unrelated to travel to Korea, it was correlated with visiting an orphanage in Korea. It was also related to initiating a birth family search in Study 1, but not in Studies 2 or 3. We discuss the importance of considering birth family thoughts across the life span and with other populations, as well as the limitations of the current study including sampling issues inherent in working with hard-to-reach populations. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Objectives: Using data from black and white adults enrolled in a community-based, multi-city cohort assembled in the mid-1980s, we examined whether reported experiences of interpersonal racial and gender discrimination differentially impacted on future cardiovascular health (CVH) depending on gendered race and the setting in which the interactions were reported to have occurred. Methods: Discrimination in eight possible settings was assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination scale at year 7; CVH two decades later was examined using a modified Life’s Simple 7 score, with higher scores indicating better health. Separate multivariable linear regressions evaluated the associations between reports of racial and gender discrimination and CVH score in each possible setting stratified by gendered race. Results: Mean (SD) CVH scores at year 30 were 7.8(1.9), 8.1(1.8), 8.9(2. 0), and 8.8(1.8) among black women, black men, white women, and white men, respectively. For black women, reporting both racial and gender discrimination while receiving medical care was associated with lower CVH score. Among black men, reporting both forms of discrimination while getting a job, at work, at school, and receiving medical care was associated with lower CVH score. Among whites, reported discrimination while obtaining housing and by the police or courts (women), and in public and at work (men), was associated with a lower CVH score. Conclusions: The setting in which discrimination is reported may be an important indicator of whether discriminatory experiences are negatively associated with CVH, providing insight on distinct effect pathways among black and white women and men. © 2020, W.

AB  - Hundreds of violent incidents of anti-immigrant hate crimes have been recorded in South Africa over the past two decades. Understanding how the public views this issue helps us better understand how it can be resolved. The paper identifies determinants of public attitudes towards anti-xenophobia strategies. Data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey for the period 2015–2018 were used for this study. Using these data, the link between anti-immigrant sentiment and lay attributes of anti-immigrant violence can be mapped. The results show that most citizens externalise the causes of this kind of hate crime and blame the victims (i.e., foreigners) for the conflict. What people believe about the etiology of an intergroup conflict was found to influence their desire for conflict resolution as well as the type of solutions preferred. Victim blaming was found to predict the adoption of prejudicial solutions to anti-immigrant hate crime (such as the mass expulsion of foreign nationals). If an individual attributed the violence to the internal attributes (e.g., emotional factors or beliefs about foreign nationals) of the perpetrators, they were more likely to adopt progressive solutions (such as education and awareness campaigns). © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Scholarly discourse has raised concerns about the gravitas of secular mindfulness trainings in promoting prosocial outgrowths, as these trainings lack ethics-based concepts found in contemplative traditions. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to test whether mindfulness trainings absent explicit ethics-based instructions promote prosocial action. There was a range of small to medium standardized mean difference effect sizes of mindfulness training on overt acts of prosociality when compared with active and inactive controls, k = 29, N = 3,100, g =.426, 95% confidence interval (CI)(g) = [.304,.549]. Reliable effect size estimates were found for single-session interventions that measured prosocial behavior immediately after training. Mindfulness training also reliably promotes compassionate (but not instrumental or generous) helping and reliably reduces prejudice and retaliation. Publication bias analyses indicated that the reliability of these findings was not wholly dependent on selective reporting. Implications for the science of secular mindfulness training on prosocial action are discussed. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - The current work investigates race-based biases in conceptualization of the facial appearance of police. We employ a reverse correlation procedure to demonstrate that Black Americans, relative to White Americans, conceptualize police officers’ faces as more negative, less positive, and more dominant. We further find that these differential representations have implications for interactions with police. When naïve participants (of various races) viewed images of police officers generated by Black Americans (relative to those generated by White Americans), they responded with greater anticipated anxiety and reported more fight-or-flight behavioral intentions. Across four studies, findings suggest Black and White Americans conceptualize police and police–citizen interactions fundamentally differently. These findings have important theoretical (e.g., using reverse correlation to document the mental representations held by minority group members) and practical implications (e.g., identifying race-based differences in representations of police that may affect community–police relations). © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This paper offers a conceptually informed analysis of fostering and adoption social work and argues for more consistent inclusion of trans and non-binary people. The conceptual framework through which we explore current policy and practice is set out to provide clarity about the ways in which we employ the concepts of trans, gender diversity, and cisgenderism (a prejudicial ideology). We employ the notion of cisgenderism as a critical lens through which to overview fostering and adoption social work within the context of trans inclusion. Focus is turned to the existing literature relevant to trans parenting, trans-headed families, and the field of fostering and adopting. We highlight significant knowledge gaps in this regard. We then argue that if fostering and adoption social work is to embody inclusive practice with trans people, a new culture must be embedded to promote collaborative working, enhance knowledge, and improve service provision. The paper concludes by asserting that such an approach must be underpinned by an understanding, acceptance, and appreciation of people who identify as trans and/or as non-binary. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Psychology has begun contributing to social theory by providing empirical measures of actually existing cosmopolitanism that complements more purely theoretical conceptions of the construct common in philosophy and sociology. Drawing from two waves of research on representative adult samples from 19 countries (N = 8740), metric invariance was found for the three factors of cosmopolitan orientation (COS): cultural openness (CO), global prosociality (GP), and respect for cultural diversity (RCD). In terms of etiology, among Wave 1 measures, the personality factor of agreeableness was the best predictor of the cosmopolitan factors of GP and RCD at Wave 2, whereas openness of personality best predicted CO. Wave 1 measures of education, political liberalism, and self-reported social status independently also explained a small amount of variance in COS. Functionally, COS was shown to predict less prejudice against immigrants, and more support for global civil society, even after controlling for social dominance orientation. All three COS factors independently predicted better attitudes towards immigrants. GP was the best predictor of trust in the United Nations, whereas RCD was the best predictor of support for environmental protection. The three-factor model of COS appears well-calibrated for assessing actually existing cosmopolitanism across cultures. © 2020 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - The coming out process is an important component of gay identity development (Troiden 1988) because it allows for an opportunity to overcome feelings of shame and increase self-acceptance (Eliason and Schope 2007). Given the importance of being openly gay (compared to not-openly gay), two experiments were performed. Experiment 1 examined whether heterosexual people’s evaluations of gay individuals are influenced by their outness levels. Experiment 1 recruited 295 U.S. MTurk participants who read a vignette describing either an openly gay or not-openly gay individual. Results illustrate that openly gay targets were evaluated more favorably than not-openly gay targets. Experiment 2 examined whether the reasons justifying the level of outness influence such evaluations. Experiment 2 recruited 492 U.S. MTurk participants who read a vignette describing either an openly gay or not-openly gay individual who provided one of three reasons for their outness level: being true to oneself, honesty in a relationship, and societal prejudice. Results illustrate that the more strongly participants endorsed homonegativity, the less favorably they evaluated openly gay targets. Moreover, female participants perceived societal prejudice and honesty in a relationship as better reasons for outness than being true to oneself. Understanding how levels of outness and reasons for outness can influence evaluations by heterosexual people may help gay people navigate social situations and, perhaps, make informed decisions regarding when it is a safe or possibly unsafe to disclose a gay identity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As ecosystems do not follow human-made borders, cross-border environmental cooperation can be highly effective, perhaps even necessary, for both scientific insight and conservation efforts. Several environmental cooperation initiatives between Israel and Jordan emerged since the peace treaty of 1994. These initiatives had the explicit double goal of peacebuilding and enhancing regional environmental protection. However, as political relations between Israel and Jordan have been unstable and often tense during this period, cooperation toward these goals has often proved challenging. The current study investigates one such attempt at regional scientific environmental cooperation, specifically, cooperation between Jordanian and Israeli long-term socioecological research centers. Eleven in-depth interviews with Israeli and Jordanian scientists, who constitute all the participating scientists in this initiative, were conducted in order to identify the benefits and challenges of their cross-border collaboration. A thematic analysis of the interview contents was then performed to compare the results with models and theories pertaining to intergroup relations from the field of social psychology, theories that are particularly relevant to this case study because they see collaboration toward a common goal as especially productive for decreasing intergroup prejudice and hostility. Specifically, Allport's (1954) "contact theory", and its derivatives in this context, were discussed, which asserts that personal contact between members of different groups leads to less intergroup prejudice and decreases intergroup hostility. Other social psychologists have developed Allport's work and argue that decategorization (seeing people as individuals rather than groups) and recategorization (perceiving people from both groups as belonging to the same metagroup) are 2 additional important processes that are necessary to reduce intergroup tensions and that find support in the current investigation. The study concludes by proposing a model that describes group-identity factors, as well as other factors, contributing to the success and failure of cross-border scientific environmental initiatives in areas of regional conflict. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - What motivates majority group members to adapt to or reject cultural diversity? Considering the relevance of personal values on our attitudes and behaviours, we inspected how self-protection and growth predict levels of discriminatory behavioural and cultural adaptation intentions towards migrants via intergroup contact and perceived intergroup threats, simultaneously (i.e., parallel mediation). Specifically, positive contact between groups is known for reducing prejudice through diminishing perceived intergroup threats. Yet current research emphasises the role of individual differences in this interplay while proposing a parallel relationship between perceived intergroup threats and contact. Also by inspecting cultural adaptation and discriminatory behavioural intentions, the present study examined more proximal indicators of real-world intergroup behaviours than explored in past research. Using data from 304 US Americans, structural equation modelling indicated a good fit for a parallel mediation model with growth relating positively to cultural adaptation intentions and negatively to discriminatory behavioural intentions through being positively associated with intergroup contact and negatively with perceived intergroup threats, simultaneously. The reverse was found for self-protection. These findings stress that personal values constitute a relevant individual difference in the contact/threats-outcome relationship, providing a motivational explanation for majority group members' experience of cultural diversity in their own country. © 2019 International Union of Psychological Science

AB  - To explore barriers to specialty substance abuse treatment programs among women with recent substance use disorders by race/ethnicity. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 28 women of White, Black, and Latino racial/ethnic descent who reported a substance use disorder in the past 5 years. Interviews were conducted by telephone and were audio-recorded. A codebook was developed using the Theory of Planned Behavior to code and identify barriers within the domains of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control toward specialty treatment. Frequencies for coded themes were then compared across all participants and by race/ethnicity. We identified several key differences in barriers to treatment by race/ethnicity. Attitudinal barriers were more pervasive among the narratives of Latinas relative to Black and White women. Latinas were more likely to report not needing treatment and that treatment would not be effective; Latinas were the only group to describe cultural barriers to treatment. Within the subjective norms domain, namely stigma and lack of support, were key barriers. Stigma was more pervasive among the narratives of Latinas and Black women than White women; Latinas were more likely to report a lack of social support for using treatment than both Black and White women. Findings provide deeper insight into barriers that may be contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment among women. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Research has shown that adolescents’ intergroup attitudes are subject to friends’ influence, but it remains unknown if certain friends are more influential than others. Popular adolescents may be especially influential of their friends’ intergroup attitudes because they can set peer norms. We examined several indicators of popularity in social networks as possible determinants of social influence: sociometric popularity, prestige popularity, being a clique leader, and frequency of contact with friends. Longitudinal analysis of adolescents’ friendship networks (12–13 years, N = 837) allowed estimating influence of friends on adolescents’ intergroup attitudes, while controlling for the tendency of adolescents to befriend peers with similar intergroup attitudes. Results showed that adolescents’ intergroup attitudes changed in the direction of friends’ intergroup attitudes. Only peers who are popular in terms of having many friends (sociometric popular) were especially influential of their friends’ intergroup attitudes. These findings may inform future interventions aiming to reduce prejudice. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Desecrating a national symbol is a powerful means of protest or of showing antipathy for a national group, but how do such actions impact ingroup favoritism? We investigated this issue via two field studies conducted prior to the France versus Ireland (Study 1, N = 72) and France versus Germany (Study 2, N = 165) matches at the Euro 2016 soccer tournament. We asked French participants to imagine the ingroup/competition outgroup flag being burnt by ingroup/competition outgroup perpetrators. Imagining the ingroup flag being burnt increased proingroup bias through increase in either ingroup favoritism (Study 1) or outgroup derogation (for all outgroups, including those unconnected with the threat; Study 2). Perpetrators’ group membership did not have the expected moderating effect. We discuss the implications of these results for social identity defense strategies and for the consequences of intragroup versus intergroup threats. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A growing body of research has shown that imagined intergroup contact can improve outgroup attitudes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted form of imagined contact in counteracting bullying in school children, and additionally to test the underlying processes of this effect. Two hundred and fifteen Italian elementary school children took part in a 3-week intervention, where they were asked to imagine a scenario in which they become friends with an unknown disabled child, interact in various social settings, and react to forms of discrimination toward the newly acquired friend. After each session, they discussed collectively what they had imagined. The dependent measures were administered 1 week after the last session. Results revealed that inclusion of an outgroup member in the self mediated the effect of imagined contact on intentions to counteract social exclusion and bullying of disabled children, as well as helping intentions. Imagined contact also promoted greater willingness for outgroup contact via more positive outgroup attitudes and empathy. Our findings are important in delineating new forms of imagined contact, and understanding ways to promote behaviors that defend victims of social exclusion and bullying in school environments. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Asian American youth’s inclusion decisions were investigated in cross-ethnic peer contexts (Asian and non-Asian). Ten-, 13-, and 16-year-old participants (N = 134), enrolled in U.S. schools, decided whether to include a same-ethnic peer with different interests or a different-ethnic peer with similar interests. Findings showed that with age, participants more frequently included a peer who shared interests even when this peer was not of the same ethnicity. Participants expected their peer groups to be equally inclusive of others of both ethnic backgrounds, and expected that in-group parents would be less inclusive of cross-ethnic peers. In addition, adolescents expected parents to have prejudicial attitudes about ethnic out-group members. Views about peer group and in-group parents’ inclusivity diverged from adolescents’ own inclusivity. These findings point to areas for intervention regarding the promotion of cross-group friendships and the reduction of prejudice. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - There is anecdotal and empirical evidence for black cat bias, the phenomenon where cats (Felis silvestris catus) with black coats are viewed more negatively, adopted less often, and euthanized more often than lighter colored cats. Despite the anecdotal claims, there is scarce empirical evidence for black cat bias. Using evaluations of cat photos, the researchers examined differences in people’s attitudes toward black and non-black cats of various colorations on measures of perceived aggression, perceived friendliness, and willingness to adopt. The researchers also explored whether participants’ levels of religiosity, superstitious beliefs, and prejudicial racial attitudes were related to black cat bias. Finally, the researchers explored whether black cat bias was related to difficulties people had in reading the emotions of black cats compared to non-black cats. This study provided evidence of black cat bias in the sample. People exhibiting higher degrees of black cat bias had higher levels of superstition, but not religiosity or racial prejudice. Additionally, people who had difficulty reading the emotions of black cats tended to exhibit a stronger bias against adopting black cats. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The development of social gerontology has led to the emergence of its own terminology and conceptual armoury. 'Ageism' has been a key concept in articulating the mission of gerontology and was deliberately intended to act as an equivalent to the concepts of racism and sexism. As a term, it has established itself as a lodestone for thinking about the de-valued and residualised social status of older people in contemporary society. Given this background, ageism has often been used to describe an overarching ideology that operates in society to the detriment of older people and which in large part explains their economic, social and cultural marginality. This paper critiques this approach and suggests an alternative based upon the idea of the social imaginary of the fourth age. It argues that not only is the idea of ageism too totalising and contradictory but that it fails to address key aspects of the corporeality of old age. Adopting the idea of a social imaginary offers a more nuanced theoretical approach to the tensions that are present in later life without reducing them to a single external cause or explanation. In so doing, this leaves the term free to serve, in a purely descriptive manner, as a marker of prejudice. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the subtle and blatant prejudice scale toward indigenous people in Argentina and its relationship with right wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, tolerance for disagreement, ideological-political self-positioning, sex and age. A sample of 304 participants from Buenos Aires was selected using a non-probabilistic incidental method. Participants were aged from 18 to 41 years and they were asked to fill a self-report questionnaire including an Argentinean version of the subtle and blatant prejudice toward indigenous people scale together with right wing authoritarianism scale, social dominance orientation scale, tolerance for disagreement scale, ideological-political self-positioning scale. We found adequate psychometrics properties for the subtle and blatant prejudice scale, as well as significant and positive correlations with right wing authoritarianism, tolerance for disagreement, social dominance orientation and political self-placement. These findings may indicate that prejudice towards indigenous people in Argentina is a complex problem that cannot be explained only by considering intergroup relations, because different socio-psychological variables are related with its consolidation and maintenance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One promising approach for reducing affective polarization is priming a shared American identity and one promising event to prime that identity is the 4th of July. Prior work showed that proximity to the 4th of July reduced affective polarization. We conceptually replicated this study using a 9-wave longitudinal design in 2019. We found no short-term or long-term effects of the 4th of July on social distance from partisan and ideological ingroups or outgroups. Notably, our within-subjects design was able to identify the existence of individual differences in social distance trajectories across time, but there were not individual differences in short-terms changes in social distance in close proximity to the 4th of July. Additional analyses, did not find consistent predictors of these individual differences, suggesting a clear gap for future studies. Although priming a shared American identity may be effective, these findings suggest that the salutary effects of the 4th of July holiday do not emerge in 2019. © 2020 University of California Press.

AB  - Myriad social groups are targets of hostile and benevolent (i.e., ambivalent) prejudice. However, prejudice toward gay men is typically conceptualized as hostile, despite the prevalence of benevolence toward gay men in popular media. This article aims to compare gay men with other targets of ambivalent prejudice (i.e., women and elderly people) and draw on the stereotype content and microaggressions literatures in order to develop a theory of ambivalent homoprejudice. The resultant framework, comprising repellent, adversarial, romanticized, and paternalistic homoprejudice was investigated using seven focus groups of heterosexuals and gay men (N = 22), and the findings were consistent with stereotype content theory. Directions for future research into the deleterious effects of ambivalent homoprejudice and possible empowering interventions are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper explores the interface between the fields of Education and Communication with respect to developing narratives that can identify leadership among women who live daily with social inequalities and violence. These studies, debates, and research took place at the AFRODIÁSPORAS Research Center on Black Women, Audiovisual Culture, and Educommunication in Urban Peripheries at the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) School of Education from Baixada Fluminense (FEBF), Duque de Caxias city, RJ, Brazil. Two studies were chosen as examples of the specific leadership developed by black women using concepts from Education, Communication, Intersectionality, and a daily struggle against prejudice and racism. The first study reports the experiences of a black deaf woman who teaches sign language alongside the history and culture of black deaf people. The second introduces a young black filmmaker who produces new portrayals of the Baixada Fluminense (BF) region. Findings: Both studies show the authorship of the interviewees, demonstrating that education and black consciousness empower people to become leaders who respond to social exclusion. Non-formal education has been employed as a method to propagate narratives refuting stereotypes and colonial beliefs that still appear on the curriculum of formal education and in hegemonic media. These two young black women are protagonists, educommunicators, social activists, and leaders. © Copyright © 2020 Malachias, Laudino and Balbino.

AB  - The current transnational climate (British Council, 2014) in Europe is likely to continue to generate institutional and classroom situations which dictate that difference and otherness be the norm rather than the exception. Unfortunately, in the 1960's, Black and minority ethnic (BME) migrants from the former British colonies had less-than-favorable educational experiences in Britain due to prejudice and stereotyping mainly arising from cultural differences. Since then there have been a plethora of studies, policies, and reports regarding the perpetuation of discrimination in educational institutions. Today, British higher educational institutions have finally begun to recognize the need to reduce progression and attainment gaps. However, their focus tends to only consider the student “Black and Minority Ethnic attainment gap” with almost no attention being given to educators', or more specifically there is a distinctive lack of thought given to the female BME educators' progression and attainment in British HEIs. As such, this paper draws theoretically and conceptually on critical cultural autoethnography, to illustrate the value of conducting research into a female's BME educators' personal and professional experiences, and “gives voice to previously silenced and marginalized experiences” (Boylorn and Orbe, 2014, p. 15). In doing so, I highlight how higher educational institutions underutilisation of such competencies and contributions have and continue to perpetuate BME underachievement. I conclude the paper by questioning the accountability of providing support for BME educators progression and attainment, challenge educational leaders to consider the value and utilization of cultural knowledge, and implore all educators to reflect on how their personal experiences influence their professional identity. © Copyright © 2020 Kappert.

AB  - Over the course of development, children acquire adult-like thinking about social categories such as race, which in turn informs their perceptions, attitudes, and behavior. However, children’s developing perceptions of race have been understudied particularly with respect to their potential influence on cross-race egalitarianism. Specifically, the acquisition of racial constancy, defined as the perception that race is a concrete and stable category, has been associated with increased awareness of racial stereotypes and group status differences. Yet, little work has investigated behavioral outcomes stemming from the acquisition of racial constancy beliefs. Here, we investigate whether the presence or absence of racial constancy beliefs differentially predicts inequality aversion with racial ingroup versus outgroup members for young children. White children (N = 202; ages 3–8) completed three sticker resource-allocation games with either a White or a Black partner shown in a photograph, after which racial constancy was measured. Results revealed that the acquisition of racial constancy interacted with partner race to predict inequality aversion outcomes in one game; however, age and gender also exerted strong effects. © Copyright © 2020 Gaither, Perlin and Doan.

AB  - How individuals divide resources between themselves and another person is influenced both by their social value orientation (SVO) and the emotions they expect to feel when dividing resources (anticipated emotions). Research has also shown that individuals favor members of their own group (ingroup) over individuals from other groups (outgroup) when allocating resources. The Malaysian multi-ethnic population is a highly relevant context to study the combined effects of intergroup relations and SVO on anticipated emotions and resource allocation. The current studies recruited Malaysian participants to examine whether anticipated emotions and allocation behavior are influenced by the ethnic identity of the person receiving the allocation. Participants completed an SVO measure and rated how they would feel if they were to share resources equally or unequally. They then made allocations between themselves and an ingroup or outgroup member in an economic game. There was no evidence of ingroup favoritism in anticipated emotions and allocation behavior. This may have been due to impression management, social desirability concerns, and/or the use of a population with socially liberal attitudes. The results nevertheless provide support for the notion that anticipated emotions play a key role in resource allocation decisions. © Copyright © 2020 Bono, van der Schalk and Manstead.

AB  - Stuttering is a disorder in oral communication that is often accompanied by negative stereotypes and social stigma. The primary goal of the present study was to examine whether opposite-sex perceivers rated the romantic desirability of targets who stuttered differently than targets who did not stutter. We were also interested in examining whether perceptions of the target (i.e., extraversion, emotional stability, self-esteem, and intelligence) would mediate the associations between stuttering and romantic desirability in a zero-acquaintance situation. Results showed that targets who stuttered were perceived to be less romantically desirable than targets who did not stutter. Further, the negative association between stuttering and romantic desirability was mediated by the perceived extraversion, self-esteem, and intelligence of the targets. Discussion will focus on the implications of these results for the understanding of the negative halo effect for stuttering. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 and of dying from it increases with age. This statistical association has led to numerous highly problematic policy suggestions and comments revealing underlying ageist attitudes and promoting age discrimination. Such attitudes are based on negative stereotypes on the health and functioning of older adults. As a result, the lives of older people are disvalued, including in possible triage situations and in the potential limitation of some measures against the spread of the pandemic to older adults. These outcomes are unjustified and unethical. We develop six propositions against the ageism underlying these suggestions to spur a more adequate response to the current pandemic in which the needs and dignity of older people are respected. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We show that educational outcomes of sexual minorities are consistent with efforts to mediate future discrimination. Gay men and lesbians obtain more years of schooling than heterosexual men and women, between 0.6 and 1.2 years. This difference is robust to controlling for observable characteristics for men but not women. Gay men and lesbian women also complete different college majors. Gay men are more likely to choose majors with lower levels of prejudice, higher levels of workplace independence, and occupations that emphasize relationships even though they pay less. Similarly, lesbian women choose majors with less prejudice and more workplace independence. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The impact of yoga on body image and embodiment has been a recent area of focus in the field of body image and eating disorders. This paper comprises a theoretical discussion of how the practice of yoga can lead to positive ways of inhabiting the body, specifically through the lens of the Developmental Theory of Embodiment. Yoga may enhance the overall experience of embodiment, by having a positive impact on each of its five dimensions: body connection and comfort, agency and functionality, attuned self-care, subjective immersion (resisting objectification), and experience and expression of desires. The article therefore describes examples of teacher-related practices during yoga that can enhance each of these dimensions. Further, yoga teachers can consider the varied protective physical and social factors delineated by the Developmental Theory of Embodiment to facilitate positive embodiment. Future research should explicitly integrate embodiment theory with yoga interventions, as well as measures that assess both possible mechanisms of change and positive ways of living in the body. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article examines a group of Chinese students’ diverse participation in teacher–student interactions involving gender and sexuality topics in ESL classrooms in the UK. The findings indicate that the Chinese students have experienced transformations of the performance of gender. Some students strategically incorporate new gender performances in ESL classrooms that they find useful for social and academic gains. However, when facing new gender performances which are undesirable or stereotyped, some students display a strong sense of agency and resistance, even at a price of sacrificing opportunities of engaging in classroom discussions. The intersection of gender and sexuality in the ESL classroom interaction offers Chinese students the opportunities to explore a variety of progressive and non-progressive gender and sexual roles that men and women occupy in Britain. But some ill-prepared ESL teachers deal with issues of gender and sexuality with prejudicial heterosexist or homophobic attitudes, which may mislead students and have a negative impact on their learning and gender and sexual identity construction. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined whether people who stutter would associate biological and non-biological explanations of stuttering with the endorsement of stereotypes about people who stutter, prognostic expectations for the reduction of stuttering, feelings of guilt, self-blame, and shame about stuttering, and agency for speech modification. Method: This was a cross-sectional study including 372 adults who stutter. Participants completed a web survey with scales that measured their agreement with biological and non-biological models of stuttering; their endorsement of common stereotypes for people who stutter; prognostic expectations for reduced stuttering; feelings of guilt, self-blame, and shame about stuttering; and feelings of agency in their ability to modify their speech. Result: Biological explanations for stuttering were significantly correlated with reduced stereotype endorsement about people who stutter, lower prognostic expectations for reducing stuttering, and reduced feelings of guilt and self-blame regarding stuttering. Non-biological explanations for stuttering were significantly correlated with increased endorsement of negative stereotypes about people who stutter, increased prognostic expectations for reducing stuttering, and increased feelings of guilt, self-blame, and shame about stuttering. Conclusion: It is concluded that the implications of biological framing of stuttering among people who stutter are complex and should be well thought out by professionals. Explaining stuttering as biological, but responsive to personal and environmental influences, may lead to reduced guilt and self-blame, while at the same time fostering feelings of agency for speech modification. © 2019 The Speech Pathology Association of Australia Limited.

AB  - Much of the existing literature on intergroup attitudes in preschool does not look at the intersections of race and gender. Integrating key developmental and social theories, the current study asked 58 diverse preschoolers (31 white, 27 non-white) to make decisions about other children when given only racial and gender information. The preschoolers were shown pictures of Black and white boys and girls and were asked who would hit or help. The entire sample was more likely to select the ‘both’ option for girls on the prosocial behaviour rather than the aggressive behaviour. Participant race mattered for preschoolers who showed some sort of bias (i.e. chose a single picture rather than the both or neither option) but only when looking at girl pictures. In short, white participants showed favouritism towards the same-race girl, while non-white participants favoured the other-race girl. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study builds from the implicit theory of creative individuals to an understanding of the social perceptions of creative individuals. Stereotypes and prejudice about creative students were examined utilizing the self-developed stereotype and prejudice scales among German adolescents. The results indicate that German adolescents hold positive images of creative students, seeing them as competent, warm and popular. Their primary perception of a creative student was admiration, which could be predicted by their stereotypes. In addition, the gender and age effects on adolescents’ social perception were examined. The results show that boys and girls tend to expect the creative student to be the same gender as themselves; and the ratings of stereotype and prejudice in the pre-teens group were significantly higher than in the teens group. These findings provide a refined image of creative individuals from a social perception perspective and partially explain the observed variations due to gender and age factors. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article discusses two complementary themes that play an important role in contemporary South African political philosophy: (1) the racist tradition in Western philosophy; and (2) the role of ubuntu in regaining an authentic African identity, which was systematically suppressed during the colonial past and apartheid. These are also leading themes in Mogobe Ramose’s African Philosophy Through Ubuntu. The first part concentrates on John Locke. It discusses the thesis that the reprehensible racism of many founders of liberal political philosophy has lethally infected liberal theory. This view neglects the distinction between genesis and justification. Political liberalism has since cleansed itself of the prejudices of its spiritual ancestors. Liberal human rights exclude racism as a matter of principle. The second part discusses the claim that the ubuntu philosophy provides a better basis for a constitution in a modern society than political liberalism. A major problem is that ubuntu is an essentially contested concept. Some philosophers consider ubuntu to be a moribund notion (Matolino); others see it as a vital concept par excellence. In the latter case, it is elaborated from sundry incompatible political views, ranging from African nationalism (Ramose) via humanist communitarianism (Metz) to liberalism (Mboti). Conclusion: as an essentially contested ideological concept, ubuntu should not be a decisive constitutional standard for the application of state force. In contrast, the constitutional model of political liberalism provides a reasonable alternative, as it is designed precisely to solve the problem of social plurality and ideological contest. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This article proposes to observe the relationship between the legacy of Constantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht in Brazil, from the 1950s to the present, demarking the influences of both in the transformation of acting practices in the country as established from two moments: first, the construction of an inaugural epic mode of acting in the left-wing experience of the theatre company Teatro de Arena in São Paulo from 1953 to 1972; and second, the ”new” acting of performers in contemporary variations on a public, democratic, and experimental theatre in dialogue with the social and political dilemmas of Brazil, specifically in Cia Livre, Cia Bartolomeu, and Cia São Jorge. This analysis will enable us to discuss how the arrival of Brecht merged with the dissemination of Stanislavski’s newly introduced practices in the country, in a conjunction that led to the invention of a hybridized and particularly Brazilian way of acting. We will also examine how the re-emergence of a political theatre, after the slow reopening of the country in the late 1980s that succeeded the Brazilian Civilian-Military Coup in 1964, brought back the “need for Brecht” as well as the “need for Stanislavski”, both of which were embraced by the young artists of the national theatre without prejudice towards specific acting styles. Thereafter, we can glimpse contributions of what we consider to be the inherent plasticity of Brecht and Stanislavski’s legacies to the mutability of the art of acting. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The De La Salle University (DLSU) Libraries organised the first Human Library in the Philippines in August 2014. The initial target audience were undergraduate and graduate students of the University. In 2016, the Integrated School Libraries organised Human Library sessions for grade school, junior high school, and senior high school students. The activity allowed them to engage with human books actively, facilitating an innovative learning experience. This paper describes the Human Library program of the DLSU Integrated School Libraries. The program aims to promote respectful dialogue between human books and students, foster the culture of diversity and difference, and reduce prejudice and discrimination against people with different social and cultural backgrounds. The program has been integrated with the school curriculum, thus allowing students to have the opportunity to dialogue with human books from different backgrounds, such as people with a tattoo, members of LGBTQ community, people with mental health issues, people with bipolar disorder, and people with eating disorders among others. Through this learning experience, students are expected to appreciate diversity and are more open-minded at an early age, be more accepting and kinder to others, empathetic, and respectful. . © 2020 Candy May N.

AB  - When addressing the pernicious effects of racial discrimination, majority white psychoanalysts and psychotherapists like to believe that their psychological awareness enables them to avoid engaging in prejudice and racism. As a result, when asked to acknowledge their implication in systemic racism, powerful counter-reactions from shame and guilt to feelings of vulnerability and discomfort result. Meaningful dialogue about white racism and the effects of coloniality in Canada and the United States requires acknowledging the limits of understanding, to be unsettled and ultimately to embrace discomfort. It also requires an awareness of the history of prejudice and racism and its impact on the disciplines of psychology, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - COVID-19 is unique in that it is spread through everyday contact with other people. Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people’s way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people’s basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society. © 2020 The Institute of Urban Sciences.

AB  - This paper considers what is shared by voice-hearers in the Hearing Voices Movement (HVM) and by service-users in art therapy. Both highlight what they see as the value of acceptance, peer-support, and clear collaborative communication. The paper considers how research and literature informed by lived-experience in the HVM and, UK art therapy might strengthen practice. Life-stories by voice-hearers, included in the HVM literature, explain what has helped them and what is meant by acceptance within the movement. For those voice-hearers with a psychosis-related diagnosis, joining HVM could mean they find hope, even though the diagnosis means that they may face deep prejudice and some of their unusual experiences are frightening. The paper also looks at what art therapy clients voice as helpful: the support found in group work; art-making; and honest, collaborative styles of communication overlaps with much that is described and explored in the work of HVM. Although much smaller in scope, feedback given by art therapists to a professional regional-group provides additional indications that the profession is responsive to service-user perspectives, collaborative work, and to HVM. Plain-language summary This paper considers the Hearing Voices Movement in relation to adult mental health. Often people who hear voices receive a psychiatric diagnosis for which the primary treatment is medication. These diagnoses are known as ‘psychosis-related’. In the psychiatric system, voice-hearers are not usually encouraged to speak about their unusual experiences. In the Hearing Voices Movement, those who hear voices are encouraged to speak about their voices and other unusual experiences and to find ways of coping with them. This paper looks at the literature of the Hearing Voices Movement to explore what ‘accepting voices’ means and how this may be relevant for art therapy clients. People who hear voices, family members, friends, health professionals, and social workers make up the movement and, they are all asked to work alongside one another in the interests of authentic collaboration aimed at improving the lives of voice-hearers. The paper also looks at what is said in life-stories by voice-hearers about the value of acceptance, peer-support, and clear collaborative communication. Even though some people with a psychosis-related diagnosis are afraid of their experiences and face damaging prejudice, joining the Hearing Voices Movement can mean they find hope. Also, the art-making, group work, and honest, collaborative styles of communication valued by art therapy clients overlaps with much of the work and research of the Hearing Voices Movement. Being respectfully accepted as a voice-hearer seems to help people feel that they can work towards a sense of control, self-direction, and self-acceptance in their lives. Feedback given by art therapists to a professional regional-group offers indications that the art therapy profession is responsive to service-user perspectives, collaborative work, and to the Hearing Voices Movement. © 2020 British Association of Art Therapists.

AB  - This paper explores the large map as an innovative visual art tool in a frontline art therapy project with refugees. In a volatile and hostile setting on the France-UK border at Calais, inhospitable spaces, for a time, become human places, and the capacity to imagine both other (people) and somewhere other (place) become possible. Within this emergency setting, a safe space is temporarily activated. In the complicated times in which we live, art therapists are uniquely positioned to offer crisis support to people in diverse contexts with ethical and imaginative practice, using both their psychological skills and the art itself in equal weight. Critical examination of art therapy interventions is a necessary aspect of ethical practice and can lead to adaptations. This can feed into contemporary debates about how to deliver crisis intervention work, social action, social justice, as well as issues of definition. Dialogue, collaboration and co-production can open debate, challenge injustices and lead to social change. Social media as an extension of practice can serve as a further innovation and offer an alternative potential space, particularly in crisis contexts and where face-to-face work is not possible. Plain-language summary This paper looks at the role of the large map in an ongoing frontline art therapy project with refugees in Calais, northern France. The authors write about the border context in which the work takes place. They then present some thinking about the use of maps within this setting. This is followed by an example of the work in practice in the form of one Facebook post written in February 2019. The authors discuss the themes and ideas about space and materials emerging out of this extract. The authors propose that the innovative choice and application of materials, which helps to create a safe space in this border setting, can be translated into other physically and psychologically challenging contexts. The core tenets of art therapy practice and the skills brought by art therapists are needed now as much as ever. The paper also invites art therapists to think critically and imaginatively about the materials and media they choose in relation to their own wider work contexts with people. The authors suggest that an important part of the art therapy intervention in a difficult place needs to be about reflecting and adapting to context, which includes crisis support. This in turn supports a dialogue that can challenge injustices and lead to social change. The collaborative reflections about the work, written into blog posts during the return journeys from France back to the UK, form a second practice innovation. The posts are shared with an online audience and sometimes read, commented upon and further shared by those who use the service in Calais. The posts attempt to present creative, impactful narratives about the human aspect of the refugee experience. This is in contrast to the dominant media narratives in which refugees are often depicted with negative stereotypes. © 2020 British Association of Art Therapists.

AB  - Background: In Israeli colleges and universities, many Arab students experience acculturative stress. Such stress arises from the need to learn new cultural rules, manage the overarching conflict inherent in maintaining elements of their culture of origin (i.e., Arab culture) while incorporating elements of the host culture (i.e., Jewish academic culture), and deal with experiences of prejudice and discrimination present in the host culture. Methods: This study investigated the association between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms among 170 Arab undergraduates from northern and central Israel. It also explored the roles of sense of coherence and coping strategies in the relationship between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on acculturative stress, depressive symptoms, sense of coherence, coping strategies, and demographics. Results: The findings reveal gender differences in the use of different coping strategies and in levels of depressive symptoms. However, academic-year differences were found only in levels of sense of coherence and depressive symptoms. Specifically, female students expressed higher levels of both active and avoidant coping. Moreover, female students and those in their first and second years of university studies reported higher levels of depressive symptoms. Among the male students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms indirectly via sense of coherence and active coping. In contrast, among the female students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms both directly and indirectly via sense of coherence and avoidant coping. Among first-and second-year students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms indirectly via sense of coherence and avoidant coping. However, among third-and fourth-year students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms both directly and indirectly via sense of coherence. Conclusions: This article underscores the significance of gender and academic-year differences in pathways involving acculturative stress. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In the months since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed the world, numerous popular press articles have recounted cases of mistreatment toward others rooted in traits associated with the illness. These accounts are the latest repercussion of a long running “otherness” that Western society has attributed to Asian peoples. This article draws on existing theory to better understand how social stigmas and subsequently prejudice may present additional challenges as nations grapple with restrictions on individuals’ movement and move to more normal social interaction. A discussion of COVID-19 in the context of stigmatization, social identity, and social cognition theories offer a means to better understand how those impacted and stereotyped by the virus may also experience negative treatment by others. © 2020 Public Administration Theory Network.

AB  - In the face of movements like #me too and Time’s Up, clinicians are challenged to navigate the intricacies of socio-political multi-dimensionalities of prejudice and the ways prejudice weaves through various aspects of psychological work. In this paper, I suggest that the intersubjective experience of prejudice is a collapse of thirdness, a collapse of the dialectical recognition of sameness and difference, or self and other. Furthermore, leaning on principles of intersubjectivity and relational psychoanalysis, I also offer a refinement of the concept of thirdness in relation to prejudice by pointing to the need to bring into focus larger socio-political currents and layers of experience that are intricately woven into the fabric of thirdness, thus constituting a social thirdness. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding the clinical pertinence, as well as collapse and repair of social thirdness in the context of gender and sexuality. I will use several carefully disguised clinical examples to illustrate these ideas and their relevance to psychotherapeutic work. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Under the powerful influence of the Cartesian split, American psychotherapy theories usually take for granted the separation of the sociopolitical and the psychological. The intellectual movement referred to as The Interpretive Turn, composed of postmodernism and hermeneutics, directly opposes the split. Drawing from hermeneutic conceptions of the cultural clearing, the everyday social experience of similarity and difference, and Gadamer’s description of dialogue, psychotherapy can be thought of as an encounter with difference. This way of conceiving of therapy opposes the split and welcomes Kohut’s concept of the group self as an early approach to cultural history. This way of conceiving of similarity and difference aids in meeting the challenges—such as those related to race, gender, sexual orientation, and class—therapists confront in their everyday practices. It is also suggested that some therapists could engage in the role of public intellectual, thus bringing more psychologically sophisticated interpretations of our current political struggles over authoritarianism and democracy. In that way a hermeneutic cultural history could aid in combating the rise of neo-fascism in the United States and throughout the world, and in developing ways of building a more humane society dedicated to the well-being of all its inhabitants. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Despite the strong influence of religion in today’s world, religious education at university is rather sparse. Universities must be proactive in overcoming negative prejudices and combating symbolic and religious illiteracy that curbs appreciation of other cultural realities. This paper carries out a diagnosis of future social and educational agents in order to discover their attitudes to the challenge that they will have to face in the fostering of intercultural and interreligious dialogue. The results would lead us to believe that initial and continuous education should be introduced in order to foment a profound understanding of the religious dimension. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Although same-sex marriages are legally recognized in many Western societies, prejudices against gay men and lesbians remain and already appear in adolescents. Since a negative attitude toward gay men and lesbians is likely to foster malevolent behaviors, we investigated predictors of homonegativity in adolescents aged between 14 and 16 years. Regression analyses revealed that Muslim religious denomination–but not another or no religious denomination–and traditional gender roles substantially explained variance in homonegativity, followed by contact with gay and lesbians friends, religiosity, and gender. Migration background, socioeconomic status, and contact with homosexual family members were not found to be predictors of homonegativity. Implications of these findings are discussed, in particular, the importance of cautiously interpreting these correlational data that do not allow for a straightforward causal interpretation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The March 15th terrorist attack started a national dialogue about prejudice in New Zealand. Previous research has investigated attitudes towards Muslims in comparison to ethnic minorities. However, presently, there are no nationally representative studies in New Zealand systematically comparing attitudes to Muslims with attitudes to other religious groups. Here, we present evidence from the New Zealand edition of the International Social Survey Programme module on religion, a national postal survey (N = 1335) collected between September 2018 and February 2019. We assess perceived threat and negativity towards Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and Atheists. We find substantially greater perceived threat and negativity towards Muslims compared with other groups. In particular, older people, New Zealand Europeans, men, and those with more right-wing attitudes report greater threat and negativity towards Muslims. In line with previous studies, higher religious identification and higher education predict greater acceptance. Taken collectively, these results reveal that the Muslim Acceptance Gap in this country is substantial, and greater challenges for acceptance are evident among lower-educated, right-wing, older, secular, and male populations. The magnitude of this gap reveals a substantial challenge to the future of New Zealand where religious and secular people can live without evoking prejudice. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Utilizing the PEACE (Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences) model as a theoretical foundation, Instapals was a novel ageism reduction intervention with undergraduate students in a non-gerontology course that 1) provided aging education and 2) facilitated positive 1-to-1 intergenerational relationships with older adults (individuals 65+) through daily exchanges on Instagram for 30 days and two in-person meetings. Paired t-tests demonstrate a significant decrease in aging anxiety, psychological concerns about aging, and negative stereotyping of older adults. Results from coded open-ended responses suggest an overall positive experience with Instapals and more positive attitudes toward aging and older adults across a semester. Findings from the first test of Instapals, a theoretically-driven intervention, shows promise for reducing ageism among larger samples and in other settings. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - For Aristotle, seriousness is one of the loftiest qualities a human can acquire, requiring a level of refined practical judgment that rules an individual in private and public life. While Aristotle’s Politics is not known for its praise for the role of women’s rationality in society, he argues in this text that women can develop the sort of judgment to be serious, and that through this quality they play an important role in the regime, particularly through the experience of married life, for “it can be argued that even within her restricted domestic sphere the woman demonstrates considerably more virtue than Aristotle's official doctrine allows”. If romantic love is an important part of the human experience, and marriage is one manifestation of romantic love, understanding the ways that the human personality develops within the experiences of courtship and marriage is an important task. Moreover, understanding the ways that social structures can promote, or impede, the fostering of romantic love, is necessary to consider, especially if we take Aristotle’s insight into the importance of marriage to regimes seriously. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A social justice analysis of the circumstances of African-American boys and young men (AAB) reveals a pervasive pattern of negative stereotypes, disparate treatment, and resource deprivation that augur poorly for their development. Developmental science has yielded many insights about the deleterious sequelae of racism and economic disadvantage, but much less is known about AAB coping and adaptation. Adaptive Calibration and Positive Youth Development are offered as conceptual tools to redirect researcher to a focus on AAB’s hidden talents and to illuminate the social resources that contribute to positive outcomes. The Adaptive Calibration (AC) Model proposes that chronic adversity influences the development of overlooked competencies that facilitate successful adaptation in toxic environments. The Positive Youth Development framework highlights the propitious influence of familial and community assets that promote resilience and prosocial development in spite of chronic adversity. Social justice agenda can be advanced if these ideas are used to guide research. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Native American youth face a number of challenges that affect their academic success and wellbeing. In schools, Native American youth are presented with textbooks that include stereotyped and distorted information about their peoples’ history. However, there is a gap in the literature showing whether these textbooks contain microaggressive statements. The current study is a qualitative inquiry into five Montana history that explores the following questions: The first, are there microaggressions in history textbooks used across Montana, and the second–if there are microaggressions, what are those themes? Results of this study indicate that these books included 96 microinvalidations, 54 microinsults, and 11 microassaults. The themes of these microaggressive statements expanded beyond Sanchez’s (2007) original themes. In turn, this study discusses the results from a perspective of White privilege, and how educational consultants can help combat this prejudice engrained in curriculum. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Research adopting the ideological-conflict hypothesis indicates that low religiosity, nonbelief, and antireligious sentiments predict prejudice toward ideological opponents. How to understand this, from an individual differences perspective, given that nonbelievers are typically open-minded and low in authoritarianism? We investigated, among 422 UK adults, social distance from antiliberals (antigay activists), fundamentalists, and religionists of major world religions (Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism). Nonbelievers showed prejudice toward all religious targets–but not toward an ethnic outgroup (Chinese). Furthermore, antireligious sentiment implied (1) valuing rationality and, in turn, social distance from fundamentalists and (2) low empathy and low belief in the benevolence of others and the world and, in turn, social distance from religionists. Finally, (3) valuing liberty predicted social distance from antiliberals but failed to mediate the effect of antireligious sentiment. Though general processes (e.g., perceived threat) explain all prejudices, specific individual differences seem to distinguish nonbelievers’ and believers’ prejudice toward each other. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Czech society has been increasingly more liberal toward LGBTI individuals and their parenting rights, although the Czech legislative system still does not treat same-sex couples equally to heterosexual couples. Attitudes of professionals who work with children and families are particularly important, as prejudice might be harmful in these circumstances. The present study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of future psychologists, participants were 164 psychology students from a university in Prague, the Czech Republic. They were presented with a vignette depicting a situation of a couple in a restaurant with their 4-year-old son who gets upset during the meal. The vignette was followed by a set of Likert scale items evaluating the parents’ and the child’s behaviour. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the eight versions of the vignette varying by the way how the couple solved the situation, the sexual orientation of the parents, and the gender of the acting parent. Overall, the couples were rated more favourably in the positive parenting situation than in the negative, and participants evaluated gay and lesbian parents more favourably than heterosexual parents. Results are discussed taking into account specific sample characteristics and the social climate regarding LGBTI rights in the Czech society. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A large body of research documents sexual prejudice towards sexual minority people, but less is known about perceptions of and attitudes towards same-sex behaviours that are not tied to self-identified sexual identities. This gap in the literature is alarming given the growing number of people who identify outside of lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), and heterosexual category labels. In the current study, 356 participants were randomly assigned to evaluate a student who varied by gender (woman or man), sexual identity (heterosexual, lesbian, or gay), and sexual behaviour (sexual activity with women or men). Drawing on branched and coincident language posed by sexual configurations theory, targets who had branched configurations (e.g., heterosexual-identified men who engaged in same-sex behaviours) were more likely than those with coincident configurations to be labelled with an identity that did not reflect their self-reported sexual identities. Participants desired greater social distance from those who reported a branched configuration, and heterosexual-identified men were the only target group to have their masculinity affected by having a branched configuration. We hope this research will spark greater interest in considering ‘grey’ areas of sexuality in the psychological study of gender and sexual orientation. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Racial attitudes can be shaped by personal attributes and social network properties. Literature on White social work students’ racial attitudes remains scarce. The purposes of this study are to explore racial attitudes among social work students and identify personal and social network correlates of such attitudes. One hundred and sixty-three White social work students in a major Midwest public university were recruited via social work electronic mailing list to complete an anonymous online survey measuring personal-level characteristics (e.g., demographic information and racial attitudes as measured by the color-blind racial attitude scale) and social network composition (e.g., information regarding network diversity). Descriptive analysis and linear regression models were conducted for the study. Social work students demonstrated moderately low levels of color-blind racial attitudes. Age was positively associated with unawareness of institutional and blatant racism. Identifying as politically liberal was associated with lower unawareness of racial privilege, institutional racism, and blatant racism. Having more social network members to talk to about topics related to race and ethnicity was associated with lower unawareness of blatant racism. Being familiar with a campus antidiscrimination protest was negatively associated with unawareness of racial privilege and blatant racism. Implications for social work educators are discussed. © 2019 Council on Social Work Education.

AB  - In a fully connected network of K individuals, links represent symmetric interpersonal relations with their signs–positive for friendly, negative for hostile ones. The network is balanced in the sense of Heider if it is divided into two, internally friendly but mutually hostile groups. A dynamics of the relations has been proposed which leads to balanced states; there, a separate differential equation is designed for each out of K(K-1)/2 links. Here we demonstrate that besides the balanced states, whole families of stable-unbalanced states exist, and the number of these states is limited only by the size of the network. Examples are given for three and four internally friendly, but mutually hostile groups. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Individuals with obesity often report experiencing prejudice and discrimination due to their weight. Past research on obesity bias reduction strategies have yielded mixed results. The present study investigated the effectiveness of manipulating information about weight controllability in reducing obesity bias. Participants (N = 350) were randomly assigned into one of three conditions: counterstereotypic, stereotypic, or control. Each condition consisted of four short vignettes. The counterstereotypic condition provided an uncontrollable explanation of obesity (e.g., genetics) in each vignette describing a person with obesity, while the stereotypic condition emphasized lifestyle choices as the main cause of obesity. The control condition included a vignette in which weight was not addressed. Participants completed questionnaires about weight controllability and obesity bias pre- and post-exposure. There was a significant interaction between time and condition on beliefs about weight controllability and obesity bias. Participants in the counterstereotypic condition increased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and decreased in obesity bias, while participants in the stereotypic condition decreased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and increased in obesity bias. Obesity bias reduction strategies that utilize information about weight controllability can be effective. However, perpetuating stereotypic causes of obesity can worsen the problem. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explores young adults’ emotional affect and attitudes towards ageing, as well as older adults’ emotional affect and self-esteem following participation in the intergenerational videoconferencing programme Smile Connect (SC). The sample consisted of 94 participants (46 older Spanish adults living in a care home in Spain and 48 young Italian adults -secondary students- learning Spanish at school in Italy). Each age group was divided into an intervention and control group. SC consists of twelve 30-minute chat sessions conducted via Skype between the target groups over six weeks. Pre and post evaluations were made to assess the affect level in both groups, self-esteem among older people, and the level of negative stereotypes about ageing among young adults. At the end of the SC, the intervention group of older adults recorded significantly improved scores in self-esteem compared to the control group. Young adults recorded a reduction in their negative stereotypes about old age after taking part in the SC programme compared to those who did not. These findings suggest that involvement in the SC programme helps to improve the emotional affect of older adults living in care homes, as well as change the negative stereotypes about ageing among young adults. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Contact facilitates a reduction in prejudice and negative stereotypes between the social groups. The effect of such contact is optimized when there is equal status between groups, which in volunteerism is manifested through as mutually equitable partnership. This qualitative study examines the processes of contact through an intervention youth group that connects Chinese and refugee/asylum seeker youths in Hong Kong. Interviews were conducted with 5 participants (60% females; mean age = 24) in 2016. Results indicated the youth group facilitated contact within its members, where the more they engage, in frequency and intentionality, the more they find a sense of belonging with each other. Moreover, Chinese participants demonstrated a shift in seeing refugee participants as collaborators and friends instead of service-recipient. The findings shed light on the processes of contact within volunteerism and offers potential contribution of collaborative environment in similar integration intervention. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Herek’s notion of cultural heterosexism describes an ideology that works implicitly through language, and leads non-heterosexuals to be framed as “others.” National statistics in many countries indicate group differences between same-gender and mixed-gender couples in divorce rates, and we used media accounts and individual interpretation of group differences in divorce to operationalize it here. We found qualified support for three hypotheses in two studies. In Study 1, analysis of 412 English-language news articles on divorce indicated that comparative statements overwhelmingly positioned same-gender couples as figure and mixed-gender couples as ground. In Study 2, 88 participants read about how same-gender couples differed from mixed-gender couples, or about how mixed-gender couples differed from same-gender couples in their reasons for dissolving relationships. Results indicated that participants showed higher perceived legitimacy of inequality, higher sexual prejudice, and higher estimates of global divorce rates in the former conditions. Analysis of participants’ explanations of group differences in divorce rates indicated that they spontaneously contrasted mixed-gender couples against same-gender couples more of the time. As the media discourse focused on male couples (Study 1) and the effects of linguistic framing was evident only when male couples were described (Study 2), we discuss how these studies, which operationalized and evidenced cultural heterosexism, may point to the emergence of homonormative ideologies that recognized gay men more than lesbians in twenty-first century politics. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We propose that feminine gay men are targets of essentialist beliefs that cast them as less natural and more entitative than masculine gay men, and that this pattern of low-naturalness/high-entitativity beliefs fuels increased sexual prejudice toward, and discomfort with, feminine gay men. Data from two studies support these hypotheses. In Study 1, feminine versus masculine gay men were rated lower in naturalness and higher in entitativity, while masculine versus feminine lesbians did not elicit this pattern of beliefs. Study 2 replicated the effects of gay men’s gender expression on essentialist beliefs, and demonstrated that feminine gay men arouse more prejudice and discomfort than masculine gay men because they are perceived as socially constructed (low in naturalness) and deeply homogeneous (high in entitativity). Discussion considers the implications of these findings for reducing the stigma of femininity in gay men and outlines directions for future research. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Transgender people are exposed to great amounts of discrimination and violence, but research has yet to fully understand what drives stigma towards this community. In this study, we hypothesized that social dominance orientation would be associated with greater gender minority stigma (i.e., stigmatizing views of transgender people), with this association mediated by higher levels of trait aggression and lower levels of critical consciousness. Data were collected online from 254 cisgender individuals (158 women, 96 men; M age = 30.81 years). Social dominance orientation was associated with higher levels of gender minority stigma. Trait aggression was not a significant mediator of this association. However, there was a significant indirect effect via lowered critical consciousness (B = 0.10, SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.17). Approaches that increase awareness about social hierarchies and systems of privilege will likely prove fruitful in facilitating social change in attitudes towards transgender people. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article is based on a study of two early years services in the West of Ireland which was attended mostly by asylum seekers. Using a sample of the findings for illustration, we discuss how the study captured an example of culturally sensitive practice that demonstrated an ability to counteract some of the negative effects of being an asylum seeker through the particular philosophy and practice model. Eight specific guidance points for practice are drawn out and considered within the context of the ecological model [Bronfenbrenner, U., & Morris, P. (2006). The bioecological model of human development. In R. M. Lerner, W. Damon, & R. M. S. Lerner (Eds.), Handbook of child Psychology, Vol. 1: Theoretical models of human development. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley]. We argue that a duality of attention to the agency—recognising the importance of the actions of each individual and to structure—recognising the inherent power differences, structural inequality, social injustice and prejudice—is essential. We show the importance of agency and of an ecological framework. We make the case for an approach to “cultural competence” that emphasises the importance of interactions at the micro level. While we are focused in this paper on the early years sector, there is also wider applicability from this specific study to general practice in the field of social care and social work with diverse populations. © 2019, © 2019 The Child Care in Practice Group.

AB  - Drawing on ecological perspectives, this study examined the foundational assumption behind the negative stereotypes that surround children of mixed parentage in South Korea; namely, that their alleged deficiency in the Korean language will cause numerous issues for Korean society. The data used for this study came from a panel study of Korean adolescents that included such variables as their Korean and English proficiency as well as other explanatory variables at the individual, family, school, and community level. This study revealed that the longitudinal trajectories of Korean and English proficiency for mixed parentage adolescents were comparable to those of peers who had ethnically Korean parents. This suggests that the ‘multicultural’ label attached to this group of minority youth has served as a means of managing growing economic inequality exacerbated by globalization; in particular, the delusion of the label is highlighted by the strong bond between children's language proficiency and their socioeconomic status. The findings of this study urge researchers and educators to assess more critically the lives of minority children. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This poem is a result of my paths through performance autoethnography. From cries and pains of my (oppressed/oppressor) carved body as a middle-class White gay man, physician and professor in the medical setting, I seek paths of potential contribution to change, reconciliation, healing, inclusion, and love. Thus, I invite you to think about how certain bodies (maybe your body too) are meant to be excluded from medical environments with hidden prejudices. Hoping that we can seek transformations, walking together, holding hands with others who desire to work, think, live, and love freely! © 2020 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - This essay integrates Moravian studies, missiology and historical theology. It begins with a brief survey of the historiography of Moravian missions in colonial North America. It then surveys various reasons for periodic hostility against Moravians in New York and Pennsylvania between roughly 1740 and 1790. It recovers the ethnic and cultural diversity, prejudices and defensive actions of colonists that were a significant component of life in these contested spaces and turbulent times, thus demonstrating that so-called ‘religious’ persecution remains a complicated phenomenon. It suggests Moravians might have avoided certain instances of misperception and consequent ‘persecution’ had they adapted themselves culturally in ways they did not. Moravians were often perceived by other colonial Europeans as a threat to the security and stability of developing locales, and remained largely on the social periphery in colonial North America as a consequence of being both wrongly and rightly understood. As an international and transnational religious community pursuing its own global dispersal for the sake of mission, Moravian political neutrality and perceived ‘foreignness’ was misunderstood in times of war by English and Dutch colonists, especially, as sympathy for the enemy or even evidence of espionage, though the religious and secular fear of their being Catholic seems to have been eventually resolved. Because Moravians in the British colonies fraternised with Native Americans for the sake of mission and were part of an international fellowship also befriending Caribbean slaves, they were sometimes slandered by colonists who feared them as instigators of rebellion by these marginalised populations. Finally, the Moravian sense of being set apart by God from the broader society and called to suffer for the sake of their righteous difference and gospel influence, when acted upon, provoked hostility from colonists who perceived them as a threat to local balances of power, denominational order or family cohesion. © Edinburgh University Press.

AB  - The University of Pennsylvania Law School has had a long relationship with Chinese students; indeed, it was among the pioneers in the admission of Chinese students in America. To better understand the origin of this affiliation, this article traces the relationship between the celebrated Chinese diplomat Wu Ting-Fang and the then Dean William Draper Lewis, exploring the pivotal role this relationship played in forging the law school’s Chinese ties. The association was cemented when Penn Law School welcomed its first Chinese undergraduate student in 1906 and graduate student in 1908. The lesser known details of these two pioneering Chinese law students’ backgrounds, academic pursuits at Penn Law School and their key achievements upon graduation are revealed in this article as well. Against a backdrop of racial prejudice and the legal subordination of Asian peoples in a new American empire, the personal efforts of men such as Dean Lewis were critical in the admission of the first cohort of Chinese law students to American law schools in the early part of the twentieth century. © 2020 The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences.

AB  - The group decision method is an important branch in the decision problems. A critical issue in group decision methods is how to determine the weights of the group members. To reduce the possible prejudice due to the social influences, we propose a novel group decision method under social influences based on information entropy. Firstly, the interaction degrees between the group members under social influences are determined. Secondly, the entropy of each expert from the decision group is computed. Then, according to the entropy, the weights of the experts can be determined. Finally, based on the evaluation matrix, the weighted values of the alternatives can be obtained and the alternatives are ranked. The decision steps are provided in detail and the practicality of the proposed method is illustrated through an example. The proposed decision method considers interactions between the group members, so that the possible biases due to the social influences can be reduced to some extent. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Intergroup contact is repeatedly proven to lead to better intergroup attitudes. We sought to explore a new path through which this happens. We propose that contact can enhance inclusiveness of social identity, the recognition of common features needed to perceive someone as an in-group member even though not all characteristics are shared. This, in turn, leads to more favorable attitudes. We investigated this among young people from majority and minority ethnic groups from two Western Balkans countries with a recent history of conflict: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. The relation between the frequency and quality of contact and prejudice reduction was partially mediated by social identity inclusiveness. We discuss the opportunities and pitfalls related to constructing inclusive social identities in post-conflict societies, as well as the similarities and differences between minority and majority perspectives. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Internationally, admissible incriminating evidence of uncharged acts by the accused is presumed unfairly prejudicial, and remains controversial. In an experimental study, 325 jury-eligible citizens were randomly assigned to a simulated trial in which the accused faced two charges. Juries were exposed to no evidence of uncharged acts or prejudicial evidence describing four uncharged sexual acts by the accused reported by the complainant or two independent witnesses. Jury inferences about the accused s sexual interest in children and his criminal intent were logically related to the source and type of evidence. While ratings of the likelihood of culpability increased with evidence of uncharged acts, juries were reluctant to convict solely on the basis of the complainant s word. Jury deliberations disclosed that prejudicial evidence did not induce impermissible reasoning or a lower threshold of proof. Multiple convergent measures revealed little danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. © 2020 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co. KG. All rights reserved.

AB  - International interventions require credible, verifiable information in order to pursue their work to build peace, foster stability and reduce armed violence. As the above discussion has demonstrated, however, unofficial information and data in settings of armed conflict are inherently ambiguous, enigmatic and positional, and often highly politicized. For many communities living in a context of war and intervention, rumour also has a sticky quality that 'can substitute for factual information and then preclude the need to search for actual fact'.119 For international interventions, therefore, there are enormous risks attached to ignoring the epistemological force of rumours. Such is the case for Mali, where 'any event is followed by an enormous dust storm of rumours'.120 The above discussion demonstrates that carefully triangulating rumour data may never result in the definitive, doctrinal status of any given violent event. Owing to the politicized nature of intercommunal violence in central Mali, for example, we may never know the exact number of victims in the Sobane Da massacre, since adversarial groups may have tactically exaggerated or subdued particular details in order to buttress their own position of legitimacy and their claims for support from national or foreign actors. Another important point to consider is that sometimes, in attempts to find out 'what actually happened', factual errors may be inadvertently introduced into a rumour's narrative that do not reflect empirical reality, but nevertheless adhere to commonly accepted stereotypes held by different social groups.121 Even though rumours are difficult to validate as concrete events, sliding between the factual and the imaginary, taking on subtle (or not-so-subtle) distortions as they move from subject to subject, they nevertheless express the positionality of conflict actors and provide glimpses into their world-views and concerns. Taking rumours seriously in intervention settings is crucial if interveners want to better understand how intervened-upon communities perceive and come to reinforce their 'collective lived' realities.122 Rumours, embellishments and stories, even fabricated ones, are valuable not only 'because they reflect the speaker's state of mind, aspirations, and desires', but more importantly because they shed light on the speaker's place within local fields of power.123 After all, the longevity of rumours depends less on their source than on the group within which they are shared.124 In this vein, rumours leading to conflicting accounts-for example, those held by supporters of COREN's vocal position regarding the MNLA's alleged sexual violence in Gao versus those of many Tuareg communities who nurture doubts on the matter (whether they are supporters or enemies of the MNLA)-can help to illustrate long-held intergroup prejudices and unresolved historical wounds felt by competing groups that need to be addressed. Recognizing how rumours render the trajectory of power relations visible can generate openings for new and creative thinking by interveners to address grievances that underpin more immediate, politicized events. As such, rumours can help interveners address root causes, instead of only more superficial ones. Finally, engaging directly with rumours can foster local trust and engagement since doing so necessarily involves an acknowledgement of anxieties and interests. In situations of complex asymmetric violence oscillating somewhere between peace and war, 'there is not so much an obscuring fog as there is a surfeit of information and impressions'.125 When interveners are attuned to this surfeit, they are not only able to decipher the positionality of individuals trafficking or accepting rumours, but also can better empathize with intervened-upon communities and gauge their interests and receptivity to potential collaboration. Nevertheless, doing so means acknowledging that a definitive view from which the researcher or intervener can discern violent events in their unvarnished and exact content does not exist; at least, not for the actors involved. Instead, by paying serious attention to rumours, researchers and practitioners can better attend to anxieties and insecurities, which are necessarily situational, relational and political. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background: In the United States, racial disparities in birth outcomes persist and have been widening. Interpersonal and structural racism are leading explanations for the continuing racial disparities in birth outcomes, but research to confirm the role of racism and evaluate trends in the impact of racism on health outcomes has been hampered by the challenge of measuring racism. Most research on discrimination relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and few studies have examined racial attitudes and bias at the US national level. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations between state-level Twitter-derived sentiments related to racial or ethnic minorities and birth outcomes. Methods: We utilized Twitter’s Streaming application programming interface to collect 26,027,740 tweets from June 2015 to December 2017, containing at least one race-related term. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine, a supervised machine learning model. We constructed overall indicators of sentiment toward minorities and sentiment toward race-specific groups. For each year, state-level Twitter-derived sentiment data were merged with birth data for that year. The study participants were women who had singleton births with no congenital abnormalities from 2015 to 2017 and for whom data were available on gestational age (n=9,988,030) or birth weight (n=9,985,402). The main outcomes were low birth weight (birth weight ≤2499 g) and preterm birth (gestational age <37 weeks). We estimated the incidence ratios controlling for individual-level maternal characteristics (sociodemographics, prenatal care, and health behaviors) and state-level demographics, using log binomial regression models. Results: The accuracy for identifying negative sentiments on comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. Mothers living in states in the highest tertile for negative sentiment tweets referencing racial or ethnic minorities had greater incidences of low birth weight (8% greater, 95% CI 4%-13%) and preterm birth (8% greater, 95% CI 0%-14%) compared with mothers living in states in the lowest tertile. More negative tweets referencing minorities were associated with adverse birth outcomes in the total population, including non-Hispanic white people and racial or ethnic minorities. In stratified subgroup analyses, more negative tweets referencing specific racial or ethnic minority groups (black people, Middle Eastern people, and Muslims) were associated with poor birth outcomes for black people and minorities. Conclusions: A negative social context related to race was associated with poor birth outcomes for racial or ethnic minorities, as well as non-Hispanic white people. ©Thu T Nguyen, Nikki Adams, Dina Huang, M Maria Glymour, Amani M Allen, Quynh C Nguyen.

AB  - OBJECTIVE This paper aims to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental distress of the Vietnamese students in the USA. We explore different root causes of mental distress among international students who are away from their home country, their loved ones, and being isolated from school and community due to this outbreak. DESIGN In-depth interviews were conducted to probe the reasons for mental stress during the pandemic and the narrative textual analysis was subsequently performed to analyze the results. This research includes the interviews of 20 Vietnamese students in the USA during the COVID-19 era. RESULTS The textual analysis showed that the mental distress of these Vietnamese students were caused by limited access to on-campus facilities and activities, limited access to public services including grocery shopping, transportations, clinics, the possibility of being infected, isolated living condition due to the lockdown order, and inability to go back to the home country when wanted. CONCLUSIONS We found that both physical attributes (e.g., living condition, internet difficulty, overwhelmed healthcare system, restricted traveling, lack of personal interaction, limited access to public services) and psychological factors (e.g., anxiety of unfamiliar teaching modality, fear of viral infection, uncertain career aspects, cultural barrier and prejudice) directly led to the mental distress of these students. Moreover, other factors such as turbulent future job markets and potential racism toward Asians in relation with “Chinese virus” may cause the mental distress of these students. © 2020 Australasian College of Health Service Management.

AB  - Mazumder investigates the long-term effect of protest on political attitudes. He finds that whites have more liberal views on race and are more likely to be Democrats in counties where Civil Rights protest was reported in the early 1960s. The analysis omits a crucial predictor of protest and of racial attitudes: college education. We include the proportion of adults with a college degree and the number of college students at the county level. The inclusion of these variables, along with some other contextual variables from the original dataset, cuts the effect of protest by about half. Protest is no longer statistically significant in eight out of nine combinations of outcome variables and protest measures. The size of the effect remains trivial when we shift analysis from the county to the individual level. Even accounting for the individual’s own education, the county’s proportion of college graduates is strongly associated with racial liberalism. This finding emphasizes the importance of education as a contextual variable. Our conclusion highlights two methodological lessons. First, causal inference should be paired with sustained historical inquiry that specifies plausible mechanisms. Second, statistical tests for sensitivity can induce complacency about the risk of confounding. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: The family history of hypertension (FHH) imposes consistent risk for diverse chronic diseases that are accompanied by hypertension. Furthermore, the heart rate variability (HRV) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) are both related to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and are usually impaired during hypertension Objective: To compare the autonomic modulation, the endothelial function (EF) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of young athletes, separated according to their parents’ blood pressure (BP) history, in order to study the influence of their genetic background on those parameters. Methods: A total of 46 young male soccer players (18±2 years of age) were divided into four groups: 1-normotensive father and mother (FM-N); 2-only father was hypertensive (F-H); 3-only mother was hypertensive (M-H); 4-father and mother were hypertensive (FM-H). Measurements of BP, FMD, HRV and VO2max were performed. The significance level adopted in the statistical analysis was 5%. Results: The standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN; FM-N=314±185; FM-H=182.4± 57.8), the square root of the mean squared differences in successive RR intervals (RMSSD; FM-N=248±134; FM-H=87±51), the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50ms (NN50; FM-N=367±83.4; FM-H=229±55), the ratio derived by dividing NN50 by the total number of NN intervals (pNN50; FM-N=32.4±6.2; FM-H=21.1±5.3) and the high (HF; FM-N=49±8.9; FM-H=35.3±12) and low-frequency (LF; FM-N=50.9±8.9; FM-H=64.6±12) components, in normalized units (%), were significantly lower in the FM-H group than in the FM-N group (p&lt;0.05). On the other hand, the LF/HF ratio (ms2) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05). We found no significant difference between the groups in VO2max and FMD (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: In young male soccer players, the FHH plays a potentially role in autonomic balance impairment, especially when both parents are hypertensive, but present no changes in VO2max and FMD. In this case, there is a decrease in the sympathetic-vagal control, which seems to precede the endothelial damage. © 2020, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current socio-political situation in India has gradually shifted the meaning of leader, power and identity in the Indian higher education system. Normalizing the diverse voices, oppression, concretizing the social categories and policing of education created a crisis of ethics. The majoritarian and populist leadership took the shape of an authentic leader, representing the identities of the groups who prejudice towards the minorities. The higher education systems such as universities have become a seat of monitoring and limiting dissenting voices and a neoliberal wave has taken over the whole system in the name of morality, nationalism and religious dominance. This article presents a critical analysis of leadership in the university settings and the way leadership processes are considered to be authentic and ethical in a cultural context. © 2020 The Kerala State Higher Education Council.

AB  - Objectives: This paper empirically examines whether and how COVID-19 may be activating bias and discrimination toward individuals of Asian descent. Methods: In March 2020, we used a national online survey to collect data from 1141 US residents. Using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression, we estimated the prevalence and COVID-19-related predictors of bias toward people of Asian descent. Results: We found over 40% of our sample reported they would engage in at least one discriminatory behavior toward people of Asian descent. Respondents who were fearful of COVID-19 (b =.09, p < 0.001) and had less accurate knowledge about the virus (b = −.07, p < 0.001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians as did respondents with less trust in science (b = −.06, p < 0.001) and more trust in President Trump (b =.04, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Public health leaders must confront fear of the virus, improve knowledge, and bolster trust in science as these factors may evoke negative attitudes toward Asians and increase prejudice and discrimination. Specifically, our findings warrant the adoption of public health campaigns that provide health information and build trust in scientific knowledge. © 2020, Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+).

AB  - Background: As the first large numbers of female physicians complete their careers, information is needed to enable institutions and individuals to optimize the final career phase and transition to retirement of these women, as well as to help younger women physicians prepare for later phases of their careers. Materials and Methods: To identify the leading issues for older female physicians, a 34-item electronic questionnaire covering heath, finances, preparation for and attitudes about retirement, caretaking responsibilities, life-work integration, various aspects of discrimination and harassment, professional isolation, and work-related stress and burnout-incorporating standardized measures of career satisfaction was distributed through the Kansas Medical Society and nationally through the American Medical Association Senior Physicians Section newsletter to female physicians older than 60 years in 2018. A total of 155 physicians self-identified as eligible and completed at least half of the survey. Results: Respondents were 60-87 years of age, mean 70.4 (+6.4) years. The majority reported good health and being financially well prepared for retirement. Twenty percent were caretakers for grandchildren, parents, or spouses. Measures of career and job satisfaction were reasonably high, despite negative work environment and burnout scores. Problems with family/career balance, age- and gender-based discrimination and harassment, salary inequity, and professional isolation persisted throughout their careers, but diminished in frequency for senior women. Conclusions: Issues faced by younger women physicians do not disappear with age or seniority. To recruit and support female physicians, issues such as balancing family/work responsibilities, combating harassment and bias, and promoting healthy work environments must be addressed throughout their entire careers. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

This article examines the myriad of challenges faced by primary and secondary school going children amongst the San community in their quest to attain formal education in rural Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe. Using a mixed method approach, the study utilised focus group discussions from selected primary and secondary schools, key informant interviews with headmasters and teachers and also survey questionnaires supported by an ethnographic research design. It emerged from the study that long distance travelled to school, abject poverty, dilapidated infrastructure and the perceived negative attitude towards education has had telling effects on the marginalised San community. The hindrances to attaining formal education has tended to solidify the existing stereotypes, prejudices and social labels against the San community by other ethnic groups as “separatists”, “non-conformist” and at worst “primitive” in as far as participating in modern and mainstream development is concerned. The article suggests that there is a need for a paradigm shift in attitude and behaviour of development agents and actors in their policy positions and their interventions to the San community. Formal education for the San community will be hard to achieve as long as institutions perceive them as subaltern citizens, who are a nuisance. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Sexual minority women are disproportionately impacted by obesity yet are underrepresented in weight stigma research. This Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) study is a secondary analysis that aimed to elucidate the frequency and contextual characteristics of perceived experiences of lifetime and momentary weight stigma among sexual minority women with overweight/obesity. Participants were 55 sexual minority women ages 18–60 with a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Perceived lifetime weight stigma events were assessed at baseline. For the subsequent five days, participants used a smartphone to complete five daily, random EMA prompts assessing the frequency/characteristics of perceived weight stigma events in daily life. All participants reported at least one lifetime weight stigma event. During the EMA period, participants reported 44 momentary weight stigma events (M = 0.80), with 24% of participants reporting at least one event. During most instances of weight stigma, women perceived the stigma’s cause to be their weight and another minority identity (e.g., sexual orientation). Findings showing high rates of perceived lifetime weight stigma in this sample and frequent co-occurrence of perceived weight stigma with stigma due to other marginalized identities in daily life underscore the need for future, larger studies investigating weight stigma through an intersectional lens in sexual minority women with overweight/obesity. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Modern psychological theories postulate that individual differences in prejudice are determined by social and ideological attitudes instead of personality. For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture the authoritarian-conservatism motivation and the dominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N1 = 3,132; N2 = 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world. © 2020 Lin, Alvarez.

AB  - When compared with their heterosexual cisgender (nontransgender) counterparts, LGBTQ+ older adults are more likely to delay or not seek medical care, often due to fear of real or perceived discrimination from healthcare providers. HCR Home care is a home healthcare agency in Upstate New York that has been delivering high-quality in-home healthcare services for over 40 years. We recognized that we had a unique opportunity to address the vulnerabilities of older adults in the LGBTQ+ community and to better meet their health needs as they age in place. We developed a five-step process to implement a program to better serve the home healthcare needs of the LGBTQ+ population in our community. The goal of this initiative is to provide ongoing community education on home healthcare, awareness of the social and health issues surrounding LGBTQ+ older adults, and ultimately to improve care and decrease health disparities. This article describes the five-step process, the challenges, successes, and implications for the future. Ensuring there are healthcare solutions available for vulnerable and marginalized individuals is key to changing the way home healthcare is structured and improving quality of life and health outcomes for all. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Oral isotretinoin is frequently used in the treatment of young acne patients. However, knowledge levels and attitudes about this treatment have not been studied in the parents previously. We aimed to investigate the knowledge levels and concerns about oral isotretinoin in the parents of adolescent acne patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 136 parents of adolescent patients with moderate to very severe acne vulgaris who answered the questionnaire about oral isotretinoin treatment. Demographic data and acne characteristics were recorded. The parents' knowledge levels and concerns about the treatment process were asked by the questionnaire. Since 32 parents have never heard oral isotretinoin before, they were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 104 parents, 80.8% were female and 19.2% were male. Of the parents, 62.5% had some concerns about oral isotretinoin treatment and 34.6% had no idea whether the drug is suitable for the use of <18 years. 52.9% stated that they think the drug will damage the liver. The most known and worrying side effects were dry lips and vision problems, respectively. The knowledge levels about oral isotretinoin treatment and its side effects were low in the parents of adolescent acne patients, leading to prejudice to the drug. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Introduction: The current study highlights the voices and perspectives of African American fathers, with specific emphasis on their race-related concerns for their adolescents as well as how these concerns guide their parenting strategies. Method: Twenty-four African American fathers participated in 1.5–3 h long focus group interviews. All fathers (M = 42.24 years, SD = 6.93) resided in a mid-sized city in the Southeastern United States. All participants were either biological fathers (n = 20) or non-biological (n = 4) fathers. Fathers were residential (76%) and non-residential (24%), with at least one adolescent child (M = 14.32 years, SD = 5.80; Range: 10–16 years). Fifty-eight percent of fathers (n = 14) had both male and female children, 29% had only female children (n = 7) and 13% had only male children (n = 3). After codebook development and refinement, key themes were explored using a theoretical thematic analysis. Results: In response to race-related and other social risks for African American adolescents, fathers articulated a number of parenting motivations and intentions: 1) fathers' own racial experiences; 2) negative media images of Black youth and families (e.g. media influences, negative stereotypes, and portrayals of Black fathers); 3) preserving families through community support; 4) developing awareness of discrimination and coping strategies; 5) cultivating positive personal and cultural identities; and 6) achievement as necessity. Also, gender emerged as a critical lens for African American fathers’ concerns and parenting strategies. Conclusion: Overall, our investigation highlights African American fathers’ own meaning-making around concerns for their adolescents as well as how they shape parenting processes. © 2020 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies face the formidable challenge of developing sustainable forms of sociability-cumsocial-distancing – enduring social life while containing the virus and preventing new outbreaks. Accordant public policies often balance between retributive (punishment-based) and assistance (solidarity-based) measures to foster responsible behaviour. Yet, the uncontrolled spreading of the disease has divided public opinion about which measures are best suited, and it has made salient group disparities in behaviour, potentially straining intergroup relations, elevating heated emotions, and undercutting coordinated international responses. In a 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment, British citizens (N = 377) read about national in-group or outgroup members (categorical differentiation), who were either conforming to or deviating from the corona regulations (normative differentiation). Participants then reported moral emotions towards the target national group and indicated support for public policies. In general, support for assistance policies outweighed support for retributive measures. Second, however, norm deviation was associated with less positive and more negative moral emotions, the latter category further relating to more punitiveness and less assistance support. Finally, respondents who read about norm-violating outgroup members especially reported support for retributive measures, indicating that people might use norm deviation to justify outgroup derogation. We discuss implications for policymakers and formulate future research avenues. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Florida, <2/3 are virally suppressed (viral load <200 copies/mL). Previous theoretical frameworks have pointed to HIV-related stigma as an important factor for viral suppression; an important outcome related to the HIV continuum of care. This study aims to analyze the association between enacted HIV-related stigma and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression among a sample of PLWH in Florida. The overall sample (n = 932) was male (66.0%), majority greater than 45 years of age (63.5%), black (58.1%), and non-Hispanic (79.7%). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models. The odds of nonadherence to ART was not significantly greater for those reporting low/moderate or high levels of general enacted HIV-related stigma (vs. no stigma) [AOR = 1.30, CI: (0.87-1.95), p = 0.198; AOR = 1.17, CI: (0.65-2.11), p = 0.600, respectively]. Moreover, the odds of nonviral suppression were not significantly greater for those reporting low/moderate or high levels of general enacted HIV-related stigma (vs. no stigma) [AOR = 0.92, CI: (0.60-1.42), p = 0.702; AOR = 1.16, CI: (0.64-2.13), p = 0.622, respectively]. However, ever experiencing health care-specific enacted HIV-related stigma was associated with both nonadherence [AOR = 2.29, CI: (1.25-4.20), p = 0.008] and nonsuppression [AOR = 2.16, CI: (1.19-3.92), p = 0.011]. Despite limitations, the results suggest that the perpetuation of stigma by health care workers may have a larger impact on continuum of care outcomes of PLWH than other sources of enacted stigma. Based on the results, there is a need to develop and evaluate interventions for health care workers intended to reduce experienced stigma among PLWH and improve health outcomes. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Background: Perceived stigma among patients with psoriasis (PWP) is associated with poorer quality of life. Objective: To determine the prevalence and predictors of stigmatizing attitudes that PWP expect and experience from others. Methods: We conducted a survey using validated outcome measures to assess the extent to which PWP anticipate and perceive stigma from others. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic medical records. Results: Patients (n = 106) were 48.11% female, 70.75% white, and had a mean age ± SD of 47.90 ± 16.19 years old. Of all, 25.47% self-reported their psoriasis as severe. Mean physician global assessment score ± SD was 2.98 ± 1.81. Two-thirds (66.98%) of patients reported that, in response to seeing their psoriasis-affected skin, they anticipated others to stereotype them as “contagious.” Linear regression analyses demonstrated that patient-reported severe psoriasis, compared to mild psoriasis, was associated with greater anticipation of negative stereotypes, social avoidance, and perceived stigma from others (P values <.05). Physician-measured body surface area and global assessment scores were not significantly associated with any outcome. Conclusion: Prevalence of anticipated and perceived stigma among PWP is high. Our results suggest that objective measures of severity may not identify patients at risk of stigma-related distress. Additional methods, such as directly inquiring about stigmatizing experiences, may be needed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Extending prior literature on stereotypes about ethnic groups and warranting theory, this experimental study examined the effects of exposure to a target Chinese international student's Facebook page with self-generated (stereotypically positive or negative) and/or other-generated wall posts (stereotypically positive or negative) on U.S. participants’ (N = 550, Mage = 21.38, SD = 3.82) perceptions of task attractiveness and behavioral tendencies (i.e., willingness to communicate/ cooperate) toward the target. Supporting warranting theory, results demonstrated that when other-generated posts were present and disconfirmed the Facebook page owner's self-generated posts, other-generated posts mitigated the effects of self-generated posts in most cases. However, when other-generated and self-generated wall posts were consistent, other-generated posts produced an averaging effect. In addition, the type of dependent measure, and the dynamic interplay between stereotype content and the valence of self-generated posts also mitigated the warranting effect of other-generated posts. © 2020

AB  - Bisexual individuals experience unique forms of discrimination related to their sexual orientation (e.g., anti-bisexual prejudice), which occurs from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals. Bisexual individuals may experience stigma differently depending on the gender of their relationship or sexual partners, because they may be perceived as heterosexual if they have a partner of a different gender and as gay/lesbian if they have a partner of the same gender. The present longitudinal study investigated within-persons differences in anti-bisexual experiences, internalized binegativity, and bisexual identity affirmation based on the gender of participants’ serious relationship partners and gender of sex partners in a sample of 180 young bisexual men. Results indicated that young bisexual men experienced more interpersonal hostility from both heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals when their serious relationship partner was female. No significant differences were found in other types of anti-bisexual prejudice, internalized binegativity, or bisexual identity affirmation by serious partner gender. For sexual partner gender, men who had only male sex partners experienced more sexual orientation instability attitudes from heterosexual and lesbian/gay individuals; men with only female sex partners experienced more sexual irresponsibility attitudes from heterosexuals, but not from lesbian/gay individuals; and, like those with female serious relationship partners, men with only female sex partners had more frequent experiences of interpersonal hostility from heterosexual and lesbian/gay individuals. Results indicate that bisexual men experience unique forms of prejudice based on the gender of their relationship and sexual partners. Implications for the mental health of bisexual men are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Attitudes towards refugees are formed via complex interactions between socioeconomic factors, perceptions of cultural threat and personality traits. Yet despite the widespread social changes the European refugee situation has generated throughout the continent, no previous literature has adequately examined these interactions in that context. This study addressed that gap by testing the relationship between personality traits and European attitudes towards refugees in the context of the European refugee crisis by conducting an ordinal regression analysis of data obtained from online surveys that we distributed in four European countries (N = 6,000).Questions were aligned with descriptors used in the Five Factor model of personality traits and a proxy of the Honesty-Humility trait used in the HEXACO model. Our results indicate that Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Honesty-Humility are negatively associated with refugee prejudice. Findings about Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness are mixed. Moreover, our results revealed that intercultural contact has a positive impact on attitudes towards refugees and that the valence of this contact plays a more significant role than the frequency of contact. Given that attitudes towards refugees have been found to correlate with asylum policy preferences, these discoveries are of considerable value to people working in asylum policy settings, as they provide them with a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing election results; especially during a period where refugee resettlement is a salient issue. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Attitude-change research requires sound attitude measures adequately predicting behavior. Most existing attitude measures focus on the cognitive (and some on the affective) attitude component (while neglecting the behavioral component). The present research introduces the SABA, a brief scale that consists of Scenarios measuring the Affective and Behavioral components of Attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. In two studies with student and non-student samples (n1 = 66, n2 = 202), we developed a 25-item scale and reduced it by performing exploratory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded two factors (affective and behavioral) for each version (SABA-L for attitudes toward lesbians, SABA-G for attitudes toward gay men). The reduced scales each contained five scenarios showing good reliability. High convergent validity and discriminant validity were shown using explicit and implicit attitude measures in a multitrait–multimethod analysis. Further, SABA scores correlated with the Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS) and the Attitudes Toward Lesbians (ATL) and Gay Men Scale (ATG), but—as predicted—not with social anxiety and the Homopositivity Scale. The SABA’s criterion and incremental validity were demonstrated in predicting attitude-related behavior better than the MHS. SABA scores showed established associations and differences in antigay attitudes based on age, religiousness, male role norms, authoritarianism, openness (SABA-G only), and sexual orientation, confirming (known-group) validity. Further, the SABA correlated less with the motivation to act without prejudice than the MHS, the ATL, and the ATG. Thus, outperforming existing attitude scales, the SABA appears to be a psychometrically sound instrument to measure attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Imagined contact has been argued to reduce prejudice. Although extant research supports this argument, replication attempts have been unsuccessful. To resolve conflicting evidence from previous studies, this study examined the effect of imagined contact on explicit and implicit prejudice against Kurds and Syrians in Turkey. Using data from 335 Turkish undergraduate students, the moderating role of ethnic and national identification in the imagined contact effect was tested. Results indicated that imagined contact did not reduce prejudice, and in-group identification did not have a moderating effect, even after controlling for actual contact. These findings call for a theoretical refinement to the imagined contact hypothesis and emphasize the need for further research to advance our understanding of when imagined contact works. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - We conducted an experiment to assess whether targeting multiple beliefs about sexual orientation (SO) may be more effective in reducing homonegativity than focusing only on beliefs about its biogenetic origins. Participants (116 women, 85 men) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions or a control condition. Those in the treatment conditions read essays summarizing: (1) research suggesting SO has biogenetic origins, (2) research suggesting SO is socially constructed and refuting beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories; or (3) research suggesting SO is biogenetic and research suggesting SO categories are socially constructed and not necessarily discrete, homogenous, or informative. We predicted participants in the conditions that targeted multiple beliefs related to the social construction of SO, not just its biogenetic origins, would exhibit the strongest reductions in beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories, and in homonegativity. We also predicted these participants would exhibit the greatest increases in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. We observed hypothesized shifts in SO beliefs across all experimental conditions. While there was a small main effect of time on homonegative prejudice, there was no main effect of condition and no changes in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. However, post hoc analyses suggested the two conditions addressing social constructionist beliefs accounted for most of the observed prejudice reduction. Implications for more comprehensive educational and social interventions designed to promote social justice for sexual minorities are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Migration is a potentially stressful process due to the sociocultural changes and the adaptation processes that go along with it. However, social support can mitigate the impact of stress, ease the adaptation process and contribute to migrants’ overall well-being. The aim of this study was to explore to what extent social support buffers the effects of stress and ethnic prejudice on subjective well-being and physical symptoms in a Peruvian immigrant community in Spain. Method: One hundred and thirty seven people participated in the study, 67.2% of them women and 32.8% men, with an age range between 19 and 64 years, who responded to self-report instruments through an online survey. The statistical analysis consisted of obtaining a structural equation model (SEM) in order to estimate the direct, indirect and total effects involved in the relationships between the study variables. Results: Social support was shown to have a significant direct effect (β = .174, p = .017) on the participants’ degree of subjective well-being, as well as an indirect effect mediated by both stress and ethnic prejudice (β = .170, p < .001). No significant direct relationship was found between the degree of social support and the severity of participants’ physical symptoms. Conclusions: The level of social support contributes to subjective well-being and acts as a protective factor against the effects of high levels of stress and ethnic prejudice, thus fostering immigrants’ process of adaptation to their new socio-cultural context. © 2020 Sociedad Española para el Estudio de la Ansiedad y el Estrés - SEAS

AB  - Prejudice towards Muslim people in Western countries is common and increasing. This paper describes an educational intervention aimed at increasing positive attitudes and actions to support Muslim Australians. University students participated in a 12-week educational programme that drew on prejudice reduction principles and a pedagogical approach that emphasised active discussion. Results (N = 94) showed an increase in positivity towards Muslim people, increased intention to take bystander action to confront prejudice, and social identification (as a supporter of positive relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Australians). Boosts in positivity towards Muslim people and intention to confront prejudice were mediated by increases in social identity, although changes in social identification only explained increased commitment to confront prejudice in a low risk scenario. Results suggest that educational interventions such as these can foster new, inclusive identities that provide a basis for action to support Muslim people. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - While public acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals and same-sex relations has grown over the past few decades, there is still opposition to LGB civil rights in the U.S. Previous literature has found links between political ideology and sexual prejudice, while empathy has been linked to both political ideology and sexual prejudice. However, no study has examined the interrelationships between these three variables. For this study, an online survey was administered to a diverse sample of college students in exchange for course credit, and those who self-identified as heterosexual were retained for analyses (N = 1143; 66.1% female; 45.5% White). Mediation analyses were performed to examine whether two subfacets of empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) mediated the relationship between political ideology and sexual prejudice. Due to gender differences in sexual prejudice and empathy, gender was included in the model as a moderator. The results of moderated mediation analyses indicated both empathic concern and perspective taking were mediators for women, while perspective taking was the only mediator for men. These results suggest that interventions for sexual prejudice may be more effective when using approaches that promote taking the perspective of LGB individuals. Specifically, interventions that utilize empathy training or direct contact with LGB individuals may result in a decrease in sexual prejudice. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aims: How and when children develop an understanding of group boundaries have implications for conflict resolution. When social divisions are not perceptually distinct, symbols become particularly important. Framed by the Social Identity Development Theory, this study was designed to assess children's categorization of symbols with conflict-related group labels. Method: In Northern Ireland, 218 children (M = 8.14, SD = 1.83, range 5–11 years old) participated in a novel task designed for this study. The sample was evenly split by child gender and community background. Results: Children sorted symbols above chance with both the hypothesized national (i.e., British/Irish) and ethno-political (i.e., Protestant/Catholic) labels, showing a stronger association for the former. Sorting was also stronger for ingroup symbols, compared to outgroup symbols, and increased with age. Conclusion: These findings reflect the potential role that a divided social world has on the development of children's understanding of conflict-related groups. The results also have implications for intergroup relations among children in divided societies. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - North Macedonia’s two main ethnic groups, the Albanians and Macedonians, have experienced increasing segregation in education, though recent political shifts have made social cohesion a priority, which could replace decades of segregationist policies and break down a damaging cycle of segregation. Using a qualitative approach, I examine the complex relationship between policies, schools, and individuals through analysing 18 years of education policies, interviews/focus groups with 30 participants, and four years living and working in segregated communities. To explore how educational policies, institutions, and practices perpetuate ethnic segregation in North Macedonia, and how growing up in a divided society shapes individuals’ conceptions of themselves and other predominant ethnic groups, I employ contact theory and critical policy analysis. I find that as students grow up in divided schools and communities, their conceptions of the self and of people from other ethnic groups are constituted by these experiences of segregation. While the nation’s education policies currently include more initiatives for integrated education, these have yet to be implemented satisfactorily, meaning that public schools could teach inclusion and serve as a mechanism for dispelling negative stereotypes, but to do so requires a reconceptualization of ethnic difference and a cohesive vision of national identity. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Research has yet to understand how ethnic/racial discrimination and ethnic/racial identity change simultaneously in adolescence. In a multiethnic sample of 211 adolescents (58% female; 41% Asian American, 10% Black, 24% Latinx, 22% White, 4% other), this study used latent change modeling to examine parallel changes in adolescents’ discrimination experiences (frequency and distress) and ethnic/racial identity (private regard, centrality) from 9th to 11th grade. The year immediately following the transition into high school, from 9th to 10th grade, emerged as a challenging period with higher levels of discrimination and accompanying declines in adolescents’ private regard. In contrast, from 10th to 11th grade, discrimination distress declined, and adolescents’ private regard remained relatively stable. Across both time periods, parallel changes were observed for discrimination (frequency, distress) and adolescents’ private regard. Implications for considering the importance of school transition, as well as individual differences by adolescent characteristics and school contexts, are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A social reputation loss model for loss of social reputation upon borrower disconnection on internet financial platforms is proposed. Firstly, the characteristics of on-line social networks of the borrowers are analysed from P2P platform, Chat platforms, QQ platform, one-click help platform, etc. Secondly, the characteristics of offline social networks of the borrowers are analysed in terms of blood, geographical, business, academic, heart, and ethnic relationships. Thirdly, from the six main factors, such as amount of default funds, disconnection time point, status of joint guarantee performance, project success probability, the amount and severity of network punishment, the impacts on the social reputation of lost-link borrowers are evaluated. Then, by quantifying these six main influencing factors, we establish a social reputation loss model on the lost-linking borrowers in P2P platform, and explore the relationship between borrower disconnection time and social reputation loss. The work proves that the social reputation loss of borrowers gradually decreases with the delay of disconnection time and other mathematical propositions. Finally, the applications of the model are discussed. The impacts of dynamic changes of the project success probability, disconnection time and amount of network punishment on the social reputation loss of borrowers are analysed. Through this study, an innovative calculating method for the loss of social reputation of borrowers who are out of touch on internet financial platforms is given. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Three studies supported a model whereby associations between ideologies that share roots in biological determinism and outcomes that reinforce inequality (based on gender, race, or class) were mediated by system justification beliefs (SJB). Outcomes included support for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton as president (Study 1), justifying police brutality (Study 2), and support for a White House budget that slashed the social safety net to endow the wealthy with tax cuts (Study 3). These findings provoke a vital question: How do people deem unequal systems worthy of defense? Each study compared social Darwinism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and biological essentialism. We expected social Darwinism to account for the most variance in SJB because it provides both the rationale for social hierarchies (natural selection) and defends them as required for human welfare. This prediction was supported in each study. Implications for the psychology of legitimacy are discussed. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This meta-analysis explored the magnitude of self-serving attribution biases for real-world athletic outcomes. A comprehensive literature search identified 69 studies (160 effect sizes; 10,515 athletes) that were eligible for inclusion. Inverse-variance weighted random-effects meta-analysis showed that sport performers have a tendency to attribute personal success to internal factors and personal failure to external factors (k = 40, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.62), a tendency to attribute team success to factors within the team and team failure to factors outside the team (k = 23, SMD = 0.63), and a tendency to claim more personal responsibility for team success and less personal responsibility for team failure (k = 4, SMD = 0.28). There was some publication bias and heterogeneity in computed averages. Random effects meta-regression identified sample sex, performance level, and world-region as important moderators of pooled mean effects. These findings provide a foundation for theoretical development of self-serving tendencies in real-world settings. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Frontline professionals such as social workers and civil servants play a crucial role in countering violent extremism. Because of their direct contact with society, firstliners are tasked with detecting individuals that may threaten national security and the democratic rule of law. Preliminary screening takes place during the pre-crime phase. However, without clear evidence or concrete indicators of unlawful action or physical violence, it is challenging to determine when someone poses a threat. There are no set patterns that can be used to identify cognitive radicalization processes that will result in violent extremism. Furthermore, prevention targets ideas and ideologies with no clear framework for assessing terrorism-risk. This article examines how civil servants responsible for public order, security and safety deal with their mandate to engage in early detection, and discusses the side effects that accompany this practice. Based on open-interviews with fifteen local security professionals in the Netherlands, we focus here on the risk assessments made by these professionals. To understand their performance, we used the following two research questions: First, what criteria do local security professionals use to determine whether or not someone forms a potential risk? Second, how do local security professionals substantiate their assessments of the radicalization processes that will develop into violent extremism? We conclude that such initial risk weightings rely strongly on ‘gut feelings’ or intuition. We conclude that this subjectivity may lead to prejudice and/or administrative arbitrariness in relation to preliminary risk assessment of particular youth. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Gender-nonconforming (GN) children are often perceived less positively, which may harm their well-being. We examined the development of such perceptions and an intervention to modify them. Chinese children’s appraisals were assessed using multiple measures (verbal responses, sharing, and rank order task) after viewing vignettes of gender-conforming (GC) and GN hypothetical peers. In Study 1, children (N = 210; 4-, 5-, 8-, and 9-year-olds) were less positive toward GN than GC peers, especially if they were older or if the peers were boys. In Study 2 (N = 211, 8- and 9-year-olds), showing children exemplars of GN peers who displayed positive and GC characteristics subsequently reduced bias against gender nonconformity. These findings inform strategies aimed at reducing bias against gender nonconformity. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Many political movements across the world today define citizenship in exclusionary ethnic or religious terms. This study extends research on ethnic–national associations in adults to children, adding to the relatively sparse literature on the development of national associations in children and in nonwestern contexts. Explicit and implicit religious–national associations were examined in a sample of 160 nine- to sixteen-year-olds (79 Hindu; 81 Muslim) in Gujarat, India. Results suggest that while Hindu children show a strong Indian = Hindu association by age 9, Muslim children appear to be buffered from this association. Furthermore, this association uniquely predicts variance in children’s attitudes about social policy and their concept of nationality, above and beyond their age, religion, and intergroup attitudes. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Interventions to increase the endorsement of the growth mindset (the belief that intelligence can be improved with effort) have been successfully implemented in schools. However, they rarely target children and young people with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND), a group who are more likely to endorse a fixed mindset, experience lower academic self-concept and academic resilience, and be at risk of negative stereotyped attitudes. This quasi-experimental study implemented a 10-week PSHE programme as well as dedicated lessons with adapted classroom practices, for example, task framing and feedback, to promote the growth mindset message to young people with SEND (N = 18). Analyses of pre- to post-intervention measures demonstrated moderate evidence for the intervention having increased students’ endorsement of the growth mindset, as well as anecdotal evidence for increased academic self-concept, academic resilience and positive attitudes to disability. However, these effects were not sustained in follow-up measures conducted 7 weeks post-intervention. The intervention did not improve students’ academic performance. Although preliminary, findings demonstrate the viability of growth mindset interventions for children and young people with SEND, but suggest that interventions should be maintained for longer-lasting effects. © 2019 NASEN

AB  - This study examined the relations of multiple categorization and social dominance orientation with adolescents’ prejudice against migrants and identification with the human group over time. Participants were 304 Northern-Italian late adolescents (61.84% female, Mage = 17.49) involved in a three-wave longitudinal study (with 3 months interval between waves). Results showed that multiple categorization was negatively linked to prejudice at a later time, whereas social dominance orientation was positively associated with it; prejudice also negatively affected multiple categorization and positively affected social dominance orientation at a later time. Moreover, prejudice mediated the effects of multiple categorization and social dominance orientation on human identification. These findings have important implications suggesting the construens effect of multiple categorization for enhancing social inclusiveness. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Despite the public outrage in response to police violence against unarmed Black men, work on the psychological dynamics of reactions to these incidents is relatively rare. The present research examined whether empathy for a Black male victim of White police interracial violence would vary as a function of victim stereotypicality (stereotypic/counterstereotypic) and Black participant racial identity. In Study 1, 140 Black participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). As hypothesized, Black participants low in racial identification reported less empathy for the stereotypical relative to the counterstereotypical victim. Those high in racial identification showed relatively high levels of empathy regardless of the characteristics of the Black victim. Study 2 replicated these effects with 263 Black MTurk participants. This research highlights the value of considering individual differences in the Black observers (racial identification) and the characteristics of Black victims to better understand the psychological processes involved in intragroup responses to police violence. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+) young people of color encounter interlocking systems of social prejudice and discrimination. However, little is understood about how subjective meanings of perceived structural stigma associated with multiple marginalized social statuses influence mental health. We document how perceived stigma can shape mental health inequalities among multiply marginalized individuals if they also encounter stigmatizing societal frameworks. Data come from in-depth interviews with 41 LGBTQ+ Latino/a young adults in the Rio Grande Valley collected from 2016 to 2017. Utilizing an intersectional minority stress framework, we qualitatively examine how young people conceptualize structural stigma, their multiple social locations (e.g., sexuality, gender, race/ethnicity, age), and their mental health. Findings highlight how LGBTQ+ Latino/a young adults experience structural racism, gender policing, and anti-LGBTQ+ religious messages in relation to their mental health. This study showcases the importance of an intersectional minority stress framework for documenting processes that can shape mental health inequalities. © American Sociological Association 2019.

AB  - People’s actions toward a competitive outgroup can be motivated not only by their perceptions of the outgroup, but also by how they think the outgroup perceives the ingroup (i.e., meta-perceptions). Here, we examine the prevalence, accuracy, and consequences of meta-perceptions among American political partisans. Using a representative sample (n = 1,056) and a longitudinal convenience sample (n = 2,707), we find that Democrats and Republicans equally dislike and dehumanize each other but think that the levels of prejudice and dehumanization held by the outgroup party are approximately twice as strong as actually reported by a representative sample of Democrats and Republicans. Overestimations of negative meta-perceptions were consistent across samples over time and between demographic subgroups but were modulated by political ideology: More strongly liberal Democrats and more strongly conservative Republicans were particularly prone to exaggerate meta-perceptions. Finally, we show that meta-prejudice and meta-dehumanization are independently associated with the desire for social distance from members of the outgroup party and support for policies that harm the country and flout democratic norms to favor the ingroup political party. This research demonstrates that partisan meta-perceptions are subject to a strong negativity bias with Democrats and Republicans agreeing that the shadow of partisanship is much larger than it actually is, which fosters mutual intergroup hostility. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - AIM: To consider the possibility of consequences beyond the alleviation of perceived individual suffering, for families left behind, communities and society as a whole should the End of Life Choice Act gain public support in the September 2020 referendum in New Zealand. METHOD: This study used the Yin case study approach to undertake a single semi-structured in-depth interview with a participant who self-identified as having first-hand experience of assisted dying from a relative's perspective (in a country where this is legal). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and trends from the interview transcript. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the interview: The potential for assisted dying becoming an expectation for others to pursue when unwell and possibly facing a life-threatening illness; the notion of stigma being associated with the individual using assisted dying legislation and the family left behind; and that there may be the potential for such legislation to produce a contagion effect. CONCLUSION: The introduction of assisted dying legislation into New Zealand culture provides a potential hotspot for family, community and social discord that may not be easily remedied. Further study in New Zealand is required to investigate whether a contagion effect of assisted dying is possible, and how as a society, we negotiate what could become a conflicted pathway potentially complicated by prejudice, judgement and stigma. © 2020 New Zealand Medical Association.

AB  - A number of studies have found that plants and related activities provide people with physical and mental disabilities, improved motor functions, stimulate concentration, motivation, relieve stress, and raise self-esteem and prevent disease. Outdoor activities stimulate, in addition to the physical musculature, cerebral musculature, since it exposes the users to the sun, in a different environment, therefore, to new challenges. In view of the above, the objective was to set up a kitchen garden at the Instituto de Ciências Agrárias of Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri with students from the Associação de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais (APAE) in Unaí, MG, Brazil. For 1 year, 15 students, with moderate to severe mental impairment, visited at 7:30 to 8:30 am daily, performing daily activities of the kitchen garden. These activities have been shown to have a relevant role in the process of social insertion and rehabilitation of people with some mental disorder. It was reported by teachers of the APAE School, reports of parents and project members, through questioning regarding the behavior and cognitive development of students involved in the project, the evolution of 12 of the 15 students participating in the project. Some of the results obtained with the practitioners: evolution in the development of activities, resourcefulness, reduction of depressive crises, less introspection and more communication, initiatives, improvement of interpersonal relationships. Thus, it is important to point out that the findings of this study indicate a positive result regarding the changes perceived by the practitioners from their insertion in the project, the activities guaranteed for people with disabilities their ability to perform tasks, social inclusion and living in society without prejudices. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to apply cultivation theory to social network sites by investigating how Facebook uses cultivates users' ethnic diversity perceptions and attitudes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors’ investigations include an online and offline survey study with 476 Facebook users and a follow-up experiment with 75 individuals. Findings: The authors provide empirical support that Facebook use cultivates ethnic diversity perceptions and ethnic diversity-related attitudes. They show that Facebook use relates to perceptions of ethnic minorities that resemble the world on Facebook that is characterized by high ethnic diversity. The authors further demonstrate that the cultivation of ethnic diversity-related attitudes is mediated by diversity perceptions related to users' close social environment. Research limitations/implications: Future research should consider culturally and educationally diverse samples as well as longitudinal research designs to address external validity and causality issues. Practical implications: Algorithms determining the content users are exposed should be thoughtfully curated to avoid attitudinal and ideological polarization. Social implications: Facebook can play an important role in positively shaping intergroup relations, thereby countering negative outgroup attitudes, social anxieties and radical right-wing parties. Originality/value: The authors’ studies extend the scope of cultivation research by identifying a new media vehicle as a source of cultivation influences and shed light on the cultivation-based process of attitude change on social network sites. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Psychiatric emergencies are severe behavioral changes secondary to worsening mental illness. Such situations present a risk to the patient and other people, so they need immediate therapeutic intervention. They are associated with feelings of fear, anger, prejudice, and even exclusion. The attitudes of professionals and factors related to the workplace culture in health can help to perpetuate stereotypes and interfere with the quality of care. Stigma has undesirable consequences in patients with mental disorders. Certain measures can reduce stigma and provide a more dignified way for patients to recover from the crisis. This article aims to discuss the causes of stigma, ways of dealing with it, and achievements that have been made in psychiatric emergency care settings. © Copyright © 2020 da Silva, Baldaçara, Cavalcante, Fasanella and Palha.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer incidence is increasing in Vietnam with studies indicating low levels of knowledge and awareness and late presentation. While there is a growing body of literature on challenges faced by women in accessing breast cancer services, and for delivering care, no studies have sought to analyse breast cancer messaging in the Vietnamese popular media. The aim of this study was to investigate and understand the content of messages concerning breast cancer in online Vietnamese newspapers in order to inform future health promotional content. Methods: This study describes a mixed-methods media content analysis that counted and ranked frequencies for media content (article text, themes and images) related to breast cancer in six Vietnamese online news publications over a twelve month period. Results: Media content (n = 129 articles & n = 237 images) sampled showed that although information is largely accurate, there is a marked lack of stories about Vietnamese women's personal experiences. Such stories could help bridge the gap between what information about breast cancer is presented in the Vietnamese media, and what women in Vietnam understand about breast cancer risk factors, symptoms, screening and treatment. Conclusions: Given findings from other studies indicating low levels of knowledge and women with breast cancer experiencing stigma and prejudice, more nuanced and in-depth narrative-focused messaging may be required. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to find out the effect of recruitment practices on the retention of commercial pilots by the airlines in India. Often it is found that trained pilots pilfered by other airlines within/outside of India and Indian aviation industry have to rely on expatriate pilots to fly the aircrafts. Newly appointed pilots are required to be trained due to the lack of experience, which is a huge investment by the airlines. Therefore, the recruitment and retention of the commercial pilots create challenges for aviation industry in India. Design/methodology/approach: Research design of the present study was exploratory and descriptive to evaluate the effect of recruitment practices on the retention of commercial pilots by airlines in India. All together, 225 commercial pilots from different Indian airlines participated in the present study. Instruments were designed to understand the practices related to recruitment, selection and retention strategies of commercial pilots used by these airlines, and how pilots perceive about recruitment practices and its relevance for retention strategies in the organization. Data were analyzed using factor analysis, Pearson’s correlation and regression analysis Findings: Results of data analysis have revealed five factors of retention and selection measures, which were encouraging and employee-friendly recruitment policy, impact of external factors, organizational internal factors, employment brand and organizational growth and self-advancement opportunities. Similarly, retention strategies measures had four factors, namely, positive work culture, opportunities for individual growth, development, and salary benefit package, and opportunity for self-achievement. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient result revealed significantly positive relationship between various dimensions of recruitment and selection to retention strategies. Further regression analysis revealed the effect of those recruitment policies on retention was positive. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study could be potential bias and prejudice of the people involved and responded. As information was collected only form Indian commercial pilots, the findings might have changed if study was to be applied to a different country or economy. Random sampling error could not be ruled out. Preferred, accepted and perceived recruitment strategies and retention polices of Indian aviation sectors might be different as compare to other countries aviation sectors policies. Influence of cultural, organizational internal and external factors result might be different as compared to result of present study. Practical implications: This is an important study, which will help the aviation sector to design recruitment policies and retention strategies to retain pilots to deal with a high level of attrition. Furthermore, present study will help the aviation sector in designing their policies and strategies, which forces pilots to remain with particular air carrier for longer time. It will give the same direction to other organizations, in general. Social implications: The concept of recruitment and retention is applicable to each and every service sector. There could be different parameters for the same. Social implication of the present study is the same as it is for the aviation sectors. It is implied that service sectors must have appropriate recruitment policies, i.e. encouraging and employee friendly recruitment policy, conscious and continuous evaluation organizations’ external as well as internal factor, efforts shall be made to create employment branding, always focus on growth and advancement opportunities for the employees and organization. Positive work culture, opportunities for individual growth and development, salary benefit package and opportunity for self-achievement will help employees to remain with the organization for longer time. Originality/value: This is an original research in the area of understanding recruitment policies and retention practices of commercial pilots in Indian aviation industry. This study is related to practical and genuine problem of attrition. Not many studies are found in this particular area. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: There are shortcomings in medical practitioners' capacity to adapt to the particular needs of people experiencing circumstances of social vulnerability. Clinical traineeships create opportunities for the acquisition of knowledge, competencies, attitudes, and behaviors. However, some authors question the learnings to be made through classical clinical training pathways. This article explores the learnings gained from a traineeship experience within a community-based clinical setting intended for patients experiencing social vulnerability and operating under an alternative paradigm of care. To our knowledge, there is little research intended to identify and understand what medical trainees gain from their experience in such contexts. Methods: This exploratory qualitative study is based on twelve interviews with practicing physicians who completed a traineeship at La Maison Bleue (Montreal, Canada) and three interviews conducted with key informants involved in traineeship management. Based on Mezirow's theory of transformational learning, data were analyzed according to L'Écuyer's principles of qualitative content analysis. NVivo software was used. Results: The main learnings gained through the traineeship are related to (1) greater awareness of beliefs, assumptions and biases through prejudice deconstruction, cultural humility and critical reflection on own limitations, power and privileges; (2) the development of critical perspectives regarding the health care system; (3) a renewed vision of medical practice involving a less stigmatizing approach, advocacy, empowerment, interdisciplinarity and intersectorality; and (4) strengthened professional identity and future practice orientation including confirmation of interest for community-based practice, the identification of criteria for choosing a future practice setting, and commitment to becoming an actor of social change. Certain characteristics of the setting, the patients and the learner's individual profile are shown to be factors that promote these learnings. Conclusions: This article highlights how a traineeship experience within a clinical setting intended for a clientele experiencing circumstances of social vulnerability and operating under an alternative paradigm presents an opportunity for transformative learning and health practice transformation toward renewed values of health equity and social justice. Our findings suggest medical traineeships in community-based clinical settings are a promising lead to foster the development of fundamental learnings that are conducive to acceptable and equitable care for people experiencing social vulnerability. © 2020 The Author(s).

It is based on in-depth interviews with 13 European husbands in Thailand and 13 Thai wives who have recently returned from Europe. We find that European husbands in Thailand experience elevated status as they are perceived by Thai locals to be transnationally privileged with wealth and power; while Thai wives in Europe experience cultural and social downward mobility, often facing prejudice and discrimination. The elevated status that European husbands experience in Thailand leads many to adopt a ‘Eurocentric’ approach, leading to a lack of engagement with Thai society. However, both groups of migrants are relatively vulnerable: the perceived elevated status of European husbands tends to decline over time; while Thai wives in Europe lack substantive social and emotional safety nets. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nursing profession faces significant challenges including; failure to recruit high school students into nursing education, poor nursing identity, and lack of awareness about the nursing profession. The level of community awareness and public image of the nursing profession are critical to recruit and retain students into nursing education, and to improve nurses’ sense of identity. Aim: To explore the level of community awareness and public image of the nursing profession in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with a convenient sample of 502 adults including106 males and 396 females, their mean age was 22.93 ± 6.76 years. Data collected included; socio-cultural data, gender preference in getting nursing care, awareness, and perceived socio-cultural barriers to pursue a nursing career. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Results: Only 32.5% preferred to get nursing care by Saudis. The nursing profession was not viewed as a respected job as 71.5% of participants would be ashamed of having a nurse in their families. The study revealed a low median knowledge score (50.0, IQR: 50.0–66.7)). The study highlighted a number of socio-cultural barriers to pursue a nursing career including; the gender-mixed working environment (35.9%), delayed marriage of female nurses (20.3%), and the negative effect of nursing profession on social life (64.5%). Conclusions: Half of the sample had a knowledge score below 50.0 out of 100. This level of poor awareness, in addition to socio-cultural perceived barriers are the main factors contributing to the negative public image of the nursing profession in Saudi Arabia. Understanding these factors could contribute to implementing focused intervention to improve the negative stereotype of the nursing profession among Saudis. © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

AB  - With globalization and immigration, societal contexts differ in sheer variety of resident social groups. Social diversity challenges individuals to think in new ways about new kinds of people and where their groups all stand, relative to each other. However, psychological science does not yet specify how human minds represent social diversity, in homogeneous or heterogenous contexts. Mental maps of the array of society’s groups should differ when individuals inhabit more and less diverse ecologies. Nonetheless, predictions disagree on how they should differ. Confirmation bias suggests more diversity means more stereotype dispersion: With increased exposure, perceivers’ mental maps might differentiate more among groups, so their stereotypes would spread out (disperse). In contrast, individuation suggests more diversity means less stereotype dispersion, as perceivers experience within-group variety and between-group overlap. Worldwide, nationwide, individual, and longitudinal datasets (n = 12,011) revealed a diversity paradox: More diversity consistently meant less stereotype dispersion. Both contextual and perceived ethnic diversity correlate with decreased stereotype dispersion. Countries and US states with higher levels of ethnic diversity (e.g., South Africa and Hawaii, versus South Korea and Vermont), online individuals who perceive more ethnic diversity, and students who moved to more ethnically diverse colleges mentally represent ethnic groups as more similar to each other, on warmth and competence stereotypes. Homogeneity shows more-differentiated stereotypes; ironically, those with the least exposure have the most-distinct stereotypes. Diversity means less-differentiated stereotypes, as in the melting pot metaphor. Diversity and reduced dispersion also correlate positively with subjective wellbeing. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article describes the growing anti-vaccine movements in the context of right-wing populism, which is also gaining popularity around the world. According to the authors, these two phenomena have a lot in common, and the activists of the anti-vaccine movements often intermingle with populist right-wing movements. The connection between anti-vaccine activists and populists is illustrated in the analysis of discourse and anti-vaccine arguments presented in materials on the Polish-language YouTube channel, as well as in comments on YouTube forums. The slogans of the defence of ‘ordinary people’ against ‘corrupt elites’ in the medical dimension indicate a dislike for ‘medical conspiracy’ and doctors corrupted by pharmaceutical concerns. Just like right-wing populists, opponents of vaccines in Poland refer to nationalist slogans and have an aversion to the European Union. In addition to the rejection of the WHO standards on sex education and the sceptic attitude to environmental changes, the rejection of vaccines is another manifestation of the conspiracy ideologies of right-wing populists in Poland that may affect health and health policy. In the area of public health, this means rejecting medical knowledge and replacing it with myths and prejudices proclaimed by anti-vaccine movements, among others. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article explores the attitudes of New Zealanders to the social marketing campaign ‘Give nothing to racism’. Thematic analysis was applied to a series of comments posted on the New Zealand Human Rights Commission (HRC)’s Facebook page. The analysis revealed four key themes: ‘It starts at the top’; ‘White people are victims too’; ‘What is racism anyway?’; and ‘We are all equal’. These themes showed that the campaign did not create a single, unified desire among audiences to overcome racism. Posts from the public ranged from commending the HRC for stamping out racism to condemnation for shedding light on an issue that some felt was non-existent in New Zealand society or which unfairly targeted ‘white New Zealanders’. The campaign appeared to produce ethnocentric and prejudiced responses, and the comments were evidence of in-group favouritism and othering of Māori. This article contends that social media platforms are spaces where “bullying, offensive content and hate speech” (Mondal, Silva & Benevenuto, 2017, p.85) can undermine social marketing and attempts to establish social cohesion and unity. © 2020, New Zealand Sociology.

AB  - Though intergroup contact may reduce negative bias in offline interactions, there is mixed evidence for how technology-mediated contact can diminish bias, particularly with the emergence of new technology systems such as virtual reality (VR). Building on avatar communication and technology-mediated contact research, this study explored how customising avatars to resemble the self, together with the salience of common ingroup identity cues affected intergroup perceptions in a VR interaction. Avatar customisation is thought to increase users’ connection with the virtual environment and with their own avatars, particularly when avatars mirror their own physical traits. Similarly, the salience of a common identity among members of ingroups and outgroups is thought to influence users positively, by making them feel belonging to a wider category, therefore reducing former outgroup bias. Accordingly, an experimental study involving dyadic VR interactions between members of different ethnic groups was carried out. Results showed that participants who customised self-resembling avatars and interacted with an outgroup member in presence of a common ingroup identity, reported less perceived outgroup bias. Contrary to predictions, outgroup bias was reduced indirectly via identification with the virtual group (superordinate category), but only when the common ingroup identity was not made salient. These results are discussed in terms of how sociotechnical factors in VR can potentially affect technology-mediated intergroup contact. © 2020, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines dozens of textual artifacts from 1985 to 2018 that illustrate the significant cultural place that Poe’s “The Masque of the Red Death” occupied as a touchstone during the early years and subsequent decades of the AIDS crisis as its plot, characters, and imagery became useful vehicles for thinking through numerous issues around the epidemic and for supporting various positions in the social and political debates that developed. A consideration of how these works use “Masque” to reinforce or confront their times’ prejudices, to advocate for political resistance and activism, and to address individual and collective grief provides the opportunity to understand how Poe’s writing serves its future audiences in ways that its author and its earlier readers could never have imagined. © 2020 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.

AB  - Inspired by recent debates on Wigner’s friend extensions to bipartite scenarios, we analyze the following situation: Alice and Bob start out with an entangled state | Ψ⟩ AB; following a measurement by one of the parties, Bob’s state is updated to | φ⟩ B. If the measurement was performed by Bob himself, Bob knows that Alice’s state has been steered to | χ←(φ) ⟩ A. If the measurement was performed by Alice, Bob knows that Alice must have found a | χ→(φ) ⟩ A which is generally different, as a consequence of the well-known “Hardy’s ladder”. Based on this observation, we show that information from direct measurement must trump inference from steering. The erroneous belief that both paths should lead to identical conclusions can be traced to the usual prejudice that measurements should reveal a pre-existing state of affairs. We also prove a technical result on Hardy’s ladder: the minimum value of | ⟨ χ←(φ) | χ→(φ) ⟩ | is 2p0pn-1/(p0+pn-1), where p and pn-1 are the smallest (non-zero) and the largest Schmidt coefficients of | Ψ⟩ AB. © 2020, Chapman University.

AB  - Exogenous attention allows the automatic detection of relevant stimuli and the reorientation of our current focus of attention towards them. Faces from an ethnic outgroup tend to capture exogenous attention to a greater extent than faces from an ethnic ingroup. We explored whether prejudice toward the outgroup, rather than lack of familiarity, is driving this effect. Participants (N= 76) performed a digit categorization task while distractor faces were presented. Faces belonged to (i) a prejudiced outgroup, (ii) a non-prejudiced outgroup and (iii) their ingroup. Half of the faces were previously habituated in order to increase their familiarity. Reaction times, accuracy and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to index exogenous attention to distractor faces. Additionally, different indexes of explicit and implicit prejudice were measured, the latter being significantly greater towards prejudiced outgroup. N170 amplitude was greater to prejudiced outgroup—regardless of their habituation status—than to both non-prejudiced outgroup and ingroup faces and was associated with implicit prejudice measures. No effects were observed at the behavioral level. Our results show that implicit prejudice, rather than familiarity, is under the observed attention-related N170 effects and that this ERP component may be more sensitive to prejudice than behavioral measures under certain circumstances. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The 'suspect community' theory, first introduced by Paddy Hillyard, claims that the British Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974 in its operation was responsible for producing discrimination against the communities of Northern Ireland during 'The Troubles". This theory has subsequently been applied to Muslim communities in the UK in the wake of the attacks of 9/11 (New York and Washington) and 7/7 (London Transport System) by Islamist terrorists. This article presents an alternative theory on the emergence of suspect communities, arguing that a suspect community is formed at the initiation of conflict and not in response to legislation dealing with conflict. In this alternative framework, the initiation of conflict and the reactions of opposing factions, combined with public outgroup perceptions of threat, create the suspect community. This alternative theory draws on psychosocial theories, including group perception of threat, social and group identity theory and out-group paranoia. The article suggests an altered starting point and offers a process to potentially reduce public bias and therefore radicalisation and recruitment at the community level. © 2020 Terrorism Research Initiative.

AB  - Anti-immigrant policymaking in the U.S. is a critical social determinant of health compromising the wellbeing of immigrants and, by extension, communities of color. It is imperative that social work, public health, and other allied professions unite to address anti-immigrant policymaking by improving intergroup attitudes and building broader public support for immigrant integration. This study fills a gap in the literature by psychometrically developing and initially validating a measure of attitudes toward integrationist immigration policymaking. A three-stage study was conducted to explore, calibrate, and validate the factor structure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings suggest there are two distinct but interrelated dimensions of attitudes toward integrationist immigration policies: support for the (a) extension of pathways to legal status and (b) expansion of eligibility for social rights and benefits. Initial evidence of criterion validity for the scale is offered. The utility of the measure for intergroup intervention testing is discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Pathogen threat can translate into a willingness to distance oneself from others on a psychological level. Building on this notion, we predicted that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic can affect attitudes toward foreign nationalities. We explored the intergroup consequences of the current epidemiological situation in two studies involving a total of 652 participants. In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the United Kingdom (UK) and in Poland, and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about coronavirus through the increase in anxiety, but this effect was not observed when a generalized measure of prejudice was considered. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice and anxiety are sensitive to the current epidemiological situation, and our findings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most affected by the pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have produced social distance rankings to identify differences in the intensity of stigma associated with various general medical and mental health conditions. All of these studies, however, treat ‘‘mental illness’’ as a single homogeneous condition, when in reality different diagnoses of mental illness may elicit different levels of stigma. Aims of the Study: Within our samples, we aim to: (i) determine if there are significant differences in the intensity of stigma associated with different mental/behavior disorders; (ii) compare the intensity of stigma associated with mental/behavior disorders vs. physical/ sensory disorders; and (iii) analyze the effect of familiarity with a person who has a mental/behavior disorder on the stigma associated with that disorder. Methods: College students in the U.S. (n=213) and Republic of Korea (n=354) completed a survey of community attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Students were asked to rank 22 health conditions, including 10 mental/behavior disorders, according to the level of acceptance most usually accorded to persons with that condition in their society. Students also indicated, for each condition, whether they had close contact with a person who had that condition. Results: Students in both countries indicated a lower mean level of acceptance for the group of mental/behavior disorders than for the group of physical or sensory disorders. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in the acceptability of different types of mental/behavior disorders, with schizophrenia and substance use disorders eliciting the most negative attitudes in both samples. Familiarity is correlated with greater acceptance for most, but not all, mental/behavior disorders. Discussion: Mental illness-related stigma imposes costs on society in the form of productivity losses and increased rates of dependency. Reducing these costs requires an understanding of the negative stereotypes that are the source of stigma, and an appreciation of differences in the nature and intensity of stigma associated with different mental disorders. Limitations of the study include: lack of generalizability of the results; terminology which may have generated negative associations for some survey items; possibility of missing variables or data measured with error. Implications for Health Policies: The findings with respect to familiarity underscore the importance of inclusive policies to combat mental illness-related stigma. Anti-stigma policies must, however, account for differences in attitudes toward different diagnoses of mental illness. Strategies that may be effective in reducing stigma for some disorders may be counterproductive for others. Implications for Further Research: Many social distance studies rely on non-random samples, limiting generalizability of the results. Future research may be able to exploit web-based survey methods to obtain larger, more representative samples. Studies should include multiple diagnoses of mental/behavior disorders, instead of a single category of mental illness, and explore the ways in which familiarity affects intensity of stigma for different mental disorders.

AB  - The importance of social connection to well-being is underscored by individuals’ reactivity to events highlighting the potential for rejection and exclusion, which extends even to observing the social exclusion of others (“vicarious ostracism”). Because responses to vicarious ostracism depend at least in part on empathy with the target, and individuals tend to empathize less readily with outgroup than ingroup members, the question arises as to whether there is a boundary condition on vicarious ostracism effects whereby individuals are relatively immune to observing ingroup-on-outgroup ostracism. Of particular interest is the case where members of a dominant ethnic group observe fellow ingroup members ostracize a member of a disadvantaged ethnic minority group, as here there is a compelling potential alternative: Perceived violation of contemporary social norms condemning prejudice and discrimination might instead lead dominant group members to be especially upset by “dominant-on-disadvantaged” ostracism. Accordingly, the present research examines, across four studies and 4413 participants, individuals’ affective reactions to observing dominant-on-disadvantaged versus dominant-on-dominant ostracism. In each study, dominant group members (White/Europeans) observed dominant group members include or ostracize a fellow dominant group member or a disadvantaged ethnic minority group member (a Black individual) in an online Cyberball game. Results revealed that dominant group members felt more guilt, anger, and sadness after observing severe ostracism of a disadvantaged as opposed to dominant group member. Although no direct effects emerged on behavioral outcomes, exploratory analyses suggested that observing ostracism of a disadvantaged (versus dominant) group member had indirect effects on behavior via increased feelings of anger. These results suggest that observing ostracism may be a sufficiently potent and relatable experience that when it occurs across group boundaries it awakens individuals’ sensitivity to injustice and discrimination. © 2020 Petsnik, Vorauer.

AB  - While there are many studies of prejudice towards disadvantaged minorities, there has been little research into stereotypes of rich people. The author commissioned the first international comparative study to investigate popular attitudes towards rich people. He analyses findings from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and France, and calculates a ‘Social Envy Coefficient’ for these four countries. Envy appears most pronounced in France, followed by Germany. By contrast, envy is significantly lower in the United States and Great Britain, although there are interesting variations by age. In addition, the study subjects a sample of popular international feature films and articles in German newspapers to detailed media content analysis. This analysis finds that rich individuals are predominantly portrayed as cold-hearted, profit-hungry and morally suspect. © 2020 Institute of Economic Affairs

AB  - Recently, Italy has seen a dramatic increase in violent attacks on immigrants, suggesting that anti-immigrant attitudes are rising in Italy. It has often been found that especially lower educated tend to be unwelcoming towards immigrants. Moreover, an important reason for people to be unwelcoming towards immigrants is that immigrants are perceived to be a threat. Following socialization theory, this paper explores the possibility that the more educated perceive less threat because education socializes them into a culture of openness towards others, whereas the less educated are socialized into a culture in which national identification and traditions are central. The eighth round of the European Social Survey is used and mediation analyses are conducted by means of the process-macro. We find partial mediation, with the more educated perceiving less threat because they attach more importance to openness and less importance to traditions. Whereas we expected the higher educated to be less emotionally attached to Italy, we find them to be higher identifiers. However, national identification did not influence the level of perceived immigrant threat. © 2020, Padova University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The primary purpose of political, civil, socioeconomic, and cultural rights is to protect the dignity of all human beings. Good mental health and well-being is defined by the “social, psychosocial, economic, and physical environment that enables individuals and populations to live a life of dignity, with full enjoyment of their rights and in the equitable pursuit of their potential.”1 Stigmatization, discrimination, and negative stereotypes are barriers to mental health and well-being.2 Individuals with mental health problems, including those with drug dependence, suffer stigmatization, which is a direct affront to dignity and may have enduring health impacts. This paper discusses the implications of stigma for a human-rights based approach to improving mental health among those with drug dependence, with a focus on the opioid epidemic now ravaging the United States. It explores the public health burden of stigma related to substance misuse, including stigma in the context of treatment and health care. It also discusses the role of policy initiatives—including decriminalization—in addressing stigma related to substance misuse. © 2020 Wogen and Restrepo.

AB  - To date, patient motivations for Asian blepharoplasty and the surgery's impact on quality of life have not been quantified. Here, we employed structured interviews and a web-based survey to better characterize patient motivations for Asian blepharoplasty and the impact of Asian blepharoplasty on self-reported domains of happiness, self-esteem, attractiveness, social life, and professional life. Structured interviews were conducted to inform a web-based survey regarding Asian blepharoplasty. Survey respondents used visual analog scales to rate their satisfaction with their eye shape, motivations for undergoing Asian blepharoplasty, and perceived outcomes after surgery. A total of 315 participants (mean 25.7 [18-58] years) of East or Southeast Asian descent were included. 185 participants expressed no desire for Asian blepharoplasty, 76 expressed some desire, and 54 had already undergone surgery. There were statistically significant differences regarding baseline satisfaction, perceived social limitation, and perceived professional limitations regarding eye shape (p < 0.0001). The Looking Glass Self index (comprised of media exposure, low self-esteem, and negative stereotypes related to eye shape) is negatively associated with preoperative satisfaction with eye shape (rho = -0.29, p < 0.01). The desire for social-professional advancement and the Looking Glass Self index significantly predict self-reported improvements in professional and social life, respectively (both p < 0.01). Asian blepharoplasty may be driven by functional, social, or economic patient motivations. Some patients may see Asian blepharoplasty as a potential solution for sociological concerns. These expectations should be further explored in physician-patient discussions regarding candidacy for surgery and establishing expectations for postoperative outcomes. © 2020 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aimed to assess the current situation of Chinese dental bachelor interns on HIV/AIDS-related knowledge and their attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, paper-based survey involving 147 dental students from three Chinese dental schools was conducted. Students were recruited to complete the questionnaire regarding their knowledge, awareness and attitudes concerning HIV/AIDS anonymously and voluntarily. Results: A total of 144 students responded to the study, generating a response rate of 98.0%. Although 97.0% of the dental students believed dentists were at high risk of HIV infection, 97.2% of students expressed no prejudice towards HIV/AIDS patients and stated their willingness to provide oral healthcare service for such patients. No statistically significant differences in the responses on attitudes and some basic knowledge were found between students who had received the relevant education about infection control and the students who had not. However, regarding most questions about oral manifestations in adult and paediatric patients living with AIDS, the students who received relevant education showed more knowledge than the students who did not (p <0.05). The cognitive level about respecting HIV/AIDS patients' autonomy and privacy was generally low in all the students. Conclusions: Most of the dental students in this survey held positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients and good grasp of some basic knowledge about HIV/AIDS. On the other hand, the questionnaire results reflected gaps in education, such as respecting HIV/AIDS patients' privacy. © 2020 Quintessence Publishing Co., Ltd.

AB  - Background Sexual identity is a significant risk factor for triggering symptoms of depression, as well as for suicide attempts in lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) population compared to the heterosexual population. To the best of our knowledge, data on the mental health of LGB persons in Serbia are lacking, and this is the first study to address this problem. The aim of the study was to examine the association between selected determinants and depression, and selected determinants and suicide attempts in LGB and heterosexual populations in the Republic of Serbia, as well as, their differences. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2015 of 264 heterosexual and LGB respondents using the "snowball sampling" method. We used linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between socio-demographic variables and different sexual identity categories with PHQ-9 scores. We assessed associations between suicide attempts, and socio-demographic characteristics, sexual identity, depression, and suicidal thoughts using logistic regression. Results Depression symptoms were higher in female relative to male participants, in participants who were single, divorced or widowed in comparison to currently married, among people with a middle level of education compared to highly educated, and in respondents identified as bisexual or homosexual in comparison to heterosexual. Homosexual and bisexual participants reported suicidal attempts 27 [Odds Ratio (OR) = 27.31] and six times (OR = 6.40) more often than did heterosexual respondents, respectively. Suicide attempts were less frequently reported by single, divorced or widowed participants in comparison to married (OR = 0.25) and those with middle education (OR = 0.38) compared to highly educated. Conclusions The present study showed that LGB persons in Serbia have significantly more symptoms of depression and suicide attempts compared to heterosexuals. Public health interventions should focus on the early detection of depression and on overcoming prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes. Also, intervention should emphasize that homosexuality and bisexuality are normal, equal and morally acceptable expressions of human sexuality. © 2020 Janković et al.

AB  - Discrimination in the workplace is illegal, yet discriminatory practices remain a persistent global problem. To identify discriminatory practices in the workplace, job advertisement analysis was used by previous studies. However, most of those studies adopted content analysis by manually coding the text from a limited number of samples since working with a large scale of job advertisements consisting of unstructured text data is very challenging. Encountering those limitations, the present study involves text mining techniques to identify multiple types of direct discrimination on a large scale of online job advertisements by designing a method called Direct Discrimination Detection (DDD). The DDD is constructed using a combination of N-grams and regular expressions (regex) with the exact match principle of a Boolean retrieval model. A total of 8,969 online job advertisements in English and Bahasa Indonesia, published from May 2005 to December 2017 were collected from bursakerja-jateng.com as the data. The results reveal that the practices of direct discrimination still exist during the job-hunting process including gender, marital status, physical appearances, and religion. The most recurrent type of discrimination which occurs in job advertisements is based on age (66.27%), followed by gender (38.76%), and physical appearances (18.42%). Additionally, female job seekers are found as the most vulnerable party to experience direct discrimination during recruitment. The results exhibit female job seekers face complex jeopardy in particular job positions comparing to their male counterparts. Not only excluded because of their gender, but female job seekers also had to fulfil more requirements for getting an opportunity to apply for the jobs such as being single, still at a young age, complying specific physical appearances and particular religious preferences. This study illustrates the power and potential of optimizing computational methods on a large scale of unstructured text data to analyze phenomena in the social field. © 2020 Ningrum et al.

AB  - Collective narcissism is a belief that one’s own group (the in-group) is exceptional but not sufficiently recognized by others. It is the form of “in-group love” robustly associated with “out-group hate.” In contrast to private collective self-esteem (or in-group satisfaction, a belief that the in-group is of high value), it predicts prejudice, retaliatory intergroup aggression, and rejoicing in the suffering of other people. The pervasive association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is driven by a biased perception of the in-group as constantly threatened and out-groups as hostile and threatening. Collective narcissism is associated with hypersensitivity to provocation and the belief that only hostile revenge is a desirable and rewarding response. It arises when the traditional group-based hierarchies are challenged and empowers extremists as well as populist politicians. Instead of alleviating the sense of threat to one’s self-importance, it refuels it. The association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is weakened by experiences that fortify emotional resilience (e.g., positive identification with a community). © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Terrorist attacks, refugee movements from crisis regions as well as barriers to integration among immigrants have also been increasing fears of Islam in Austria, whereby Muslims are often regarded all too generally as outsiders to Austrian society. In this article the results of a representative study (Social Survey Austria 2018) are presented, which includes the first time a sophisticated scale on attitudes towards Muslims. In addition, a sequential multiple regression analysis will be used for a more detailed analysis of classical factors influencing critical attitudes towards Islam, whereby a new research gap will be addressed focusing on religious attitudes and practices of Austrians. The analysis of the extent of anti-Muslim sentiment in Austria reveals a dominant critical view. However, the influences of religious orientations are manifold: While conventional religious practice (such as church attendance and praying) as well as superstition reinforces animosities, inclusive religious attitudes and individual practices of spirituality lead to more tolerant attitudes. The results, which indicate a tendency towards greater tolerance among religious people, show that we are in Austria mainly confronted with cultural rather than interreligious conflicts, which are primarily centered around identity and recognition. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The evidence for differential effects of positive and negative intergroup contact on prejudice is mixed. We propose that the closeness of the relationships respondents have with contact partners can explain inconsistencies in previous findings. In three studies (total N = 953), we tested the associations between positive intimate, negative intimate, positive superficial, and negative superficial contact and attitudes toward different outgroups (immigrants and gay people). We hypothesized that: (H1) the effect of positive contact would be maximized in intimate interactions; (H2) the effect of negative contact would be maximized in superficial interactions; (H3) positive intimate and negative superficial contact would have similar power in predicting attitudes. Results always supported H1, and supported H2 and H3 only with immigrants. Findings held also when controlling for category salience and agreeableness, but not for social dominance orientation, which instead strengthened the effect of negative superficial contact. Overall, findings clarify the positive–negative contact asymmetry. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Social Identity Theory (SIT) as used in cross-cultural organizational psychology (CCOP) shows individualistic biases by envisioning an autonomous person whose culture supports temporary, largely independent, and readily interchangeable relationships with multiple categorical groups, organizations, and other collectives. We seek to reduce these biases in CCOP by drawing from recent social psychological analyses, notably Motivated Identity Construction Theory, that have refined identity theory’s original principles. To make a broad range of organizational applications, we rely heavily on our cross-cultural psychology audience’s familiarity with basic SIT topics and controversies by discussing them quite briefly. We apply such refinements to theories about correlates of organizational identification (OI) measures, interpretive OI theorizing, and an intrapersonal network approach to OI. We conclude by extending these refinements to other constructs linking individuals to organizations: organizational commitment, attachments to organization groups and components, and roles and norms. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Three studies examined the influence of exposure to religious concepts on attitudes of Jews toward Muslims in Israel. Religious concepts were exposed by using either supraliminal (Study 1) or subliminal (Study 2) priming, hence tapping different levels of awareness. Comparable supraliminal and subliminal priming techniques were further employed to investigate the effects of participants’ own religious content (“Jewish”) and content representing the “other” religion (“Islamic”) on attitudes of Jewish participants toward members of the Muslim group (Study 3). Findings indicated that exposure to religious concepts at a conscious level increased threat perceptions and negative attitudes, while lack of awareness of religious concepts had positive outcomes. Additionally, realistic and symbolic threats played a mediating role in understanding the impact of Jewish concepts on perceived social distance only under conditions of awareness of religious concepts. Our results convey the importance of investigating why religious diversity in society may not always have a positive impact on intergroup relations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We examine whether perceived interpersonal discrimination mediates the association between disability and psychological well-being (depression, negative and positive affect) and how these processes differ across the life course. Data are from two waves (2004–2006; 2013–2014) of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS; N = 2,503). Perceived discrimination accounts for 5% to 8% of the association between disability and the three mental health outcomes. Moderated mediation analyses reveal significant age differences; perceived discrimination is a stronger explanatory mechanism among midlife (ages 40–64) relative to older (age 65+) adults. Disability stigma takes a heightened psychological toll at midlife, a life stage when adults are expected to be able-bodied and interact with a diverse social network, which may be a source of interpersonal mistreatment. Among older adults, for whom impairment is expected and common, the psychological impact of disability may operate through other pathways. We discuss implications for research and practice. © American Sociological Association 2020.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered global panic. We have conducted an anonymous online survey of Asian medical students in Poland to assess whether they experience any form of prejudice related to the ongoing pandemic. As demonstrated, the COVID-19 outbreak had triggered xenophobic reactions toward students of Asian-origin (n = 85) before the first SARS-CoV-2 case was confirmed in Poland. Facing prejudice, including discrimination related to COVID-19, may add to feelings of isolation of students of Asian origin who study abroad, and affect career development, especially for students. We recommend that universities should proactively develop policies that support students, faculty, and staff affected by discriminatory behavior both during the current outbreak and in the future. However, preventing such behaviors should also be enforced by national authorities © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Stigma plays an important role in understanding successful interventions to control the opioid epidemic in the United States. Stigma has been described both as an agent to incentivize positive health behavior and as an agent of marginalization contributing to poorer health. Past scholarship has argued that stigma has positively motivated public health changes, for example, among tobacco users; it has also been associated with discrimination against vulnerable individuals, resulting in increasingly poorer health behaviors, for example in relation to HIV-prevention messaging.The discourse on stigma may conflate the denormalization of unhealthy behaviors with wholesale rejection of individual identities. More effective interventions would counter stigma against people who use opioids in general and specifically denormalize opioid misuse. These interventions might alter the effect of public health messaging and ultimately improve outcomes.We argue that public health educators and communication campaigns can contribute to positive social norm change and motivate healthy behaviors by incorporating strategies that attempt to disentangle unhealthy behaviors from identity.

AB  - Black women are disproportionately impacted by HIV and depression has been linked to negative HIV outcomes. Little attention has been given to social/structural factors that may drive depression among Black women living with HIV (BWLWH), including discrimination and gendered racial microaggressions (GRM). One hundred BWLWH completed measures on GRM, race- and HIV-related discrimination, and depressive symptoms, as well as a clinical interview for major depressive episode (MDE). GRM and race- and HIV-related discrimination were significantly associated with depressive symptoms and increased likelihood of MDE, but only GRM contributed uniquely in associations with both. Interventions targeting depression among BWLWH should address GRM and race- and HIV-related discrimination. © 2020, The New York Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Understanding the roots of human cooperation, a social phenomenon embedded in pressing issues including climate change and social conflict, requires an interdisciplinary perspective. We propose a unifying value-based framework for understanding cooperation that integrates neuroeconomic models of decision-making with psychological variables involved in cooperation. We propose that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex serves as a neural integration hub for value computation during cooperative decisions, receiving inputs from various neurocognitive processes such as attention, memory, and learning. Next, we describe findings from social and personality psychology highlighting factors that shape the value of cooperation, including research on contexts and norms, personal and social identity, and intergroup relations. Our approach advances theoretical debates about cooperation by highlighting how previous findings are accommodated within a general value-based framework and offers novel predictions. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Transgender subjects in Manipuri society have experienced cultural legitimacy as well as prejudice and therefore have had an ambiguous status from early to modern times. From their early prototypes, pheitas, to their modern counterparts, nupi sabis, transgender subjects have played vital roles in the administrative, cultural and artistic life of Manipuri society. Legitimacy as well as stigma marked their participation in social and economic life. This article traces the emergence of the nupi maanbi community, a community of man-to-woman transgender subjects and argues that the current nupi maanbi identity, embedded in this distinct community, is firmly located in the economic niche that the subjects inhabit as professionals in the increasingly popular fashion and beauty parlours in contemporary Manipur. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The article uses ethnographic research on right-wing anti-government movements in Bolivia conducted at the height of social conflict and cultural violence in 2008 and 2009 to reflect more generally on the relationship between anthropological research, ethical commitment, and the politics of knowledge. The article first describes the relevant epistemological and political contexts in which engaged anthropology emerged as an important disciplinary current. It then goes on to consider how and why the author's research on right-wing political practice in Bolivia diverged from the disciplinary expectations of engaged anthropology. After reflecting on the implications of this shift, the article concludes by arguing for a methodological recalibration that allows anthropologists to take seriously the ideologies and cultural logics of contemporary right-wing mobilization, particularly social and political movements that are animated by what Edmund Burke described as ‘just prejudice’. © Royal Anthropological Institute 2020

AB  - A growing body of literature suggests that OT administration may affect not only prosocial outcomes, but also regulate adversarial responses in the context of intergroup relations. However, recent reports have challenged the view of a fixed role of OT in enhancing ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Studying the potential effects of OT in modulating threat perception in a context characterized by racial miscegenation (Brazil) may thus afford additional clarification on the matter. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, White Brazilian participants completed a first-person shooter task to assess their responses towards potential threat from racial ingroup (White) or outgroup (Black) members. OT administration enhanced the social salience of the outgroup, by both increasing the rate at which participants refrained from shooting unarmed Black targets to levels similar to White targets, and by further increasing the rate of correct decisions to shoot armed Black targets (versus White armed targets). In summary, our results indicate that a single dose of OT may promote accurate behavioral responses to potential threat from members of a racial outgroup, thus offering support to the social salience hypothesis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Psychological and neural evidence suggests that negative attitudes toward stigmatized individuals arise in part from failures to perceive them as social targets. Here, we tested whether experimentally upregulating neural regions involved in social cognition would predict subsequent decreases in bias toward stigmatized individuals (i.e., people who use substances). Methods: Participants underwent fMRI while completing either a lovingkindness intervention task or a control task, and each task was reinforced via daily text messages for a month following the one-time fMRI scan. Changes in implicit bias against stigmatized individuals were measured by Implicit Association Tests. Results: The lovingkindness intervention task, compared with a control task, elicited greater baseline activity in the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), implicated in mentalizing, or the process of making inferences about others’ mental states. The lovingkindness task compared with the control task also produced marginal decreases in bias over the month of the intervention. Individual differences in initial RTPJ activity at baseline during the fMRI intervention tasks further predicted improved implicit attitudes toward stigmatized individuals a month later. Conclusions: The current study suggests that individual differences in people’s tendency to engage brain regions that support taking others’ perspectives are associated with greater changes in bias reduction over time. It is possible that strategies that upregulate mentalizing activity, such as lovingkindness training and other strategies that increase social cognitive processing, may be effective in shifting people’s biases against stigmatized individuals. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mowat–Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized clinically by a distinctive facial gestalt, intellectual disability, microcephaly, epilepsy, and nonobligatory congenital malformations such as Hirschsprung disease, urogenital anomalies, congenital heart disease, eye malformations. This article summarized the clinical features and molecular findings of 15 Chinese MWS patients. The results revealed a higher incidence of congenital heart disease in Chinese MWS patients compared to that previously reported in Caucasian cohorts, while the incidence of Hirschsprung disease and genitourinary malformation appeared to be lower. This suggests possible ethnicity-related modifying effects in the MWS phenotype. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Promoting a healthy diet in children remains a prominent public health priority. Parents have been shown to be a major influence on their children's eating behaviors, but limited research has been devoted to exploring the factors that lead parents to select certain feeding practices over others. Past research has demonstrated a link between weight stigma (i.e., prejudicial attitudes or discriminatory behavior targeted at individuals who carry excess weight) and an individual's own weight-related behaviors and outcomes, but no study has examined how parental levels of weight stigma maybe associated with a parent's preferred feeding practices. The primary objective of this study was to examine the cross-sectional associations between parental levels of weight-based stigmatization with parental feeding practices. Responses were collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk website for n = 406 parents who 1) had at least one child aged 5–10 and 2) perceived themselves to be overweight or obese. After adjusting for relevant covariates, parental weight stigma was shown to be significantly associated with restrictive feeding practices, and verbal modeling of eating behaviors (all ps < .05). A priori exploratory mediation analysis identified concern about child weight as a significant mediator between weight stigma and parental feeding practices. A discussion of the potential limitations of this study, future directions of research, and implications of these findings are included. © 2020

AB  - Aim: To explore health professionals' views about who would benefit from using a closed-loop system and who should be prioritized for access to the technology in routine clinical care. Methods: Health professionals (n = 22) delivering the Closed Loop from Onset in type 1 Diabetes (CLOuD) trial were interviewed after they had ≥ 6 months' experience supporting participants using a closed-loop system. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Interviewees described holding strong assumptions about the types of people who would use the technology effectively prior to the trial. Interviewees described changing their views as a result of observing individuals engaging with the closed-loop system in ways they had not anticipated. This included educated, technologically competent individuals who over-interacted with the system in ways which could compromise glycaemic control. Other individuals, who health professionals assumed would struggle to understand and use the technology, were reported to have benefitted from it because they stood back and allowed the system to operate without interference. Interviewees concluded that individual, family and psychological attributes cannot be used as pre-selection criteria and, ideally, all individuals should be given the chance to try the technology. However, it was recognized that clinical guidelines will be needed to inform difficult decisions about treatment allocation (and withdrawal), with young children and infants being considered priority groups. Conclusions: To ensure fair and equitable access to closed-loop systems, prejudicial assumptions held by health professionals may need to be addressed. To support their decision-making, clinical guidelines need to be made available in a timely manner. © 2020 The Authors. Diabetic Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Diabetes UK

AB  - As culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse students continue to be underrepresented in gifted programs, the beliefs that frame teacher perceptions of giftedness remain an important area of focus. Literature indicates that a lack of gifted-specific coursework in teacher preparation programs may sustain ill-formed preconceptions regarding giftedness, leading new teachers to rely on bias and stereotypic thinking when nominating students for gifted identification. Furthermore, deficit thinking and colorblind racial attitudes may interfere with the implementation of culture-fair identification practices and the implementation of multicultural pedagogy meant to elicit unique strengths and engage culturally diverse students. This article explores these barriers to equitable programming and concludes with broad recommendations for school psychologists in advocating for traditionally underrepresented gifted students. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Stigma against those who suffer from mental illness is a major issue in many nations. Stigma, which is comprised of prejudice, ignorance, and discrimination, serves as a barrier to seeking help and staying in contact with mental health services. It is thus imperative that concerted efforts are taken against stigma. Methods: Eight young psychiatrists from eight Asian nations offer a narrative review of the state of stigma in their respective nations, the sociocultural reasons behind this stigma, recent anti-stigma efforts and the effects, if any, of such efforts. Results: Despite these eight nations lying varying significantly in terms of economic developmental levels, there are sociocultural commonalities that undergird stigma across these nations. It is also evident that there have been more recent concerted efforts to combat this stigma, and in some countries, there has been a change in the perceptions of mental illness. Conclusion: The causes of stigma tend to be similar across various nations, and this perhaps suggests that international collaboration and a concerted global effort to combat this problem might thus be a possibility. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - We investigated the content of survey items to assess whether and how racist and sexist stereotypes are woven into the fabric of research on attitudes about abortion in the United States. We collected and analyzed a comprehensive set of survey items (456 items from 80 studies) used in peer-reviewed research published from 2008 to 2018 in representative and nonrepresentative studies of U.S. respondents. Our analysis was guided by historical narratives that have been influential in shaping representations of women and reproduction in the United States (e.g., the Moynihan Report). With this background, we developed three themes pertaining to how individuals’ attitudes about abortion are measured: we found that items rely on (1) moral, (2) sexual, and (3) financial evaluations of women seeking abortion care. These themes highlighted implicit and explicit judgments of women, including representations of them as unwilling to partner with men and as fiscally and sexually irresponsible. We argue that survey items meant to objectively assess abortion attitudes draw on negative racial and gender stereotypes and that these stereotypes then travel widely under the veneer of scientific objectivity. Critical methods, such as the item bank analysis described in this study, are crucial to discern how inequality, prejudice, and discrimination can be reproduced in the fabric of research methods. In our discussion, we offer suggestions for researchers to reduce these and related forms of bias in survey-based abortion research. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - The current study sought to determine whether holding targeted marginalized identities was associated with greater experiences of distress related to Trump's presidency and whether participants’ level of Trump-related distress predicted decrements in mental health. Participants in the current longitudinal study included 338 underrepresented college students attending a predominantly White institution. Results indicated that individuals who held targeted marginalized identities reported greater Trump-related distress compared to their non-targeted counterparts, and that holding multiple targeted marginalized identities was associated with greater levels of Trump-related distress. Findings also indicated that Trump-related distress was associated with increases (relative to previous trajectories) in anxious but not depressive symptoms. Overall, our results suggest that a shift in sociopolitical circumstances that promulgates bigotry may be harmful to those who possess targeted marginalized identities. © 2019 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - In this study, we examined the association between racial colorblindness and inaction to address prejudice. Conceptualized as a type of legitimizing ideology that maintains societal inequality, we hypothesized that colorblindness would be associated with less confidence in and lower likelihood of engaging in action to address prejudice. Our study examined the role of affective variables in explaining the link between colorblindness and inaction, as well as explored potential racial group differences. We used multigroup structural equation modeling analysis to test for measurement and structural invariance of our hypothesized model across White, Asian American, and Underrepresented racial minority (i.e., African American, Latinx American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Native American, and Multiracial students from Underrepresented groups) college students. In Study 1 (n = 1,125), we found that greater colorblindness was indirectly associated with less confidence in action through affective variables (e.g., intergroup empathy, and positive and negative emotions during intergroup interactions). In Study 2 (n = 1,356), we found that greater colorblindness was indirectly related to less likelihood of action through intergroup empathy. In both studies, we demonstrated measurement and structural invariance across racial groups, indicating that our hypothesized model functioned similarly across White, Underrepresented, and Asian American students. Our findings have implications for future research and practice to challenge colorblindness and to promote engagement in actions to reduce prejudice. © 2019 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - Stereotypes are ideological and justify the existing social structure. Although stereotypes persist, they can change when the context changes. Communism’s rise in Eastern Europe and Asia in the 20th century provides a natural experiment examining social-structural effects on social class stereotypes. Nine samples from postcommunist countries (N = 2,241), compared with 38 capitalist countries (N = 4,344), support the historical, sociocultural rootedness of stereotypes. More positive stereotypes of the working class appear in postcommunist countries, both compared with other social groups in the country and compared with working-class stereotypes in capitalist countries; postcommunist countries also show more negative stereotypes of the upper class. We further explore whether communism’s ideological legacy reflects how societies infer groups’ stereotypic competence and warmth from structural status and competition. Postcommunist societies show weaker status–competence relations and stronger (negative) competition–warmth relations; respectively, the lower meritocratic beliefs and higher priority of embeddedness as ideological legacies may shape these relationships. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Previous research has shown conflicting findings on how population diversity influences outgroup prejudice. In some cases, prejudice is greater when minority groups make up a larger portion of the population, whereas in other cases, prejudice is lower as diversity increases. This article examined how the diversity of a culture’s ancestry—or its historical heterogeneity—would be related to outgroup attitudes. Historically heterogeneous populations descend from ancestors who have migrated from many parts of the world over the past 500 years and, as a result, have a longer legacy of contact with diverse groups of people. The results of two cross-cultural studies found that greater heterogeneity predicted lower levels of outgroup prejudice, and some evidence that diversity in the current population was related to increased prejudice. The findings suggest that intergroup attitudes have deeply entrenched roots that cannot be fully understood by looking at current indicators. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - How do members of societally valued (dominant) groups respond when considering inequality? Prior research suggests that salient inequality may be viewed as a threat to dominant-group members’ self and collective moral character. However, people possess multiple social identities and may be advantaged in one domain (e.g., White) while concurrently disadvantaged in another domain (e.g., sexual minority). The present research tests whether individuals may reduce the moral-image threat of being societally advantaged in one domain by highlighting discrimination they face in other domains. Four experiments with individuals advantaged along different dimensions of inequality (race, social class, sexuality) reveal that making such inequality salient evokes greater perceived discrimination faced by oneself and one’s ingroups along other identity dimensions. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Many people argue that support for populist radical-right political agents is motivated by people feeling “left behind” in globalized Western democracies. Empirical research supports this notion by showing that people who feel personally or collectively deprived are more likely to hold populist beliefs and anti-immigration attitudes. Our aim was to further investigate the psychological link between individuals' justice concerns and their preferences for populist radical-right political agents. We focused on stable individual differences in self-oriented and other-oriented justice concerns and argue that these should have opposing correlations with preferences for populist radical-right parties. We tested our hypotheses in two national samples, one from the United States (N = 1500) and one from Germany (N = 848). Sensitivity to injustice towards oneself enhanced the likelihood of preferring Trump (United States) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) (Germany) via increased anti-immigration attitudes and increased populist attitudes. Sensitivity to injustice towards others reduced the likelihood of preferring Trump and AfD via decreased anti-immigration attitudes. We discuss our findings in regard to how stable individual differences in the evaluation of fairness can motivate intra- and interpersonal political conflicts in modern western societies and how politics and mass media can fuel these conflicts. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Stigma associated with gambling disorder is complex, and is a key obstacle that prevents sufferers from seeking early help for their condition. However, little research has addressed how best to reduce gambling stigma. This study explored the effectiveness of video intervention styles, that have been used to reduce public stigma for conditions such as mental illness and substance use disorders. This was done to determine which would be most suitable, considering the unique characteristics of gambling disorder. An online survey of 164 people living in Australia was conducted which examined attitudes toward gamblers experiencing problems before and after an intervention. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three interventions (contact, education, advocacy) or a control video. The study found that each intervention was associated with changes to different components of stigma. Importantly, the education intervention increased labelling, but reduced stereotype endorsement and anger. Advocacy also reduced anger, attributions of character flaws, and anticipated discrimination and recoverability. While these interventions were generally effective at reducing stigma, the contact intervention was mixed, effectively intervening for some aspects of stigma, but increasing stigma on others. No single intervention reduced all aspects of stigma, suggesting that a complementary approach utilising specific elements of each intervention style could be used to deliver relevant information and effectively reduce stigma. Taken together, this suggests that research should be conducted into comprehensive, combined interventions, that include aspects of all three intervention styles, in an attempt to reduce more aspects of stigma simultaneously. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Whereas overt forms of discrimination against women at work have decreased over time with the passage of formal antidiscrimination laws, implicit biases against women still plague organizations. To understand how implicit biases may appear in the workplace today, we examined how dissimilar outcomes may emerge for men and women leaders when their self-ratings differ from others’ (e.g., subordinates, peers) ratings. Drawing upon role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders and the status incongruity hypothesis, we theorized and found that women who overrated their leadership behaviors received lower performance ratings and higher perceived risk of derailment scores from their supervisors than did women who underrated their leadership behaviors. Men, however, experienced fewer negative consequences (than women) when they overrated. Given these findings, especially in light of discovering that most self–other agreement (SOA) research does not explicitly address gender as a main variable of interest, we question some of the field’s previous findings. We discuss the implications of our results for both practice and research regarding how SOA plays a role in the development of one’s career, highlighting the potential importance of implicit gender biases. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are often subject to prejudice and negative attitudes within mainstream society. Personal contact has been found to be one of the most important factors in improving negative attitudes. Governmental policy changes in the UK in the 1990s facilitated the inclusion of children with IDs into mainstream education. The current study aimed to investigate whether the contact that students had with peers with IDs, through the inclusion of students with IDs in mainstream schools, is related to attitudes toward people with IDs. Two hundred and fortyseven undergraduate students completed an online questionnaire which measured attitudes toward people with IDs, and both the quality and quantity of contact with people with IDs in varying contexts. Correlational and regression analyses show that more contact at school is significantly associated with positive attitudes toward people with IDs, when controlling for contact in other contexts. Findings suggest that those who had a more, or higher, quality of contact were significantly more likely to have more positive attitudes in adulthood. These findings suggest that inclusion policies may help to encourage more positive attitudes toward people with IDs in the long term. Further research is necessary to replicate these findings, and to further these findings by investigating the specific experiences at school that may encourage more positive attitudes. © 2019 International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in concerns that labour market vulnerability and national economic performance might be interacting to foment more polarized opinions about immigration. This article uses European Social Survey and EU-SILC data from 23 countries to explore this potential relationship, examining attitudes about the economic impact of immigration. In doing so, it seeks to investigate how the link between labour market vulnerability and anti-immigrant sentiment may be shaped by both resource scarcity (in the economy as a whole) and job scarcity (on the labour market). Findings from the analysis are twofold. First, labour market vulnerability is indeed correlated with more negative beliefs about the economic contribution of immigrants, even controlling for related factors such as education and contract type. Second, this effect is moderated by GDP per capita (though not unemployment rates), with labour market insiders and outsiders holding more distinct attitudes in higher GDP countries; thus, although attitudes towards the economic contribution of immigrants are generally more negative in poorer countries, labour market vulnerability contributes to greater opinion polarization in stronger economies. It is therefore resource availability in the economy, rather than on the labour market, that appears to be crucial. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - School teachers have been shown to favor ethnic majority over minority students. However, it is unclear what psychological processes motivate ethnicity-based discrimination. Of the studies that have examined the psychological roots of teacher discrimination, most have focused on implicit or explicit prejudice. We propose an alternate predictor: dehumanization. Using a within-subject paradigm with a small-scale experiment (N = 29) and a larger scale replication (N = 161), we find that Hungarian preservice teachers consistently discriminate against Roma minority students by recommending that they be denied entry to higher track secondary schools, and preferentially placing them into lower track schools, relative to equally qualified ethnic majority Hungarian students, and that the severity of the ethnic tracking bias is predicted by dehumanization (but not prejudice). In fact, the relationship between dehumanization and discrimination holds (and may be significantly stronger) for teachers who express the lowest levels of prejudice towards the Roma. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective: Experiencing stigmatization regarding mental illness has harmful effects on recovery from serious mental illness (SMI). Stigma experiences can also lead to internalized stigma, the cognitive and emotional internalization of negative stereotypes, and application of those stereotypes to one's self. Internalized stigma may lead to additional harms, including decrements in self-esteem and self-efficacy. Therefore, this study examined the effects of stigmatization experiences on recovery-related outcomes through internalized stigma, self-esteem, and self-efficacy in a single comprehensive model. Methods: Adults with SMI (n = 516) completed standardized measures assessing the variables of interest during baseline assessments for 2 randomized controlled trials. In a secondary analysis of the trial data, separate serial mediation models were tested for recovery orientation, perceived quality of life, and social withdrawal as outcomes, with experiences of stigma as the predictor variable and internalized stigma, self-esteem, and self-efficacy as serial mediators in that order. Alternate order and parallel mediation models were also tested to evaluate directionality. Results: The serial mediation model was the best fit, although self-efficacy was not found to be a critical mediator. Experiences of stigma led to internalized stigma, which influenced self-esteem and recovery-related outcomes, consistent with the social-cognitive model of internalized stigma. Conclusion: This indicates that internalized stigma is an essential target for reducing the negative impact of stigmatization on recovery. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Teachers and educators represent meaningful relationships for children, and their attitudes can have a major influence on a child’s development. This research examined the role of background characteristics, contact experiences, and sexual prejudice in determining beliefs about children’s adjustment in same-sex parent families. The sample consisted of 323 Italian teachers and educators working in nursery schools, kindergartens, and primary schools. The Scale on Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families was used to assess adults’ beliefs about negative impacts on children raised in same-sex parent families. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the association between individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting and background information, political and religious orientation, contact experiences, sexual prejudice, and beliefs about same-sex couples’ parenting abilities. Sexual prejudice, religious involvement, and negative beliefs about two-father couples emerged as strong predictors of individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting, whereas political orientation and negative beliefs about two-mother couples predicted only the individual form of opposition. Empirical data are essential in understanding the level of prejudice and discrimination in schools in order to provide policies and programs designed to improve knowledge and competencies to deal with same-sex parent families and their children. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Different forms of discrimination, marginalisation and exclusion have been central concerns for social geography for over 50 years now. Some forms of prejudice are historically resistant, long-lasting and have featured in social geography for many decades (such as racism and sexism); others have emerged more recently within social geography debates as well as in the wider society and are less well understood. In this second progress report on social geography, I explore recent research about Islamophobia, transphobia and sizism that demonstrates that each of these forms of prejudice is worthy of further study and analysis in their own right by social geographers and scholars in related fields. I argue that it would be productive to investigate areas of connection and solidarity across and within these different prejudices and others in order to be able to resist multiple forms of discrimination, intolerance and hate. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Interfaith education appears to have a strong potential for prejudice reduction and for overcoming Islamophobia and antisemitism. Common in-group identity theory contends that awareness of interreligious similarities would reduce intergroup streotypes and anxiety. However, optimal distinctiveness theory assumes that pointing to similarities would actually pose an identity threat to learners, especially members of a minority. Jewish and Muslim Israeli adolescents who studied about similarities and inter religious influences between Islam and Judaism showed varied and contradictory reactions. Jewish students decreased prejudice while Muslim students slightly increased them. Findings are discussed in light of above theories, and point to educational implications. © 2020, © 2020 The Religious Education Association.

AB  - This article analyzes how anti-immigrant attitudes shift when individuals experience changes in their subjective and objective economic situations. To do this, we use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP, N ≈ 14,700) and apply fixed-effects multinomial logit panel regression models as a statistical framework. The social identity approach is applied as a theoretical perspective to explain how individual incidents can lead to group-based devaluations. Our findings show almost no effect of social mobility and shifts in the household income, while more disruptive events, such as becoming unemployed, significantly increase the probability of having stronger anti-immigrant attitudes. However, the largest shift in anti-immigrant attitudes is observed when fears of a worsening economic situation increase. © 2019, © 2019 European Sociological Association.

AB  - Political groups are often seen as polarized communities. Research suggests social capital predicts intergroup attitudes; those who perceive higher social capital tend to have more positive attitudes about racial outgroups. Do the positive associations between social capital and racial attitudes extend to attitudes about political outgroups? If so, could social capital help reduce political animosities? Lessons are found in the fields of community development and psychology. We conducted a survey (n = 338) of college students regarding their perceptions of social capital in their university community, as well as their political ideology and attitudes about liberals and conservatives. After controlling for personality and pre-political predispositions, regression analyses indicate asymmetrical effects. Among liberals, social capital positively predicts attitudes about the liberal ingroup and the conservative outgroup. Among conservatives, social capital has no significant effects on attitudes about either political group. Thus, liberals and conservatives respond differently to their beliefs about their communities, potentially impacting the effectiveness of interventions. © 2019 Community Development Society.

AB  - Background: Childhood obesity is associated with a multitude of co-morbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Childhood obesity can also affect a young person's social, emotional and mental health if they encounter negative prejudice and social marginalisation. Given the prevalence of overweight and obese children globally, it is imperative that effective interventions are developed. Children are receptive to information conveyed via digital means, therefore, the use of technology may play a crucial role in interventions to reduce childhood obesity. This systematic review aimed to review and critically appraise the literature published to date in relation to the effectiveness of technology-based interventions, employed as secondary prevention, in addressing childhood obesity. Methods: An electronic search strategy was undertaken in Medline and Embase, covering publications up to and including 12th July 2018. Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of technology-based interventions on weight-related outcomes in children, aged 8 to 18, published only in the English language, were included. Results: From an initial search total of 1012 studies, 11 met the inclusion criteria. They were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomised Controlled Trials and were analysed using a narrative approach. The findings of this review showed a limited potential of technology-based interventions, employed as secondary prevention, to address childhood obesity. Of the eleven studies reviewed, three (27%) showed a positive relationship between technology-based interventions and weight-related outcomes in overweight or obese children. Conclusions: This review suggests that technology-based interventions, primarily active video games, as well as internet or web-based interventions and mobile phone communications, may, with further research, have the potential to impact positively on weight-related outcomes. It is difficult to determine the degree of efficacy of these technology-based interventions, as only two databases were searched, selecting only English language articles. Moreover, the included studies demonstrated a lack of high-quality evidence. The lack and heterogeneity of studies with technology-based interventions is a further limitation. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Our analysis investigates how gender, age, and technology stereotypes relate to one another and how this relationship reinforces or questions stereotypes. Based on intersectionality, stereotyping, and sense-making literature, our study explores how older women perceive their own interest in and competence with technology and that of their peers. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with women between 65 and 75 years of age in Germany. Our findings indicate that their evaluations of others are age and gender stereotyped. When explaining their own interest in technology, they refer to their individual preferences, and for explaining their own competence of technology, they refer to social categories. Plus, assumptions of technology usage seem to be gendered. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the need for taking social categories into account when evaluating inclusiveness with new technologies. © Copyright © 2020 Gales and Hubner.

AB  - In America, Black men are often stereotyped as criminal. Previously-incarcerated Black men must contend with this negative group stereotype and with the knowledge that their incarceration status confirms this image to others. The present study is one of few to examine the psychological consequences of incarceration status among Black men. Drawing on our social-contextual theory of prejudice, we investigate the role of previous incarceration on Black men’s expectations about being stereotyped by educators, beliefs about the utility of education to better their circumstances, and motivation to seek education. Previously- (vs. never-) incarcerated Black men reported greater stereotype expectations, which mediated their utility beliefs and motivation. We discuss incarceration as a “prejudiced place” with lasting and disparate psychological and educational consequences. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Integration in one's social community may depend in part upon feeling safe and secure within one's physical community, or neighborhood. Moreover, high-quality neighborhoods may serve as a supportive resource, potentially “buffering” against the harmful influence of experiences such as discrimination or depression that could otherwise Erode adults' sense of belonging. This study examines longitudinal associations of perceived neighborhood quality, daily discrimination, and depression with social integration among midlife and older adults, and tests whether perceived neighborhood quality is of increased importance with age and/or in the contexts of discrimination and depression. Research Design and Methods: Multilevel random intercept models analyzed 6,016 observations of 3,102 individuals drawn from the 3 waves of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS, 1995-2014). Results: Perceived neighborhood quality was associated with greater social integration throughout adulthood, though its impact was slightly attenuated with age. Moreover, depression was harmful for social integration across the age range, yet its influence was significantly buffered by perceived neighborhood quality. Daily discrimination was not associated with social integration, net of covariates. Discussion and Implications: Findings underscore the importance of physical place and person-environment fit for social well-being throughout adulthood, and confirm the deleterious effects of depression for adults' social integration. Further, results highlight perceived neighborhood quality as a critical component for successful “aging in place,” particularly as a social resource adults may call upon in the context of depression. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common and severe disorder among low-income adolescent mothers in low-and middle-income countries where resources for treatment are limited. We wished to identify factors influencing health service utilization for adolescent perinatal depression, in Nigeria to inform new strategies of care delivery. Methods: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted among purposively selected low-income young mothers (with medical histories of adolescent perinatal depression), and separately with primary care clinicians treating this condition in Ibadan, Nigeria. Participants from this community-based study were from the database of respondents who participated in a previous randomized control trial (RCT) conducted between 2014 and 2016 in 28 primary health care facilities in the 11 Local government areas in Ibadan. Semi-structured interview guides, framed by themes of the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, was developed to obtain views of participants on the factors that promote or hinder help-seeking and engagement (see additional files 1 & 2). FGDs were conducted, and saturation of themes was achieved after discussions with six groups. Transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Results: A total of 42 participants, 17 mothers (who were adolescents at the time of the RCT), and 25 care providers participated in 6 FGDs. The availability of care for perinatal depression at the primary care level was an important enabling factor in healthcare utilization for the adolescents. Perceived health benefits of treatment received for perinatal depression were strong motivation for service use. Significant stigma and negative stereotypes expressed by care providers towards adolescent pregnancy and perinatal depression were obstacles to care. However, individual patient resilience was a major enabling factor, facilitating service engagement. Providers trained in the management of perinatal depression were perceived to deliver more tolerant and supportive care that adolescent mothers valued. Conclusions: Participants identified unsupportive and stigmatizing clinic environments towards pregnant and parenting adolescents as significant barriers to accessing available care. Interventions to reduce stigma among healthcare providers may improve services for this vulnerable population. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Heteronormativity is a culturally embedded system defining acceptable identities and behaviors in romantic relationships. Recent literature has suggested that heteronormativity is strongly associated with political attitudes, personality characteristics such as tolerance of ambiguity, and key demographic variables such as gender and sexual orientation. However, interactions between gender and other factors have not been thoroughly explored as predictors of heteronormative attitude and beliefs. The current study (N = 306) expands the understanding of predictors of heteronormativity, particularly as they interact with gender. In the current study, higher education was associated with lower heteronormativity among women, but not among men, and expressiveness was associated with lower heteronormativity among men, but not among women. Finally, a 3-way interaction showed that the relationship between education and heteronormativity for men (but not women) depended on trait expressiveness. Future studies are recommended, including observation of changes in heteronormativity over time and exploration of mechanisms that reinforce or reduce heteronormativity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Research evaluation based on citation data identifies excellence using quantity and quality proxies as the main orthogonal dimensions. Citation data are readily available from aggregators such as the Web of Science or Scopus in the form of number of papers P, number of citations C and h-index. However, most of the prestigious award-giving bodies, e.g. for the Nobel Prizes or for the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) Prize in India, rely on rigorous peer evaluation rather than on citationbased performance. While peer-review judgements are holistic but also subjective, citation-based evaluations tend to be reductive and quantitative. In this study, we look at three of the most prestigious premier peer-review decision-making exercises in India, the SSB Prize, and election Fellowship of the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru. By comparing the awardees and successfully elected Fellows against a list of outstanding citation-based top performers in the world, we report a marked field dependence with citation data predicting 0% to less than 40% of the peer-review selections depending on the field. This study highlights two mixed dangers: one of compressing performance to numbers in an essentially reductive process, and the other of the possible bias and prejudices involved in what is often a subjective peer-review process. Thus, type I and type II errors cannot be avoided in any peer-review or citation evaluation taken in isolation, and vary from as much as 100% to 63%, depending on the field. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background: Previous studies showed that anger, rather than sadness, created automatic intergroup bias in a minimal group context. Methods: The current research reports a single study (N = 99) aiming to replicate this finding and further to test whether the intergroup bias manifests as ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation, or both. Results: Our results failed to replicate the effect of anger on automatic bias. Intriguingly, participants across all emotion conditions exhibited high level of ingroup favoritism, but there was little evidence of outgroup derogation. Conclusion: These results suggest that, when there is no competition or conflict between groups, individuals, even in a bad emotional state such as anger, generally show ingroup love rather than outgroup hate. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: After the closing of four of the five historically Black college and university (HBCU)–based library and information science (LIS) graduate programs (leaving only that of North Carolina Central University), there is a need to revitalize HBCU-LIS degree program pathways to increase racial diversity in LIS education. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed-methods study entails survey and interview research with HBCU librarians. The researchers explored participants’ professional experiences and perspectives on creating partnerships between HBCU institutions and LIS graduate programs. Findings: Participants demonstrated substantial experience, expressed high levels of job satisfaction, viewed pipeline programs favorably and believed that LIS can be strengthened through the inclusion of HBCU educational practices and students. Practical implications: This study provides recommendations and a model for forging culturally competent and reciprocal HBCU–LIS degree program partnerships. Social implications: Community-led knowledge of HBCUs can disrupt rescue and deficiency narratives of these institutions. Such prejudices are detrimental to HBCU-LIS degree program partnerships. Originality/value: Past HBCU-LIS degree program pipeline partnerships did not culminate in research or published best practices. This paper presents literature-derived and community-sourced guidelines along with a model for future initiatives. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - France receives a relatively large number of international adoptions. However, little is known about the frequency and types of microaggressions experienced by adoptive parents and internationally adopted adolescents in France. Unusually, France functions legally as a colorblind society, where race is not officially recognized. Therefore, we surveyed adoptive parents and adopted adolescents regarding their feelings of difference and experience of prejudice–related to both adoptive status and country of origin. Some respondents reported that special needs represented an additional area of stigma. Family belonging, adoption identity, and adoption visibility all impacted the experience of microaggressions by French internationally adopted adolescents and their parents. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present study sought to examine the role of sexual identity and exposure to stereotypes of feminism on women’s self-identification as a feminist, endorsement of feminist attitudes, and intention to engage in collective action. Participants (N = 312; all women) disclosed their sexual identity as either heterosexual or non-heterosexual (sexual minority) and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: exposure to positive stereotypes of feminists, to negative stereotypes of feminists, control condition (no exposure to stereotypes). Results showed stark differences between heterosexual and sexual minority women, with sexual minority women scoring significantly higher on self-identification as feminist, feminist attitudes, and collective action intentions. Exposure to positive stereotypes of feminists increased feminist self-identification regardless of sexual identity. Exposure to negative stereotypes reduced self-identification with feminism, and lower identification mediated the path between negative stereotyping and collective action. Implications of these findings for the advancement of women’s rights movements are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Although social media have become important venues for right-wing populist (RWP) campaigns, the content, selection, and effects of RWP messages on social media remain largely unknown. Using content and panel analysis in two studies, we investigated the potential reciprocal relationship between RWP communication on social media and citizens’ anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-elitist attitudes, and feelings of anger and anxiety. In Study 1, we analyzed 13,358 Facebook posts from German and Austrian political parties and their leading candidates. Among our results, RWP actors conveyed anti-immigrant and anti-elitist messages more often than non-RWP actors, and anti-immigrant messages especially induced negative emotional responses among followers of RWP actors. In Study 2, our analysis of data from a two-wave panel study with 559 respondents revealed that anti-immigrant attitudes drove selective exposure to RWP content on Facebook, which consequently fueled anti-immigrant attitudes, and that selective exposure to such content increased individuals’ anti-elitist attitudes and anxiety. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Negative emotions affect the acceptance of out-groups. Here, we investigated whether modifying negative emotions would affect perceptions of out-groups. We experimentally manipulated the use of two emotion regulation strategies: suppression of emotional expression and cognitive reappraisal, the latter involving reframing a situation to mitigate its emotional impact. Using a population-based sample (N = 317), we conducted an online randomized controlled trial. Participants regulated their emotions while reading threatening news about out-groups. Not only reappraisal, but also suppression increased immediate acceptance of out-groups. The effect of reappraisal was partly mediated by decreased disgust, suggesting unique effects of reappraisal on this emotion. In the suppression condition acceptance decreased at high levels of habitual emotion regulation, whereas reappraisal showed an opposite tendency. Previous research may have underestimated the importance of different emotion regulation strategies on prejudice, and that relatively simple interventions can affect prejudice. The findings are of interest to prejudice prevention programs. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Although overall women are better represented in higher education than men, women’s psychological experience in various academic contexts is qualified by a decreased sense of belonging and academic self-efficacy, including in fields where they are not targeted by a negative stereotype. To clarify this phenomenon, we develop the hypothesis of a mismatch between female students’ values and the values associated with success in the increasingly selective realm of higher education. We argue that, whatever the fields of study, these values are self-enhancement values (competitiveness, self-affirmation, dominance). Three studies showed that when success was depicted in terms of self-enhancement values, women–but not men–expressed a lower sense of belonging, had lower self-efficacy and were less likely to pursue a given academic opportunity both in STEM and non-STEM fields of study. These effects did not appear in an academic context depicting success as being rooted in self-transcendence values (helpfulness, cooperation, benevolence). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - People with mental illness face stigma, and due to their low social status, they may also face blatant dehumanization that denies their status as fully evolved human beings. In the current research, three studies documented the existence of blatant dehumanization of mental illness. Study 1 (N = 112) showed that participants rated people with mental illness in general as being significantly less human than other dehumanized social groups such as Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Study 2 (N = 158) showed that dehumanization occurs for specific mental disorders but that the level of dehumanization varies widely among disorders. Study 3 (N = 223) documented significant correlations between dehumanization of mental illness and standard measures of stigma such as fear, pity, and social distance. Overall, the results establish the relevance of blatant dehumanization to mental illness stigma and suggest new directions for understanding stigma. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study focuses on the role of social identity and prejudice as causal variables in public attitudes toward pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a UK sample. In all, 222 participants participated in an experimental vignette study with a 2 × 2 × 2 design with between-participants factors of ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender, and completed measures of attitudes toward gay men, Black Africans, and PrEP. Kruskal–Wallis tests showed significant effects of gender on attitudes toward gay men and Black Africans; of ethnicity on attitudes toward gay men and PrEP; and of religion on attitudes toward gay men. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed more positive attitudes toward PrEP when it was presented as benefitting men (vs. women). Structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between the independent variables of gender, ethnicity, and religion and the dependent variable of attitudes toward PrEP was mediated by attitudes toward gay men and Black Africans. Individuals must perceive the principal beneficiaries of PrEP (i.e., gay men and Black Africans) positively to endorse PrEP for these groups, and sexism may reduce public acceptability of PrEP for women. Future research should use representative samples and alternative experimental manipulations, and include strength of social identification as an independent variable. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In general terms, the study of Ancient Near East History is questioned under the pretext that it does not respond to ‘national’ interests, that is, such knowledge is futile, absurd or u nnecessary because it is far from Latin American history as well as – andmore specifically – of the reality and the needs of the present. However, Ancient Near East History can become an extremely fertile and operational field to study and research if we avoid its delimitation based on certain historiographic and anthropological prejudices that are still present in academic media. In this paper, we proposesome considerations about the relevance of the study of Ancient Near East History as a kind of ‘laboratory’ from which it is possible to think a whole set of sociocultural characteristics different from our contemporaneity modes of social experience and to recognize the diversity of ways in which human experience can materialize throughout history. © 2020, Revista Brasileira de História.

AB  - This article discusses scholars who have been advocating the concepts of race and racism to explain cultural prejudices in ancient Greece and Rome. More precisely, this study debates the arguments for the case of an ancient racist or proto-racist Greece elaborated on by Benjamin Isaac (2004) in The Invention of Racism in Antiquity and Susan Lape (2010) in Race and Citizen Identity in the Classical Athenian Democracy. Thus, for this historiographical perspective, there is much more continuity between ancient and modern racism than we had assumed. This article highlights certain conceptual and argumentative flaws in this approach, maintaining that ethnic relations in ancient Greece are better explained as non-hereditary forms of cultural prejudice rather than as racism, which has a specific history related to European colonization and slave trade. © 2020, Revista Brasileira de Historia.

AB  - In 2019, about 4 million Venezuelans have left the country looking for a better landscape for them and their families. Thousands, even entire families, have arrived in Mexico, trying to regularize their situation and to stay permanently in the country. The purpose of this work is to analyze how the media portrays the Venezuelan migration in Mexico, and in what way this coverage influences people's judgements about migration. Particularly to understand what kinds of arguments are used to justify hostility and xenophobic opinions. Data collection focuses on a textual analysis of online news generated by Mexican and international media. Final outcomes will show how the media serves to preserve a particular coverage based on traditional prejudiced stereotypes that serve to set a hostile ambient towards migrants and to justify violations to their human rights. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed to identify small geographic areas where the childhood cancer yearly incidence and late-stage diagnosis rates were disproportionately higher among racial/ethnic minorities (Hispanics and non-Hispanic African Americans) in Texas. Methods The study examined childhood cancer disparities in Texas from 2005 to 2014, based on geographic location and race/ethnicity. Relative (risk ratio) and absolute (risk difference) measures were used to investigate racial disparities of childhood cancer late-stage diagnosis in small geographic areas (census tracts). The study investigated childhood cancer yearly incidence- and late-stage diagnosis rates for three racial groups combined. The study also analyzed the temporal change of childhood cancer late-stage diagnosis rates based on the data from census tracts where disparities existed for Hispanics and non-Hispanic African Americans compared with a non-Hispanic white reference group. Results A total of 54% of the cases in the study cohort were diagnosed in the late stage. Although there were fewer non-Hispanic African Americans cases compared with non-Hispanic white and Hispanic cases, they showed significant geographic variation in racial/ethnic disparities compared with the non-Hispanic white reference group. The study also revealed that 58 census tracts for non-Hispanic African Americans and 47 census tracts for Hispanics (of 5265) had significantly higher late-stage diagnosis rates compared with non-Hispanic whites. The findings also demonstrated consistent increases in incidence and late-stage diagnosis from 2005 to 2014 for all cases combined. Conclusions Most of the significant census tracts with a higher late-stage diagnosis rate for Hispanics were located on the outskirts of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio areas. In contrast, geographic disparities of childhood cancer late-stage diagnosis for non-Hispanic African Americans were found inside the large metropolitan areas of Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. The findings of this study will help prioritize the geographical allocation of resources, which, in turn, will help to facilitate preventive healthcare services and alleviate the disease burden in children. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Professional practice amongst health professionals is at its peak when conducted free of bias and founded in accurate, up-to-date knowledge. If tarnished by judgmental attitudes or inadequate or inaccurate knowledge, individuals receiving health care or education may be disadvantaged or, worse, stigmatized. This study sought to detect if pre-service health professionals possess weight bias and quantify the degree of bias if present. It also sought to measure the level of nutrition knowledge that pre-service health professionals possess and compare these attitudes and knowledge to professionals whose roles are not incumbent on providing health education or counselling. Participants (n=174) were enrolled in an undergraduate nutrition elective and completed a survey containing the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire, Crandall's Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire, and the Fat Stereotyping Questionnaire. Students in nonhealth-related degrees (n=92) displayed higher levels of nutrition knowledge than those in health-related streams (n=82). Weight bias was detected amongst both groups and was stronger in students enrolled in health degrees. Fat stereotyping was detected at a medium level and, although insignificant, was higher amongst pre-service health professionals. Results of this study support the call for attitudes and knowledge to be addressed during the formal period of higher education, with the aim of reducing weight bias and improving nutrition knowledge before pre-service professionals graduate and enter the workforce. © 2020 Assoc. of Schools Advancing Health Professions, Wash., DC.

AB  - Introduction: Efficacious antiretroviral treatment (ART) enables people to live long and healthy lives with HIV but young people are dying from AIDS-related causes more than ever before. Qualitative evidence suggest that various forms of HIV-related discrimination and resulting shame act as profound barriers to young people’s engagement with HIV services. However, the impact of these risks on adolescent retention in HIV care has not been quantified. This study has two aims: (1) to examine whether and how different types of discrimination compromise retention in care among adolescents living with HIV in South Africa; and (2) to test whether internalized stigma mediates these relationships. Methods: Between 2014 and 2017, adolescents living with HIV (aged 10 to 19) from 53 health facilities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, were interviewed at baseline (n = 1059) and 18-month follow-up (n = 979, 92.4%), with responses linked to medical records. Data were analysed through multiple regression and mediation models. Results: About 37.9% of adolescents reported full retention in care over the 2-year period, which was associated with reduced odds of viral failure (OR: 0.371; 95% CI:.224,.614). At baseline, 6.9% of adolescents reported discrimination due to their HIV status; 14.9% reported discrimination due to HIV in their families and 19.1% reported discrimination in healthcare settings. Healthcare discrimination was associated with reduced retention in care both directly (effect: −0.120; CI: −0.190, −0.049) and indirectly through heightened internalized stigma (effect: 0.329; 95% CI: 0.129, 0.531). Discrimination due to family HIV was associated with reduced retention in care both directly (effect: −0.074, CI: −0.146, −0.002) and indirectly through heightened internalized stigma (effect: 0.816, CI: 0.494, 1.140). Discrimination due to adolescent HIV was associated with reduced retention in care only indirectly, through increased internalized stigma (effect: 0.408; CI: 0.102, 0.715). Conclusions: Less than half of adolescents reported 2-year retention in HIV care. Multiple forms of discrimination and the resultant internalized stigma contributed to this problem. More intervention research is urgently needed to design and test adolescent-centred interventions so that young people living with HIV can live long and healthy lives in the era of efficacious anti-retroviral treatment. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - A growing body of literature acknowledges the association between negative stereotypes and individual components of active aging, but very few studies have tested this association, at both individual and population levels. The Stereotypes Content Model (SCM) states that the cultural aging stereotyping of higher warmth than competence (called paternalistic or ambivalent prejudice) is universal. Our aims in this study are to test the extent to which the universality of this stereotype is confirmed in European Countries as well as how far "positive", "negative" or "ambivalent" views towards older people, and other negative attitudes such as prejudice and behaviours such as discrimination, predict active aging assessed both at individual and population levels. We have analyzed data from the European Social Survey-2008 (ESS-2008), containing SCM stereotypical and other appraisal items (such as direct prejudice and perceived discrimination) about adults aged over-70 from 29 European countries. First, SCM cultural stereotypes about older adults (“friendly”, “competent”, and “ambivalent”) were calculated; secondly, after developing a typology of countries based on their “negative”, “ambivalent” and “positive” views about older adults, the universality of cultural stereotypes was tested; thirdly, taking into consideration ESS data of those older persons (over 70s) who self-reported indicators of active aging (health, happiness, satisfaction and social participation), multilevel analyses were performed, taking our inter-individual measure of active aging as dependent variable and our stereotypical classification (positive/ negative/ambivalent), direct prejudice and perceived discrimination as predictors; finally, relationships between stereotypical and appraisal items on older adults were examined at population level with country data from Active Aging Indexes. Our results show cultural stereotypes about older people (more friendly than competent) are widespread in most European countries, and negative cultural views of older adults are negatively associated with active aging both at individual and population level, supporting that negative cultural views of older adults could be considered as a threat to active aging. © 2020 Fernández-Ballesteros et al.

AB  - This study analyzes five political cartoons published in the Taiwan Nichinichi Shinpo (Taiwan Daily Newspaper) depicting the Musha Uprising, an indigenous rebellion against Japanese colonial rule that occurred in Taiwan in 1930. The study has produced two important findings and theoretical implications. First, two of the political cartoons deployed The Great Chain of Being multimodal metaphor, and the artist's conceptual blending of Japanese kabuki stories with the Musha Uprising dramatically portrayed the colonizers as humans and the colonized as animals. We analyze the social and historical context to explain why these cartoons used the boar as a metaphor representing the indigenous people. Second, our results reveal paradoxical and ambivalent perspectives in the cartoons. On one hand, the metaphor of Human vs. Animal reproduced the unequal hierarchical relations between the colonizers and the colonized. On the other hand, the cartoonist also portrayed the rulers in a critical and satirical way. Finally, the research relates the content of this analysis with the post-colonial theorizing of Edward Said. In sum, the study makes a contribution to interdisciplinary research by applying metaphor theory to the analysis of political cartoons and colonial discourse, as well as revealing the hierarchical colonial thinking and racial prejudice lurking behind the metaphors. © 2020 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Race and caste are two important historical and social categories that had a significant role during the European colonial period and in the colonies. Christian missionary activities during the colonial period often colluded with the colonial institutions in perpetuating certain accepted worldviews that benefited the colonial authorities. The central argument of this paper is to highlight the impact of a racialized worldview that was prevalent among European colonial powers, its transmission to the colonial context, and its continuing social legacy within Christianity. This paper, through a post-colonial analysis of British mission history and its work in a South Asian context, raises some pertinent questions regarding the tacit role of race and caste in the Christianizing mission. It also argues the need for careful post-colonial analysis of mission practices to challenge reactivation of entrenched structures of discrimination and prejudice. © 2020 World Council of Churches

AB  - Introduction: Oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive disease caused by complete absence of or decrease in melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes. Due to the reduction or absence of melanin, albinos are highly susceptible to the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation and are at greater risk of actinic damage and skin cancer. There are no epidemiological data on the incidence of albinism in Brazil. Objective: To analyze the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients with albinism treated by the Pró-Albino Program of the Dermatology Clinic of Santa Casa de Misericórdia from its beginning in 2010 until 2017. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the records of all consecutive albino patients admitted to the service in the study period were reviewed. Sociodemographic data, family history, and dermatological clinical data were collected. Results: Between March 2010 and April 2017, 191 patients were admitted, of whom 109 were female (57.07%) and the age range was 0-92 years, with >30% under the age of 18 years. Consanguinity among the parents was confirmed by 26% of the patients. Unprotected sun exposure was reported by 109 (57.07%), and 138 (72.25%) had a history of sunburn. Of the 146 records with information, 38 had skin cancer (26%), with a mean age of 47.4 (p < 0.0001); the youngest patient diagnosed with a cutaneous tumor was 23 years old. The prevalence of actinic damage was high. There was information on solar elastosis and actinic keratosis in 148 medical records, of which 96 (64.8%) patients had elastosis and 75 (50.67%) keratoses. Elastosis, keratosis, and skin cancer were significantly associated with age, unprotected sun exposure, and sunburn (p < 0.05). Of the 37 (26% of the sample of 146) patients with a previous or current history of skin cancer, it was possible to identify the histological type in 29 (13 men and 16 women); of these, 18 (62%) were basal cell carcinomas (BCC), 15 (51%) were squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 2 (7%) were melanomas. Of these, 4 cases (14%) presented the 2 types of carcinoma (BCC and SCC), and the 2 that had a diagnosis of melanoma also had BCC. Some patients had multiple ulcerated tumors. The tumor site was preferentially in the head and neck (43%), trunk (37%) and limbs (20%). Conclusions: Albinos represent a risk group for skin cancer and other actinic lesions. These lesions were found to be prevalent in the albinos seen by the program and probably reflect the characteristics found in the Brazilian albino population. Access to health care, especially through multidisciplinary programs that enable the diagnosis and early treatment of these lesions, health education, and the use of photoprotective measures can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life of patients with this rare genetic condition. © 2019 hS.

AB  - This paper reports on a qualitative study, which embraced the interpretative paradigm. The study explored Pre–Service Technology Teachers’ (PSTTs) experiences of Project–based learning (PBL) as pedagogy while learning about Education for Sustainable development (ESD) at a university in South Africa. The paper advances the rationale that adopting a pedagogy that contextualised PBL has allowed for transformation in the perception and behaviour of PSTTs about sustainability issues, critical citizenship as well as their role as future teachers. Furthermore, it improved the capacity of people to address environmental and developmental issues. Mezirow, theory on transformative learning guided the study theoretically. Fifty-four PSTTs, who were enrolled for the processing module in technology education in 2016, were purposively selected to participate in the study. Participants were assured of confidentiality and anonymity. Data was generated in three stages. This paper reports on stage two and three of data generation, which required PSTTs to participate in focus group interviews and maintain a reflective diary of their experiences of PBL and ESD. Data was subjected to thematic analysis. The findings revealed that PBL increased application of content to solve sustainability problems. Furthermore, the findings bring to the fore new dimensions to the learning that PSTTs experienced when they engaged in PBL, such as overcoming prejudices, team work, awareness of their social responsibilities to the community and the development of skills for sustainability change agents. These finding have implication for pedagogy used to infuse ESD within the curriculum and overcome social cultural stereotypes. Copyright © 2020 by authors, all rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study is to identify enablers and barriers in access of HIV and sexual reproductive health (SRH) services among adolescent key populations (KP) in Kenya. Methods: A cross-sectional study using qualitative methods was conducted between October 2015 and April 2016. A total of 9 focus group discussions and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with 108 adolescent KPs in Mombasa, Kisumu and Nairobi Counties of Kenya. Data were recorded digitally, translated, transcribed and coded in NVivo10 prior to analysis. Results: Adolescent KPs preferred to access services in private health due to increased confidentiality, limited stigma and discrimination, access to adequate amount of condoms, friendly and fast-tracked services. Negative health provider attitudes made adolescent KPs dislike accessing health care in public health facilities. There was a lack of adolescent key population’s policies and guidelines on HIV and SRH. Conclusions: The study has demonstrated existing enablers and barriers to provision of HIV/SRH services for an at-risk population for which limited data exist. The results provide a basis for program redesign involving the adolescent KPs to minimize barriers for access to HIV/SRH services. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose/Objective: Health care providers' attitudes of marginalized groups can be key factors that contribute to health care access and outcome disparities because of their influence on patient encounters as well as clinical decision-making. Despite a growing body of knowledge linking disparate health outcomes to providers' clinical decision making, less research has focused on providers' attitudes about disability. The aim of this study was to examine providers' explicit and implicit disability attitudes, interactions between their attitudes, and correlates of explicit and implicit bias. Research Method/ Design: We analyzed secondary data from 25,006 health care providers about their disability attitudes. In addition to analyzing people's explicit and implicit attitudes (Disability Attitudes Implicit Association Test), we used Son Hing, Chung-Yan, Hamilton, & Zanna's (2008) model of two-dimensional prejudice to compare provider's explicit and implicit attitudes. Finally, we used linear regression models to examine correlates of providers' explicit and implicit attitudes. Results: While on average, provider's explicit attitudes (M = 4.41) indicated little prejudice, their implicit attitudes (M = 0.54) revealed they moderately preferred nondisabled people-they were aversive ableists. Correlates of providers' explicit and implicit attitudes also included age, gender, political orientation, and having relationships with disability (friends, family, and being a person with disability). Conclusions/Implications: This study revealed that despite a majority of providers self-reporting not being biased against people with disabilities, implicitly, the overwhelming majority were biased. This study's findings can be used to better understand how provider disability bias can contribute to inequitable health care access and health outcomes for people with disabilities. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to quantify the association between perceived everyday discrimination and binge eating among Latinas in the United States. Methods: Participants included 1014 Latinas from the 2002–2003 National Latino and Asian American Study. Modified Poisson models with robust standard errors were used to estimate sociodemographic-adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of binge eating associated with overall and attribution-specific discrimination. Results: Approximately 7% of Latinas reported binge eating. Increased frequency of discrimination was associated with a higher prevalence of binge eating (aPR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23–2.06), and Latinas reporting frequencies of discrimination in the top tertile had the greatest prevalence elevation (aPR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.32–10.00). There were important differences by discrimination attribution: Latinas experiencing primarily height/weight-based or skin color–based discrimination had the greatest prevalence elevation relative to those reporting no discrimination (aPR, 10.24; 95% CI, 2.95–35.51; and aPR, 8.83; 95% CI, 2.08–37.54, respectively), whereas Latinas reporting primarily race-based discrimination had the lowest prevalence elevation (aPR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.47–5.69). Conclusions: Discrimination may be an important social determinant of Latinas’ binge eating. Future research should incorporate expanded conceptual models that account for Latinas' complex social environment, focusing on intersecting dimensions of identity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Intergroup toleration is a requirement for living with diversity and actively promoted by local, national, and international bodies. However, although psychological researchers have extensively considered the implications of being discriminated, little is known about the psychological consequences of being tolerated. In this article, we argue that beyond the freedoms implied by tolerance, being “merely” tolerated also implies social identity threats that compromise specific psychological needs (belongingness, esteem, control, certainty). We further consider the psychological consequences of being tolerated at the personal, interpersonal, and intergroup levels and consider factors that may moderate the impact of being tolerated for minority outcomes. Taken together, this work provides the first theoretical argument and overview of what it means to be tolerated by considering the negative implications of toleration in diverse nations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Recent increases in intergroup tensions and violence have global negative implications and underline the need for effective interventions to ameliorate conflictual relations. Despite the ongoing trend in social psychology toward an interventionist approach, there is still a theoretical and empirical gap in personalizing intergroup interventions to achieve optimal effectiveness. Integrating interventions aimed at prejudice reduction and promoting peace, we present a theoretical framework for personalizing these intergroup interventions. We propose a three-layer model: personalization parameters, intergroup interventions, and mechanisms that link parameter and intervention. To illustrate the model, three sample parameters are described (ideology, dominant emotional sentiments, and Big Five personality types) and three corresponding mechanisms (level of intervention congruency; the degree to which an intervention addresses core appraisal theme; and a needs-based mechanism). We demonstrate how the parameters and mechanisms map onto different established intergroup interventions, and suggest some empirical directions to test and later apply the theoretical framework. Finally, we discuss the potential of personalized interventions to substantially improve intergroup relations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Obesity is a complex medical condition, influenced by several factors. Weight bias refers to pervasive negative weight-related attitudes or beliefs, expressed as stereotypes, prejudice, and even open discrimination toward individuals because they have obesity. Obesity increases the risk of acquiring a wide range of associated diseases, as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. This chronic disease can also impair a person’s well-being and quality of life. Nevertheless, the media, public, and even healthcare providers, including doctors, focus overwhelmingly on the contribution of individual choices and responsibility. The widely held assumptions are that individuals with obesity do not have self-control, don’t “eat wisely,” or do not want to be healthier. These assumptions are inherently linked to stereotypes and are likely to exacerbate stigmatizing attitudes towards people with obesity. Even with the growing incidence and prevalence of obesity worldwide, weight stigmatization did not recede. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Why do some women enjoy and internalize sexist jokes, whereas others express sharp disapproval? To answer this question, we explored the role of cavalier humor beliefs (jokes are fun and harmless, or “just jokes”), in addition to known predictors such as social dominance orientation and hostile sexism. In Experiment 1, women (N = 225) reported their amusement and offensiveness in response to three types of jokes: aggressive sexist jokes, belittling sexist jokes, and neutral jokes. Cavalier humor beliefs predicted higher amusement and lower offensiveness ratings for all jokes (including neutral), but more strongly predicted lower offensiveness ratings for the aggressive and belittling sexist jokes, suggesting that these beliefs might be highjacked by those who mask prejudiced intentions. In contrast, social dominance orientation and hostile sexism were each associated with favorable reactions to sexist but not neutral jokes. In Experiment 2, we explored the role of cavalier humor beliefs (and hostile sexism) in women's (N = 226) acceptance of sexist jokes, and subsequent release of bias against women following sexist joke exposure. Overall, exposure to aggressive (vs. neutral) jokes led women to rate the jokes as unfunny and offensive, but these objections were dampened among women higher in cavalier humor beliefs, even after controlling for hostile sexism. Critically, among women higher in cavalier humor beliefs, aggressive joke exposure facilitated acceptance of discrimination against women, even when accounting for hostile sexism. Thus, cavalier humor beliefs perpetuate sexism among women, whose ingroup is targeted by sexist humor. Implications for Prejudiced Norm Theory are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - While climate change has become a salient political and social issue in Western societies, we know relatively little about how these societies will react to one of the potentially important consequences of climate change: increasing migration flows. By means of a representative online survey in Germany, this paper therefore investigates for the very first time to what extent citizens in industrialized societies are willing to accept climate change migrants, especially in comparison with other groups of migrants and refugees, and the circumstances and principles under which they would accept them. The findings show that climate change migrants receive high support levels comparable with those enjoyed by political refugees (migrants who need special protection) and that contrast with attitudes towards economic migrants (who are often not seen as in need of special protection). We also see that people are more likely to accept justifications for taking climate change migrants when they realize that the expected number of migrants is relatively low. While arguments about morality, corrective justice, and a country’s capacity lead to similar acceptance rates in general, the latter argument plays a more important role for highly educated people and non-environmentalists than the former two. The findings of this study allow us to better prepare for potential conflicts that might emerge with increasing migration flows caused by climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Interethnic prejudice in children has been studied mostly in the United States, but less often in Europe, where the public discourse is increasingly negative about ethnic minorities, especially the Muslim minority. This study examined in-group favoritism (White preference) and out-group rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent (representing the Muslim minority) among White children in the Netherlands. Social preference for and rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent are compared with preference for and rejection of Black children. Social preference and rejection were measured using a task in which participants were presented with pictures of children with different ethnic appearances, and asked to select who they wanted to (not) play with, (not) sit next to, and invite for their birthday party. In addition, maternal implicit prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent and explicit attitudes toward their children’s interethnic contact were assessed. The study included 140 children aged 6 to 8 years (M = 7.26, SD = 0.77) and their mothers. The results reveal both in-group favoritism and out-group rejection. The Middle Eastern out-group was preferred less than the Black out-group. Reporting absolutely no reservations about children’s interethnic contact by mothers was associated with less rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent. Findings reveal that young children already show interethnic prejudice and that particularly people of Middle Eastern descent are devalued. The results show that maternal acceptance of child interethnic contact seems to play a role, and provide starting points for further investigation of the relation between parental and child interethnic attitudes. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Introduction: Weight stigmatization is reflected in anti-fat attitudes and stereotypical perceptions of people who are overweight; it has been demonstrated to be prevalent in many segments of society across multiple countries. Studies examining the prevalence of weight stigmatization use different research tools, which can hinder inter-study comparisons. There is also evidence indicating weight stigmatization among registered physical therapists, although its magnitude differs between studies. Limited information exists regarding the attitudes and beliefs of physical therapy (PT) students toward individuals with obesity. Examining weight stigmatization among PT students is particularly important for developing appropriate educational interventions that may influence the professional lives of future physical therapists. Objective: This study aims to characterize and compare the stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs of PT students and certified physical therapists regarding people with obesity in Israel. Its secondary objective is to translate three weight stigmatization questionnaires into Hebrew and determine their psychometric properties. Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymous, and computerized self-report survey was completed by 285 certified physical therapists (average age 39.6 ± 10.1 years) and 115 PT students (average age 26.4 ± 4.9 years). The study used three validated weight stigma questionnaires employed in earlier studies to determine different aspects of weight stigmatization: the Fat Phobia Scale (short form; FPS), Anti-Fat Attitudes (AFA) questionnaire, and Beliefs about Obese People (BAOP). These questionnaires were translated into Hebrew and their psychometric properties ascertained. Results: Similar to the original English versions, the translated versions of the three questionnaires demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α values of FPS = 0.77; AFA = 0.75; BOAP = 0.59). The three questionnaires showed a low correlation. No significant difference was noted in the FPS and AFA scores between groups, reflecting that both demonstrated average weight stigmatization (FBS in both groups: average score of 3.6 out of 5; AFA therapists: 3.3 ± 1.2, students: 3.0 ± 1.2 out of 9). However, significant between-group differences were observed for BOAP, which examines beliefs regarding individuals' control over their weight (therapists: 16.4 ± 5.6, students: 18.0 ± 5.7 out of 48; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Student and certified physical therapists demonstrate average levels of weight stigmatization, as reflected in the FPS and AFA scores. Nevertheless, compared to certified physical therapists, physical therapist students believe more strongly that obesity cannot be controlled by the individual. The students' beliefs could affect their clinical judgment and behavior as health care professionals in the future. Therefore, anti-fat attitudes and stereotypical perceptions should be addressed and remediated early using educational interventions during the study period. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

AB  - Prejudice researchers have proposed a number of methods to reduce prejudice, drawing on and, in turn, contributing to our theoretical understanding of prejudice. Despite this progress, relatively few of these methods have been shown to reliably improve intergroup relations in real-world settings, resulting in a gap between our theoretical understanding of prejudice and real-world applications of prejudice-reduction methods. In this article, we suggest that incorporating principles from another field, social marketing, into prejudice research can help address this gap. Specifically, we describe three social-marketing principles and discuss how each could be used by prejudice researchers. Several areas for future research inspired by these principles are discussed. We suggest that a hybrid approach to research that uses both theory-based and problem-based principles can provide additional tools for field practitioners aiming to improve intergroup relations while leading to new advances in social-psychological theory. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems are widely employed nowadays to make decisions that have far-reaching impact on individuals and society. Their decisions might affect everyone, everywhere, and anytime, entailing concerns about potential human rights issues. Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond traditional AI algorithms optimized for predictive performance and embed ethical and legal principles in their design, training, and deployment to ensure social good while still benefiting from the huge potential of the AI technology. The goal of this survey is to provide a broad multidisciplinary overview of the area of bias in AI systems, focusing on technical challenges and solutions as well as to suggest new research directions towards approaches well-grounded in a legal frame. In this survey, we focus on data-driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms. If otherwise not specified, we use the general term bias to describe problems related to the gathering or processing of data that might result in prejudiced decisions on the bases of demographic features such as race, sex, and so forth.

AB  - Background: Many medical students cite an unwelcoming culture in surgery and perceive surgeons as arrogant or unfriendly. These perceptions have been reported as factors discouraging medical students from applying to surgical residency programs. This highlights an opportunity early in medical education to address these negative stereotypes and create opportunities for positive interactions with surgeons. We hypothesize that positive experiences with surgical residents and introduction to representative surgical cases early in the medical school curriculum can provide a real-world context for learning anatomy and encourage students to consider a surgical career. Methods: We developed and implemented a series of structured, one-hour, cadaver-based sessions cofacilitated by anatomists and surgical residents for medical students during their anatomy didactics. Sessions included common surgical cases and focused on critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while offering opportunities to review cadaver anatomy. Students completed a postcourse survey. Results: Nine sessions were implemented with involvement of eight surgical residents and 185 students; 83 students completed a postcourse survey (response rate of 45%). A majority of students rated the sessions “very helpful” in terms of highlighting the importance of anatomy in medical education (n = 52, 63%) and providing clinical context (n = 59, 71%). 54% (n = 45) indicated interest in a surgical career and 64% (n = 53) agreed that session participation had increased their interest in surgery. Conclusions: Overall, students agreed that sessions provided clinical context for their learning and increased interest in a surgical career. Surgical faculty and residents should engage in preclinical medical education to bridge the basic science and clinical years and introduce positive surgical role models early during medical training. © 2019

AB  - We implement a correspondence audit study that uses a non-paired design to test the effect of obesity on employment discrimination in Mexico. In Mexico it is common practice to include a photograph in a resume, and job advertisements often specify personal and physical characteristics. We use both types of information to evaluate discrimination against the obese and identify its potential channels. We send two fictitious resumes, one of a woman and another of a man, one obese and the other non-obese, in response to advertisements for job openings. The obese photograph is a digital manipulation of the picture of the same non-obese person. We send a total of 3202 resumes in response to 1696 job advertisements. There is clear evidence of discrimination against obese women, but not obese men. The callback rate for the non-obese women is 29.1 %; for obese women it is 21.3 %. The difference is statistically and economically significant. An obese woman would need to send 37 % more resumes to obtain the same number of callbacks as a non-obese woman. We explore different channels that could explain this result, including customer discrimination (employer discrimination based on perception of customer expectations), productivity and salary, the gender of the person making the hiring decision, and the proportion of women in the occupation. We find no strong evidence in favor of any one channel. Advertisements with men identified as the contact person discriminate more than those with women, but replacing those men with women would reduce the observed gap in callback rate no more than 25 %. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study developed and examined a brief dissonance-based non-dieting intervention designed to help college women reject unhealthy dieting behaviors, accept their bodies, and increase healthy eating. Participants included 94 female university students (mean age = 20.6 years; mean BMI = 23.8 kg/m2), randomly assigned either to the non-dieting intervention condition or a brochure control condition. The intervention consisted of two 90–120 min interactive group sessions designed to engender the rejection of dieting, increase body acceptance, and develop healthy eating skills. Assessment measures were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up. The group sessions produced significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group on measures of dieting intention, intuitive eating, body image dissatisfaction, eating concerns, and anti-fat attitudes. These effects were sustained at one-month follow-up. There were also overall improvements over time in dietary intake and mental health-related quality of life across conditions. This study extends the research on non-dieting approaches by using a brief, dissonance-based structure and by applying the intervention to a young adult sample that included participants of normal weight. The findings here indicate that a non-dieting approach is acceptable and feasible, and can result in improvements in eating and weight-related behaviors, in young adult women. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While the importance of consumption of luxury goods as a mechanism accompanying upwards movement in a social hierarchy has been well acknowledged, attention to the role and perceptions of luxury in multicultural societies has been scarce so far. It is nonetheless intriguing that ethnic groups inhabiting the same territory, and exposed to a same culture, might develop substantially different notions of luxury, which may end up affecting the integration, or isolation, of one of the groups. Our article addresses this deficiency in the literature by exploring the case of Estonia, a multi-ethnic society where Russians make up almost one-fourth of the population. Much has been written about the integration, and lack thereof, of ethnic Russians into Estonian society. We contrast these views by looking at inter-ethnic relations in the country from a different angle and by a) looking at consumption of luxury in the country through the concept of ‘conspicuous consumption'; b) endorsing Foster's concept of consumer citizenship. This allows us to shed light on an under-explored tendency and maintain here that, in a significant number of cases, ordinary citizens challenge official identity narratives by the state through counter-narratives centred around consumption of luxury at the everyday level. The identified counter-narratives end up translating into (consumer behaviour) instructions for those Russians willing to assert their Estonianness thus allowing them to seek integration into the majority group by simply consuming luxury items that they perceive as appreciated among Estonians, or associated with Estonian high status. By doing this, we make a case for expanding the parameters for academic scrutiny of social integration to include more ‘banal' forms of consumer practices through which top- down narratives and macro studies may be challenged. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Subcutaneous panniculitis-like alpha-beta T-cell lymphoma is a rare disease, which comprises less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The epidemiology of this disorder has not been established in New Zealand, particularly the ethnic variation. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from 2005 to 2017 in South Auckland, New Zealand. Patients with histopathologically confirmed subcutaneous panniculitis-like alpha-beta T-cell lymphoma, according to the WHO-EORTC classification, were included. Cases were identified from multiple data sources to ensure the study population was completely surveyed. Census data were used as the denominator. Results: Ten cases were identified. Five were men and five women. The median age at diagnosis was of 38.5 years (range 17–73 years). Nine were Māori/Pacific, and one was European. The ethnic relative risk of subcutaneous panniculitis-like alpha-beta T-cell lymphoma in Māori/Pacific versus European was 11.1 (95% Cl 1.83–246.1, P = 0.005). Conclusion: Māori and Pacific have a higher relative risk of subcutaneous panniculitis-like alpha-beta T-cell lymphoma compared to non-Māori/Pacific. © 2019 The Australasian College of Dermatologists

AB  - Background: Family-centred care is the dominant model for providing nursing care in paediatrics. Unit layout has been shown to impact nurses' ability to provide family-centred care. Little is known about the meanings and experiences of paediatric intensive care unit nurses concerning the care they provide to families within their unique physical setting. Aim: This study examined paediatric intensive care unit nurses' lived experience of caring for families following a major hospital transformation project, which included the construction of a new unit and quality improvement changes. Study design: A hermeneutic-phenomenological design was selected to study a paediatric intensive care unit in a large Canadian paediatric teaching hospital. Methods: Data were collected over a 6-month period through individual interviews, photographs, participant observation, and document review. The sample consisted of 15 paediatric intensive care unit nurses who experienced the unit both pre- and post-transformation. Data were analysed in an ongoing fashion using the method described by Benner to identify common and divergent meanings. Results: Despite pride in offering a family-friendly environment, nurses' practice prejudiced a family focus in favour of patient-centred care. Nurses in this study negotiated physical and practice spaces with families by interpreting that nurses do not belong in the home-like patient room and exhibiting gatekeeping comportments. Conclusion: Although similar nurse comportments have been identified in prior works, no previous studies have identified these as forming a pattern of negotiating spaces with families. Relevance to clinical practice: This study provides insights into the lived experience of paediatric intensive care unit nurses in relation to family care, which can stimulate reflections at an organizational level about creating environments where nurses and families can both feel at home. © 2019 British Association of Critical Care Nurses

AB  - The present study examined age-related differences among Israeli youth regarding the complexity of their mental images of Jews and Arabs, two groups that are adversaries in the Middle East conflict. The participants, 494 Jewish children and adolescents ranging from 8–16 years old each, drew two human figures, one Jewish and one Arab, and then attributed a forename and a profession to each drawn image. Four complexity variables were scored as follows: image complexity (number of items included in the figure), embellishments (number of items added to the drawing and in the space around the figure), image name, and image profession. Overall, participants depicted members of their in-group as more complex. However, early adolescence was found to be a critical age at which differences emerged. The findings suggest that introducing complexity to social representations in early adolescence may facilitate prevention of negative associations related to outgroups and enhance intervention to reduce stereotypes, prejudice, and racism. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Previous research suggests there may be racial differences in how adults rate children’s ADHD behavior. Differences in perceptions of Black parents and White teachers could have implications for ADHD diagnosis of Black children. This study compared ADHD ratings of Black parents to White teachers, and examined factors that may explain racial differences. Participants included 71 Black parents (65 women, 6 men; Mage = 33.92) and 60 White teachers (41 women, 19 men; Mage = 33.60), as well as a comparison group of 65 White parents (49 women, 16 men; Mage = 36.83). Participants watched video clips of children in classrooms and rated ADHD behaviors and ADHD likelihood. They then completed questionnaires regarding beliefs about ADHD stigma, verve (movement expressiveness), experiences with racial discrimination, and racial attitudes. White teachers rated Black boys’ ADHD behaviors and their likelihood of having ADHD higher than Black parents. White teachers with more negative racial attitudes toward African Americans gave higher ADHD behavior and likelihood ratings to Black boys than did teachers with less negative racial attitudes. Across all participants, ADHD stigma beliefs and verve were not related to ratings of Black boys. Black parents with more experiences with racial discrimination gave higher ratings to Black boys’ ADHD behaviors. Research is necessary to further explain the mechanisms by which discrepancies in ratings of Black boys’ ADHD behaviors exist between Black and White adults to inform culturally sensitive assessment and diagnosis of ADHD in Black children. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - US Latino/as experience high rates of discrimination, resulting in personal and relational distress. A sample of 238 Latino/a young adults (Mage = 25.37 years; 57.6% men; 54.4% Mexican) was used to investigate how perceived discrimination was associated with romantic relationship instability via young adults’ depressive symptoms. The moderating roles of ethnic identity and romantic relationship maintenance on these associations were examined. Greater relationship maintenance and ethnic identity affirmation were associated with less depression and relationship instability. Under conditions of high ethnic identity exploration and resolution, the association between discrimination and depressive symptoms was stronger, leading to greater relationship instability. The findings reveal that the protective roles of cultural and relational factors may depend on the stressor and outcomes examined. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The paper explored how to promote constructive intergroup relations among children and young people in a context of protracted conflict. Across two studies, the Empathy–Attitudes–Action model was examined in middle childhood and adolescence. More specifically, we tested the relations among dispositional empathy, out-group attitudes, and prosocial behaviors for youth born after the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. In one correlational (Study 1: N = 132; 6–11 years old: M = 8.42 years, SD = 1.23) and one longitudinal design (Study 2: N = 466; 14–15 years old), bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that empathy was associated with more positive attitudes toward the conflict-related out-group, which in turn, was related to higher out-group prosocial behaviors, both self-report and concrete actions. Given that out-group prosocial acts in a setting of intergroup conflict may serve as the antecedents for peacebuilding among children and adolescents, this study has intervention implications. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Imagined contact can be effective at reducing social stigma. However, the effect may depend on the strength of the stigma held. We tested the robustness of imagined contact in an Asian setting where stigmatization of mental illness is stronger than in Western countries. In Experiment 1 (n = 167) with five conditions, only an enhanced version of positive imagined contact was able to decrease stigma towards people with schizophrenia through decreasing intergroup anxiety. Given the potential discrepancy between imaginations and reality about experiences with stigmatized groups, in Experiment 2 (n = 121), we tested the hypothesis that after presenting participants with factual information about a mental illness group, imagined contact might backfire, resulting in more negative perceptions. However, enhanced imagined contact alongside factual message about schizophrenia did not increase stigma. The backfiring hypothesis was therefore not supported. Nevertheless, providing realistic information did negate the positive effects of enhanced imagined contact on stigma reduction. In both experiments, we also showed that intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of enhanced imagined contact on various measures of stigma. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Giving thanks has multiple psychological benefits. However, within intergroup contexts, thankful responses from low-power to high-power group members could solidify the power hierarchy. The other-oriented nature of grateful expressions could mask power differences and discourage low-power group members from advocating for their ingroup interests. In five studies (N = 825), we examine the novel idea of a potentially harmful side of “thanks,” using correlational and experimental designs and a follow-up. Across different contexts, expressing thanks to a high-power group member who transgressed and then helped undermined low-power group members’ protest intentions and actual protest. Thus, the expression of thanks can pacify members of low-power groups. We offer insights into the underlying process by showing that forgiveness of the high-power benefactor and system justification mediate this effect. Our findings provide evidence for a problematic side of gratitude within intergroup relations. We discuss social implications. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - The Brazilian prison population in 2016 had increased by more than 700%, compared with the situation in the early 1990s, from 90 thousand to 726.7 thousand. The ordinary response to prison overcrowding came through changes to the justice system, such as Therapeutic Jurisprudence and Restorative Justice. Although these new processes are socially relevant, there are few studies about them anywhere, but especially in Brazil. This study seeks to discuss the perceptions of Brazilian judges upon these new ways of dispensing justice from the perspective of institutional change theory. The data collection involved document analysis, court-hearing observations, and interviews with 14 key-actors in the Brazilian justice system. The results show four dimensions—beliefs, motivations, commitment, and intergroup relations—that characterize the roles played by Brazilian judges working with Therapeutic Jurisprudence and Restorative Justice. This movement can be classified as the modal type of institutional change called layering and “radical” frame blending. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of four US music educators during and after a 3-week adult choir camp in South Africa. Findings reveal that the camp positively influenced music teacher understandings and practices, both during and after the exchange. Throughout the camp, participants navigated race, privilege and prejudice and expressed value for a vast array of shared experiences with choir mates, teachers, and homestays. Participants reflected regularly on processes of learning new musics, describing growth through authentic and at times challenging activities. Furthermore, all participants recognized that firsthand experiences were essential to deep learning. During the camp, all participants expressed hopes of bringing new ideas and music home; 2 months after returning to their classrooms, 3 of the 4 participants reported the teaching of South African songs along with modified pedagogical approaches. Ultimately, participants shared that the trip had impacted them in various personal ways, noting increased tolerance, patience, kindness, confidence and hope. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out-groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3- to 4- and 5- to 6- year-old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in- and out-group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in-group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out-group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out-group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out-group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out-group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3- to 4-year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out-group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Young children typically report primarily same-gender friendships across childhood. However, there is growing awareness of the benefits of gender-integrated friendships and gender integration in schools, especially for social-emotional domains. The current study tested whether Successful Kinesthetic Instruction for Preschoolers (SKIP), an evidence-based motor competence intervention led by physical education teachers, promotes gender-integrated friendships in preschool-aged children. Results documented that children (Mage = 47.38, SD = 6.21 months, range = 36.67–60.25 months) assigned to the SKIP condition (n = 56) as compared to a control free-play condition (n = 37) showed higher motor skill competence and were more likely to report gender-integrated friendships post intervention. Growth in girls’ reports of gender-integrated friendships, in particular, drove the intervention effect on gender-integrated friendships. These findings highlight one example of how motor competence interventions can also result in benefits in social-emotional domains. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article estimates the empirical relationship between prejudicial attitudes toward homosexuality and the wages of gay men in the United States. It combines data on prejudicial attitudes toward homosexuality from the General Social Survey with data on wages from the U.S. Decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys—both aggregated to the state level. The author finds that a one standard deviation increase in the share of individuals in a state who are prejudiced toward homosexuals is correlated with a decrease in the wages of gay men of between 2.7% and 4.0%. The results also suggest that the prejudice of managers is responsible for this correlation. The author finds that a one standard deviation increase in the share of the managers in a state who are prejudiced toward homosexuals is associated with a 1.9% decrease in the wages of gay men. The author finds no evidence that the wage penalty for gay men is correlated with the prejudice of customers or co-workers. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Transphobia is an under-examined but important type of prejudice to study in Polish culture. Poland is a country where a majority of transgender people feel discriminated against. There is a need for a more evidence-based measures for researchers and practitioners to better understand transphobia. The main purpose of the present three studies (n = 300 participants for each study) was to validate the Genderism and Transphobia Scale (GTS; Hill and Willoughby 2005) and the Transphobia Scale (TS; Nagoshi et al. 2008) in Polish culture and to identify the possible psychological and demographic factors that matter in forming attitudes toward transgender individuals. The results confirm that Polish versions of both the GTS and the TS are reliable instruments to measure attitudes toward transgender individuals. Moreover, the studies revealed that both traditional and modern homonegativity, right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, religious fundamentalism, attitudes toward gender roles, and biological and cultural beliefs about the origins of gender differences were significant predictors of transphobia. As in previous studies, men were more prejudiced toward gender nonconformists in comparison to women. These studies contribute well-adapted tools for measuring transphobia and data-driven collection of significant predictors of transphobia. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the experiences of Palestinian-Israeli minority1 teachers when teaching at majority state Hebrew secular schools in Israel. Specifically, the objective is to describe and analyze the role of the teachers’ work-related experiences in shaping their sense of self-efficacy, job satisfaction, acculturation process, and how all these affect their feelings regarding their potential role in helping break down stereotypes and misconceptions about the Palestinian-Israeli minority. Data were gathered from 15 interviewees, who described their experiences, feelings, and perspectives about their work. Findings indicate that Palestinian-Israeli teachers experience a strong sense of self-efficacy, satisfaction, and positive relationships with students, parents, and colleagues. Participants expressed the belief that their work helps reduce prejudice and increases mutual understanding among the groups in conflict, through successful acculturation, despite some difficulties. It is suggested that stakeholders should strengthen efforts to recruit and retain these teachers, through strong administrative support. © 2019 American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.

AB  - Individuals often develop negative biases toward unfamiliar or denigrated groups. Two experimental studies were conducted to investigate the extent to which brief negative messages about novel social groups influence children's (4- to 9-year-olds'; N = 153) intergroup attitudes. The studies examined the relative influence of messages that are provided directly to children versus messages that are overheard and examined whether the force of these messages varies with children's age. According to implicit and explicit measures of children's intergroup attitudes, children rapidly internalized messages demeaning novel groups, thus forming negative attitudes toward outgroups merely on the basis of hearsay. These effects were generally stronger among older children, and were particularly pronounced when the message was provided directly to children. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - How do parents think about and react to their children's racial biases? Across three studies (N = 519) we investigated whether and how parents’ Internal Motivation to Respond without Prejudice Scale (IMS) predicted standards for their children's race-related behavior, and tested parents’ affective reactions to imagining their children violating their standards. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that parents (of 4- to 12-year-old children) with high IMS set more stringent standards for their children's race-related behavior than their low IMS counterparts. Upon considering their children expressing racial bias, high IMS parents reported negative self-directed affect (i.e., guilt; Studies 2 and 3), an affective response that motivates prejudice reduction in adults. The results have implications for involving parents in prejudice interventions targeting children's biases. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

Based on 34 qualitative interviews, we explore both the perceived meaning of ‘community’ in the context of targeted victimization and the emotional and behavioural effects that anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Islamophobic hate crimes have on other members of the victim’s group. Building on previous quantitative data undertaken as part of a larger programme of research, this study helps to explain how and why hate crimes have significant indirect consequences on two distinct but commonly targeted communities. The focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim communities allowed us to draw out similarities and commonalities across different groups, further enhancing the understanding of the impacts of hate crime. In particular, the article highlights how for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim people feelings of anger and anxiety about hate crimes were linked to enhanced levels of empathy towards those that they share a group identity with. These empathic bonds often gave rise to a sense of ‘shared suffering’, with participants frequently feeling connected to group members worldwide through their common experiences of hate and prejudice. Although group identity was important to many participants’ sense of belonging to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender or Muslim communities, it was clear that the most profound impacts of hate crime were experienced when incidents occurred within someone’s local area. This highlighted the importance of location as a key variable in understanding both the meaning of ‘community’ and the indirect impacts of hate crime. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The correlates of sexual prejudice –negative attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals– are well-known in the literature, but the relevance of the social-political environment in which these correlates insert has received less attention. This study examines trends and correlates of sexual prejudice in El Salvador, a country frequently ranked as one of the most homophobic in the Americas. Using a representative sample from national-level surveys conducted between 2008 and 2016, it was found that the Salvadorian population displayed high levels of sexual prejudice in this period, although these levels varied significantly over time. Analysis with 2016 data showed that socially precarious conditions, religion, and traditionally gendered worldviews, were positively associated with sexual prejudice. Sexual prejudice also correlated with political and social beliefs that encompass authoritarian and misogynistic tendencies. Three clusters of predictors of sexual prejudice were identified: Religious conventionalism, unsophisticated masculinity background, and a deficient democratic socialization. This study supports previous findings about correlates of sexual prejudice while highlighting the lesser-studied role of the social-political environment, and oscillations in a democratic culture, in perpetuating sexual prejudice. © 2020, South-West University "Neofit Rilski".

AB  - The present study aims to see individual personality factors having influence over the respondents’ engagement levels. The academic achievements of the students differ based on their personality which determines how they keep themselves engaged in their studies.Here the researcher has used the big five personality as a predictor for student engagement among the Master of business administration students (MBA) of a B-School in Tiruchirapalli. The level of engagement varies among students in their academics which results in variation in academic performance. Two different scales were used to find out student engagement and big five personality variables (BFI 10). Academic success is strongly prejudiced by entity difference ininspiration and accomplishment.The academic achievements of the students differ based on their personality which determines how they keep themselves engaged in their studies. Student engagement have been found to be significant communication-related traits linked to student classroom outcomes, together with student wisdom and student preservation. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Purpose: Environmental social work (ESW) is an approach and a perspective in social work focusing on ecological and environmental sustainability and justice within the context of sustainable development (SD). This study aims to analyse students’ reflective tasks on challenges for ESW education and practice from a critical theory perspective. The purpose of this study is to discuss the implications of the findings for accelerating the implementation of SD in social work curricula. Design/methodology/approach: The research participants comprised 49 master level students from four different cohorts studying the course “Social Work and Sustainable Development” at the University of Gävle, Sweden. The sample comprised only those students who had completed at least one of the three non-mandatory reflective tasks that were set within the course. The reflective tasks of the research participants were gathered as data for this study. A qualitative methodological approach with the help of ATLAS-ti V8.4 was used to analyse the gathered data. Findings: This study discusses three primary results, which are categorised as “Being Boxed”, “Safe and Saviour Sweden” and “Politics and Power”. Based on the results, this study argues for a transformative and emancipatory pedagogy (TEP) in the teaching and learning of ESW to accelerate the implementation of holistic SD within the social work curriculum. Research limitations/implications: This study is mainly based on the analysis of “problematic” discourses of some of the students. The majority of the students and their respective discourses are not considered. Moreover, it would have been interesting, and probably enlightening to explore the background of the students (such as gender, ethnicity and religion) and any concomitant beliefs or prejudices (whether consciously held or otherwise) that would need to be addressed for an effective social work outcome. For ethical reasons, the background of the students was not recorded and analysed in this study. Practical implications: Based on the results, this study argues for TEP in catalysing environmentalism within the social work curricula. Social implications: Social workers have a political mandate from their professional ethics to work for the protection of the planet and for the well-being of all – including non-humans. This study therefore argues for ESW education within social work curricula in promoting SD through social work practice. Originality/value: Within the context of SD, there is a global call for social work education to shift from an anthropocentric to an eco-centric paradigm. However, ESW education is still in its infancy stage and very few universities are focusing in this particular area. This study therefore brings an important and well-needed layer of empirical evidence in considering the implications for catalysing environmentalism within the social work curricula. © 2020, Komalsingh Rambaree.

AB  - This paper aimed to examine deprovincialization, defined as a less ingroup-centric worldview fostering openness to other cultures and outgroups, and to test its relationships with personality, cognitive styles, values, political ideologies, intergroup contact, and prejudice. In Study 1, we proved the factorial validity of the Cultural Deprovincialization Scale (CDS), an instrument specifically designed to assess a growing acceptance of other peoples and cultures following intergroup encounters, and we provided evidence for its construct validity by exploring its nomological net. People scoring higher on the CDS were more extraverted, agreeable, open to experience, cognitively flexible, and scored lower on social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and nationalism. Moreover, deprovincialized people reported higher scores on positive contact, lower scores on negative contact, better outgroup attitudes, and lower levels of prejudice. In Study 2, using a longitudinal design, we tested the within- and between-individual associations that deprovincialization had with positive and negative intergroup contact, outgroup attitudes, and prejudice. Both between-individual and within-individual variations in positive and negative contact predicted time-varying deprovincialization, whereas between-individual and within-individual variations in deprovincialization predicted time-varying outgroup attitudes and prejudice, controlling for age, gender, and social dominance orientation, and also for contact when deprovincialization was a predictor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Homosexual men are constantly exposed to prejudice and violence in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between minority stress, parenting styles, and indicators of mental health problems in a sample of homosexual men. Method: quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational, and retrospective design. Participants were 101 Brazilian men who selfidentified as homosexuals, aged between 18 and 55 years. Results: concealing sexual identity was a predictor of depression and stress. Parental responsiveness was associated with a lower incidence of enacted stigma and depression. Conclusions: the mental health of homosexual men can be negatively affected by the need to conceal their sexual orientation. Parental responsiveness is a protective factor in terms of experiencing enacted stigma and depression. The results found in the study may be useful for counselors and social workers who are working with LGBT people and their families. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper aims to study democratic principles among official and public institutions in modern Uzbekistan. The authors discuss the features of perceptions of political reforms in the social consciousness, the interactions of civil society institutions (scientific, socialist and public) that shape social consciousness and ideological factors that contribute to the correction of prejudices. According to the authors, democracy and human freedom are interdependent, not opposed to coercion. Democratic relationships are reflected in the balance between them, not conflict or accident. As a result of studying the general features of social and political processes taking place in modern Uzbekistan, changes in public opinion, their directions and trends, we have identified the internal social paradoxes of democratic reforms. At the same time, the article provides some suggestions and recommendations that will enable the realization of human rights and interests in the future democratization of society in Uzbekistan. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Contemporary society is saturated with negative representations of racial and ethnic minorities. Social science research finds that exposure to such negative stereotypes creates stress above and beyond pre-existing effects of income inequality and structural racism. Neuroscience studies in animals and humans show that life stress modulates brain responses to rewards. However, it is not known whether contending with negative representations of one's social group spills overs to influence reward processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of stigmatizing negative stereotypes on neural responding to the anticipation and consumption of monetary gains and losses in a Mexican American sample. Machine learning analyses indicated that incentive-related patterns of brain activity within the nucleus accumbens differed between Mexican Americans subjected to negative stereotypes and those who were not. This effect occurred for anticipating both gains and losses. Our work suggests that rhetoric stigmatizing Latinos and other minorities could alter how members of such groups process incentives in their environment. These findings contribute to our understanding of the linkage between stigmatizing experiences and motivated behavior, with implications for well-being and health. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Author Toni Morrison used fictional narratives to make readers uncomfortably aware of their collective role in perpetuating the culture of poverty and pitying its victims. In her first novel, The Bluest Eye, she focused on the most vulnerable member of society–a child–to depict the consequences of extreme social isolation and shine a spotlight on problematic explanations of poverty that fail to critique dominant narratives. This article examines how Morrison utilized relationships in The Bluest Eye to expose the societal conspiracies that damage children. Through her characters, Morrison challenges us to move away from the comfort of pitying victims to interrogating the role we play, especially in our schools. Using literary analysis, this article makes a case for helping young people resist the internalization of negative stereotypes, helping them use their voices to confront the deficit thinking and structural racism that pervades today’s educational system. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article reviews the debate about the enhancement of grandparents’ legal status in relation to their grandchildren. In particular, it observes that calls for a legal presumption in favour of grandparent contact with their grandchildren when family relationships break down were emboldened by the enactment in s1(2A) of the Children Act 1989 of a presumption that involvement of both parents in their children’s lives furthers children’s welfare. Proponents of grandparent rights argued that there should be a similar statutory presumption in favour of grandparent involvement. It is also argued that courts should strictly enforce child arrangement orders that give grandparents time with grandchildren. The article examines the welfare case for such involvement and concludes that there is no unequivocal evidence to support it. It also considers the effect of the presumption in s1(2A). The article concludes that to enact a similar presumption in favour of grandparents, to apply a de facto presumption, to enforce orders strictly and even to remove the leave requirement that currently exists, could prejudice the interests of mothers as well as children. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This contribution focuses on four periods in Iceland, from the early twentieth century until the time of writing, in order to document and analyse the struggles of people with intellectual disabilities to marry, have a family and maintain custody of their children. Each period is linked to specific pieces of legislation that governed the bodies and lives of disabled people and reflected larger social norms concerning issues of family life and parenthood. An emphasis is placed upon the perspective of contemporary critical disability studies in analysing the historical development of this struggle, and the voices of those who experienced this struggle first-hand, drawn from a number of research projects conducted in Iceland. Our main contention is that the weight of history still comes to bear upon matters of parenting and family life, even in the most recent shift toward a human rights approach to disability. There remains a strong socio-cultural resistance toward parenting with an intellectual disability, rooted in the ideology of early twentieth-century eugenics. Our goal is to document the development of these phases throughout the twentieth century in Iceland in order to illustrate how older ideas and prejudices still inform contemporary child protection practices concerning parents with disabilities. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Crisis occupies an ambiguous place in the writings of Hannah Arendt. Not only does crisis undermine categories of judgment, but in doing so it eliminates prejudices as well, forcing us to judge without them. Although Arendt never had an opportunity to fully develop her understanding of judgment, we know that she considered it to be ‘the most political of man’s mental abilities,’ and her writings on education reflect this. In her essay, ‘The Crisis in Education’ she draws a connection between judgment and crisis, linking it to the work of the classroom. It is this relationship, between crisis and judgment, that I examine. In doing so, I turn to two figures central to Arendt’s work–Immanuel Kant and Adolf Eichmann–each of whom embody opposing aspects of what it means to judge, epitomized by a conceptual tension between example and cliché. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the process of Internalized Sexual Stigma (ISS) in a sample of Egyptian gay men. Participants' experience of ISS was explained using the theoretical understanding that it represents an internal form of minority stress, which is the excess and harmful stress often experienced by individuals from stigmatized social categories due to their minority position. Thematic analysis of interviews with eight Egyptian gay males suggested that these men experienced internal minority stress as a result of the sexually-prejudiced messages they received from different sectors of their society, including its non-affirming religious institutions. Moreover, thematic analysis added cultural understanding to this theoretical explanation by producing an emerging theme that highlighted the possible role of societal pressure to meet gender expectations in perpetuating this problem. Recommendations for mental health professionals who conduct clinical interventions with gay men from diverse populations are provided. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Israeli society in the first decades of statehood is thought of as a dichotomous one, with middle and upper class Ashkenazi Jews on one hand and on the other, lower class immigrants from Muslim countries. Though the emergence of a Mizrahi middle class is associated with the 1970s and 1980s, a deeper look into early-statehood Israel indicates that the ethnic/class dichotomy was already more nuanced in the 1950s. In fact, the social landscape of this period included a group of new Middle Eastern and North African immigrants of urban middle and upper classes, who managed to integrate into Israel's urban middle class. Most of them had come from Iraq. Scholarly discussion on this urban group presents methodological challenges, as documentation regarding it is scant and even rare. The current article concerns a particular sub-group of young middle-class immigrants from Iraq who published a journal documenting their world-view and activities. The article examines the characteristics of this group's integration process, its social and cultural perceptions, guiding aspirations, and dilemmas, placing particular emphasis on the identity and self-representation of these young people. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research aims to examine transprejudice in the Turkish cultural context and identify its socio-political and morality-based correlates. To that end, we report two studies. In Study 1, we manipulate the gender identity of a hypothetical victim in a violent criminal scenario. We find that people (N = 116) put greater social distance towards a transwoman compared to a ciswoman victim, yet do not distinguish between the two in terms of responsibility attributions. In Study 2 (N = 175), we explore the socio-political and moral underpinnings of transprejudice by focusing on the role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) in different forms of transprejudice through the mediating functionof moral foundations. RWA predicts greater social distance and less positive affect towards transwomen through the purity foundation; while SDO predicts lower positive affect through the care foundation. The findings show that transprejudice does exist to some extent and that RWA seems to be a potent socio-political predictor of transprejudice in Turkey. The moral foundations, on the other hand, do not seem to play the mediator role that has been shown for other prejudice domains and different cultural contexts. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In a between-subjects’ experimental design, we manipulated whether participants viewed an educational video on the importance of Silver Alerts before viewing an older Caucasian female in a Silver Alert. We also examined associations of target recognition with individual difference variables, including gender, ethnicity, Attitudes Towards Older People (ATOP), empathy, conscientiousness, as well as contact and experience with older adults. The results showed an advantage of the priming condition compared to the no-priming condition for correctly identifying the missing woman. Additionally, females correctly identified the missing woman more than males, and Caucasian participants correctly identified the missing woman more than African American participants. Lastly, participants who reported more experience with older adults were more likely to recognize the missing woman. The results suggest that preceding Silver Alerts with information about their importance may increase their effectiveness. Further research is needed to investigate how individual difference variables relate to recognition of missing senior citizens. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The study utilized African theories, literatures, framework and a qualitative method with 11 heterosexual Nigerian undergraduate university students to explore their perceptions and attitudes towards homosexuality and LGB persons. The data analysis identified six categories: (a) higher tolerance observed for lesbians than gay men among heterosexual men; (b) possibility of biological causation of homosexuality; (c) assumptions of social and environmental factors as influencing homosexuality; (d) assumption that gays are sexual abusers and the fear of gay men and lesbians; (e) positive perceptions about LGB persons; and (f) suggestions on conversion therapy for LGB persons. This study identifies perceptions, attitudes and microaggressions of heterosexual students towards LGB persons and the implications on safe schools and the well-being of LGB students. The study recommends how to address heterosexism and homophobia in our schools and campuses. Findings are discussed with findings on attitudes towards homosexuality in schools and universities in some African countries. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this paper, a case is made for mainstreaming gender into global women's health programming and policies. The potential implications of conflating "gender" with "women'" in the design and evaluation of women's health programming are first considered. HIV/AIDS case studies are then used to depict examples of (a) where gender has been well integrated and (b) where policies fall short of gender mainstreaming. Finally, practical approaches to mainstream gender in a meaningful way into the design and evaluation of women's health programming and policies are provided for practitioners and researchers. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: Positive Expectations Regarding Aging serve as a protective factor of healthy aging; however, negative stereotypes regarding aging continue to dominate popular aging discourse. It is proposed that trait mindfulness (TM) is associated with aging expectations through the cultivation of openness, curiosity, and non-judgment to one’s thoughts, emotions, and sensations, whether they are positive or negative. Methods: Associations between the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Expectations Regarding Aging Survey (ERA-38) were examined among 201 participants aged 55+ years. Results: Analyses revealed that higher levels of TM was significantly associated with positive aging expectations, controlling for retirement and socioeconomic status ((Formula presented.) = 14.0%, F(5,192) = 7.17, p <.001). Conclusion: The development of TM, notably the facet of non-judgment, may be used to promote positive aging expectations to help support healthy aging. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The current paper seeks to integrate social and cognitive psychological literature to provide a multifaceted understanding of attention to race. Social psychological studies show that participants demonstrate attentional bias to racial out-group versus in-group faces. Most of this research utilizes White participants and examines the attentional bias to Black faces, concluding that threat stereotypes or negative racial attitudes underlie attentional bias. However, visual processing research demonstrates that various stimulus- and perceiver-driven processes impact attention, suggesting that mechanisms other than racial stereotypes may underlie race-based attention. We propose a framework of attention that accounts not only for direct influences of the stimulus and perceiver but also perceiver-stimulus interactions that emerge iteratively over time. We apply this framework to existing research on attention to race, elucidating various processes that can explain the attention to racial out-groups. We propose that our framework can account for attention to race more generally, beyond the oft-used Black versus White paradigm. We argue that mechanisms underlying attentional bias to race encompass complex factors beyond stereotypes and that our framework can account for stimulus, perceiver, and iterative processes that impact attention to race. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: We are at a historical juncture that is punctuated by the rise of white nationalism, an exacerbation of racial divisions and tensions, an uptick in hate crimes, and bullying increasingly targeting immigrant youth, all of which, in the current political and cultural climate, have often been legitimized through a recourse to “alternative facts.” However, the current historical moment in the United States is also marked by a postmodern ethos, which is often taken up by the public in a fragmentary manner, highlighted by a general sense of incredulity regarding any form of knowledge. At the same time, the fuller, ethical context of postmodernism complicates how educators may pedagogically address and respond to the tensions and conflict that filter over into the university classroom from the social strife and injustices evident in the society at large. The ethical context of postmodernism warns against changing hearts and minds with a proliferation of the “right” facts assumed to be devoid of attachments of value. It also warns us to be vigilant against the foreclosures, reductions, and exclusions that occur when one draws on metanarratives and universals to mobilize against injustice. Purpose: We explore what it means pedagogically, for teacher educators in predominantly white institutions, to be situated at a historical juncture that calls out for some form of social advocacy on their part to combat the rise in the politicization of truth and xenophobic and racist sentiment, but are simultaneously compelled to keep in mind the ethical lessons of postmodernism. Research Design: We utilize critical phenomenological analysis intertwined with a narrative accounting of both authors' classroom experiences as they attempt to engage college students at a predominantly white university with issues of racism, white privilege, and marginalization. We analyze and reflect on the mixed reactions of our students to a presentation on teaching in a diverse world, given by one of the authors to the other author's class of pre-service teachers. Conclusions/Recommendations: For teaching that may facilitate white students' ability to become reflective of their positionality as structured through whiteness and its attendant privileges, it is important to envision pedagogical work taking place within environments that can address not only students' cognitive capacities but also the white body schema, which operates at a pre-reflective level. Educators may refrain from reducing white students to reified categories of whiteness by cultivating a disposition of wonder that may allow them to understand whiteness through the lens of emergent realities rather than substantive, ontological forces.

AB  - Objective: The study aims the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes in Brazil, which has already been legalized, with an emphasis on the import and planting of seeds in the national territory, still without regulation, and the axiological gap resulting from such legal framework. The study also points out the medicinal properties of cannabis that have already been scientifically proven and to clarify how to resolve the aforementioned controversy over its regulation in the national territory. Methodology: The method of approach followed is the legal dialectical, covering the phenomenon, fact and theory, simultaneously, seeking the result with complement between the both. To obtain the results desired by the work, bibliographic research was used, covering specialized works. Results: The release of the import and planting of cannabis seeds in Brazil, for medicinal purposes, is a result of the right to health, the application of the principles of human dignity, equality and social solidarity, as well as the principles of economic activity. Contributions: The choice of the theme is justified considering that, in addition to the proven efficiency of cannabis in the treatment of serious diseases, socially there is still great prejudice on the theme, which is reflected in the legal area. © 2020, Centro Universitário Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

AB  - Negative stereotypes about racial minorities, particularly African Americans, persist in the United States. Given the imperviousness of racial stereotypes about minorities, can individuals who date interracially also be stereotyped? The author investigates this by conducting the first systematic study of men’s attitudes toward white and black women who date outside their race. First, the author inductively uncovers these stereotypes through focus groups. Second, to assess these stereotypes’ nationwide prevalence and to minimize social desirability bias, the author applies a survey experiment, in which interracial dating is subtly primed via photographs of couples, to a national sample of men. The findings are mixed. In the experiment, crossing the white-black racial boundary does activate negative stereotypes for women, which may have reputational costs, but mostly among older white male respondents. These costs include changes in men’s perceptions of their class status, cultural values, and even sexual practices. In conclusion, interracial dating is a key social site where gender-based moral norms are policed, class divisions are constructed, and racial boundaries are maintained. © American Sociological Association 2019.

AB  - This study investigates underrepresented youths’ perspectives on social media design and how these may inform the development of more ethical and equitable social media apps. In contrast to the tradition of universal design in the field of human–computer interaction, this study centers difference to investigate how users’ perspectives and expectations, shaped by their identities, help determine the affordances of social media and their ethical implications. Twenty-five in-depth interviews and youth-guided “think aloud” social media tours were carried out with a diverse range of young people from underrepresented groups. Findings illustrate how young people perceive and experience empowering and disempowering aspects of social media design. Interviewees expressed a palpable sense of underrepresentation in the digital technology design sector and noted several ways in which design elements of social media can exacerbate a sense of inadequacy. The negative implications of user profile design and popularity rating systems that encourage conformity were found to be of particular concern for low-income youth, youth of color, and other underrepresented groups. However, our findings also illuminate youth perspectives on how social media can sometimes serve as a tool to counter negative stereotypes and build social capital. The analysis includes concrete suggestions from underrepresented youth for more ethical and equitable social media design. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This research aims to reveal the pattern of the multiculturalism-based civics education at higher education institutions in Surakarta, Indonesia. It applied the descriptive qualitative method with the dual case study approach, conducted at State University of Sebelas Maret and Slamet Riyadi University in Surakarta. The data were collected through observation and interviews to find the answers to the research questions in the field. The data were analysed using the interactive technique, consisting of data collection, data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. The result shows that the teaching of multiculturalism-based civics education at State University of Sebelas Maret and Slamet Riyadi University has almost the same pattern, that is media-assisted teaching pattern and is always conducted by considering the material integration dimension, knowledge construction dimension, prejudice minimization dimension, equal rights to education dimension, and the dimension of school culture empowerment and social structure from the planning stage to teaching implementation and evaluation stages. The research findings suggest that the students of universities in Surakarta should be able to implement the goal of the teaching of civics education in universities, and the lecturers should always improve the materials, content, method, and strategies of the teaching of multiculturalism-based civics education. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years psychosocial studies have given a growing attention to online intergroup contact in reducing prejudice. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of evidence on processes that could mediate this relation. The present study aimed to fill this gap. Focused on intergroup relationships between people with different sexual orientations, it examined whether and to what extent identity processes-i.e., sexual identity commitment and exploration-mediated the relationship between online intergroup contact and perception of mediated and vicarious sexual online discrimination on Facebook. Data was collected with a sample of 357 Facebook users (Mage = 26.07, SD = 8.37; females: 64.9%, males: 35.1%) who completed an online questionnaire. A full Structural Equation Modeling was tested. Results showed that: (a) Online contact was positively associated with perceived online sexual discrimination; (b) online contact was positively associated with identity exploration but not commitment; (c) exploration-but not commitment-was positively associated with perceived online sexual discrimination; (d) sexual identity exploration-but not commitment-mediated the relationship between online contact and perception of sexual discrimination, increasing the positive effect of contact on perceived discrimination. Limitations and directions for future research were discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The aims of this article are to (1) present a shared definition of weight stigma related to pregnancy and (2) develop a definition to inform valid and reliable nursing research addressing weight stigma in the obstetric setting. Weight stigma is increasingly prevalent in society, especially among women with prepregnancy overweight or obesity. However, a universally accepted definition of weight stigma related to pregnancy has yet to be identified. We followed Walker and Avant's concept analysis methodology using an iterative approach to ensure a robust and conceptually sound definition of weight stigma related to pregnancy. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - This study analyses the acculturation orientation of immigrant students and their adaptation to the Basque education system. For this, a three-dimensional perspective is adopted that takes into account the group of origin and the two linguistic-cultural groups of the host society. The results indicate that the main acculturation orientation is integration; however, two modalities appear, one oriented to monolingualism and the other to bilingualism. Both types of integration are related to good academic adaptation; however, the subjects with integration oriented to bilingualism show higher levels of social adaptation and greater linguistic identity with both languages and with both identities, the Spanish and the Basque. The results of this research support the idea that the study of acculturation in bilingual contexts such as Basque requires a three-dimensional approach, in which the group of origin and the linguistic groups of the host society, whether majority or minority, are considered. On the other hand, it is considered important to promote bilingual education among all students, including immigrants, to facilitate their adaptation and foster positive intergroup relations. © 2020, Ministry Education and Science.

AB  - This research focuses on the implementation of a series of actions and training workshops with families of a school located in a socially excluded area in the city of Cordoba, Spain. The study explores how the participants perceived the experience and the educational and social benefits of this formative process. The research methodology was based on a participatory action research approach, which involved successive cycles of research and action in different phases: planning and analysis of the problem, action, observation and reflection. Five key informants, selected according to the criterion of structural heterogeneity, participated in the research. Semi-structured interviews and field journals were used as research instruments and content analysis was the technique of choice to analyses the information. The results reveal that the participants found the workshops to be highly beneficial both personally and in terms of the image they project to their children. They also faced challenges regarding their continuity in the activity, such as prejudices or different communication codes. The discussion underlines the importance of conducting training activities with families in contexts of poverty as an educational action that can increase their interest and motivation towards the school and hence enhance their participation in school life.

AB  - While previous research has examined social norms and intergroup contact as predictors of prejudice, there is limited research on their interplay in shaping intergroup attitudes. The results of five studies using correlational and experimental methods in different intergroup contexts consistently showed that the influence of intolerant (vs. tolerant) social norms on prejudice is reduced for people who have contacts with outgroup members. Studies 4–5 further showed that threat perceptions mediate the interaction effects between norms and contact on prejudice. Overall, the research program suggests that intergroup contact is a potent tool for reducing conformity to intolerant and antiegalitarian norms. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - According to the extended contact hypothesis, direct intergroup contact is not necessary for prejudice reduction; it suffices to know that ingroup friends have outgroup friends. However, extended contact is typically measured in a way that does not clarify whether people know the outgroup friend of their ingroup friend or whether they are even direct friends. A social network approach is used to compare extended contact when ingroup friends’ outgroup friends are not direct friends (open triads) to when there is a direct friendship with some (mixed triads) or all of the ingroup friends’ outgroup friends (closed triads). Results from a nonprobability sample in the US predicting feelings toward Black people (N = 313) and from a representative sample in the Netherlands predicting attitudes toward immigrants (N = 818) show that extended contact reduces prejudice only when some of the outgroup friends of one’s ingroup friends are known. This suggests that the extended contact effect should not be interpreted as providing a solution for situations where direct contact with outgroup members is not possible. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The impact of racial experiences on Whites has been underresearched and has rarely been considered traumatic. To understand these experiences, it is important to consider variation in one's orientation to their racial group (i.e., racial identity) and the type of racial encounter. Using a White adult sample and hierarchical cluster analysis, the authors found that reactions to race-based encounters were associated with varying levels of psychological distress and well-being and racial identity statuses. Clinical implications are discussed. El impacto de las experiencias raciales en personas blancas no ha sido suficientemente investigado y en raras ocasiones ha sido considerado traumático. Para comprender estas experiencias, es importante considerar la variación en la orientación de cada individuo hacia su grupo racial (es decir, la identidad racial) y el tipo de encuentro racial. Usando una muestra de personas adultas blancas y un análisis jerárquico de clústeres, los autores hallaron que las reacciones a los encuentros raciales estaban asociadas a niveles variables de malestar psicológico, así como de estados de bienestar e identidad racial. © 2020 American Counseling Association.

AB  - Some forms of cooperative helping do not bind people from a moral perspective but ensure the functioning of social groups. Here, we have assessed how children coordinate such nonobligatory social concerns with group identity concerns. We have performed three studies (3–11-years-old; N = 393) aimed at testing children's peer preferences and resource allocation toward neutral individuals that engage in helping and hindering behaviors toward in-group and out-group peers. In Study 1, we have found that, in helping contexts, children prioritized group concerns and exhibited in-group favoritism. In hindering contexts, they privileged helping norms and did not exhibit out-group derogation. In Studies 2 and 3, we have confirmed that transgressions of cooperative helping norms outweighed intergroup bias. Our results suggest that, when cooperative helping norms conflict with group identity concerns, helping norms take priority. When these principles are coextensive and not in conflict, children give priority to group concerns. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Accumulated disadvantage (AD) is conceptualised here as an agglomeration of unfavourable or prejudicial conditions which in adolescence may compromise the progress to further education or future life chances. There are several theories on AD, suggesting, e.g., (1) an increase of AD by age and (2) trajectories (previous disadvantage predicts later disadvantage). Social pathways theory suggests that (3) a third factor (e.g., socioeconomic position, SEP) mediates or moderates the association between early and later disadvantage, while other theories imply (4) polarisation (a strengthening association between AD and SEP by age) or (5) equalisation (a weakening of association between AD and SEP). We apply these theories to longitudinal data of 7th graders (13 years, N = 5742), followed until the end of the 9th grade. Five dimensions of disadvantage were health (poor self-rated health), social behaviour (poor prosocial behaviour), normative (conduct disorders), educational (poor academic achievement), and economic (parental unemployment). The results show that the prevalence of AD increased over the follow-up as most indicators of disadvantage elevated. AD at the 7th grade predicted later AD, as did the SEP of the students. Moderation of AD by SEP was also observed. The study corroborates with hypotheses on increase of AD, trajectory, and social pathways but no signs of polarisation or equalisation were observed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Recent advances in social psychological research have shown that national integration policies influence how immigrants are perceived and treated by the mainstream population. However, the processes by which these policies come to have an impact on prejudice and well-being of the general population are largely unknown. Moreover, past research has often relied on unrepresentative samples limiting generalizability. The present research proposes that when the national integration policies of a given society are perceived as clearly defined and coherent, they have a direct impact on the perceived cultural norm related to those national integration policies. In turn, the perceived cultural norm affects personal attitudes toward cultural norms (i.e., the degree to which individuals support a given policy), which influence the level of anti-immigrant prejudice as well as psychological well-being. Findings from two correlational studies with representative samples of the mainstream population conducted in France on the policy of secularism (N = 940) and in Québec on the policy of interculturalism (N = 912) supported the proposed theoretical model. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, I explore how the US-based Religious Right and white nationalist movements are both organized around a similar politics of gender rooted in defending the patriarchal family. While the broader meanings of the family differ in each framework—either providing the foundation for the racial nation or the religious order—there is surprising agreement across these movements around understanding the family as a heterosexual and patriarchal institution that is under attack. Based on long-term ethnographic research in both movements, I show how defending the heteropatriarchal family provides valorized gendered identities for their participants along with a moral justification for prejudice, particularly through a discourse of defending women and children from feminism and queerness. This analysis shows how contemporary right-wing and authoritarian movements rally around this family—modern, classed and raced, and patriarchal—as an anchor of stability in a time of increasing economic and social change. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association.

AB  - Although ethnic differences in pain perception are well documented, the underlying mechanism for these outcomes has not been established. µ-opioid receptor (MOR) function might contribute to this disparity, given that MORs play a key role in pain sensitivity and modulation. However, no study has characterized ethnic differences in MOR physiology. This study sought to address this knowledge gap by examining differences in µ-selective agonist binding potential (BPND; [11C]-Carfentanil) between 27 non-Hispanic black (NHB) and 27 demographically similar, non-Hispanic white participants. Participants completed questionnaires and two 90-minute high-resolution research tomograph positron emission tomography (PET) imaging sessions. During PET imaging, a capsaicin or control cream was applied to individuals' arms, and pain ratings were collected. Bonferroni-corrected PET volumes of interest analyses revealed significantly greater [11C]-Carfentanil BPNDamong NHB participants in bilateral ventral striatum ([left]: F1,52= 16.38, P &lt; 0.001; [right]: F1,52= 21.76, P &lt; 0.001), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ([left] F1,52= 17.3, P &lt; 0.001; [right]: F1,52= 14.17, P &lt; 0.001), bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ([left]: F1,52= 10.4, P = 0.002; [right]: F1,52= 12.91, P = 0.001), and right insula (F1,52= 11.0, P = 0.002). However, there were no significant main effects of condition or ethnicity × condition interaction effects across models, likely attributable to individual variability in the direction of change within groups. BPNDvalues were significantly correlated with pain ratings collected during the capsaicin condition (r range = 0.34-0.46, P range = 0.01-0.001). Results suggest that NHB individuals might have generally greater unoccupied MOR density than non-Hispanic white peers. Findings have implications for physiological differences underlying ethnicity-related pain disparities. If replicated, these results further emphasize the need for tailored treatments in historically underserved populations. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - An increasing literature has emerged to examine development of social enterprises (SEs) in varying national or regional contexts. This paper presents empirical research on SEs in Finland’s Swedish-speaking regions. Differences between Finnish speakers and Swedish speakers have been identified in studies on, for instance, social capital and communality. Both groups have equal constitutional status. This study focuses on the prevalence, role and characteristics of SEs in Swedish-speaking regions. The research data consist of statistical and other background data, a survey and strategy documents. The study shows that SEs do not appear to be more common in the Swedish-speaking regions, despite positive preconditions for SEs and their operations in those regions. At the same time, Finnish SEs still appear to face similar challenges in, for instance, their funding and management, and general prejudice and ignorance about SEs. © 2019 Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to investigate how intergroup relation moderates group bias in Third-Party Punishment (TPP) of selfishness. Participants competed or cooperated with the other group and then performed a TPP task in which they could reduce an allocator's benefits after paying a low cost (paying 1/3 unit deducts 1 unit of the allocator in Experiment 1, n = 76) or a high cost (paying 1 unit deducts 1 unit of the allocator in Experiment 2, n = 81). The results supported the “mere-preference hypothesis” of group bias, showing that people were more likely to tolerate their ingroups while punishing outgroups more harshly. Furthermore, when the cost was low, competition increased people's punishment toward outgroups' selfishness but not toward ingroup members, thus enlarging the group bias. When the cost was high, however, this effect disappeared, indicating that people consider a “cost-to-impact ratio” when selectively enforcing the fairness norm in intergroup conflicts. Our findings suggest how intergroup relation and cost-benefit analysis interact together to influence the group bias in TPP, providing insights into mechanisms underlying the maintenance of fairness norms and decision-making in a group context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study explores perceptions and awareness of disproportionate minority contact (DMC) by stakeholders in juvenile justice, youth-serving community organizations, schools, social services, and the faith community. This study is derived from a statewide assessment, which included in-person interviews with individuals that have personal and professional relationships within the juvenile justice system. Findings support the contention that individuals are either unaware of the prevalence of DMC, have already formed prejudices about minority youth within the system, or do not appreciate the degree of importance DMC has on the development of minority youth. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Infertility, a common experience among women and men worldwide, remains on the margins of public health and medicine in low-resource settings. Previous studies identified associations between individual experiences of infertility and negative outcomes, particularly in contexts where childbearing is imperative, but few have examined broader implications of infertility and infertility-related stigma on communities. To understand the production and impact of infertility-related stigma, this study analyzes 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted with 104 women and men in rural Malawi. FGDs, conducted July–September 2018, were used to elicit the range of community norms around family formation, pregnancy, fertility, and infertility. Data were analyzed through memo-ing during and after data collection and collaborative, thematic coding. We found that stigma manifested within existing systems of gender and power. Aligning with Link and Phelan's stigma framework (2001) there were three primary mechanisms by which infertility-related stigma was produced and reinforced: labeling of a person perceived to be infertile (i.e., establishing ‘other’), perpetuating negative stereotypes associated with suspected causes of infertility (e.g., abortion, multiple sexual partners, weak sperm), and consequences of infertility that reinforced stigma (e.g., social ridicule and distancing, divorce). Labels, presumed causes, and consequences of infertility were entrenched within gender and sexuality norms. Women perceived as infertile were unable to follow a normative path to achieving adult status, presumed to be sexually transgressive, and considered “useless.” Men's masculinity was questioned. Both women's and men's identities, as well as social positions within relationships and communities, were threatened by perceptions of infertility. Ultimately, the manifestation of infertility-related stigma contributed to an environment wherein the risk of being perceived as infertile was highly consequential and unrelenting. Pervasive stigma, at the community-level, impacts decisions around contraceptive use and timing of childbearing, as women and men not only wanted to avoid infertility, but also the appearance of infertility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article deploys insights from Michael Young’s 1958 satire The Rise of the Meritocracy to challenge the dominant ideology of meritocracy in contemporary British society. It draws on ethnographic research in schools over a twenty-five year period to illustrate the damage the illusion of meritocracy inflicts on children and young people, but particularly those from working class backgrounds. It argues that the consequences of the pretence of meritocracy are to be found in everyday practices of testing, hyper-competition and setting, and beyond the classroom in the designation of predominantly working class schools as ‘rubbish schools for rubbish learners’. It concludes that, beyond the negative consequences for working class learners, there are wider consequences for British society, exacerbating social divisions and encouraging the growth of distrust, prejudice, envy, resentment, and contempt between different social groups. © 2020 Political Quarterly Publishing Co (PQPC)

AB  - People with obesity commonly face a pervasive, resilient form of social stigma. They are often subject to discrimination in the workplace as well as in educational and healthcare settings. Research indicates that weight stigma can cause physical and psychological harm, and that affected individuals are less likely to receive adequate care. For these reasons, weight stigma damages health, undermines human and social rights, and is unacceptable in modern societies. To inform healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public about this issue, a multidisciplinary group of international experts, including representatives of scientific organizations, reviewed available evidence on the causes and harms of weight stigma and, using a modified Delphi process, developed a joint consensus statement with recommendations to eliminate weight bias. Academic institutions, professional organizations, media, public-health authorities, and governments should encourage education about weight stigma to facilitate a new public narrative about obesity, coherent with modern scientific knowledge. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To examine outcomes in a 4-year college pilot program built on stigma change research. U Bring Change to Mind (UBC2M) was developed and launched at Indiana University (IU) in 2014 as an institutionally supported, student-led organization to make campuses “safe and stigma-free zones.” The accompanying College Toolbox Project (CTP) assessed change in student prejudice and discriminatory predispositions as well as perceptions and behaviors at follow-up. Method: All entering Class of 2019 students were invited to complete a Web-based survey (N = 3,287; response rate = 44.6%). In their third year, students were sent a follow-up survey. Stigma indicators for 1,132 students completing both waves were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regressions. Models controlled for social desirability, prior contact, socio-demographics, and self-reported mental illness. Participation was examined for potential biases. Results: Statistically significant positive changes in attitudes and behavioral predispositions emerged. Although fewer students with prior contact endorsed stigma items initially, they reported significant reduction at follow-up. UBC2M active engagement was associated with lowering prejudice. Both passive and active engagement predicted change in discriminatory predispositions as well as current inclusive behaviors and positive perceptions of campus mental health culture. Conclusion: A long-term, community-based, student empowerment approach with institutional supports is a promising avenue to reduce stigma on college campuses, to develop the next generation of mental health leaders, and to potentially reduce societal levels of stigma in the long run. CTP provides evidence that both contact and contextual visibility matter, and that UBC2M offers a nationally networked organizational strategy to reduce stigma. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to educate the school staff for a correct management of epileptic seizures in order to increase the safety of young people at school and promoting the administration of rescue drugs and in order to improve care and reduce improper calls to the health emergency number. Methods: This project started in January 2016, and it is still ongoing at the Department of Neuroscience of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome, Italy. There has been a data cut-off evaluation in November 2018. Two-hour training meetings with the school staff have been organized. The major topics of the training activities were as follows: report what epilepsy is, how to manage students with epileptic seizures, and how to administer rescue medications. During the meetings, the following two questionnaires were administered: one pretest in order to collect personal information and information on awareness of epilepsy, willingness to administer rescue medications, and anxiety in facing a seizure; and one posttest in order to check the knowledge acquired after the training sessions. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.R-project.org/). Demographics (sex and age) and teaching experience were summarized with descriptive statistics for each variable. Demographics, teaching experience, awareness of disability, and knowledge of epilepsy were correlated to the management of seizures occurring in the classroom before the course; results are reported as odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence interval (95 CI). Results: Nine hundred school staff members (95% school staff and 5% social workers) entered in the project between January 2016 and November 2018. Seven hundred and forty (82%) returned the questionnaires fulfilled, and not all of them were completely filled. Ninety-eight percent of school staff (676/691) were aware about epilepsy; however, only in 16% (110) the awareness of epilepsy came from medical staff, scientific brochures, or participation in conventions. Thirty-five percent of school staff (248/707) believed that epilepsy reduces learning abilities, and 58% (409/703) believed that children with epilepsy need school support. After the training, 68% of school staff (496/734) correctly filled in the questionnaire related to the management of acute seizures versus 8% of them (57/718) in the prequestionnaire. After the training, 89% of school staff (601/675) were ready to administer rescue medications versus 54% (384/712) before the training. The majority of participants reported that the level of anxiety related to the management of seizures after the training significantly reduced. Conclusions: Results of this project documented an increase in knowledge of epilepsy, a better knowledge on management of acute seizures in the school settings, a reduction in anxiety, and an increase in willingness to administer rescue medications. Further studies should be planned in order to document the changes in the real-world management of seizures, to evaluate if a reduction in hospital admittances might be reached, and to extend the project by assessing, through a questionnaire, the stigma and prejudices against the children affected by epilepsy by their classmates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aims: Driven by the literature on pluralistic ignorance, our research investigates fear of appearing racist, being rejected, discriminated, and disinterest in intergroup contact as antecedents of contact and outgroup attitudes, focusing on attributional differences between the majority and minority group perspectives. Methods: Questionnaires were distributed in schools in Northern Italy. Participants were 400 Italian and 141 immigrant high-school students. Results: The results showed that the lack of interest in contact was the strongest predictor of contact for the majority group. For the minority group, fear of rejection emerged as the strongest predictor. The majority group attributed the minority to avoid contact most strongly due to the fear that they would be rejected, and the minority group perceived it was due to the majority not being interested in contact. Conclusion: Our research contributes to understanding the divergent concerns the majority and minority groups have in relation to intergroup contact and discusses the importance of tackling these concerns. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Semmelweis reflex is a human behavioral tendency to stick to preexisting beliefs and to reject fresh ideas that contradict them (despite adequate evidence). We aim to familiarize the readers with the term that not only has a significant historical background but also grave clinical implications. Methods: A keyword search for “Semmelweis reflex,” “Belief perseverance,” “handwashing,” and “Idea rejection” was conducted using PubMed Central, MEDLINE, and Google SCHOLAR. Literature published in paper-based journals and books was also searched. All manuscripts pertaining to these keywords were thoroughly analyzed for this review. Results: The first section of our paper briefs the story of Ignaz Semmelweis and brushes on the contributions of other intellectual researchers that were rebuffed initially. The discussion further explains the root cause of this dismissal, an inherent bias against uncertainty that may be at the core of our fear for new ideas. Finally, this review explores the means by which we can prevent ourselves from being a victim of rejection. Conclusions: The age-old prejudice that is Semmelweis reflex is explored in this review. With careful and thorough study design, scientific rigor, and critical self-analysis of the manuscript, one can avoid being victimized by this reflex. The dual edged nature of this reflex lays unveiled when its importance is highlighted in the prematurely accepted medical failures. Understanding that any new idea goes through the grill of being critically analyzed and perceived encourages the scientist to hold on to the original thought as it may rather be practice changing. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Extensive research on racial contexts suggests that white Americans living near black Americans adopt more negative racial attitudes. Theoretically, local intergroup exposure has been conceptualized as acting contemporaneously through various mechanisms. However, a separate body of research on political socialization indicates that adolescent experiences are often especially influential. We hypothesize that whites’ racial contexts during adolescence produce prejudiced responses. We then test this hypothesis using two complementary data sets, a population-based panel conducted 2007-13 and the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Survey (1965-97). Our analyses demonstrate the enduring influence of adolescent contexts at larger levels of aggregation: While the racial composition of whites’ current counties is not a consistent predictor of racial prejudice, the racial composition of their county during high school is. Proximity during one’s formative years increases racial prejudice years later, providing new insights about local contextual effects and the roots of racial prejudice. © 2020 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - This article introduces a model of the internalisation of normative social harmdoing: the MINSOH. This model seeks to explain how group members internalise harmful social norms such that they personally endorse their groups' normative actions. To this aim, the MINSOH integrates two divergent yet complementary theoretical perspectives: self-determination theory and the social identity approach. These perspectives differ in their basic assumptions about the possibility for harm to become internalised, yet when integrated, they provide a powerful account of how harmdoing can become internalised. The MINSOH proposes specific conditions under which harmful normative actions become accepted by group members. This article outlines multiple self-determined motivations for harmdoing and discrete group processes that enable harmdoing to be internalised and autonomously enacted, and reviews factors that facilitate (i.e., strong/unique/comparative social identification; endorsement of ideological justifications) and block the internalisation process (presence of multiple identities/diverging norms; inclusive superordinate identity). Directions for future research are then discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Guided by the early findings of social scientists, practitioners have long advocated for greater contact between groups to reduce prejudice and increase social cohesion. Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size—and at times, direction—of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change—willingness to work in solidarity— that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Violence between police and young black men is a longstanding issue that has gained national attention in recent years due to high-profile violent encounters. We conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from different groups (young black men aged 14–24 years, parents, educators, police officers, and staff in youth serving organizations). Stakeholders were asked to (1) identify causes of violent encounters between police and young black men; (2) describe police officers who serve in their communities; and (3) describe interactions between police and young black men. Data were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis and content analysis methods. All stakeholder groups except police felt that violent encounters between police and young black men were caused by officers lacking a connection with communities. Fear and distrust across stakeholder groups was also seen as a cause of violent encounters; youth feared police after having seen or heard of violent encounters, while officers feared youth due to the availability of firearms and previous assaults on officers. Several stakeholder groups recognized that racism and prejudice among police was another cause of violence between police and young black men. Positive interactions between police and youth were seen as the result of established, trusting relationships developed over time. Future efforts to prevent violent encounters between police and young black men should engage multiple stakeholder groups. One avenue for engagement is through community mobilization efforts that foster collaboration, build community trust, and encourage implementation of policies, programs, and practices that prevent future violent encounters. © 2020, The New York Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Female aggression against outgroup conspecifics is an important aspect of intergroup relationships among female primates. Intense aggression from resident females toward immigrant females suggests that the costs of intrasexual competition outweigh the benefits of group living and has been reported in some species with female transfer. In bonobos (Pan paniscus), however, immigrant females are likely to integrate smoothly into an unfamiliar group through affiliative interactions with specific older females. We hypothesized that older resident females gain an indirect benefit from female immigration by increased mating opportunities for their philopatric sons. We examined the effects of 1) age and tenure and 2) the presence of adolescent or adult sons on the probability of aggression by resident females against immigrant females. We collected 73 instances of dyadic agonistic interactions between 14 female bonobos at Wamba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, for five different periods between November 2014 and June 2018, which included four immigrant females with a group tenure of <2.5 years. The female dominance hierarchy correlated with age and tenure, the slope of the hierarchy was weak but statistically significant, and the hierarchy was not linear. We found that the rate of aggression against immigrant females decreased with age in resident females but was unrelated to the presence of mature sons. Our findings suggest that the cost imposed by female immigration varies among resident females, and that social tolerance to immigrant females may be associated with low feeding competition rather than any future benefits. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We investigated whether existing intergroup contact experiences moderated the associations between prejudicial attitudes and behavioral tendencies towards outgroups across five studies in Turkey (total N = 1,281). Findings showed that among Turks who reported higher levels of cross-group friendship quantity (Study 1) and greater positive (but not negative) contact (Study 2) with Kurds, prejudicial attitudes did not predict negative outgroup behavioral tendencies. Confirming these studies, Study 3 indicated that the association between homophobic attitudes and outgroup avoidance/approach tendencies was weaker among individuals who reported more LGBTI friends. Study 4 replicated the latter finding among children using Syrians as the target outgroup. Study 5 further showed that the buffering role of intergroup contact occurred only among participants who held less certain attitudes towards Syrian refugees. Findings provide insights into how existing contact experiences shape the relationship between negative attitudes towards outgroups and relevant behavioral intentions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In a secularizing world, religious groups are increasingly threatened by anti-religious groups. We present two studies investigating religious peoples’ responses to anti-religious threats. We expected intergroup threats to shape group-based emotions and behavioural intentions through a novel pathway whereby threat affects group-based meta-emotions: the ingroup’s perception of the outgroup’s emotions towards the ingroup. In Study 1, we experimentally manipulated threat and group salience with participants from two different cultures (British and Latinx/Hispanic). Study 1 demonstrated non-interactive effects of threat increasing negative emotional responses and of group salience strengthening emotional responses. The results illustrated the role of group-based meta-emotions in predicting outgroup-directed emotions and behavioural response intentions. Study 2 used a different manipulation of threat in an American sample and an identity-based manipulation of salience to assess the impact of real-world anti-religious campaigns involving symbolic and realistic threats. Both threat types increased negative group-based meta-emotions, negative outgroup-directed emotions, desire to respond, and opposition to the anti-religious campaign compared to no threat. Overall, religious identity salience had little impact on outcomes. The indirect pathway through meta-emotion replicated, suggesting the importance of considering this novel meta-emotion pathway in intergroup relations. © 2019 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Numerous studies in the United States, as well as a smaller number of studies in other Westernized countries, have linked racial and ethnic attitudes to support for more punitive forms of crime control. The current study explores this relationship in Israel by assessing whether the degree to which Israeli Jews typify crime as an Israeli Arab phenomenon and/or resent Israeli Arabs is related to support for punitive criminal justice policies. The findings suggest that ethnic typification and resentment are related to general punitive attitudes, whereas ethnic apathy and resentment are related to greater support for the death penalty. Also, the relationship between ethnic typification and punitiveness is stronger among those who are less resentful. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Since the British ‘Brexit referendum’ in 2016, tensions between ‘leave’ and ‘remain’ voters have been growing. Using a novel analytical approach based on the full distribution of responses rather than their arithmetic means, Study 1 (N = 1,506) showed on average 90% of overlap among Leavers and Remainers across a range of important variables. Even on the variables that are commonly used to illustrate how Leavers and Remainers differ (e.g., prejudice against immigrants), the amount of overlap was larger than 50%. In Study 2 (N = 206), we demonstrate the importance of focusing on similarities between groups: Presenting the full distribution of responses from Leavers and Remainers rather than their mean differences caused more accurate perceptions of the actual differences and similarities between both groups and higher perceived intergroup harmony. We conclude that similarities between Leavers and Remainers are substantial and that our proposed approach may help to de-escalate tensions between these and other groups. © 2019 The British Psychological Society

AB  - The aim of present study was to explore relationships between experienced and anticipated discrimination, internalized stigma, and empowerment among people with physical disabilities in Serbia. The convenience sample consisted of persons with different types of physical disabilities. The following scales were administrated: The Discrimination and Stigma Scale, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, and the Boston University Empowerment Scale. An analysis showed that internalized stigma was correlated with experienced and anticipated discrimination and empowerment, while no correlation was found between empowerment and discrimination. People with physical disabilities who experienced and anticipated discrimination are at higher risk of reporting internalized stigma. © 2019 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Women with disabilities are more vulnerable to violence, including intimate partner violence (IPV), yet the majority of emerging IPV prevention programs fail to explicitly consider the needs of participants with disabilities. Women and men living with disabilities engaged with IPV prevention programs in four countries were interviewed to explore how disability shaped their experiences of gender, violence, IPV, and whether the programs met their disability related needs. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 women and 15 men living with disabilities in Ghana, Rwanda, Tajikistan and South Africa. The data were analysed thematically and compared across the settings. Participants described experiencing disability-related stigma, discrimination, exclusion, and for women, increased vulnerability to IPV. Barriers to full participation in programs included limited accessibility, and lack of disability-specific materials, recruitment or outreach. Enablers of inclusion included recruitment and monitoring strategies aimed at people with disabilities, partnering with a local disabled people's organization, training staff in disability inclusion, and raising awareness of disability rights. The data encouragingly suggests that inclusion of women and men with disabilities in IPV prevention programs designed for the general population has beneficial outcomes. Inclusion can prevent violence, promote their wellbeing, support economic empowerment, and challenge disability-related stigma and discrimination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The internationalization of academic production has changed the publishing culture in all corners of the world with increasing participation of scholars from semi-peripheral countries in international journals (Belcher, 2007). While there has been growing interest in how multilingual scholars see this internationalization process, little is known about Brazil. To address this gap, a survey was distributed to scholars (N = 290) from different research fields in this country. The analysis of the data revealed important disciplinary differences, suggesting the existence of a peripheral group of scholars inside this semi-peripheral country. The scholars from the exact and biological sciences reported that they publish in English much more frequently than Portuguese, and few reported language-related issues. They contested the existence of a nativeness bias, although some perceived prejudice against Latin-American research. Scholars from the humanities and the social sciences publish substantially less in international journals, reporting challenges particularly with language. Overall, the data suggest that international publication has become part of the disciplinary culture in Brazil in the hard sciences while the humanities and the social sciences seem to remain in a peripheral position. This appears to be particularly true for disciplines such as education and language and literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent research shows that self-respect (defined as seeing yourself as a person with equal rights) predicts assertive but not aggressive responses to injustice in interpersonal contexts. The present research focuses on the antecedents of self-respect and its consequences for collective action tendencies among members of disadvantaged groups. Across three studies (N = 227, N = 454, N = 131) using different contexts and samples (discrimination of Muslims in Germany; women regarding gender inequality), experiences with equality-based respect (defined as being treated as someone of equal worth) predicted self-respect. Moreover, across all three studies, self-respect predicted intentions for cooperative or normative but not support for hostile or non-normative protest. The results demonstrate the potential of self-respect for facilitating collective action in the face of injustice while still enabling positive intergroup relations. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Access to and engagement with social services among women who trade sex is essential to address issues including substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder, and housing instability. This grounded theory study aims to understand how adult women who trade sex accessed and engaged with social services. Drawing from semistructured, in-depth interviews with 30 mostly Black and White women, results suggest that women’s differing viewpoints of sex trading and experiences of racial prejudice impacted their access and engagement with services. Women’s experiences ranged from affirmed to disrespected, which influenced whether and how they chose to continue seeking services. Implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - What is known on the subject?: The Psychiatric/Mental Health Clinical Placement Survey preplacement, validated in English and widely used, assesses nursing student attitudes towards the mental health field. There are no validated scales in Spanish to assess students' attitudes towards mental health, nor is there evidence of attitudes in Spanish students. What does this article add to existing knowledge?: The present study was the first to address the validity of a scale which evaluates nursing student attitudes towards mental health issues, in Spanish. Until now, no knowledge was available on nursing student attitudes towards mental health issues in the Spanish context. What are the implications for practice?: The results provide faculty professors with a validated tool to use to assess attitudinal changes in students, following theoretical and practical training in mental health. To have an up-to-date perspective on student attitudes towards both the field of mental health and people with severe mental illness, thereby providing the opportunity to focus on those aspects requiring improvement. Abstract Introduction The encouragement of positive attitudes towards mental health is necessary in order to improve the quality of healthcare assistance. The attitudes of nursing students towards mental health are unknown, and there are no validated scales for their assessment. Aims To adapt the Psychiatric/Mental Health Clinical Placement Survey (PMHCPS) to Spanish and examine its psychometric properties; to describe the attitudes of nursing students towards the mental health field. Method Confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA), internal consistency and construct validity were performed. An assessment of the students' attitudes was also conducted. Results The CFA showed appropriate fit, and total internal consistency was adequate. With regard to construct validity, knowledge was associated with practicum mark. The students achieved above mid-range scores for all subscales, except negative stereotypes. Gender differences were observed. Discussion The PMHCPS, translated to Spanish, enables the students' attitude towards the mental health field to be assessed, thus identifying those areas of student attitudes and competencies requiring improvement. Implications for practice To provide Spanish nursing faculties with access to a scale, with which to assess changes in student attitudes. The assessment results may then be utilized to formulate teaching methods in order to improve the quality of health care the students might provide as future nursing professionals. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Despite growing evidence that racial-ethnic discrimination has a critical impact on college students of color, there is a shortage of longitudinal studies investigating such discrimination across the course of students’ college careers. The present study examined trajectories of professor- and peer-perpetrated ethnic-racial discrimination across the first three years in college and the correlations between these trajectories and academic, psychological, and physical adjustment outcomes during students’ fourth year in a sample of 770 Black, 835 Asian American, and 742 Latino college students (total n = 2347; 60.1% female) at elite colleges and universities in the United States. Latent growth modeling revealed stability in reported peer discrimination over the first three years of college and an increase in reported discrimination from professors. Discrimination from peers and professors equally predicted unfavorable grades, a lower likelihood of on-time graduation, and less school satisfaction. Perceived discrimination from peers (but not from professors) during students’ first year predicted higher rates of depressive symptoms and more health problems in their fourth year. Although initial levels and trajectories of discrimination varied as a function of students’ ethnicity-race, the correlates between discrimination and adjustment outcomes did not vary between ethnic-racial groups. The present findings suggest that ethnic-racial discrimination is a complex, ecologically-based stressor that presents a constellation of challenges for students of color attending elite colleges and universities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Since 2014, the refugee crisis has launched a political shockwave across Europe, with consequences for the European Union, the Schengen Zone, and national politics. Within this context, we investigated how public statements about the refugee crisis are received. While debate and criticism are hallmarks of a democratic society, research demonstrates that people respond more negatively to criticism about their group from an outsider compared with an insider. But does this reflect a protective bias in favour of one’s own group, or a more principled position against criticism from outsiders independently of one’s own group membership? In three experimental studies, people apply the principle of preferring internal over external criticism, even to the point of penalizing in-group members who criticized outgroups. This preference for internal over external criticism is guided by perceptions that internal critics are more constructive and more expert than external critics. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In an era of seemingly intense populist politics, a variety of issues of intergroup prejudice, discrimination, and conflict have moved center stage in much of the industrialized world. Among these is “political correctness” and, in particular, what constitutes a legitimate discourse of political and social conflict and opposition. Yet the meaning of legitimate discourse is being turned on its head as some disparaged groups seek to reclaim, or reappropriate, slurs directed against them. Using as a context a U.S. Supreme Court case about whether “The Slants”—a band named after a traditional slur against Asians—can trademark its name, we test several hypotheses about reappropriation processes based on a nationally representative sample with an oversample of East Asian Americans and several survey experiments. We find that motives attributions influence how people understand and evaluate potentially disparaging words. In particular, when reappropriation motives are perceived, insulting words are judged to be less insulting. In this sense, uncivil discourse can to some degree be tamed. © 2019 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Schizophrenia affects more than eight million people in China. Stigmatization of schizophrenia may prevent family members and close others from providing social support to those with schizophrenia. This article aims to investigate the potential use of a biogenetic approach to reduce the stigma of schizophrenia using a cross-sectional (study 1, n = 141) and an experimental design (study 2, n = 100) in China. In the first study, mediation analysis reveals that perceived affiliate stigma, the negative prejudice, and discrimination towards family members of individuals with socially stigmatized identities due to their affiliation with the person mediates the path between biogenetic beliefs and desire for social distance. This pattern is replicated in study 2 in which two 10-min lectures were created and used to influence participants’ beliefs in biogenetic causes of schizophrenia. Findings suggest that the biogenetic approach may increase Chinese participants’ desired social distance towards their family members with schizophrenia through increasing their concerns about the negative consequences of being affiliated with the family member. Therefore, future research should investigate aspects of biogenetic anti-stigma campaigns that do not increase participants’ perception of affiliate stigma in China. © 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.

AB  - Prior work has established that nonverbal signals that capitalize on existing cultural biases can shift attitudes toward members of familiar social groups (e.g., racial minority group members). This research is the first to examine whether nonverbal signals can influence adults’ attitudes toward unfamiliar individuals outside the context of existing cultural biases. In a series of studies, we examined whether seeing one individual receive more cold, unfriendly nonverbal signals than another individual would lead to biases in favor of the target of more positive nonverbal signals. Consistent with our preregistered hypotheses, exposure to nonverbal bias in favor of one individual over another led participants to develop nonverbal signal-consistent explicit biases. Moreover, a combined analysis of the data from all four samples indicated that participants also formed nonverbal signal-consistent implicit biases. Taken together, these findings suggest that nonverbal signals have the potential to create and spread attitudes toward others. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This study investigated diabetes management processes among young adults with type 1 diabetes applying the grounded theory method. A total of 15 young adults, with an average age of 29 years, with type 1 diabetes were selected through theoretical sampling between November 2016 and October 2018. Data collected through in-depth interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The core category of this study was defined as “living in a standardized frame.” Participants managed diabetes through the trial-and-error process in addition to selective restriction or selective minimization. They restricted their diet, physical activity, social interactions, and range of thoughts, often following passive and avoidant strategies. Consequently, nurses are in a critical position to assist diabetic individuals via support programs and take the lead in mitigating social prejudice. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Negativity toward gay men and transgender people is pervasive. Past research suggests that authoritarianism predicts biases against transgender people, in part due to an essentialist view of gender. To determine the generalizability of these findings, but with political conservatism as the focal predictor, we re-analyzed Norton and Herek’s (2013) large (n = 2281) nationally representative U.S. dataset. In doing so, we modeled a latent factor indicated by anti-transgender attitudes and prejudice toward gay men to capture prejudice toward gender non-conformists. That is, prejudice against transgender people and gay men on the political right might arise from perceived gender norm violations, which binary gender beliefs could potentially explain. Consistent with social dominance theory, results revealed that those more conservative in ideology were more likely to display prejudice toward gender non-conformists in part due to their greater endorsement of binary gender beliefs. Unexpectedly, and novel to the existing literature, conservatism predicted binary gender beliefs and prejudice toward gender non-conformists more strongly for women than for men. Binary gender beliefs seemingly function as a legitimizing myth to bolster existing hierarchical relations between gender conforming versus gender non-conforming people, particularly among conservative women. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Racial prejudice is a pervasive and pernicious form of intergroup bias. However, a mounting number of studies show that recategorization—even into minimal groups—can overcome the typical consequences of racial and other group classifications. We tested the effects of minimal grouping on implicit prejudice and infrahumanization using a paradigm in which race was orthogonal to group membership. This allowed us to examine whether knowledge of group membership overrides obvious category differences. We found that participants infrahumanized and showed implicit bias toward the minimal outgroup, despite the cross-cutting presence of race, and in fact did not show any of the usual implicit racial bias. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs) showed an early race effect followed by distinct reactions on the basis of group as processing continued. This is evidence that arbitrary social classifications can engender ingroup preference even in the presence of orthogonal, visually salient categorizations. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective: Across a correlational cross-sectional and experimental study, we investigate how contextual variables, such as majority group perceptions, interact with individual variables, such as the relationship between ethnic and national identity, to ultimately influence intergroup relations between bicultural individuals and White Americans. Method: Across 2 studies (Study 1, n = 187; Study 2, n = 176), bicultural participants completed a battery of surveys measuring bicultural identity integration, impressions of majority group attitudes, and behavioral intentions targeted at majority group members. Additionally, majority group attitudes were experimentally manipulated in Study 2. Results: Individuals with integrated bicultural identities were more likely to approach and less likely to avoid majority members. Although perceptions of negative majority group attitudes are typically associated with negative intergroup relations, individuals with greater harmony (Study 1) and blendedness (Study 2) between their ethnic and national identities were buffered from these adverse effects. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of both individual and contextual factors in intergroup relations. The distinct effects of blendedness and harmony across self-report and experimental studies have theoretical and practical implications for our understanding of bicultural identity integration. Finally, implications for encouraging more positive intercultural relationships between majority and minority group members will be discussed. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine the relationships between perceived weight stigma, eating disturbances, and emotional distress across individuals with different self-perceived weight status. Methods: University students from Hong Kong (n = 400) and Taiwan (n = 307) participated in this study and completed several questionnaires: Perceived Weight Stigma questionnaire; Three-factor Eating Questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Each participant self-reported their height, weight, and self-perceived weight status. Results: After controlling for demographics, perceived weight stigma was associated with eating disturbances (β = 0.223, p < 0.001), depression (β = 0.143, p < 0.001), and anxiety (β = 0.193, p < 0.001); and eating disturbances was associated with depression (β = 0.147, p < 0.001) and anxiety (β = 0.300, p < 0.001) in the whole sample. Additionally, eating disturbances mediated the association between perceived weight stigma and emotional distress. Similar findings were shown in the subsamples who perceived themselves as higher weight or normal weight and in the male and female subsamples. However, in the subsamples who perceived themselves as lower weight, only the links between eating disturbances and emotional distress were significant. Conclusion: Perceived weight stigma was associated with eating disturbances and emotional distress in young adults with both higher and normal weight. Eating disturbances were associated with emotional distress regardless of participants’ weight status. Level of evidence: Level V, cross-sectional descriptive study. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Two studies assessed the nature of parental communication about the trauma of Indian Residential Schools (IRSs) in relation to the psychological distress of their adult offspring, and whether the link between parental communication and distress was mediated by offsprings’ greater awareness of collective discrimination or sense of pride in cultural identity. In Study 1, an online survey of Indigenous participants from across Canada (N = 498) demonstrated a curvilinear relation between the extent to which parents talked about their negative IRS experiences and the severity of depressive symptoms among offspring, among whom symptoms were particularly pronounced with more frequent communication. This relation was mediated by greater perceived discrimination. A similar, but inverse, association was found when parental communications conveyed positive construals of their IRS experiences. Study 2 (N = 134) further demonstrated an association between direct communications from IRS survivors and offspring wellbeing in that, either the absence of, or especially frequent communications were related to more severe depressive symptoms among offspring. However, hearing about parental IRS experiences from someone other than the parent was not related to offsprings’ depressive symptoms. Qualitative analyses indicated that direct communications from parents tended to provide excessive detail, whereas parental silence was associated with speculation and feelings of isolation or resentment among offspring of IRS survivors. Taken together, the results suggest that either insufficient or excessive parental communication about trauma might undermine offspring wellbeing, whereas moderate levels of communication that provide positive meaning and promote cultural pride or diminish perceptions of personal discrimination could be beneficial. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A significant body of knowledge exists around the role of intergroup relations in sport for development and peace (SFDP). However, while numerous SFDP researchers have investigated overt conflict, scholars have typically overlooked the varied nature of intergroup relations in comparatively stable SFDP environments. In addressing that issue, the authors explore intergroup relations in the context of Fiji, a country which in recent years has moved from a society characterized by the politics of coup d'état to democratic government and relatively peaceful social relations. That said, Fiji has long been shaped by a fundamental cultural divide between Indigenous Fijians (iTaukei) and Fijians of Indian ancestry (Indo-Fijians): this is reflected in the de facto separatism between these groups in relation to their role in rugby union and Association football (soccer). The authors present a qualitative framework—the Intergroup Relations Continuum (IRC)—by which to map intergroup relations as they apply in Fiji according to identity, ethnicity and sport. While the IRC is applied here in a Fijian context, the model is intended to be generalizable, aiming to provide a practical instrument for researchers, sport managers, policymakers and local stakeholders. The goal is to allow them to visually illustrate group affinities, rivalries, and sensibilities in terms of collective relationships that characterize sport and society. © 2019

AB  - The role of prejudice in second-language acquisition has received little attention but may be related to an individual’s motivation to learn another language. For instance, learners who express high Social Dominance Orientation or Right-Wing Authoritarianism, constructs reflective of prejudice and worldviews that endorse hostility towards or fear of outgroup members, may be less motivated to learn a second language. Moreover, increased Social Dominance Orientation and/or Right-Wing Authoritarianism scores may be associated with reduced motivation to learn a second language due to the impact of prejudice on Integrativeness, which is the extent to which a person has an interest in learning a second language and in interacting with members who speak that second language. The current study sought to test these associations with a sample of 110 college participants learning French as a second language in a bilingual institution. Integrativeness was found to fully mediate the relations between Social Dominance Orientation, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, and Motivation to learn a second language. Results suggest the importance of examining the role of prejudice in second-language acquisition. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study addressed the lack of research simultaneously examining multiple dimensions of religiousness when predicting rape myth acceptance, and extended prior findings of a mediating role for right-wing authoritarianism (i.e., uncritical submission to authority and aggressive attitude toward those who do not conform to social norms) in the association between religiousness and prejudice. The sample consisted of 99 undergraduate and graduate students (M age = 31.87 years, 66.7% female, 80.82% White, and 93% Christian affiliated) from a religiously affiliated university in the Midwest United States. As hypothesized, dimensions of religiousness exhibited differential associations with rape myth acceptance. Religious motivation characterized by openness and exploration (i.e., quest religiousness) was a significant negative predictor of rape myth acceptance, directly, and indirectly through right-wing authoritarianism. In contrast, rigid adherence to religious beliefs, assumed to be “right” and absolutely true (i.e., religious fundamentalism), and extrinsically motivated religiousness each exhibited a positive association with rape myth acceptance through right-wing authoritarianism. In addition, internally motivated religiousness and religious fundamentalism each moderated the nonlinear effect for quest predicting rape myth acceptance. Findings suggest that uncritical religious and secular submission to external authorities or uncommitted and nonexploring religiousness may have increased the extent to which persons adhered to rape myths, whereas religious exploration was protective. Practical implications center on the need for socioculturally relevant prevention and intervention efforts with religious identifying college students. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic started in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China and was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11th March, 2020. Till 16th March more than 169,000 cases were reported and over 140 countries were affected. The major outbreak was in China, South Korea, Iran and Europe. 6,500 people already died and more than 76,000 have recovered from the disease. The purpose of study is to focus on present situation of COVID – 19 and its societal impact on international community. Strong measures were taken to reduce outbreak: personal precautionary measures: using face-masks, hand hygiene and self-quarantine; environmental measures: as surface cleaning and community measures: closing of schools and colleges for social distancing, cancelling large gatherings and participation in public events. In Wuhan, central authorities implemented ban on transportation on 23 January. Due to coronavirus outbreak, xenophobia, heightened prejudice, racism and cases of suspicion, fear and hostility have been reported by Chinese people in many countries, such as North America, Europe and Asia Pacific region. Another major impact of disease outbreak is cancellation of major events in film industry, sports and other industries. Many concerts, music festivals, fashion shows and conferences were cancelled or postponed. Governments have closed temporarily all schools, country wide to limit the spread of coronavirus and as on 14 March, approximately 420 million children are not attending school. Several instance of essential goods supply shortage, panic buying, logistic operations, increased usage of personal hygiene equipment occurred due to coronavirus outbreak. There are almost 91,000 active cases in 73 countries and many restrictions on social and economic activities which has a negative impact on consumer spending and supply chain across the globe. Hence, impact of COVID – 19 will be significant. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Background: Sexual minority men remain highly impacted by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with social stress being a clear predictor of their risk for infection. The past several decades of stress research regarding sexual minority men's HIV-risk behaviors has almost exclusively focused on the influence of stress emanating from outside the gay community (e.g., stigma-related stress, or minority stress, such as heterosexist discrimination). However, recent evidence suggests that sexual minority men also face stress from within their own communities. Purpose: We sought to examine whether stress from within the gay community, or intraminority gay community stress, might influence sexual minority men's risk behaviors, including HIV-risk behaviors, over-and-above more commonly examined stressors affecting this risk. Methods: We tested whether intraminority gay community stress was associated with sexual minority men's HIV-risk behaviors in a large national survey of sexual minority men (Study 1), and experimentally tested intraminority gay community stress's impact on behavioral risk-taking and attitudes toward condom use (Study 2). Results: Self-reported exposure to intraminority gay community stress was positively associated with HIV-risk behaviors when accounting for the effects of several commonly examined minority stressors and general life stress (Study 1). Participants who were rejected from an online group of other sexual minority men evidenced greater risk-taking in a subsequent task and reported fewer benefits of condom use than participants who were accepted by the online group, when accounting for state affect (Study 2). Conclusions: Sexual minority men's experiences of stress and rejection stemming from their own community may be an important and overlooked predictor of HIV infection and transmission. © 2020 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - Background: Racial bias in medical care is a significant public health issue, with increased focus on microaggressions and the quality of patient-provider interactions. Innovations in training interventions are needed to decrease microaggressions and improve provider communication and rapport with patients of color during medical encounters. Methods: This paper presents a pilot randomized trial of an innovative clinical workshop that employed a theoretical model from social and contextual behavioral sciences. The intervention specifically aimed to decrease providers' likelihood of expressing biases and negative stereotypes when interacting with patients of color in racially charged moments, such as when patients discuss past incidents of discrimination. Workshop exercises were informed by research on the importance of mindfulness and interracial contact involving reciprocal exchanges of vulnerability and responsiveness. Twenty-five medical student and recent graduate participants were randomized to a workshop intervention or no intervention. Outcomes were measured via provider self-report and observed changes in targeted provider behaviors. Specifically, two independent, blind teams of coders assessed provider emotional rapport and responsiveness during simulated interracial patient encounters with standardized Black patients who presented specific racial challenges to participants. Results: Greater improvements in observed emotional rapport and responsiveness (indexing fewer microaggressions), improved self-reported explicit attitudes toward minoritized groups, and improved self-reported working alliance and closeness with the Black standardized patients were observed and reported by intervention participants. Conclusions: Medical providers may be more likely to exhibit bias with patients of color in specific racially charged moments during medical encounters. This small-sample pilot study suggests that interventions that directly intervene to help providers improve responding in these moments by incorporating mindfulness and interracial contact may be beneficial in reducing racial health disparities. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The prejudices and stereotypes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are based on contents that highlight the most negative and dramatic aspects of the symptoms of this disease. This is reinforced by the preponderance of negative representations related to AD. In this paper, these representations have been analyzed as frames. The most dominant frame used to represent dementia is “body-mind dualism,” and its alternative is the “body-mind unity” counter-frame. This study aims to define the impact of different messages inspired by the Dualism frame and the Unity counter-frame in the collective representation and meaning given to AD. Posters of simulated health campaigns about AD were designed, combining contents related to the Dualism frame and the Unity counter-frame, and were shown to 85 participants. To analyze the impact of both types of frameworks, a pre-post record of the attitudes of the participants toward AD was conducted using the Attitudes toward Dementia Scale. The assessment of the campaign and the self-report emotions were also registered. Participants’ eye movements were measured during exposure to the posters. Attitudes toward dementia were found to be significantly more positive following exposure to discourses characteristic of the Unity counter-frame. Likewise, the dualism discourse evoked more sadness and anger. Moreover, the posters that used the discourse of the Unity counter-frame were considered more useful. We concluded that attitudes toward dementia are influenced by framing. Designing suitable health campaigns using these frames could help mitigate the attitudes and stigma associated with AD. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Jamaica has been called one of the world’s most anti-gay countries. However, little empirical research has investigated methods of reducing this prejudice. Intergroup contact—(positive) interaction with someone from a different social group—is one of the most widely tested and strongly favored methods of reducing prejudice. However, the role of contact in this specific context is not clear, particularly the relative importance of contact compared to other variables that predict (less) prejudice. This current cross-sectional research investigated that question using a large, representative sample of Jamaican participants (N = 942). As in prior research, contact predicted less anti-gay prejudice, and the (negative) relationship between contact and anti-gay behaviors was mediated by intergroup anxiety and attitudes, even when other important predictors were taken into account. However, contact was a less important predictor than gender, education, or religiosity. Implications for intergroup contact and prejudice-reduction strategies in Jamaica are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study describes the process of developing and validating the Sexual Prejudice in Sport Scale (SPSS), which is a multidimensional instrument developed to assess attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (LG) in sports. The authors conducted two studies: first, to establish the factor structure of the SPSS on 297 heterosexual athletes; and, second, to test the reliability and validity of the resulting 19-item scale on a sample of 311 heterosexual and 160 LG athletes. Exploratory factor analysis of an initial item pool yielded three factors: open rejection, which assesses the blatant prejudice expressed toward LG people; denial of visibility, which evaluates attitude toward the coming out of LG people; and gendering performance, which corresponds to gender stereotypes about performance/skills of LG people. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the SPSS. The authors documented internal consistency, test-retest stability, and convergent/divergent validity. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Election Commission of India proclaimed the results of India's 2019 electoral decision of public on May 23, 2019 for the lower house of the Indian parliament. Bhartiya Janata Party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has won a whopping majority-303 seats, out of 543. Looking into 2014 general election the party won only 282 seats. This indicates that Indian citizens have given a clear mandate to rule once again to Modi by centralized consolidation by a national party, the first since 1984. Past studies have focused on electoral voting behaviour of citizens with a political quotient. However, limited studies are conducted among citizens, especially on Y generation. Following theory of reasoned action, a study was conducted, incorporating variables of attitude and ethnicity on intention to vote, with the moderating effect of social media and gender. The study followed quantitative research method with cross sectional study design to collect data from five locations of Gujarat. A sample size of 1680 voters were considered by applying purposive sampling. PLS-SEM analysis results revealed that attitude and ethnicity relate to voter's behaviour assimilating social media and gender. Implications of the study extends better insight to the politicians, political parties and leaders in understanding the political behaviour of citizens during elections. © 2020 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Social mechanisms explaining Danes’ attitudes to asylum seekers were analysed on two main dimensions: border control and rights allocation, in a national survey of 500 adult respondents in September 2013. Data show that the respondents supported exclusionary practices against asylum seekers much more than exclusion from rights. Three main mechanisms were simultaneously at play in both exclusionary dimensions: perceptions of threat, social distance (prejudice), and perceiving asylum seekers as not “genuine refugees”. Identifying asylum seekers’ as a security and socio-economic threat, as persons not in “real” fear of persecution, together with prejudicial attitudes to them had a boosting effect on excluding asylum seekers from the Danish collective in terms of entry and rights. Findings are discussed in light of existing theories on exclusionary attitudes to asylum seekers. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Research in the area of public stigma and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is limited to examining stigmatic beliefs towards persons aged 65 and over (i.e., persons with late-onset dementia). The aim of the present study was to compare college students' stigmatic attributions towards an older and a younger person with AD, using an attributional model of stigma. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 375 college students (mean age = 25.5, 58.9% female, 64.3% Jewish) who answered a computerized, self-administered, structured questionnaire after being presented with one of two randomly distributed vignettes varying in the age of the person with AD - 80 or 50 years of age. Cognitive, emotional and behavioral attributions of stigma were assessed using an adapted version of the Attribution Questionnaire. Other variables examined included background information, experiences and concerns about developing AD. T-tests and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) hierarchical regressions were used to analyze results. Results: Similar to previous studies, students' levels of dementia stigma were low to moderate. Negative attributions were consistently and significantly higher (β =.17 to.33, p <.01), and positive attributions were significantly lower (β = -.26, p <.01) when the target person was younger rather than older. Conclusion: The differences in stigmatic beliefs towards a younger and older person with AD point to the theoretical and practical importance of clearly stating the age of the target person in stigma studies as well as in programs aimed at reducing public stigma towards persons with AD. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Dialogue can have positive effects for participants, but it is not clear how it affects members of the wider community. This study examines a dialogue project in Prozor-Rama in Bosnia and Herzegovina using survey data from 2012 and 2015. Results show that there is a general positive trend in interethnic relations, however, dialogue in Prozor-Rama had the effect of lowering in-group trust and dampening the increase in civic engagement relative to a control town. This suggests that in the short-term dialogue can have negative effects. They also suggest the need for studies of the long-term effects of dialogue. This study is significant because it moves beyond looking at the effect of interethnic contact on attitudes and prejudice and also examines its effect on social ties, social interaction, and civic participation. © 2019, © 2019 The Editor of Ethnopolitics.

AB  - European countries have witnessed a steady rise of political distrust over the past decades, which coincides with the rise of mass immigration. Building on existing research regarding anti-immigration attitudes and political trust, this study presents two possible theoretical mechanisms through which actual immigration trends could generate political distrust in host societies: either through cultural change or through negative evaluations of institutional performance. To empirically test these, I employ a multi-level comparative longitudinal research design using micro-attitudinal data from the European Social Survey for 17 European countries (2002–16). The results do not find support for the cultural hypothesis, as there is no evidence of an overall relationship between growth in foreign populations and citizen distrust in political institutions. However, there is support for the institutional performance hypothesis, whereby growth in foreign populations is associated with higher political distrust amongst individuals who have anti-immigration attitudes. The implication of these findings is that mass immigration is not the central cause of the decline of political trust Europe, however, it may have been a factor in the growing distrust amongst a relatively small sub-group of citizens. © 2019, © 2019 European Sociological Association.

AB  - Objectives Disability discrimination is linked with poorer well-being cross-sectionally. The aim of this study was to explore prospective associations between disability discrimination and well-being. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting The United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study. Participants Data were from 871 individuals with a self-reported physical, cognitive or sensory disability. Primary outcome measures Depression was assessed in 2009/10. Psychological distress, mental functioning, life satisfaction and self-rated health were assessed in 2009/10 and 2013/14. Results Data were analysed using linear and logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, household income, education, ethnicity and impairment category. Perceived disability discrimination was reported by 117 (13.4%) participants. Cross-sectionally, discrimination was associated with depression (OR=5.40, 95% CI 3.25 to 8.97) fair/poor self-rated health (OR=2.05; 95% CI 1.19 to 3.51), greater psychological distress (B=3.28, 95% CI 2.41 to 4.14), poorer mental functioning (B=-7.35; 95% CI -9.70 to -5.02) and life satisfaction (B=-1.27, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.87). Prospectively, discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress (B=2.88, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.36) and poorer mental functioning (B=-5.12; 95% CI -8.91 to -1.34), adjusting for baseline scores. Conclusions Perceived disability-related discrimination is linked with poorer well-being. These findings underscore the need for interventions to combat disability discrimination. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.

AB  - This paper comes up with a question of self-identity in Meena Kandasamy’s novel when I Hit You: the Portrait of the Writer as a Young Wife, a fiction which provides psychoanalytical framework of sexual abuse with protagonist. This study upsurges a critical discussion on gloomy aspects of sexual violence, marital rapes and how it affects self-identity. Still in twentieth century and Digital India condition of Indian women’ life is made more pathetic by entangling her with enough laws made by patriarchy to sabotage her basic rights of living life with dignity. It is not the story of underprivileged, uneducated and rural women but demolishing dignity and hitting a strong woman like Meena is like a challenge and a conquest Indian husbands. Various ideological, constitutional and philosophical sources will serve as a theoretical framework within which research expands and explores the themes of sexual violence by Intimate Partner (IP) in the novel. Besides, this study throws light on social stigma, prejudice, internal conflicts, multifaceted strains of sexual abuse on women’s body and her suffering soul. This paper concludes with a message that, a journey, where the unnamed protagonist examine her realities and her fight which is going inside her and outside forces which intruded upon her consciousness and conception of selfhood. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - The historic and primarily Latino 2006 immigrant rights protest wave occurred in response to proposed federal anti-immigrant legislation (H.R. 4437). Research on the unprecedented series of demonstrations suggests that the draconian and racialized nature of the bill helps explain why it incited large-scale collective action. Utilising a new survey with a considerable oversample of Latino respondents, the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), this paper investigates the role that collective identities, racialisation, and social networks play in Latino support for contemporary immigrant rights activism. To do so, we incorporate measures such as linked fate, perceptions of anti-immigrant sentiments, knowing undocumented people, and concerns about immigration enforcement policies. The results of our analysis indicate that some of the same factors that influenced Latino engagement in the 2006 mobilisations, such as identity and racialisation, concerns over enforcement, and social networks, continue to impact Latino support for contentious politics on behalf of the foreign-born. We also find evidence that political party and past protest activity, play a significant role in explaining levels of support for activism. Our results have important implications for understanding how anti-immigrant policies and racialized nativism influence Latino support for contentious politics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective To explore the perception of medical students from a private medical college in Perak, Malaysia, on primary care practice and induce the factors influencing their perception and willingness to consider primary care as a career pathway. Design Qualitative study using focus group discussions. Participants' responses were audio recorded, transcribed, grouped under various domains and listed out and analysed. Setting A private medical college in Perak state, Malaysia. Participants Forty-six medical students from years 2 to 5 were included. Eight focus groups were formed with two focus groups from each academic year (six students each in seven groups and four students in one group). Students were informed through their respective student leader of each year and received a participant information sheet and an informed consent form which were completed and returned if they decided to participate in the focus group discussions. Results The participants had different levels of understanding of primary care depending on their level of exposure to primary care. Senior students with more exposure had a better understanding about primary care and its services. Attractive factors towards choosing primary care as a career included short working hours with a more balanced family and social life, being able to treat patients as a whole with continuity of care and closer relationship with patients. Unattractive factors included routine, unchallenging and boring practice, poor salary, work overload and administrative work in government clinics, being less recognised by other specialties; and the poor perception by other doctors that those pursuing primary care were not € brilliant enough' for more € sophisticated disciplines like surgery or paediatrics'. Conclusion This study showed that the medical students' level of exposure to primary care played a crucial role in determining their understanding of primary care practice and their choice of career in primary care. Issues to be addressed include remuneration, workload and the prejudice against primary care as a career pathway. Suggestions included introducing early exposure to fun and challenging primary care postings in the medical curriculum and producing well trained, skilled and enthusiastic role models. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

AB  - Intergroup relations are of crucial importance in contemporary times, with concerns around social representations, social influence and collective action remaining salient. A core aspect of intergroup conflict revolves around the notion of joint projects, whereby different collectives seek to promote their own project through processes of joint intentionality. Nonetheless, we contend that intergroup relations research can tackle the notion of projects more fruitfully by studying the mutual understandings of projects of groups in conflict. Accordingly, we propose an action-oriented reformulation for intergroup relations research, which is contrasted with the standard object-oriented formula. Object-oriented research either (a) emphasizes the study of social objects without regard for their different construal by members of conflicting groups, or (b) focuses on ‘social representations of’ the objects in question, without regard for the projects that such representations serve. Contrastingly, action-oriented research (a) seeks to understand a collective’s ‘social re-presentation for’ a specific project; and (b) studies the social and alternative re-presentation of objects and projects as a systemic product of intergroup relations. We then present illustrative examples of object-oriented research, followed by a study concerning Arab-Maltese relations in Malta as an example of action-oriented research. We end by making recommendations for future research on intergroup relations, with the aim of shedding light on the processes that bind coalitions for collective action. © Copyright © 2020 Buhagiar and Sammut.

AB  - Well-educated and prosperous, Asians are called the “model minority” in the United States. However, they appear disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positions, a problem known as the “bamboo ceiling.” It remains unclear why this problem exists and whether it applies to all Asians or only particular Asian subgroups. To investigate the mechanisms and scope of the problem, we compared the leadership attainment of the two largest Asian subgroups in the United States: East Asians (e.g., Chinese) and South Asians (e.g., Indians). Across nine studies (n = 11,030) using mixed methods (archival analyses of chief executive officers, field surveys in large US companies, student leader nominations and elections, and experiments), East Asians were less likely than South Asians and whites to attain leadership positions, whereas South Asians were more likely than whites to do so. To understand why the bamboo ceiling exists for East Asians but not South Asians, we examined three categories of mechanisms-prejudice (intergroup), motivation (intrapersonal), and assertiveness (interpersonal)-while controlling for demographics (e.g., birth country, English fluency, education, socioeconomic status). Analyses revealed that East Asians faced less prejudice than South Asians and were equally motivated by work and leadership as South Asians. However, East Asians were lower in assertiveness, which consistently mediated the leadership attainment gap between East Asians and South Asians. These results suggest that East Asians hit the bamboo ceiling because their low assertiveness is incongruent with American norms concerning how leaders should communicate. The bamboo ceiling is not an Asian issue, but an issue of cultural fit. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although social cognitive difficulties are common following stroke, the extent to which such difficulties observed in the acute phase are related to long-term socioemotional outcomes remains poorly understood. To address this question empirically, 53 stroke patients completed a measure of Theory of Mind (The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test) and a cognitive flexibility measure that has been related to social cognitive processes (a Reversal Learning Task) at hospital bedside. These participants then completed measures of socioemotional functioning at a 6-month follow-up. Baseline difficulties on the two measures were found to predict distinct types of socioemotional difficulties. The RMET uniquely predicted self-reported depression and loneliness whereas the Reversal Learning task uniquely predicted peer-reported social behavior, specifically social inappropriateness and stereotyping and prejudice. Importantly, a measure of general cognitive function did not explain variance in these outcome measures, suggesting that social cognitive difficulties are linked to poor socioemotional outcomes. By showing for the first time that social cognitive deficits observed acutely post-stroke are related to longer term functional outcomes, these findings reinforce the importance of including brief social cognitive measures as part of routine post-stroke clinical assessment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As in most parts of Europe, the influx of a large number of refugees from the summer of 2015 on has greatly stirred German society and politics and deeply divided the population on how to deal with asylum seekers and immigration. This article enters this controversy by examining supporters committed to the pro-refugee side of the debate–female volunteers in refugee support work. It investigates how the volunteers interpret their relationship with refugees and adopts the social-psychological hypothesis claiming that the construction of a common identity helps decrease prejudice and facilitate intergroup relations. However, I go on to argue that manifestations of difference continuously interfere with these conceptions of ‘sameness’, as difference is fundamental for the construction of identities and meaning in general. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with female refugee support workers in Germany, this paper then traces how female volunteers imagine and locate ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ when working with refugees. The article shows that while outwardly, participants are keen to develop a sense of a shared identity with the refugees, distinctions through power hierarchies or cultural or gender identities disrupt their experience in ambivalent, complex and covert ways. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite sexism occurring frequently, people often do not identify it as such. Using a vignette design, the current project explored whether sexism was identified at a different rate and intensity depending on the specific form of sexism enacted (hostile or benevolently sexist behavior) and race (Black or White) of the man perpetrating sexist behaviors. When a Black man engaged in a benevolently (paternalistic) sexist behavior he was perceived as more sexist than a White man. However, White and Black men were perceived similarly when they engaged in a hostile (overtly negative and derogatory) sexist behavior. Overall, female participants identified sexism more often and viewed it as more sexist than male participants did, especially in the context of benevolent sexism. These findings suggest there are significant effects of perceiver gender and perpetrator race in the perception of sexism. This demonstrates the importance of examining both race- and gender-based discrimination together. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016. In addition, the number of hate crimes committed against members of the religion jumped 67% in 2015 alone. Addressing the rise in anti-Muslim prejudice is critical. We examined (N = 406) the role of regional identification in predicting anti-Muslim attitudes. That is, identification with the American South, a more conservative and religious part of the country with a history of slavery and violent secession movements, predicted anti-Muslim attitudes. This relationship was mediated by conservation values. For Southerners who strongly identified with “the South”, the endorsement of values related to a general resistance to change led to greater anti-Muslim attitudes. Anti-Muslim bias may lie in perceptions of threat: for strongly identified Southerners, the Muslim faith is viewed as a societal threat. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In the Balkans, contact with gays and lesbians is typically hostile or avoided. Drawing from probability samples of young people from five Balkan countries (N = 1046), we examined whether it is possible to transfer the effects of contact with other marginalized outgroups (largest ethnic minority in every country, Roma, the extremely poor and physically disabled) to acceptance of gays and lesbians (secondary outgroup), and whether this relationship could be explained by attitude generalization and increased intergroup trust. Path analyses supported the secondary transfer effect: it confirmed that, while controlling for direct contact, contact with other marginalized groups was related to more acceptance of a secondary group; this relationship was mediated by trust. This was found across all primary groups in the combined samples, while the effect varied for different groups in country samples. The results add to the value of intergroup contact as a mean of prejudice-reduction. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Combating prejudice against social minorities is a challenging task in current multicultural societies. Mass media can decisively shape prejudice, because it often represents the main source of information about social minorities. In 3 studies in the Czech Republic (N = 445) and Switzerland (N = 362; N = 220), we investigated how prejudice against negatively and positively perceived minorities (the Roma in Study 1, Kosovo Albanians in Study 2, Italians in Study 3) is influenced by a single exposure to a print news report, by manipulating the valence of reports about minority members (positive vs. negative vs. mixed) and linguistic forms for minorities’ ethnicity (nouns vs. adjectives). Positive and negative reports shaped prejudice in the respective directions; the effect of mixed reports mostly did not differ from positive reports. Labeling ethnicity with nouns (e.g., a male Roma) resulted in more prejudice than adjectives (e.g., a Roma man), independent of report valence. Report valence influenced the affective part of prejudice (i.e., feelings toward a minority), whereas language consistently shaped the behavioral part of prejudice (i.e., preferred social distance from a minority). © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Although long-acting injection (LAI) is presented as first line treatment option for patients with psychosis, negative attitudes toward this galenic negatively impact the selection of this treatment option. However, these negative attitudes may not be confined to patients but also observed in the general population. A web-based study on 1807 participants was conducted during which participants imagined that they had a particular chronic illness based on clinical vignettes (mental illnesses: schizophrenia, depression; somatic illnesses: multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The frequency of relapse and the intensity of symptoms were experimentally manipulated in the vignettes. Participants rated their subjective distress associated with each vignette, their belief in the effectiveness of treatment, and their treatment preference regarding medication. We examined under which conditions LAI was preferred over pills. Statistical analyses were performed using Bayesian methods. Results showed that participants preferred LAI over pills in 40.5% to 50.8% of cases. LAI was more preferred for illnesses with low frequency of relapse, low subjective distress, and for somatic than for mental illnesses. The perceived advantage for LAI over pills and the belief about the better efficiency of LAI were the main factors that drove the preference for LAI. Keeping in mind some advantages of LAI, the public negative representations of injections might partially influence patients' prejudices against LAI. These attitudes should be named and discussed with the patients when LAI seems to represent a relevant therapeutic option. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite significant writing by women in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was in the nineteenth that fiction by women became extensive and widely published, prompting numerous sometimes prejudiced evaluations of their works. The popular writer Rhoda Broughton (1840-1920), herself subject to adverse and biased criticism, addresses the notion of female imagination and creativity and the Victorian conception of the female writer in her two novels, A Beginner (1894) and the posthumous A Fool in her Folly (1920). Broughton relates the arduous journey of young first-Time writers, Emma Jocelyn and Charlotte Hankey respectively, and exposes the limited opportunities open to them in both the private and public spheres. Two novels focus on the two young heroines women, lovers and writers in such a way that initiation becomes a major site for the exploration of female consciousness and experience. The convergence of the fictive and the real in the two texts also serves to highlight the relevance of literature by women. This is achieved firstly through the juxtaposition of the two heroines vicissitudes with those of real women, including Broughton herself; secondly, through the heroines admiration for other women writers, particularly Charlotte and Emily Brontë and George Eliot; and thirdly, in the echoes of texts by women writers including Jane Austen and Anne Brontë. Contemporary society s prejudice against unconventional women is confirmed but clearly not endorsed in the endings of the two texts. Broughton s thought-provoking studies of women s quests for personal and professional identity classify her as a perceptive writer who advocates the intellectual and emotional empowerment of women at a time when women were challenging limited definitions of their sex and fighting for their social rights. © 2019 Victorian Popular Fiction Association.

AB  - This research aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between racial prejudice and White Americans' views on cannabis legalization. The recent legalization of recreational cannabis in a handful of states, along with many other states legalizing medical cannabis in recent years, has catapulted the flowering plant back into the spotlight and nightly news cycles. Given the historically racist propaganda used to criminalize the plant, it follows that Whites' support for legalization may be associated with racial prejudice. Using data from the General Social Survey data from 1972-2018, we find that different forms of racial prejudice have a negative effect on Whites' support for cannabis legalization generally. Additionally, as the negative effect of overt, old-fashioned racism diminishes over time and across birth cohorts it is supplanted by the more subtle laissez-faire racism. In conclusion, we discuss the implication of the relationship between racial prejudice and views on marijuana for the increasingly complicated racial dynamics surrounding cannabis legalization. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Throughout the discourse surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict many methods have emerged to examine the ways in which artists engage with the issues through popular culture. As hip hop spread globally, its universal themes and ability to constitute community led to the use of rap as a vehicle for political commentary. This paper explores how the Palestinian hip hop group DAM provides a commentary on the experiences of Palestinian-Israelis through carnivalesque methods to create shocking juxtapositions. Using an inter-textual method, we can see that humor allows DAM to freely speak “their truth,” defusing tensions and providing a new perspective on the conflict, opening dialogue, and regaining control over a painful history. This case study raises questions of authenticity, agency, and parody in hip hop. The genre blurs the threshold of true and false and allows artists to present a conventional hip hop persona, giving them the freedom to safely comment on social issues. Humor allows for further political commentary under the façade of a joke. By parodying painful racial, gender, and class stereotypes, artists reclaim their identity and further subvert prejudices against them. This case study challenges the notion of what protest music looks like, and how it functions to promote change. © 2020 by the Regents of the University of California. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates how three of the most popular and influential mainstream American situation comedies of the 1990s (Seinfeld, Frasier and Friends) explored and developed societal attitudes to sexual identities. None of these sitcoms feature gay male characters in leading roles, yet (the odd camp restaurant critic aside) they may be seen as pioneering popular televisual representations of attitudes towards male homosexuality. This article argues that these sitcoms (which are today considered homophobic by some) may, in their exploration of problematic responses to differences in sexual identities, be (in effect) more progressive than those series of that period (such as Ellen [1994-98] and Will & Grace [1998-2006, 2017-20]) whose representations of central gay characters in positive but often stereotypical ways tended to avoid (or posited that they had no need to engage in) discussions of the prejudices of wider society (of homophobic ridicule, discrimination and violence). © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - The attitudes that social work students hold about race and poverty impact the effectiveness of their practice in the field. This study assessed color-blind racial attitudes and attitudes towards poverty of graduating BSW students (n=41) and MSW students (n=128) from three accredited social work programs. Results indicate a correlation between color-blind racial attitudes and attitudes toward poverty for BSW students, but not MSW students. BSW students had fewer color-blind racial attitudes and more favorable attitudes toward poverty than MSW students. Several predictors of their attitudes were found: their educational status, personal experience of poverty, political ideology, and type of diversity course taken. Implications include the need to approach diversity education from an anti-oppression approach. © 2020 Authors.

AB  - What factors determine public opinion towards immigrants? This inquiry is especially crucial in the context of developing countries since they hold 80 per cent of global refugee populations. Lebanon, with the burden on its shoulders due to hosting about one million Syrians, offers a unique case to study the mechanisms driving the formation of attitudes towards immigrants. In this article, I examine how Syrian density is associated with Lebanese attitudes towards immigrants. Using Arab Barometer Wave IV data (2016), I test three arguments linking public attitudes to natives' economic, security, and sectarian concerns. My analysis suggests that there is no relationship between employment status and negative attitudes towards immigrants. Instead, I argue that perceived economic situation and sense of security provide better mechanisms for the formation of natives' attitudes towards immigrants. Moreover, I present the observational evidence that Lebanese attitudes towards immigrants are driven by one's sectarian affiliation. Notably, Christians are more likely to adopt positive attitudes towards immigrants as Syrian density increases, compared with Shi'as more likely to cite prejudice. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - Knee extension stiffness due to fibrous retraction of the quadriceps is a relatively uncommon condition in children but not so rare in developing countries. It is the result of iatrogenic intra-muscular injection. It is responsible for major functional prejudices in the child. A retrospective study was carried out over a period of 4 years. Twenty children were treated surgically for knee extension stiffness. In 100% of cases it was a severe retraction of the knee. The quadriceps-plasty described by Judet was used in 16 cases and a V-Y quadriceps-plasty in 4 cases. Immediate post-operative physiotherapy was performed every 6 hours with positioning in splint (with every 6-hour alternation between extension and 100°-flexion splint). The average knee flexion degree was 5° in preoperative period and improved to 103° after the surgery. The final result was considered excellent in 30% and good in 70% of the cases. © 2020, Acta Orthopaedica Belgica.

AB  - The location of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is generally constant in fully grown mandibles. If we know its average distance from the lower border of the mandible, available bone length from the crest of the edentulous ridge can be estimated by physical measurement of the whole length of mandible in that area. This study aimed to measure the superio-inferior distance of the inferior alveolar nerve (SIDIAN) from the base of the mandible in posterior regions on the right and left side based on cone-beam-computed tomography (CBCT) scans and to evaluate gender and ethnicity-related variations in the Malaysian population. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 CBCT-Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine files of the patients of 3 ethnic populations (Malay, Chinese and Indian) between the ages of 18 and 80 years were selected for the study. The files were imported onto the iCAT software. The measurements of the SIDIAN to the lower border of the mandible in molar regions were done on both sides. The data was analysed using t-test, one-way analysis of variance test, and correlation coefficient test via the SPSS software. Results: Statistically significant positive correlations were identified between the SIDIAN from the lower border of the mandible in the first and second molar regions within the same side as well as between both sides of the mandible (r ≈ 0.8). There were no statistically significant differences between genders. However, there were statistically significant differences on both molar regions and on both sides in all three ethnic groups (P < 0.05). In general, the SIDIAN from the lower border of the mandible was greatest amongst Chinese and smallest amongst Indians. Conclusions: The strong positive correlations on both sides of the mandible indicate the presence of symmetry. Ethnicity-related variations exist in terms of the location of the IAN in the mandible. © 2020 Indian Journal of Dental Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Academia represents society at its microcosmic level where students, teachers, administrators, and parents across diverse regions, religions, classes, races, castes, and genders interact with each other. Camaraderie between students and students, faculty and students, faculty and parents, faculty and faculty, and students and administrators develop. This paper argues that the bonhomie existing between the major participants in academia is marked by the interference of power, whereby the one wielding more power by virtue of one’s position, class, race, caste, or gender tries to dictate the terms of a particular relationship. A specific code of conduct regarding speech, behavior, dress, thought, writing, love, and life is laid down for all—from professors to students and administrators to parents. The paper calls attention to the fact that embracing fixed roles defined by ideological prejudices, hierarchical divisions, and oppression implies the birth of “power relations” as well as an acceptance of the same. The paper examines, in particular, the trajectory of “power relations” in the light of the course of action defined by power for everyone in academia. However, power in general serves not only to suppress the powerless but is also productive. The paper aims to show how in a specific location as academia as described in Amitabha Bagchi’s Above Average, countering power with power creates a proper kind of resistance that blurs the difference between “power” and “resistance” in “power relations.”. © 2020 IUP.

AB  - This article presents a discussion of neurocognitive hacking and its potential for use at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of cyber conflict. Neurocognitive hacking refers to the ability to activate specific neural areas of the brain, via subliminal or supraliminal stimuli, to shape the behavioral outcomes of an adversary. Research suggests that awareness of mortality-related stimuli has neural correlates in the right amygdala and left anterior cingulate cortex and mediates negative behavior toward out-group members, including unconscious discriminatory behavior. Given its in-group/out-group dynamic, the phenomenon could be exploited for use in information operations toward target populations, specifically ones that are multiethnic, multicultural, or multireligious. Although development of the theoretical framework behind neurocognitive hacking is ongoing, mortality-related stimuli are proposed to activate one's unconscious vigilance system to further evaluate the locus and viability of the suspect stimuli. Research suggests that the subsequent discriminatory affective reactions directed toward out-group members are representative of automatic heuristics evolved to protect the organism in the event a stimulus represents a more serious threat to survival. Therefore, presenting mortality-related stimuli over computer networks to targeted audiences may facilitate the ingestion of tailored propaganda or shaping of specific behavioral outcomes within a population, including sowing division in a target community or weakening support for a specific political regime. © Association for Politics and the Life Sciences 2020.

AB  - The history of the present time is a recent field of historiography but today finds itself in a key position in the public conversations of many countries. From this foundation, the historian Henry Rousso retraces in his book The Latest Catastrophe a genealogy of writing about this history from antiquity to today in order to better identify the unique characteristics of this field, which has its origins in the catastrophes of the twentieth century, first among them the Holocaust, deemed “the latest catastrophe.” These reflections on the writing of history and contemporaneity are an opportunity for us to question the presence of the Second World War in today's societies. Instead of a reading of this presence focused on the catastrophe's long effects, we propose the hypothesis of the “becoming of the event” reformulated by the social changes that have intervened since 1960 in Western societies. By postulating the past first as an “absent thing” (Ricoeur) that historical narratives refigure, we insist on the role of a discontinuous and heterogeneous present in the narrative mediations that reconstitute historical facts and the meanings they offer. Starting from this interactive approach between the past and present, a reading is possible about the future of the Second World War that is interwoven with the social changes of the last third of the twentieth century. This period is characterized by the intervention of new actors and new technical, institutional, and judicial structures, broadly cultural, in the memorialization of this past. Its reconstitution by the media into a new reality is another important fact. Moreover, a compassionate link to the past is now retold publicly, a change that is helped by the emergence of victimhood as a new social category that engenders action for the rights to reparations for endured prejudices that rewrote traditional national narratives. Finally, an evolution of memorial politics founded on a preventive understanding of the past, witness of a new historicity, is more significantly inscribed in the consciousness of internal threats to societies (nuclear, environmental) and consequently in the expansion of the politics of risk-prevention. © 2020 Wesleyan University

AB  - Research on Islamophobia in Switzerland, and on the role of religiosity in relation to Islamophobia, is in its infancy. Against this background, we analyzed data from an online survey conducted in Switzerland on “Xenosophia and Xenophobia in and between Abrahamic religions”. The results of a multivariate analysis revealed that, besides right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political orientation, indicators related to religion play a crucial role. We found that the greater the role of religion, and the more central it is for the individual, the more likely it is that the individual has a positive view of Islam. We claim that a person’s level of religiosity is accompanied by her adoption of religious values, such as neighbourliness and tolerance, and that the more religious individuals are, the more likely they are occupied with different religions, which leads to tolerance as long as it is not accompanied by a dogmatic and fundamentalist religious orientation. Also relevant is that the preference for the state to have a secularized relationship with religion is accompanied by a fear of Islam. We propose that studies on Islamophobia, as well as on other prejudices, should use differentiated measures for religiosity; the Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS) turned out to be a reliable instrument of measurement in this regard. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background Extensive literature covers the relationship between psychiatric and dental health, but little research explores the ability of dental practitioners to confidently address patient mental health. This paper explored self-reported confidence of dental students when addressing patient mental health in a university setting. Methods Mixed-method approach involving a quantitative scenario-based survey and focus groups. Research participants were from years three, four and five of the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. Results Survey data showed low confidence among dental students. Focus group themes included lack of education, prejudice and rejecting responsibility. Participants suggested communication skills workshops to help improve confidence. Discussion Self-reported confidence among dental students when addressing patient mental health was low, echoing wider literature findings. Focus groups highlighted an absence of patient mental health from the curriculum. Systematic reviews have recommended greater education around screening tools for 'assessing psychological comorbidity'. Using best practice, focus group data and psychologist guidance, we developed a communication skills case-based workshop for service improvement. Conclusion Low student confidence likely originates from limited focus within the BDS curriculum. The research will be expanded into other UK dental schools to explore the confidence of dental students nationally and to evaluate and trial the developed workshop. © 2020, British Dental Association.

AB  - What undermines cooperation in ethnically diverse communities? Scholars have focused on factors that explain the lack of inter-ethnic cooperation, such as prejudice or the difficulty to communicate and sanction across group boundaries. We direct attention to the fact that diverse communities are also often poor and ask whether poverty, rather than diversity, reduces cooperation. We developed a strategic cooperation game where we vary the income and racial identity of the interaction partner. We find that beliefs about how poor people behave have clear detrimental effects on cooperation: Cooperation is lower when people are paired with low-income partners, and the effect is particularly strong when low-income people interact among themselves. We observe additional discrimination along racial lines when the interaction partner is poor. These findings imply that poverty and rising inequality may be a serious threat to social cohesion, especially under conditions of high socioeconomic segregation. © 2019 The Experimental Research Section of the American Political Science Association.

AB  - The role of HIV disclosure and its influence on engagement in HIV care after initial linkage to care is not well understood. We conducted 28 in-depth interviews with patients newly entering HIV care. Gaining access to social support was a key reason that many patients disclosed their HIV status. For some, HIV disclosure improved support networks related to engagement in care at the time of care entry, in the form of appointment reminders, emotional support, and confidence to disclose more widely. However, some participants cited anticipated stigma as a barrier to disclosure, as they feared rejection or further disclosure without their permission. Early access to social support and skill building related to stigma reduction and coping can be useful resources to help patients manage HIV, as they initiate care. In addition, incorporating support for smart disclosure decisions into interventions may improve access to social support, ultimately improving engagement in care.

AB  - In her 2007 book Epistemic Injustice Miranda Fricker identifies testimonial injustice as a case where a hearer assigns lower credibility to a speaker due to “identity prejudice.” Fricker considers testimonial injustice as a form of epistemic injustice since it wrongs the speaker “in her capacity as a knower.” Fricker recommends developing the virtue of “testimonial justice” to address testimonial injustice. She takes this virtue to involve training in a “distinctly reflexive critical social awareness.” The main goal of this article is to argue that Fricker's proposed training falls short of the target and that a cultivation of the capacity of being present—the ability to be mindful—would be necessary to develop the critical social awareness that Fricker requires. I want to explore the impact of compassion and open-mindedness—virtues cultivated in mindfulness training—on testimonial justice specifically and virtue epistemology generally. In attempting to develop an epistemic account informed by mindfulness—a mindful epistemology—my primary goal is to bring Buddhist insights on how to anchor the mind by training it to be fully present and attentive into the focus of mainstream Western philosophy. More specifically, I argue that doing so allows us to appreciate the crucial role that a prediscursive level of cultivation plays in the development of testimonial justice. © 2019 The University of Memphis

AB  - Nursing faculties are working to improve students’ attitudes towards mental illness and people with severe mental illness, given the repercussions a lack of knowledge and negative attitudes may have on the quality of care. Complementing undergraduate programmes with volunteering activities affords students the opportunity to interact with people with a severe mental illness, and allow them to develop positive attitudes and overcome prejudice. Aim: to explore and deepen in nursing students attitudes prior to and following volunteering on an Acute Mental Health Inpatient Unit. By means of mixed methods approach, students were assessed at two time points by questionnaires including “Community Attitudes to Mental Illness” and “Semantic Differential”, and by testimonies gathered from interviews. Positives changes in attitudes were identified and monitored over time capturing a destigmatizing tendency. The participation in educational strategies such as volunteering in Acute Mental Health Inpatient Unit, complementary to undergraduate programmes and clinical placements in mental health, allows nursing students to develop more diversified and positive attitudes towards mental illness and people with severe mental illness. The impact of an interventional education strategy is not as powerful in nursing students as it might be in students of other non-healthcare oriented university degrees due to their baseline attitudes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Against the backdrop of hundreds of studies documenting negative stereotypes and stigma held by the public regarding people who stutter, a substantial number of investigations have attempted to improve public attitudes and measure their results with a standard instrument, the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes–Stuttering (POSHA–S). Although the majority of interventions have been moderately to quite successful, a substantial minority have been unsuccessful. Purpose: This study sought to determine what properties of interventions and demographic variables were predictive of least to most successful interventions. Preliminary to that, however, it required the division of samples into clearly differentiated categories of success. Method: Twenty-nine different study samples containing 934 participants were categorized into four levels of success of interventions according to pre versus post POSHA–S summary mean ratings. Intervention properties and demographic characteristics and for each success category were analyzed for their predictive potential of successful attitude improvement. Results: Interventions characterized by high interest or involvement, meaningful material, and content that respondents found to be relevant, but not excessive, tended to be associated with more successful interventions. In contrast, demographic variables were weak predictors of intervention success. Conclusion: The authors hypothesize that maximally effective interventions reflect optimal matches between participant characteristics and intervention features, although the critical variables in each are not yet apparent. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Ways of labeling a person with epilepsy (PWE) may have an impact on public position towards affected persons. This study analyzed college students position changes, influenced by three different labels of PWE. Methods: Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. Students of three schools answered one of three questionnaires whose content changed in the labeling form: person with epilepsy, epileptic or PWE. Proportions were compared with Chi square test or Fisher's exact test to explore considering age, gender, religion practicing, socioeconomic status, knowing an affected person and by faculty. Results: A total of 273 questionnaires were included were distributed in medicine 133 (48.7 %), engineering 108 (39.6 %) and law 32 (11.7 %) schools. Labeling type distribution was person with epilepsy 94 (34.4 %), epileptic 93 (34.1 %) and PWE 86 (31.5 %. No statistical differences were found according the labels person with epilepsy and epileptic. The abbreviation PWE had statistical significant connotation in aspects of academic achievement p = 0,007, selecting a PWE in your work team p = 0,009, self control p < 0,000, being dangerous p < 0,000 and having any disturbance in thought or behavior p = 0,05. Religion practicing, socioeconomic status and knowing a person with epilepsy did not impact in attitude related to labeling. Engineering and law students expressed their concern in employability. Conclusion: The abbreviation PWE may have negative connotations when used in written questionnaires. No differences were found with the labels person with epilepsy and epileptic in college students. More studies are needed to explore the stigmatizing or destigmatizing effects of labeling a person with epilepsy on different populations. © 2020 British Epilepsy Association

AB  - The niqab provokes a heated debate in European societies and generates intolerance towards women who wear it. Some of the explanations used to criticize this Muslim garment refer to the idea that women wear the niqab as a form of patriarchal oppression. Furthermore—especially after the terrorist attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists—the niqab is seen as a symbol of religious radicalization. We carried out 10 communicative daily life stories with Muslim women wearing the niqab in Spain, to explore the adverse experiences that they face, as well as the ways to transform them. Our analysis, informed by a communicative approach, revealed different forms of discrimination, such as prejudice, personal attacks and social isolation. Furthermore, it revealed some opportunities to transform these experiences, through the equality of differences, the egalitarian dialogue, and the support of faith-based organizations. Ultimately, our findings illustrated participants’ persistent defense of their right to express their religious identity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We performed a multilevel, multinational analysis of the 2014 European Social Survey dataset (N = 33,597, nested in 19 countries) to study how individual conservative values and cultural embeddedness moderate the link between contact with immigrants and the attitudes toward them. A combination of frequency and positivity of contact with immigrants showed a negative association with ethnic prejudice while, conversely, participants’ conservative basic values were directly and positively associated with prejudice. National cultural embeddedness was not associated with the dependent variable. Neither individual conservative values nor cultural embeddedness moderated the association between contact and prejudice. Strengths, limitations, implications and future directions of this study are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using data from the 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, I investigate whether education’s influence on the likelihood of visual and performing arts attendance in the USA varies by race-ethnicity. The results reveal that education increases the odds of attendance for both Whites and non-Whites, but it has a stronger impact upon the former than the latter. Unlike Whites, education’s effect on attending visual and performing arts activities for non-Whites is insignificant for high school diploma recipients when compared to their counterparts with some college education. These findings suggest a racial-ethnic bias in visual and performing arts attendance net of education that connects to the European roots of “legitimate” art in modern western society and the history of US racial discrimination. European Americans have dominated the USA’s social institutions for centuries and have held prejudices against minorities’ artistic capabilities since the colonial era. Consequentially, they could determine which arts genres provide valuable cultural capital. Conversely, minority art communities have only recently acquired the resources for self-sustainability. This likely limited their ability to develop formal institutions within their own communities to support the arts. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In Western Europe, a select number of “ghettos” are at the forefront of public anxieties about urban inequality and failed integration. These notorious neighbourhoods at the bottom of the moral spatial order are imagined as different and disconnected from the rest of the city. This paper examines how residents in Amsterdam Bijlmer, a peripheral social housing estate long portrayed as the Dutch ghetto, experience the symbolic denigration of their neighbourhood. Interviews show that all residents are highly aware of the negative racial, cultural and material stereotypes associated with their neighbourhood. However, these negative stereotypes are not equally felt: territorial stigma “sticks” more to some residents than others and substantial inequalities are observed in who carries the burden of renegotiating blemish of place. Differential engagement with stigma depends on how residents’ identity and the materiality of their surroundings intersect with stigmatising narratives of place. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to study stereotypes and discriminations in the field of health, and more specifically among French liberal physiotherapists. Extensive Anglo-Saxon literature reveals discriminatory practices on the part of health professionals towards black, Hispanic, poor and/or female patients. We chose to study the population of patients with Universal Mutual Coverage (CMU) in order to represent a population of patients with low socio-economic status. We established, through a questionnaire completed by physiotherapists, that these patients were indeed the object of a rather pejorative stereotype, tinged with social uselessness. These results support a previous study with French physicians and dentists. Level of evidence: 5. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - This paper explores the impact of acculturation conditions, orientations and outcomes on international students in Australia's tertiary education sector. Specifically, we investigate the factors that facilitate or hinder acculturation of international students within a multidimensional acculturation context (Arends-Tóth & van de Vijver, 2006). We used a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design in two studies to investigate acculturation of international students at an Australian university and test how these factors are related to psychological and sociocultural outcomes. In Study 1, we conducted a generic qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with a conventional content analyses approach,which compared the experiences of international students who on average had high numbers of positive experiences versus those who had high numbers of negative experiences. We found that a support network of mixed-nationals, and especially host locals, facilitates positive psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and buffers acculturative stress. Study 2 quantitatively tested the association of factors found in Study 1 (perceived stereotypes, intercultural and ethnic network/resources) with psychological and sociocultural acculturation outcomes. Study 2, shows that perceived negative stereotypes loosen ties with the dominant (host) culture and reinforces ties with the ethnic (non-host) culture. The social resources associated with either culture was found to be useful for acculturation, with both independently contributing to participant well-being. Contact with host locals played a particularly crucial role in developing these resources. Our findings provide foundations for pragmatic policy implications, suggesting value in the development of formally organized contact programs in the early sojourn experience of international students. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we propose the opinion dynamics model with the increasing peer pressure and the stubborn agents. Cooperation and competition between individuals are considered simultaneously in a social network. Similar to the signed DeGroot model, we adopt a weighted average update rule in our model. We derive conditions under which opinions converge to a fixed opinion distribution. In particular, we find conditions under which opinions reach consensus or polarization (bipartite consensus). Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Introduction: The midwifery profession in the United States demonstrates a significant lack of diversity. The critical need to address the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the midwifery workforce is well recognized; little attention, however, has been given to gender diversity. This study focused on gender diversity within midwifery, specifically with regard to men who are midwives. Nearly 99% of midwives in the United States are women. No research has previously explored the attitudes of the predominantly female midwifery workforce toward its male members. Methods: An invitation to an internet survey was sent to the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) membership. Quantitative and open-ended questions assessed attitudes toward and experiences with male midwives, whether members thought men belong in the profession, whether gender impacts quality of care, if ACNM should facilitate gender diversification, and whether exposure to male midwives impacts attitudes toward gender diversification. Data analysis of qualitative responses used a qualitative description methodology to identify common themes. Results: Six thousand, nine hundred sixty-five surveys were distributed, and 864 participants completed the survey. Respondents reported beliefs that men belong in midwifery (71.4%), that gender does not affect quality of care (74%), and that ACNM should support gender diversity (72%). Respondents’ perspectives revealed 3 dichotomous themes pertaining to the core nature of midwifery and how men fit within the profession: 1) inclusion versus exclusion, 2) empowerment versus protection, and 3) sharing with versus taking from. Often, the same respondent expressed both aspects of the dichotomy simultaneously. Discussion: This study contributes new information about midwives’ attitudes and beliefs toward gender diversity in midwifery in the United States. The values of professionalism, tradition, feminism, protection, and diversification inform participant responses. Findings support efforts toward gender diversification and have implications for implementation in education and practice. © 2020 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes in the postcolonial society of Singapore based on an examination of the impact of group threat on these resentments. The binary regression analysis finds that direct or parental immigration experience has a mitigating impact on anti-immigrant attitudes, while homophobia is the strongest predictor of anti-immigrant prejudice. However, the preference for Singaporeans over immigrants in the allocation of jobs during times of scarce work and low levels of trust in strangers reinforce anti-immigrant sentiments in Singapore. The outcomes presented in the paper suggest that group threat theory has only a moderate explanatory power and that feelings of mistrust deserve more attention in the future for explaining group-based hostile attitudes in plural contexts. Consequently, multicultural Singaporean society exhibits an attitudinal composition that corresponds only partly with group threat theory but with the assumption of the interrelatedness of prejudices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports a study that adopted age-appropriate terminology to investigate 6–11-year-old children's attitudes towards mental illness (N = 120). The study utilized a semi-structured interview technique and card selection tasks to assess the children's attitudes to individuals diagnosed with different mental illnesses (anorexia nervosa, depression and dementia). Their attitudes were measured in terms of social distance, social functioning, emotional response and trait attributions. Findings suggested that children's responses varied according to the specific mental illness diagnosis for social functioning, emotional response and trait attributions. In addition, the children's attitudes towards the three characters showed different developmental profiles as a function of age for social functioning and trait attributions. The implications of these findings for theories of the development of prejudice, and implications for stigma reduction programs, are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As the largest minority group in the United States, Latinas/os have experienced a long history of discrimination, prejudice, and stigmatization as gang members. A contemporary survey of law enforcement agencies reported that Latinos continue to be the largest proportion of any racial or ethnic group involved in gangs. To describe such a pattern, the framework of settler colonialism will be utilized to describe differential experiences based on race, gender, and how structural inequalities vary by region and time. Latinas/os have been particularly impacted by segregation, second-class treatment, and policies considered racially neutral. Gangs provide a topical area for examining patterns of racialization and social control. The authors of this article will outline the research literature on gangs and how settler colonialism has impacted the Latina/o population regarding the origination of gangs, reasons for joining, behaviors and activities, and the process for leaving these groups. The authors emphasize decolonization strategies including reducing structural inequalities and thereby reducing gang membership and risky behaviors. Until this can be accomplished, the authors hope for human rights, labor equity, and religious organizing efforts that can form into social movements of collective empowerment and justice. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Exploring political and social policy developments in Croatia, Hungary and Poland, three EU member states, this article addresses the hegemonic position of authoritarianism, populism, conservatism and neoliberalism, albeit articulated differently in each state. All three countries are marked by modes of governmentality that combine heteronormative familialism, repatriarchialization, nationalism, ethnicized demographic renewal and anti-immigrant sentiments. In each, a kind of layered social divestment is occurring, delivering a radical new vision of social reproduction and fundamental differentiations in terms of access to social citizenship between those seen as ‘deserving’ of support and those who are not, who are increasingly subjected to disciplinary measures. Although the degree of welfare retrenchment varies across the cases, the radical nature of restructuring, breaking down traditional notions of left and right on welfare, is suggestive of longer-term restructurings not reliant on individual politicians or parties. © 2019 International Institute of Social Studies

AB  - Previous research investigating the under-representation of women in science and technology fields has identified various causes. These include, a lack of inspiring female role-models, limited exposure of girls to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, gender-biased stereotypes, and preferences for different learning styles between genders. Dedicated to the ideas of women and space, the “She Space” research project for high school girls was a joint effort of the Earth and Planetary Image Facility (EPIF) at Ben-Gurion University in the Negev and Beit Yatziv. The participants included 20 high-school aged female students and a predominantly female staff of up to eight university researchers and advanced degree students. The goal of this project was to advance and support female students engaging with various scientific fields and, in particular, the field of space science. The project emphasized the quality and development of the research process and used project-based learning to help participants learn to use a research-based approach when encountering challenging scientific concepts or subjects. This, together with active learning and teamwork was set as the educational framework to meet the different learning styles and motivational needs of girls. Furthermore, special attention was given to the suppression of gender stereotypes by 1) introducing women role models 2) overcoming self-induced prejudices related to STEM abilities by introducing new and unknown subjects (remote sensing), about which participants lack preconceptions. Using participant surveys, we found that self-reported confidence with and interest in STEM subjects increased after the project. We also found that participants’ feelings about participating in an all-female program did not noticeably change after the program. However, the vast majority (87%) of participants did report that having a majority female staff was very important to them. © 2019 IAA

AB  - Ambivalent sexism theory conceptualizes sexism as comprised of two distinct yet complementary attitudinal views of women: hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS). HS is an antipathy toward women; BS is an ostensibly positive view of women as pure and warm yet weak and incompetent. The current research adds to extant models of individual differences and sexism by capturing a wider range of interpersonal warmth-dominance measures associated with both BS and HS. Four studies were conducted that featured online and student samples (N = 772; 55.7% female) as well as self (Studies 1–4) and friend-reports (Study 4). We found that men's HS correlated positively with interpersonally dominant characteristics and negatively with interpersonal warmth. In contrast, men's BS correlated positively with both interpersonal dominance and warmth measures. For women, HS positively correlated with one interpersonal dominance measure (i.e., Machiavellianism) and negatively with warmth measures. However, the relationships between BS and dominance-warmth measures were less consistent or clear for women. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that BS (but not HS) was associated with apparent biases in self-perception. Extending prior research on prejudice and personality, this research provides a comprehensive examination on the relationships between ambivalent sexism and interpersonal dimensions of dominance and warmth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study is a population-based test of stereotype threat effects in a national study of African Americans. Stereotype threat activation is operationalized as the additive interaction between identity threat (i.e., perceiving race as barrier to life goals) and high endorsement of negative stereotypes among African American respondents (N = 3750) to the National Survey of American Life. Those classified as experiencing stereotype threat are hypothesized (1) to have the lowest scores on measures of cognitive functioning, perceived mastery, and educational attainment; and (2) these effects would be stronger than the negative stereotypes only group. Limited support was found for the hypotheses. Extension of stereotype threat to social inequities in the broader African American community may be premature. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Surveys were conducted with 227 Black and 130 Hispanic parents in poverty in a mid-sized city in the South. For Hispanic parents, a sense of linked fate within their ethnic group is associated with a lower likelihood of enrollment, however, measures of intergroup relations are not related to the Head Start enrollment status of Black parents. Implications for policies on preschool expansion are discussed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma can be a barrier to early intervention of severe mental illnesses, especially schizophrenia, which further leads to poor outcomes. Mental health campaigns were designed to educate the general public about signs for early identification of psychosis, but the line between schizophrenia and attenuated psychosis was not well demarcated. We wonder if people would generalize their stigmas towards schizophrenia to subjects with subthreshold psychotic symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was employed which used a structured questionnaire, comprised of four case vignettes describing attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS), schizophrenia, psychotic-like experiences (PLE), or depression, and was followed by two sets of questions using the 4-point Likert scale to measure discrimination and prejudices. Participants were chosen by convenience sampling of laypersons from different backgrounds. Results: A total of 268 subjects completed this survey. A gradient of stigmas, highest toward schizophrenia, followed by APS/depression, and lowest toward PLE was apparent across gender, all age groups, and education levels. Participants who were younger and had higher education revealed a trend of lower prejudice and discrimination. People who have visited a psychiatric hospital showed higher discrimination toward schizophrenia, APS, and depression. People who have seen mentally ill persons in public places showed lower stigma toward PLE. Discussion: Our respondents posed a differentiable attitude towards PLE, APS, and schizophrenia, while exhibiting no difference between APS and depression. Certain personal attributes were correlated with stigma levels. Further investigation about mental health literacy and attitudes towards subjects with psychotic symptoms in the general public is warranted. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - We examined perceptions of cross-class heterosexual couples, that is, couples where couple members differ in social class. Informed by social dominance theory, system justification theory, and equity theory, we predicted that (a) cross- (vs. same-) class couples would be perceived more negatively, (b) cross-class couples with the woman (vs. the man) in the higher class position would be evaluated more negatively, and (c) same-class low-low (vs. high-high) couples would be evaluated more negatively. We examined perceptions of cross-income, cross-education, and cross-occupation status relationships. We found support for our predicted patterns, with some exceptions. In general, high-high class couples were preferred. In three of four studies, a higher-class woman paired with a lower-class man was evaluated most negatively of all couples. Recognition of this prejudice may explain challenges faced by certain couples and couple members; as such, implications for clinicians and counselors are discussed. Further, our research generates directions for future research.

AB  - While a large body of social psychological research has shed light on the nature of prejudice and how to reduce it, we argue that such work does not address situations of cultural or religious outgroup beliefs and practices that are considered incompatible with one's own. The present theoretical article contrasts a prejudice-reduction approach with a toleration-based approach to consider the differences each have with regard to the attitude object they focus upon, the perceived reasonableness of the attitude, and the behavioral consequences each may lead to. In doing so, we consider the psychological processes involved in whether the negative attitude leads to negative actions. We conclude by arguing that a toleration-based approach forms an important addition to the psychological thinking about cultural diversity and intergroup relations. Collectively, the present work makes a novel contribution to the social psychological literature by stimulating theory development and raising novel questions for empirical research. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Previous research has shown that participation in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca can lead to both more positive outgroup attitudes and increased commitment to Muslim identity. We describe a survey of pilgrims (N = 1,176) carried out at Mecca, during the Hajj, which tested explanations for these experiences of self-change at the time of their occurrence. In line with contact theory, perceived cooperation among pilgrims indirectly predicted more positive outgroup attitudes (as well as enhanced Muslim identification), via identification with the crowd. In line with social identity and identity congruence explanations, positive emotional experience and the perception that the crowd embodied the Muslim value of unity predicted self-change variables through identification with the crowd. The finding that participation in an all-Muslim gathering increases positive views of other groups (including non-Muslims) through identification with the crowd offers an alternative perspective to suggestions that such gatherings might encourage intolerance. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Public stigma towards people with mental health problems has been demonstrated in Western societies. Little is known about non-Western cultures and whether cultures differ in their perceptions of people with mental health problems. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination towards people with psychosis. Participants were from White British and South Asian backgrounds (N = 128, aged 16–20 years) recruited from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. They completed a cross-sectional survey on affective, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions of stigma. Results revealed significant cultural differences on all three stigma dimensions. South Asians attributed higher anger (prejudice) and dangerousness (stereotypes) to people with psychosis than White British. They also reported lower willingness to help, greater avoidance, and higher endorsement of segregation (discrimination). The effects of ethnic group on helping intentions, avoidance, and segregation endorsement were mediated by anger and by dangerousness. Understanding cultural differences in stigma towards psychosis will be important for designing stigma interventions as well as treatments for people with different cultural backgrounds. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This article adds to the social psychological literature on how minority group members seek to manage their interactions with majority group members. Specifically, it focuses on minority group members’ use of humour in interactions where they anticipate or actually experience prejudice. The data on which our analysis is based originate from interviews conducted with Roma in Hungary (N = 30). Asked about their interactions with majority group members, interviewees reported using humour as a means to (a) manage embarrassment; (b) gather information about the other's intergroup attitudes; and (c) subvert taken-for-granted understandings of social relations. The humour involved was diverse. Sometimes it entailed the telling of (Roma-related) jokes. Sometimes it involved the exaggerated performance of roles and identities that ironised majority–minority social relations. The significance of humour as a tool for minority group members to exert some control over their interactions with majority group members is discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Over half of refugees are school-aged children. In host communities, children's attitudes and behaviours are important for the integration of refugee children. This study examines the empathy–attitudes–action model in middle childhood (N = 94, 8 to 11 years old). In both the experimental and control conditions, children were introduced to a (fictional) refugee and told that he or she would be moving to their school. The experimental condition also listened to a storybook about the child's refugee experience. Empathy, outgroup attitudes, and prosocial behaviour toward the incoming child, and refugees as a group, were measured. Although mediation was not supported, the storybook condition reported more empathy and helping intentions, and attitudes predicted helping intentions but not giving to refugees. Results highlight how host-society children can welcome refugees. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Population growth is probably the greatest global challenge of the twenty-first century and fertility is a central element of this growth. Fertility is a human attribute which depends almost entirely on social, economic, political, cultural and psychological frameworks, making fertility intention an element of what individuals learn from a very young age as part of their socialisation into society. The fundamental significance of socio-psychological, environmental and cultural factors in what adolescents are assimilating on fertility cannot be exaggerated, yet, relevant information is limited. Eight factors deduced from ecological model and theory of planned behaviour were used to predict fertility intention among a cohort of Nigerian adolescents, using cross-sectional design. Mean fertility intention was 4.06 ± 1.34. Age and religion had no effect, but gender did. Self esteem, perceived parental expectation of fertility, attitude towards fertility and peer-related subjective norm are significant predictors. Media and ethnic attitude are insignificant predictors of, but are significantly related to fertility intention. Attitude towards a four-child family and perceived behavioural control yielded insignificant relationships with, and also failed to predict fertility intention. Perceived parental expectation of fertility, an interpersonal factor of the ecological model is the single most important predictor (β = 0.707, R2 = 0.506, r = 0.711, and partial r = 0.710). Fertility intention points towards fertility decline, though sluggish and diminutive, thereby failing to reflect the need of Nigeria’s population pyramid to thin out from the base. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Framed within intersectionality and using science identity as a unit of analysis, in this single case study I explore the barriers, difficulties, and conflicts that Amina, a young Muslim woman, immigrant in Western Europe confronted throughout her trajectory in physics and the ways in which her multiple identities intersected. The main sources of data consisted of three long biographical interviews, which were analyzed through a constant comparative method. The analysis of the data provided insights into how intrapersonal, interpersonal, sociocultural factors, alongside a myriad of experiences nurtured Amina's intersectional identities and what this may mean for Muslim women's participation in physics. The findings are summarized in two main assertions: (a) Amina was confronted with various barriers across her journey in physics with the intersection of religion and gender being the major barrier to her perceived recognition due to cultural expectations, sociopolitical factors, and negative stereotypes and (b) Amina's social class, religion, gender performance, and ethnic status positioned her as Other in various places throughout her trajectory in physics, and consequently hindered her sense of belonging. These findings suggest the urgency and importance of: (a) examining the intersection of science identity with other identities, especially, religion, gender, and ethnicity for the purpose of extrapolating a more comprehensive understanding of how minoritized groups participate in science; (b) rethinking recognition through an explicit intersectionality lens across various geographical and sociopolitical contexts; and (c) transforming physics into a diverse world where multiple ways of being are recognized, where minoritized groups will not have to compartmentalize parts of their identities to exist, and where they can perform their authentic and intersectional identities. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the patterns in allegations of workplace discrimination filed by individuals with cancer. Objective The goal of the research was to describe discrimination, both actual and perceived, that has occurred against individuals with cancer in comparison to a group of individuals with other general disabilities (GENDIS) through analyses of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Integrated Mission System (IMS) database. Methods An ex post facto, causal comparative quantitative design was used to examine Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) Title I complaints received by the EEOC from people with cancer from 2009 through 2016 (n = 10,848) in comparison to the GENDIS group over the same time period (n = 13,338). Results Results revealed statistically significant differences in the patterns of issues alleged by the two groups. When compared to the GENDIS group, the cancer group was significantly older and had proportionally more individuals who identified as Asian than the GENDIS group. People with cancer were more likely to allege discrimination in the areas of unlawful discharge, demotion, wages, layoff, benefits, and referrals. They were less likely to allege discrimination in areas of reasonable accommodation, hiring, and suspension. Also, the cancer group was more likely than the GENDIS group to file allegations against smaller employers and employers in the Southeast region of the United States, while employers in the Mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain regions were less likely to be named in allegations by people with cancer. The cancer group was also significantly more likely than the GENDIS group to find that EEOC investigations of their allegations resulted in merit-based case resolution, that is, discrimination had indeed occurred. Owing to the large sample size, some of these between-group differences were small in magnitude. Conclusion The workplace discrimination experiences of people with cancer are substantially different from those of people with other disabilities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Humans distinguish between we-groups and they-groups, such as relatives versus strangers and higher-ups versus lower-downs, thereby creating crucial preconditions for favouring their own groups while discriminating against others. Reported here is the finding that the extent of differentiation between us and them varies along latitude rather than longitude. In geographically isolated preindustrial societies, intergroup differentiation already peaked at the equator and tapered off towards the poles, while being negligibly related to longitude (observation study 1). Contemporary societies have evolved even stronger latitudinal gradients of intergroup differentiation (survey study 2 around 1970) and discrimination (mixed-method study 3 around 2010). The geography of contemporary differentiation and discrimination can be partially predicted by tropical climate stress (warm winters, hot summers and irregular rainfall), largely mediated by the interplay of pathogen stress and agricultural subsistence (explanatory study 4). The findings accumulate into an index of intergroup discrimination by inhabitants of 222 countries (integrative study 5). © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Decades of social attitudes research has shown the importance of examining both implicit and explicit attitudes for a fuller understanding of attitudes. Despite evidence from the broader literature, transgender attitudes studies to date have almost exclusively utilized self-report measures to assess explicit transgender prejudice due, in large part, to the dearth of implicit transgender prejudice measures. The current study, therefore, conducted a series of three pilot studies using online samples to build a standardized procedure based on the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) to assess implicit transgender prejudice (Transgender AMP) and examined its performance to establish preliminary validity and reliability evidence for scores from the procedure. Results of the repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of prime type, demonstrating a systematic difference in the ratings of transgender primes versus neutral primes and provided initial evidence of construct validity. Although the effect size was not as large as what is reported for the original AMP, the Transgender AMP still showed sensitivity as a measure of implicit transgender prejudice. Likewise, results of the mixed ANOVA showed a significant effect of contact, replicating findings from the explicit transgender prejudice literature. Transgender AMP scores were also found to be internally consistent (α = .87). Overall, the newly developed Transgender AMP performed as expected with preliminary evidence suggesting that it is a simple, user-friendly procedure capturing implicit transgender prejudice. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Stereotypes often guide our perceptions of members of social groups. However, research has yet to document what stereotypes may exist for the fastest growing youth demographic in the United States—biracial individuals. Across seven studies (N = 1,104), we investigate what stereotypes are attributed to various biracial groups, whether biracial individuals are stereotyped as more similar to their lower status monoracial parent group (trait hypodescent), and whether contact moderates these stereotypes. Results provide evidence of some universal biracial stereotypes that are applied to all biracial groups: attractive and not fitting in or belonging. We also find that all biracial groups are attributed a number of unique stereotypes (i.e., which are not associated with their monoracial parent groups). However, across all studies, we find little evidence of trait hypodescent and no evidence that the tendency to engage in trait hypodescent varies as a function of contact. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Although pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) have been characterized as feminine, some PEBs are masculine suggesting that gender bending (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors inconsistent with one’s own gender) and gender conformity (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors consistent with one’s own gender) are possible for both women and men. Social consequences for gender bending versus conformity with PEBs were assessed in three studies. Gender bending created uncertainty about an actor’s heterosexual identity (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with stigma-by-association, actors’ gender bending influenced judgments about an actor’s friend’s sexual identity (Study 2). However, gender bending had limited effects on ascription of gendered traits: More feminine than masculine traits were ascribed to PEB actors, even actors of masculine PEBs (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with social ostracism, Study 3 illustrated that men were most likely to socially distance themselves from female gender benders, likely as a result of prejudice against gender-bending women. In contrast, women preferred to socially interact with gender-conforming women, likely resulting from a combination of their greater interest in feminine than masculine PEBs and preferring to interact with women more so than with men. Social repercussions are discussed in terms of stigmatizing engagement in PEBs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Stereotypes can influence social perception in undesirable ways. However, activated stereotypes are not always applied in judgments. The present research investigated how stereotype activation and application processes impact social judgments as a function of available resources for control over stereotypes. Specifically, we varied the time available to intervene in the stereotyping process and used multinomial modeling to independently estimate stereotype activation and application. As expected, social judgments were less stereotypic when participants had more time to intervene. In terms of mechanisms, stereotype application, and not stereotype activation, corresponded with reductions in stereotypic biases. With increasing time, stereotype application was reduced, reflecting the fact that controlling application is time-dependent. In contrast, stereotype activation increased with increasing time, apparently due to increased engagement with stereotypic material. Stereotype activation was highest when judgments were least stereotypical, and thus, reduced stereotyping may coincide with increased stereotype activation if stereotype application is simultaneously decreased. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Children and adolescents (N = 153, ages 8–14 years, Mage = 11.46 years) predicted and evaluated peer exclusion in interwealth (high-wealth and low-wealth) and interracial (African American and European American) contexts. With age, participants increasingly expected high-wealth groups to be more exclusive than low-wealth groups, regardless of their depicted race. Furthermore, children evaluated interwealth exclusion less negatively than interracial exclusion, and children who identified as higher in wealth evaluated interwealth exclusion less negatively than did children who identified as lower in wealth. Children cited explicit negative stereotypes about high-wealth groups in their justifications, while rarely citing stereotypes about low-wealth groups or racial groups. Results revealed that both race and wealth are important factors that children consider when evaluating peer exclusion. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is characterized by thymic (irritability, depressed mood, anxiety), physical (breast swelling, muscle pain), and behavioural (decreased interest, lethargy) cyclical symptoms that appear approximately one week before menstruation and begin to decrease after the luteal phase. Diagnosis considers the degree to which these symptoms have altered social or professional functioning during the year preceding consultation. DSM-III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and DSM-IV working groups have successively decided not to attribute an official disorder status to PMDD, apprehending its possible negative impact (e.g., potential increase in prejudice against women through pathologization of natural female functioning and a risk of misuse). Since its inclusion in the DSM-5 (the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM) in 2013, it has achieved official status of mental disorder. It is also expected to be included in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) according to the beta draft of the World Health Organisation. The current paper challenges the validity and relevance of PMDD inclusion in diagnostic textbooks through an argument from both sides on this issue. Criticism about PMDD largely comes from feminist groups, worried about the implications of including the diagnosis and its associated treatments, which are firmly rooted within the medical paradigm. The scientific community, however, is divided, and while some welcome the DSM-5 work group initiative, others are less enthusiastic. The DSM-5 work group identified sufficient empirical support to justify inclusion of PMDD in the Depressive disorders category. Their decision was based on an examination of the four requirements necessary for including any disorder in diagnostic textbooks, that is: (a) a clear distinction of PMDD from other disorders, (b) the presence of antecedent validators (environment and cultural consideration), (c) concomitant factors (biomarkers) and (d) predictive validator (PDMM's stability over time and drug treatment response). The current paper reviews these requirements. A first consideration leading to the inclusion of PMDD in DSM-5 is that it could clearly be distinguished from other mood disorders by the concordance between the premenstrual phase and the symptoms’ onset. Indeed, the symptoms begin at the luteal phase and tend to disappear when menstruation ends. However, a meta-analysis reveals some issues in how symptoms ratings have been used in PMDD's studies. Furthermore, it appears that PMDD present high comorbidity with other disorders. A majority (73%) of PMDD cases are combined with another mental disorder (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, etc.). Secondly, PMDD work group advocates the importance of heritability, compared to what they describe as a very modest impact of environmental issues on symptoms’ onset. That said, some studies highlight the association between PMDD and various life events and suggest that PMDD is a culture-bound phenomenon. Women who met PMDD criteria would have had experienced significantly more physical and sexual abuse, interpersonal problems, and mistreatment at work than women who did not meet the diagnostic criteria. In addition, women in Western Europe and North America appear to be at greater risk of having PMDD. Third, although no biological markers have systematically been associated with PMDD, notable differences on some gene of women with PMDD have recently been identified. However, biological markers that are characteristic of women with PMDD could be the result of traumatic antecedents rather than the unique cause of this psychological distress. Finally, the work group claims that some predictive factors, which predict the PMDD symptoms’ and response to drug therapy, tend to confirm its existence. The fact that symptoms reappear at each cycle would demonstrate the disorder's periodicity and stability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of medications (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors- SSRI) in treating this disorder has been a significant factor in the decision of its inclusion in the DSM-5. Nevertheless, the central role played by treatment response in PDMM validation has been challenged by some researchers. Scientific literature review urges to be careful regarding PMDD's place in the diagnostic textbook. Indeed, additional studies concerning discrimination of PMDD from other disorders, life event's role, intercultural issues, and biological correlates are warranted to confirm its validity. To conclude, the arguments raised in the current paper are not intended to invalidate the existence of women's premenstrual symptoms or emotional distress that some women may experience, but rather to debate on the legitimacy of PMDD's inclusion as a “disorder” in psychiatric textbooks and diagnostic manuals. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Using a between-groups design and random assignment, this study examined 214 Turkish children's (M = 11.66 years) mindreading and general reasoning about in-group members (Turks), similar out-group members (Syrians within Turkey) and dissimilar out-group members (Northern Europeans). Children heard four mindreading and four general reasoning stories with in-group or out-group members as targets. Whereas children's general reasoning about three groups was equivalent, accuracy of mental state inferences differed by target with more accurate mindreading of in-group targets compared to both sets of out-group targets. In this Turkish sample, mindreading of Syrian targets was the least accurate. Prejudice and perceived realistic threat predicted lower mindreading. These findings have important implications for understanding how similarity and intergroup processes play a role in children's mindreading. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - This article tests the hypothesis that self-development plays a role in the offset of childhood amnesia; assessing the importance of both the capacity to anchor a memory to the self-concept, and the strength of the self-concept as an anchor. This research demonstrates for the first time that the volume of 3- to 6-year old's specific autobiographical memories is predicted by both the volume of their self-knowledge, and their capacity for self-source monitoring within self-referencing paradigms (N = 186). Moreover, there is a bidirectional relation between self and memory, such that autobiographical memory mediates the link between self-source monitoring and self-knowledge. These predictive relations suggest that the self-memory system is active in early childhood. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (LGBQ+) youth’s sexual and reproductive health is often framed as “at-risk.” For LGBQ+ young people who inhabit multiple marginalized statuses, such as lesbian, bisexual, or queer (LBQ+) Latinas, managing these risk discourses and their health may be even more complicated. The perspectives of LBQ+ youth of color can elucidate how risk discourses hinge on multiple, intersecting axes to shape youth’s sexual and reproductive health when their sexual identities are also stigmatized. We employ an intersectional analysis to qualitatively explore 30 LBQ+ Latina young adults’ encounters with sexual and reproductive health risk discourses. Findings show how some LBQ+ Latinas had to manage the constraints of heteronormative health discourses in maintaining their health. Relatedly, some participants emphasized their struggles in navigating barriers to sexual and reproductive health care, often stemming from fears of experiencing prejudice and discrimination. Finally, certain LBQ+ Latina young people challenged negative stereotypical discourses by conceptualizing their sexual identity/behavior as health promotive and engaged in proactive and preventative health behaviors. Our study challenges the theoretical focus of individual risk among marginalized youth to highlight how this framing eclipses structural conditions and how intersecting risk discourses shape and constrain youth’s sexual and reproductive autonomy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article explores the representation of the figure of the effeminate boy in two contemporary adolescent novels written in Chinese which break the silence in addressing alternative gender and sexual identities. In A Beautiful Heart, the transsexual and homosexual tendencies evinced by an effeminate boy are treated as forms of sexual perversion to be cured through professional psychotherapy. The narrative’s tensions and contradictions, however, call into question the reductive discourse of pathology. Such questioning unsettles, but does not subvert, the text’s explicit conservatism, nor does it attribute legitimacy to queer identities. The Dream of A Beautiful Lad, on the other hand, sets out expressly to interrogate and shatter the monopoly of received opinions about boyhood, gender, maturity and adulthood. In presenting cases of gender nonconformity, however, the text reveals its own complicity in binarism, carrying with it strong traces of androgynous humanism which, in its intention to validate queer existence, is inevitably coloured by heteronormative and heterosexist prejudices. It is concluded that the various forms of gender-crossing and trans-phenomena represented as accompanying queer boyhood do not necessarily entail transcendence or subversion. The figure of the effeminate boy is nonetheless a welcome presence in children’s and adolescent literature, unleashing possibilities for resistance and intervention in a rigidly gender-defined society. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine the adaptation process of international medical school students to university life in Turkey. Methods: The mixed method design study, including all the international students (n=127) studying at Ege University School of Medicine, is employed. Qualitative data were collected from 23 students selected by purposive sampling technique. Two instruments were utilized for collecting data: Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ) and Brief COPE. Focus group interviews were performed for qualitative data collection. Results: The mean SACQ score of the medical students was found to be 407.44 (SD=68.29). The Academic Adjustment category included the themes of educational goals, different studying habits, accommodation, academic advisor, and scholarship. The Social Adjustment category included the themes of social interaction and support, differences, longing for family, discrimination and its effects on social life. The Personal/Emotional adjustment category included themes of psychological and physiological health problems. The Goal Commitment/Institutional Attachment category included themes of academic and social adaptation as well as the student' communication with education management. Conclusions: This study identifies to light critical issues in supporting international students with adaptation problems to university life in Turkey. It is clear that revising the content of education programs to enable international exchange is not sufficient enough by itself to meet the needs of international students.

AB  - Background: People may be stigmatized if they have mental illness, emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), or physical or intellectual disabilities. Being stigmatized adversely affects one's psychological well-being and quality of life. While occupational therapists frequently work with people with EBD and disabilities, all healthcare practitioners may encounter these populations, and stigmatizing attitudes of healthcare professionals towards such clients can negatively affect the therapeutic relationship, evaluation, and treatment. Therefore, understanding attitudes of healthcare students - as future practitioners in all fields of healthcare - towards people in this regard is fundamental to the future implementation of anti-stigma programs. We aimed to develop and test questionnaires for examining stigmatizing attitudes of healthcare students towards people with mental illness or disabilities and children with EBD. Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify surveys related to attitudes towards people with mental illness, EBD, and disabilities. Items that were pertinent to the concept of stigma were selected and modified to fit into the Taiwanese context. A total of 336 students from departments of occupational therapy, physical therapy, nursing, and medicine in 7 universities across Taiwan completed the questionnaires. Item analysis and factor analysis were used to examine the reliability and validity of the questionnaires. Gender differences were also considered. Results: Factor analyses of the three questionnaires yielded factor structures that explained 61.34 to 67.15% of the variance, with Cronbach's α values ranging from 0.71 to 0.89. The Questionnaire on Stigmatizing Attitudes Towards Mental Illness consisted of 16 items with 4 subscales: deviant behavior, social isolation, negative stereotype, and self-stigma. The Questionnaire on Stigmatizing Attitudes Towards Children with EBD consisted of 14 items with 3 subscales: rejective attitude, negative stereotype, and deviant behavior. The Questionnaire on Stigmatizing Attitudes Towards Disabilities consisted of 10 items with 3 subscales: positive stereotype, negative stereotype, and pessimistic expectation. In addition, men had slightly higher stigmatizing attitudes than women. Conclusions: The results showed satisfactory factor structures and internal consistency, and thus support the use of these questionnaires to understand attitudes of healthcare students towards these populations. In addition, particular attention should be paid to gender differences in stigmatizing attitudes of healthcare students. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The history of Giovanni Falconi's career and his vaccination campaigns is two hundred years old. It is however very relevant today because of the widespread negative social opinion against vaccination at that time, opinions which seem to have re-emerged even in the current century. In his very important role of “Vaccine Conservator” (a sort of national supervisor for the quality of vaccinations), he clashed with the prejudice of the people and with the anti-scientific attitudes of some of his illustrious colleagues. He investigated how to simplify the procedure with a smallpox needle that became known as “Falconi's Needle” or “Falconian Needle”. Falconi also made several experiments on smallpox vaccine preparation and was a supporter of the use of “animal” and “humanized” formulas despite the prejudice regarding the latter. Due to his profound anatomical knowledge and the strength of mind that characterized him, he was able to follow evidence-based scientific principles in his methods. Thanks to this he managed to convince people not to oppose vaccinations. He also succeeded in bringing the number of vaccinated people to exceed the number of newborns, a great achievement that led to remarkable progress in Italy and the rescue of thousands of lives throughout Europe. Unfortunately, it was not possible to find a copy of this instrument, which required the author to have the needle reconstructed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Importance: Women and black physicians encounter workplace challenges because of their gender and race. It is unclear whether these individuals are assessed with lower patient satisfaction or confidence ratings compared with white male physicians. Objective: To examine whether physician gender and race affect participant ratings in scenarios in which physician competence is challenged. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized trial enrolled a geographically diverse sample of 3592 online respondents in the United States who were recruited from 2 crowdsourcing platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 1741) and Lucid (n = 1851). A 2 × 2 factorial design for the gender and race of simulated physicians was conducted between March 9 and July 25, 2018. Participants were excluded before intervention if they were younger than 18 years, were pregnant, or had a history of cancer or abdominal surgical procedures. Interventions: A clinical vignette was presented to the participant with a picture of the emergency department physician. Participants were randomly assigned to physicians with different gender and race, with 823 assigned to black women, 791 to black men, 828 to white women, and 835 to white men. A contradictory diagnosis from an online symptom checker introduced doubt about the clinical diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: A composite outcome (range, 0-100, with 0 representing low patient confidence and satisfaction and 100 representing the maximum on the composite scale) measured participant (1) confidence in the physician, (2) satisfaction with care, (3) likelihood to recommend the physician, (4) trust in the physician's diagnosis, and (5) likelihood to request additional tests. Results: Among 3277 adult participants, complete data were available for 3215 (median age, 49 years [range, 18-89 years]; 1667 [52%] female; 2433 [76%] white). No significant differences were observed in participant satisfaction and physician confidence for the white male physician control physicians (mean composite score, 66.13 [95% CI, 64.76-67.51]) compared with white female (mean composite score, 66.50 [95% CI, 65.19-67.82]), black female (mean composite score, 67.36 [95% CI, 66.03-68.69]), and black male (mean composite score, 66.96 [95% CI, 65.55-68.36]) physicians. Machine learning with bayesian additive regression trees revealed no evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity as a function of participants' race, gender, racial prejudice, or sexism. Conclusions and Relevance: No significant differences were observed for simulated patients' evaluations of female or black physicians, suggesting that bias in favor of white male physicians is negligible in survey-based measures of patient satisfaction.

AB  - Introduction Migrant women consistently rate their care during labour and birth more negatively than non-migrant women, due to communication difficulties, lack of familiarity with how care is provided, and discrimination and prejudicial staff attitudes. They also report being left alone, feeling fearful, unsafe and unsupported, and have poorer birth outcomes than non-migrant women. Community-based doulas (CBDs) are bilingual women from migrant communities who are trained in childbirth and labour support, and who facilitate communication between woman-partner-staff during childbirth. This study protocol describes the design, rationale and methods of a randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CBD support for improving the intrapartum care experiences and postnatal well-being of migrant women giving birth in Sweden. Methods and analysis A randomised controlled trial. From six antenatal care clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, we aim to recruit 200 pregnant Somali, Arabic, Polish, Russian and Tigrinya-speaking women who cannot communicate fluently in Swedish, are 18 years or older and with no contraindications for vaginal birth. In addition to standard labour support, women are randomised to CBD support (n=100) or no such support during labour (n=100). Trained CBDs meet with women once or twice before the birth, provide emotional, physical and communication support to women throughout labour and birth in hospital, and then meet with women once or twice after the birth. Women's ratings of the intrapartum care experiences and postnatal well-being are assessed at 6-8 weeks after the birth using selected questions from the Migrant Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire and by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. The intervention group will be compared with the control group using intention-to-treat analyses. ORs and 95% CIs will be estimated and adjustments made if key participant characteristics differ between trial arms.

AB  - This paper focuses on how to use critical reflection in social work education in order to encourage students to critically reflect on their standards regarding assessment, opinions and values about aging. Material, both oral and written, from needs assessments of older persons conducted by 106 social work students was analyzed. The result shows that the students initially interpreted needs based on prejudice and assumptions about aging. However, when using Schön´s three steps of reflection in the exercise, together with knowledge of critical social work theories, students became more concerned and reflected more critically on their assessments. This study shows the possibilities of working with pedagogical exercises in order to increase the awareness and critical knowledge of social work students in order to attempt to reduce discrimination. Educating students in critical social work enables them to learn how to comment on and transform the profession of social work and our unjust society, while questioning their own as well as society’s prejudice regarding the needs of elderly persons. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines the extent to which generational change is likely to be producing attitude change on the issue of immigration in Europe. Using multi-level modelling on seven rounds of the European Social Survey (2002–2014) and 16 European countries, we investigate the question of whether there are significant differences in anti-immigration sentiment between cohorts of Europeans, focusing on the roles that education and far-right mobilisation are likely to play in the process of generational change. The paper’s findings indicate that it is the most educated amongst the youngest cohorts who appear to be persistently more positive about immigration, even controlling for aging processes, but this combined effect of cohort and education diminishes for younger cohorts socialised in the context of a strong far-right anti-immigration presence. Thus, generational-change-induced attitude change in the realm of immigration attitudes may be occurring but this is likely to be dependent on individuals having adequate education skills to process the vast changes brought by immigration; in contexts where the far-right is likely to be mobilising anti-immigration sentiment these education skills appear to have a more limited impact on attitudes to immigration. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We introduce a cross-national survey experimental design which combines three different sources of potential variation in migration attitudes – migrant characteristics, native respondent characteristics and national context. Our survey experiment tests the impact of randomly assigned cues for migrant skills (professional or unskilled) and origins (European or non-European) in twenty-one national contexts. In order to make the origins cue both contextually relevant while retaining comparability across contexts, we use the largest poorer European and non-European source countries for migrants in each country as our origins cue. We find that the ‘skills premium’ observed in previous research is universal – in all of our contexts native respondents are more willing to accept skilled professional migrants than unskilled migrants, but with considerable variation in effect size between countries. We find that a significant preference for European over non-European migrants exists in the majority of our countries, but varies a great deal between contexts, and is insignificant in several countries, suggesting that this ‘European premium’ is more contingent than the ‘skills premium’. The two treatment effects are unrelated at the national level, and show only a modest interaction at the individual level, suggesting preferences for high skills and European origins are largely independent of each other. We find no evidence that treatment effects are related to views about the overall impact of immigration at the national level or the individual level. However, some individual attitudes – in particular racial prejudice, social distance and support for anti-discrimination legislation – predict variation in responses to the experimental cues. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - What factors explain majority members’ anti-Muslim prejudice? This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members’ negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration–our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Based on ESS-7 data, this paper focuses on two attitudinal dimensions about public policies related to immigration: how many can come and who can come. In this context, the hypothesis concerning the bi-dimensionality of racism was supported and, as predicted, biological racism is more anti-normative than cultural racism. Both biological and cultural racism predict opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria on the selection of immigrants. As hypothesised, the relationship between racism and opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria is mediated by threat perceptions. Specifically, symbolic and realistic threats mediate the effect of biological and cultural racism on opposition to immigration and on ethnicist criteria. The hypothesis that the mediation effects are moderated by the country’s quality of democracy was supported, indicating that the mediation effects are stronger in countries with a higher quality of democracy. Results are discussed within the context of racism theories as a bi-dimensional concept and in the framework of the role of legitimation processes in social discrimination. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The present paper contributes to the literature on the formation of attitudes and public views toward out-group populations by focusing on the relations between actual versus perceived and misperceived size of immigrant population (as indicators of competitive threat) and attitudes toward immigration. The analysis is conducted in the context of 17 European societies. The data for the analysis were obtained from the 2014 European Social Survey (ESS). The main findings lead to the conclusion that misperceptions of the size of immigrant population play a more important role than factual reality in shaping public views and attitudes toward immigration. Although perceived size is not totally detached from actual size, the discrepancy between actual and perceived size is found to be a more powerful predictor of opposition to immigration than actual size. The more inflated is the misperception the more pronounced is opposition to immigration. The impact of misperceptions, when measured as a discrepancy or a ratio, on anti-immigrant attitudes is more pronounced in countries with, proportionally, a large foreign-born population. The meaning of the findings and the relevance of misperceptions and cognitive maps in shaping public views are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Past research has found that several brain event-related potentials (ERPs) were sensitive to the perception of ethnic differences displayed on human faces. This body of research suggests that the phenomenon of “race perception” involves a cascade of cognitive processes that includes both automatic and overt attentional mechanisms. However, most of these studies used stimuli depicting whole faces rather than stimuli depicting separate facial features. Therefore, it is still largely unknown if ERP responses to racial differences are the result of a holistic processing of the whole face, or whether they can be accounted for by the perception of single facial features. To address this issue, we examined whether a single facial feature, the eyes region, can provide sufficient information to trigger known ERP correlates of race perception such as the P2, the N400 and the Late Positive Complex (LPC). Specifically, we showed pictures depicting only the eyes region of Caucasian and Asian faces to a sample of Asian participants. We found that the P2 was larger for other-race (OR) compared to same-race (SR) eyes, and that the N400 was larger for SR compared to OR eyes. The effects on the P2 may suggest an enhanced vigilance response to OR eyes whereas the N400 effect could reflect a signal of familiarity triggered by SR eyes. These results indicate that a specific facial feature, the eyes region, can account for known effects of race perception on early brain potentials. Our findings also indicate that well-known early neural correlates of race perception can be triggered in the absence of a holistic processing of the whole face. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Stigma towards people diagnosed with a severe mental disorder (SMD) is one of the main obstacles for these service users to receive timely and relevant healthcare. This study was undertaken to understand how stigmatizing attitudes are demonstrated towards people with SMD in primary healthcare centers (PHC) from the perspective of those affected and primary healthcare professionals. Methods: We used a qualitative exploratory research design to contrast the differences and similarities regarding stigmatizing attitudes towards people with SMD in primary healthcare centers (PHC) from the perspective of two groups: (i) people diagnosed with a severe mental disorder, and (ii) healthcare professionals. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and discussion groups and subsequently analyzed using Atlas.ti software. Results: Our results indicate that both service users and healthcare professionals manifest stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminatory behavior in health care. In addition, structural aspects of the health system and organizational culture appear to contribute to stigmatization. Both groups agreed that there is a need for healthcare professionals to have more education, specialization, and skill development related to mental health issues. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce the stigma towards people with SMD in PHC must consider delivery of information about mental disorders, development of skills in the healthcare professionals, and modifications in the culture of the health centers. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The policies and discourses of the Trump administration reflect such extreme examples of inhumane policies and racializing logic that they are easy to identify and call out. In this essay, I focus instead on the less obvious and more everyday processes of racialization and anti-immigrant sentiment that are taken up by various actors in schools. I consider how tropes and stories generated by nationalist policies and discourses around the world seep into teachers’ commonsense understandings about who immigrant students are and what they require to be successful. In doing so, I draw on Michael Agar’s (1986) notion of the ethnographic “breakdown” to explore individual breakdown moments in my own research in a Danish public school and teaching in a US school of teacher education as a useful mechanism for discerning how policies and discourses shape everyday exclusions in schools. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Food consumption and nourishment are related to the availability and use of resources by different social groups within a country. Communities experience hunger not just due to biophysical restrictions, but also their socio-cultural conditions. For this reason, international scientific cooperation seeking to improve nourishment must be interdisciplinary and connected to disciplines covering all relevant dimensions, including hunger, health and well-being, gender, and inter-ethnic relations. Studies on constraints and drivers of food consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa indicate that although women make decisions regarding the type of meals consumed, they lack control over food production, especially on small farms. While the term gender equally is commonly found in discourses on nourishment projects, knowledge regarding gender programs and education for men in remote patriarchal villages in Eastern Africa is rare. To close this research gap, this study seeks to understand (1) basic notions of masculinities and femininities of this inter-ethnic group; and (2) how traditional knowledge can influence decisions related to Unpaid Care Work and nourishment. The case study area is inhabited by the Wagogo, a predominantly pastoralist and patrilineal tribe practicing settled agriculture or migrating to urban areas throughout Tanzania. To achieve these research goals, we explicitly develop pedagogical strategies to interact with adults living in the villages, separated into men and women. These pedagogical tools encompass Nutritional Education involving 80 participants, including female and male farmers, community leaders, primary school teachers, and health professionals. Based in time-use field of knowledge and proposed activities based on participatory methods, we established bonds of trust with the community, initiating a truly open dialogue about food consumption and decision-making. This study reinforces the need to address the ethnic identities of the researched regions in order to not just comprehend the traditions and culture, but also the food and nutrition of the indigenous people. © Copyright © 2020 Schlindwein, Bonatti, Bundala, Naser, Löhr, Hoffmann, Sieber and Rybak.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of socio-demographic factors on ethnic tolerance (ET) and religious tolerance (RT) as well as the participation of the local community in peacebuilding in post-ethnic violent conflicts in a multi-cultural society. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in the rural areas of Indonesia, on the basis of an empirical study that was performed in Lampung, a province at the southern tip of Sumatra. Data were collected through a survey of 500 respondents from five districts susceptible to ethnic conflicts. From each district, two villages that experienced ethnic conflicts were chosen and from each village, 50 respondents were randomly selected. To strengthen the explanation of quantitative data, in-depth interviews were also conducted with another 50 residents, five informants from each of ten villages. Informants comprised community leaders or traditional leaders, local police officers, local military officers and district government officials. Findings: First, the degree of tolerance is not specifically concentrated in the socio-demographic characteristics. Second, ET affects RT. Third, local community participation in peacebuilding in post-ethnic violent conflicts is not influenced by the socio-demographic characteristics but is influenced by ET and RT. The socio-cultural approach is the main strategy for peacebuilding in post-ethnic (and religious) conflicts in multi-cultural societies. The weakness of inter-ethnic relations soon improves in the post-peace period through the reconstruction of social and cultural factors to strengthen social cohesion and social capital at the local community level by involving various stakeholders Originality/value: This paper is a valuable source of information regarding current research on the role of local communities in strengthening and building peace in post-ethnic violent conflicts in multi-cultural societies. © 2020, Hartoyo Hartoyo, Haryanto Sindung, Fahmi Teuku and Sunarto Sunarto.

AB  - Australia is one of the last Western countries to legalize marriage between same-sex couples. Research suggests that the delay in marriage equality may be a consequence of societies’ conceptual connection between marriage and family being an ultimately heterosexual experience. The aim of this study was to investigate attitudes toward same-sex parenting within the marriage equality debate. Members of an Australian sample (n = 436) were randomly allocated to 1 of 9 conditions, where they received a vignette of either a heterosexual couple, a male same-sex couple, or female same-sex couple in 1 of 3 family structures (marriage/no children; marriage/children; no marriage/children). Participants rated their level of acceptance toward their allocated vignette, deciding whether the couple deserved the same rights as anyone else. Results demonstrated a significant division between acceptance of same-sex couples and heterosexual couples getting married and having children, with more negative attitudes toward same-sex couples present. Findings also highlighted a prejudice toward couples having children out of wedlock, regardless of sexual orientation of the couple. The implication for marriage equality advocates is challenging society attitudes toward marriage and family, by educating the community about same-sex parenting as well as parenting beyond marriage. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - (1) Background: Increasing waves of immigration have not only changed the demographic features of European societies but have also had important implications for intergroup relationships. Based on the theoretical model of intergroup threat theory, this study examined whether and to what extent intergroup anxiety mediates the relationship between antecedents and attitudes toward asylum seekers. (2) Method: In a sample of 470 Italians (mean age 30.21), using a survey-based study, we assessed the antecedent of intergroup anxiety (national identification) and its consequences (classical and modern prejudice). (3) Results: The results supported most of the expected predictions. While intergroup anxiety was positively associated with prejudice toward asylum seekers, national identity was positively related to intergroup anxiety and prejudice. Moreover, the relationships between antecedents and consequences were mediated by intergroup anxiety. (4) Conclusion: This study has identified antecedents that can potentially increase or decrease intergroup anxiety and proposes certain strategies for improving social inclusion policies and relationships between asylum seekers and settled communities. The implications for future studies are discussed. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Mental illness is a global public health crisis. Although rates of untreated cases stand as a primary problem, stigma is a significant obstacle. Yet, global differences in levels and roots of stigma remain poorly understood. Using the Stigma in Global Context–Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) data, we analyzed data on two components of stigma—prejudice and discriminatory potential—attached to clinically diagnostic cases of depression and schizophrenia. We examined whether stigma was higher in the East than West. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the link between prejudice and discriminatory potential in the East was due, in part, to cultural differences in the attributions about mental illness. With SGC-MHS’ nationally representative vignette data from over 11,000 respondents in 11 relevant countries (four Eastern, seven Western), analyses replicated past research of higher levels of stigma and more moral attributions in Eastern countries, particularly for depression. Moreover, prejudice-related disclosure spillover concerns predicted discriminatory potential (social distance) in the East, but not the West; this was driven by a greater emphasis on moral attributions in the East. Finally, exploratory analyses found that Western respondents endorsed higher discrimination for minority (vs. majority) group members with mental illness. In Eastern countries, the same pattern emerged for schizophrenia, but the reverse occurred for depression—greater stigma for majority as compared with minority group members. Together, these findings suggest that cultural differences in the sources of prejudice and attributions about the etiology of mental illness contribute, at least in part, to global differences in the profile of stigma. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - (1) Background: The population of older adults is growing faster but most of them experience physical, psychological, and social limitations. Higher education should reflect these concerns by providing students appropriate skills to support a sustainable society and putting the acquired theoretical knowledge into practice. Intergenerational Service Learning (SL) is an educational approach capable of contributing to these requirements. The goal of the study was to analyze the effects of an intergenerational SL program from the complementary perspective of the different agents involved. (2) Methods: The study used hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, widely used in educational research. A total of 23 (three female) Physical Education Teacher Education students (PETEs) and 20 older adults (three male) participated. Reflective journals were used for PETEs and semi-structured group interviews for older adults. (3) Results: The following categories emerged from PETEs: social sensitivity and disconfirmation of negative stereotypes, academic and professional learnings, satisfaction and personal growth, and desire for social justice. From older adults, four complementary categories emerged: disconfirmation of negative stereotypes, improvement of physical function, satisfaction and desire of continuity, and social interaction. (4) Conclusions: Intergenerational SL offers important social and educational inputs by deconstructing negative stereotypes and providing positive experiences to both PETEs and older adults. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This paper evaluates a method of generating a unique dataset that has been underused—a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. The UK’s FOI Act came into force in 2005, allowing the public to make requests of publicly held data. We set out to understand the determinants of the quality responses to FOI requests. We also explain how requests can be made and provide suggestions to construct effective data-driven requests. We applied for data on hate crime from all police forces and on uptake of maternity leave from all universities. We find that observable characteristics of the local area, police force and universities neither determine whether the request was fulfilled, nor the speed of response, suggesting that the data from these FOI requests are representative of the institutions from which they were requested. © 2020 Clifton-Sprigg et al.

AB  - Background. U.S. medical schools have been unsuccessful in creating a diverse physician workforce. Implicit bias is pervasive in medicine, including potentially in medical school admissions. Methods. We invited all 2018–2019 interviewees at one U.S. medical school to complete the eight-item Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) asking about experiences of bias during interview experiences to date. Results. Three hundred forty-seven (30%) of 1,175 interviewees completed the survey, with participant demographic characteristics matching those of the broader interviewee pool. Seventy-two (21%) responded affirmatively to one or more EDS items. Gender, age, race, religion, and sexual orientation were all sources of discrimination. Those reporting bias had completed more interviews (5.2 vs. 3.9, P<.05) and were more likely to be Latinx (30.6% vs. 16.4%, P<.05) than their counterparts. Only three (4%) reported the incident to the institution where it occurred. Conclusion. Further work exploring experiences of bias during medical school admissions and how to decrease their frequency is warranted. © Meharry Medical College.

AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out-group), controlling for face-to-face and online contacts with both out-groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown—regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in-depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative-positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward “others” for society at large. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with social-emotional difficulties, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as early as toddlerhood. The aim of the current study was to understand whether economically disadvantaged children's beliefs about the consequences and correlates of poverty (poverty stereotypes) and their beliefs about their personal economic disadvantage contribute to their social-emotional functioning. Interviews were conducted with 94 socioeconomically diverse 4- to 9-year-old children, whose parents reported on their social-emotional functioning and family socioeconomic disadvantage. As hypothesized, among relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged children, perceived disadvantage was associated with social-emotional functioning. The same relation was not found for relatively socioeconomically advantaged children. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed higher levels of personal disadvantage had more attention problems and more anxious-depressive symptoms than socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed lower levels of personal disadvantage. In addition, only among socioeconomically disadvantaged children (and not among relatively advantaged children) was negative stereotyping associated with attention problems. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed more negative stereotypes had higher levels of attention problems. There was no evidence of an association between negative stereotyping and anxious-depressive symptoms and no moderation of this relation by socioeconomic status. Implications and directions for future research are discussed in light of several relevant theoretical frameworks, including stigma consciousness, status anxiety, and critical consciousness.

AB  - There is increasing scientific and public support for the notion that some foods may be addictive, and that poor weight control and obesity may, for some people, stem from having a food addiction. However, it remains unclear how a food addiction model (FAM) explanation for obesity and weight control will affect weight stigma. In two experiments (N = 530 and N = 690), we tested the effect of a food addiction explanation for obesity and weight control on weight stigma. In Experiment 1, participants who received a FAM explanation for weight control and obesity reported lower weight stigma scores (e.g., less dislike of ‘fat people’, and lower personal willpower blame) than those receiving an explanation emphasizing diet and exercise (F(4,525) = 7.675, p = 0.006; and F(4,525) = 5.393, p = 0.021, respectively). In Experiment 2, there was a significant group difference for the dislike of ‘fat people’ stigma measure (F(5,684) = 5.157, p = 0.006), but not for personal willpower weight stigma (F(5,684) = 0.217, p = 0.81). Participants receiving the diet and exercise explanation had greater dislike of ‘fat people’ than those in the FAM explanation and control group (p values < 0.05), with no difference between the FAM and control groups (p >0.05). The FAM explanation for weight control and obesity did not increase weight stigma and resulted in lower stigma than the diet and exercise explanation that attributes obesity to personal control. The results highlight the importance of health messaging about the causes of obesity and the need for communications that do not exacerbate weight stigma. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Political conflict sometimes spills over into unrelated areas of our lives. A growing literature documents examples of partisan considerations influencing judgments and behaviors in ostensibly nonpolitical contexts such as the workplace, academia, and dating, among others. To date, the focus has been on demonstrating these phenomena, with scant consideration of their downstream effects. When politics spills over into nonpolitical settings—that is, when political considerations influence nonpolitical judgments or behaviors—what are the consequences? I address this question with a novel theory and a nationally representative survey experiment. I find that norms exist regarding the spillover of political considerations into nonpolitical matters—and that spillover can have its own political consequences. When one's copartisans discriminate against members of the other party, it can lead to decreased partisan identification and depolarization. Partisan discrimination in nonpolitical settings can—in some sense ironically—reduce affective polarization. That said, partisans also appear to hold a double standard: They expect copartisans to give an edge to fellow copartisans. © 2019 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Research on team leadership has primarily focused on leadership processes targeted within teams, in support of team objectives. Yet, teams are open systems that interact with other teams to achieve proximal as well as distal goals. This review clarifies that defining ‘what’ constitutes functionally effective leadership in interteam contexts requires greater precision with regard to where (within teams, across teams) and why (team goals, system goals) leadership processes are enacted, as well as greater consideration of when and among whom leadership processes arise. We begin by synthesizing findings from empirical studies published over the past 30 years that shed light on questions of what, where, why, when, and who related to interteam leadership and end by providing three overarching recommendations for how research should proceed in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of leadership in interteam contexts. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a marked increase in partisan social polarization, leaving scholars in search of solutions to partisan conflict. The psychology of intergroup relations identifies empathy as one of the key mechanisms that reduces intergroup conflict, and some have suggested that a lack of empathy has contributed to partisan polarization. Yet, empathy may not always live up to this promise. We argue that, in practice, the experience of empathy is biased toward one's ingroup and can actually exacerbate political polarization. First, using a large, national sample, we demonstrate that higher levels of dispositional empathic concern are associated with higher levels of affective polarization. Second, using an experimental design, we show that individuals high in empathic concern show greater partisan bias in evaluating contentious political events. Taken together, our results suggest that, contrary to popular views, higher levels of dispositional empathy actually facilitate partisan polarization.

AB  - Political polarization and far-right movements across the West are thought to be partly driven by beliefs that white people face discrimination in societies that supposedly favour non-white people. We compared perceptions of racial discrimination with reported discrimination experiences in large, US national samples to shed light on the veracity of such beliefs. Regarding experiences, we find that white people consistently experienced less discrimination than black people, and that declines in anti-black discrimination have not coincided with increases in anti-white discrimination. Regarding perceptions, respondents overall did not express zero-sum discrimination beliefs. Moreover, black respondents and Democrats perceived that black people face much more discrimination than white people, whereas white respondents and Republicans perceived a smaller discrimination gap between black and white people, relative to reported discrimination experiences. Overall, improvements for black people do not seem to coincide with disadvantages for white people, and discrimination perceptions differ from reported discrimination experiences. Implications for racial attitudes, political polarization and voting behaviour are discussed. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Existing trust research has often failed to account for the possibility that communication impairments brought on by language barriers could explain low levels of trust both within and between countries. To test whether this is the case, I construct an ‘index of communication potential’ for a sample of 359 cross-country dyads composed of 21 European countries. Although similar indexes have been used previously, this is the first one to include instances of ‘semi-communication’ between related languages when calculating communication potential. Multiple regression analysis indicated not only that greater communication potential was associated with greater cross-country trust, but that this relationship was monotonic: semi-communication was also associated with greater trust, but the link was weaker than for actually sharing a language. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Patients who suffer from substance use disorder (SUD) might receive services from different service providers in an opioid maintenance treatment programme (OMT) and have a widespread and complex need for nursing. Background: Literature reveals that prejudices against people with SUD exist. There is a lack of studies exploring patients with SUD experiences of preserving their dignity in the encounter with healthcare staff. The aim of the study was to gain insight into the meaning of dignity for patients with SUD. Methods: The research design was descriptive and interpretative. In the interpretation of qualitative in-depth interviews with six patients, a hermeneutical approach based on Gadamer (Truth and method, Sheed & Ward, London, UK, 1989) was used. Results: Analysis resulted in three mains themes about the meaning of dignity: (a) The material dimension. (b) To be respected by others. (c) The inner experience. Factors enhancing dignity in the encounters were as follows: (a) Being respected and acknowledged. (b) Being cared for. (c) Knowledge and persistent relation. Factors depriving dignity were as follows: (a) Stigma and prejudice. (b) Insufficient relations and lack of confirmation. (c) Experiencing disrespectful/patronising attitudes and lack of knowledge. Conclusions: The material dimension of dignity containing an aesthetically aspect was important for these patients. Dignity was also experienced as strongly connected to respect. Dignity can be enhanced by treating patients with SUD with understanding and respect, and dignity can be inhibited through stigmatization of patients with SUD, as well as by caregivers’ lack of knowledge. Relevance to clinical practice: The study clarifies a need for more knowledge about SUD among healthcare staff, as well as promotes ethical awareness in encounters with patients regardless of their background. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and prejudices of nursing students regarding the provision of transcultural nursing care to refugees. Methods: The sample of this comparative descriptive study was composed of 317 volunteering nursing students living in Ankara, Turkey. Descriptive statistics were presented as number, percentage, and mean ± standard deviation. The relationships among dependent and independent variables were analyzed with Pearson chi-square test. p ≤ 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the students was 21.19 ± 1.66 years; 88.6% were female. Only 30.0% (n = 95) of students (predominantly seniors) were educated on transcultural nursing. Statistically significant differences were found among grades of nursing students on the answers to the items, “Refugees are under coverage of general medical insurance system,” “The concept of ‘Health’ differs from culture to culture,” “Cultural features of the patient are important for caring nurse,” “In order to provide care to only refugees and foreign patients, nurses from other cultures should be employed in hospitals,” “Interpreters should be employed in hospitals 24 hours for services for refugees,” and “According to my observations, refugees and their relatives admitted to the hospital are not respecting the healthcare workers and hospital rules.” In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in students' comfort level with nursing care activities between those students who were literate in a foreign language and those who were not literate in a foreign language. Conclusions: Our findings show that attending lectures on transcultural nursing in a curriculum of seniors and being literate in a foreign language had a positive impact on the attitudes of students in terms of the provision of medical care to refugees. It is recommended that nursing programs integrate lectures on transcultural nursing into the curricula of all four grades of nursing education and encourage students in language learning to better serve our disadvantageous guests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We explore the idea that humor focused on social group disparities can be a viable tool to reduce some of the negative outcomes associated with interracial interactions. These interactions are crucial in promoting common understanding about the causes of social, educational, and economic disparities and crafting solutions to redress them. However, investigations have demonstrated that interracial interactions can be emotionally and cognitively taxing, and for these reasons are often avoided. When not avoided, these interactions often result in negative outcomes. Anxiety has been identified as a key factor in these outcomes as majority group members cope with concerns over appearing biased and minority group members cope with concerns over being discriminated against. Humor may be able to alleviate anxiety that contributes to negative outcomes associated with intergroup dialogue. To explore this claim, we first review the literature on interracial interactions and the role of anxiety in shaping them. We then discuss investigations exploring the impact of group-related humor, specifically disparagement humor, on intergroup perceptions. Finally, we draw from both literatures to consider factors that might determine race-related humor's potential to facilitate positive interracial dialogue through anxiety reduction. We conclude with some possible areas for further research. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Here, we integrate two influential psychological theories: social-identity theory and self-determination theory. Whereas social-identity theory considers how social identities impact the self, self-determination theory elucidates the psychological necessity of feeling related, competent, and autonomous. In this article, we outline and provide justification for a unified theoretical framework that considers how perceptions of personal relatedness, competence, and autonomy are influenced by perceptions that one’s social group is related, competent, and autonomous. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Perceived discrimination based on criminal record is associated with social determinants of health such as housing and employment. However, there is limited data on discrimination based on criminal record within health care settings. We examined how perceived discrimination based on criminal record within health care settings, among individuals with a history of incarceration, was associated with self-reported general health status. We used data from individuals recruited from 11 sites within the Transitions Clinic Network (TCN) who were released from prison within the prior 6 months, had a chronic health condition and/or were age 50 or older, and had complete information on demographics, medical history, self-reported general health status, and self-reported perceived discrimination (n = 743). Study participants were mostly of minority racial and ethnic background (76%), and had a high prevalence of self-reported chronic health conditions with half reporting mental health conditions and substance use disorders (52% and 50%, respectively), and 85% reporting one or more chronic medical conditions. Over a quarter (27%, n = 203) reported perceived discrimination by health care providers due to criminal record with a higher proportion of individuals with fair or poor health reporting discrimination compared to those in good or excellent health (33% vs. 23%; p =.002). After adjusting for age and reported chronic conditions, participants reporting discrimination due to criminal record had 43% increased odds of reporting fair/poor health (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01–2.03). Race and ethnicity did not modify this relationship. Participants reporting discrimination due to criminal record had increased odds of reporting fair/poor health. The association between perceived discrimination by health care providers due to criminal record and health should be explored in future longitudinal studies among individuals at high risk of incarceration.

AB  - Social psychologists have leveraged social norms messaging about prejudice to improve social climates. Less research, however, has explored how social identities of message sources and recipients (e.g., gender) influence receptivity to these messages. Testing for the effects of source and recipient social identity on message receptivity is not just of theoretical importance, but also has practical implications for who can effectively deliver such messages and whether such messages have unintended negative consequences for disadvantaged group members. In the present research, an experimental design explored whether the effectiveness of an egalitarian social norms message (compared to a control message) depended on source gender, recipient gender, and their interaction, as well as whether the egalitarian social norms message had unintended negative consequences for participants. Results of an experiment with undergraduate participants (N = 434) showed that receiving an egalitarian social norms message (compared to a control message) resulted in more positive diversity attitudes and stronger intentions to confront prejudice, and these effects did not depend on source gender. The egalitarian social norms message, compared to the control message, did not have detrimental effects on members of socially disadvantaged groups, and was evaluated as more beneficial for social climate. Implications for intervention are discussed. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In this article, I adopt the socio-cognitive approach to critical discourse analysis (CDA) to interpret the discourse found on the popular UK radio phone-in programme the Nigel Farage Show. Evidence emerged of positive self-presentation and negative other representation through denials of prejudice, discursive de-racialisation and the use of war metaphors and lexis referencing legality, criminality and the collective. However, the control over this forum was its defining feature which appeared to propagate an anti-immigration stance and normalise the aforementioned lexis. This control was evident through the selection and placement of contributors, the influence of cognitively central participants, the foregrounding of Trump’s rhetoric, topic selection, protection offered to in-group members and topicalisation which supported the in-group and served to vilify the views and identity of the out-group. All of which led to the creation of a closed community devoid of alternatives. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the consumption behaviours of healthcare professionals in relation to red meat and processed red meat products.Design: This study included a questionnaire conducted through face-to-face interviews with 149 health professionals. The purpose of the questionnaire was to determine the extent to which health professionals agreed with the WHO classification of red meat and processed red meat on their list of carcinogenic products.Setting: This research was carried out in İzmir, which is Turkey's third largest city. The survey was conducted in 2016 by holding face to face interviews with forty-three specialist doctors, sixteen doctors, twelve dentists, sixty-four nurses and fourteen pharmacists.Subjects: Nationally representative sample of healthcare professionals in Turkey.Results: People educated in healthcare are especially cautious about the consumption of processed red meat products. The results of the research revealed the importance of processing and cooking patterns in red meat consumption preferences.Conclusions: The consequences of the research, in terms of breaking down prejudices and overcoming the anxieties of those with health concerns who do not consume red meat, are important. In fact, the results show that healthcare professionals consume red meat, but they are more careful in their consumption of processed red meat products. This result is in line with the WHO report. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This research examined the impact of a change in school diversity on school children's intergroup relations. A longitudinal survey tracked 551 White British and Asian British students (Mage = 11.32) transitioning from elementary (time 1) to secondary (time 2) school in an ethnically segregated town in the United Kingdom. We estimated a multivariate, multilevel model. A cross-sectional comparison of segregated schools and a mixed elementary school at time 1 revealed that both Asian and White British in the mixed school reported more positive intergroup relations. A longitudinal analysis found that the transition from segregated elementary to mixed secondary schools was associated with Asian British developing more positive intergroup relations. White British reported overall less positive intergroup relations, although only trust decreased; evidence from other measures remains inconclusive. The findings are important for understanding early stages of diversity exposure, and the impact of changing diversity levels on majority and minority groups. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sexual racism, a form of prejudice enacted in sexual or romantic settings, is a complex phenomenon that can interact with racial stereotypes and media representations of beauty to affect interracial attraction. Research suggests that racialized beauty standards and racial stereotypes can perpetuate broader racist tendencies in social interactions. This study aims to develop a critical understanding of how undergraduate students conceptualize the intersection of race and sexuality, and how racial identity shapes their sexual and romantic experiences. Using a qualitative methodology of survey analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the attitudes and behaviors of students at a large public university in California, and focuses on the thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained during eighteen student interviews. This research identifies three significant themes: (1) the impact of racial stereotypes on interracial attraction, (2) the media’s tendency to perpetuate Whiteness as a standard of beauty, and (3) the harmful consequences of sexual racism on students’ self-esteem and self-worth. Findings suggest that racial stereotypes, beauty standards, and sexual racism are prevalent among this student community and have harmful consequences for students of color, including decreased self-esteem, sexual repercussions, and internalized racism. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study tested the mechanisms by which social stigma contributes to psychological distress in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. A large community sample (N = 4248, M age = 29.9 years, 42.9% female, 57.1% male, 35.7% bisexual, 64.3% lesbian/gay, 9.9% non-white) was recruited using targeted and general advertisements for an online cross-sectional survey. Participants completed measures of childhood gender nonconformity, prejudice events, victimization, microaggressions, sexual orientation concealment, sexual orientation disclosure, expectations of rejection, self-stigma, rumination, and distress. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships between these variables in a model based upon minority stress theory and the integrative mediation framework with childhood gender nonconformity as the initial independent variable and distress (depression, anxiety, and well-being) as the final dependent variable. The results broadly support the hypothesized model. The final model had good fit χ2(37) = 440.99, p &lt;.001, TLI =.96, CFI =.98, RMSEA =.05 [.05,.06] and explained 50.2% of the variance in psychological distress and 24.8% in rumination. Sexual orientation and gender had moderating effects on some individual paths. Results should be considered in the context of the cross-sectional nature of the data, which prevented tests of causality, and self-report measures used, which are vulnerable to bias. Findings indicate strong relationships between minority stressors and psychological distress in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, which are partially accounted for by rumination. These results may inform the development of interventions that address the added burden of minority stress among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Stigma negatively impact quality of life of people with dementia and their family members. Yet the literature in stigma and dementia remains scant. This article systematically reviews manifestations of and associated factors with public-stigma and self-stigma in the context of dementia. After searching and screening on the three major databases of PubMed, Embase, and psycINFO, 26 articles, including 17 quantitative papers and nine qualitative papers, were selected for synthesis. Results show consistently limited knowledge, as well as stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination of public toward people with dementia and their family caregivers. Demographic characteristics of general public were found to be associated with the level of their stigma against dementia. People with dementia and their family caregivers also perceived negative stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination from general public and healthcare professionals. They reported negative feelings of themselves and tended to delay help-seeking. Psychological factors rather than sociodemographic factors shaped self-stigma of people with dementia and their families. This systematic review highlights the need of future studies in both public-stigma and self-stigma in dementia research in different contexts and cultures, as well as the development of evidence-based and culturally competent interventions and mass media campaigns to reconstruct public perception of dementia. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - An increasing number of immigrant students attend Italian schools, with the possibility of being involved in bullying episodes. A few studies have investigated this phenomenon, providing some evidence that immigrant students may face an increased risk of being bullied compared to native-born students. The present study adopted a mixed-method design, which may better detect the dynamics of bullying towards immigrant peers. Participants were 692 native-born and immigrant students (20.5% with immigrant background; 54.8% females) who filled in self-report measures about their bullying experiences, popularity, acceptance of diversity at school, and prejudice. Thirty-five pupils (54% with immigrant background) were also interviewed. Two hypothetical bullying scenarios were presented: one depicting a native-born victim and one depicting an immigrant victim. After each scenario, adolescents were encouraged to reason about the motives for bullying. Quantitative data showed that general bullying was associated with perceived popularity status among peers, while racial bullying was associated with prejudice but not peer status. The relevance of anti-immigrant prejudices in driving racial bullying emerged also from adolescents’ interviews. The qualitative data indicated that among the reasons for bullying, adolescents mentioned a desire for dominance and popularity, in particular when the victim was non-immigrant. Findings suggest that, in addition to individual and peer group-related risk factors, prejudice also needs to be addressed in anti-bullying interventions aimed to counteract racial bullying. © 2019 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - While research on experimental interventions that aim to improve outgroup attitudes via contact imagery grows, it is important to examine if contact imagery that occurs in spontaneous, non-experimentally controlled conditions drives attitudes, and in what direction. To answer this, we constructed and validated a spontaneous imagined intergroup contact scale (SIICS) that differentiates between frequency, quality and elaboration of the spontaneous imagery of outgroups. In three correlational studies (NP ortugal = 305, NU nited Kingdom = 185, NI taly = 276), we tested the role of spontaneous imagined contact frequency, quality and elaboration in predicting attitudes and social distance (Studies 1–3) and intended behaviour (Study 3) toward immigrant groups. Results demonstrated that spontaneous imagined contact quality consistently predicted key outcome variables above and beyond the other two dimensions. Importantly, the effects were significant while controlling for other potent forms of direct and indirect contact. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Scarce data exist on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by asylum seekers in Switzerland and their perception of discrimination. A cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence and type of CAM used by asylum seekers in one region of Switzerland and evaluated their self-perceived discrimination. Among the 61 asylum seekers who participated, lifetime prevalence of CAM use was 46%, with 28% reporting its use during the last year. Herbal medicine was the most frequently used CAM. Self-perceived discrimination was reported by 36% of asylum seekers, mainly related to their national origins. CAM users had a tendency to report more discrimination than non-users (44% vs. 30%). CAM use is prevalent among asylum seekers. Considering the importance of herbal medicine use and that only half of the respondents disclosed CAM use to their physician, clinicians should ask about it, notably because of potential risks of herb–drug interaction. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Despite the centrality of national identity in the exclusionary discourse of the European radical right, scholars have not investigated how popular definitions of nationhood are connected to dispositions toward Muslims. Moreover, survey-based studies tend to conflate anti-Muslim attitudes with general anti-immigrant sentiments. This article contributes to research on nationalism and out-group attitudes by demonstrating that varieties of national self-understanding are predictive of anti-Muslim attitudes, above and beyond dispositions toward immigrants. Using latent class analysis and regression models of survey data from 41 European countries, it demonstrates that conceptions of nationhood are heterogeneous within countries and that their relationship with anti-Muslim attitudes is contextually variable. Consistent with expectations, in most countries, anti-Muslim attitudes are positively associated with ascriptive – and negatively associated with elective (including civic) – conceptions of nationhood. Northwestern Europe, however, is an exception to this pattern: in this region, civic nationalism is linked to greater antipathy toward Muslims. It is suggested that in this region, elective criteria of belonging have become fused with exclusionary notions of national culture that portray Muslims as incompatible with European liberal values, effectively legitimating anti-Muslim sentiments in mainstream political culture. This may heighten the appeal of anti-Muslim sentiments not only on the radical right, but also among mainstream segments of the Northwestern European public, with important implications for social exclusion and political behaviour. © 2019 European Consortium for Political Research

AB  - We investigated the nature of prejudice toward people with developmental disabilities, its potential roots in dehumanization, its implications for social policy beliefs affecting this target group, and strategies for reducing prejudice toward people with developmental disabilities. Studies 1 (N = 196, MTurk) and 2 (N = 296, undergraduates) tested whether prejudice took a hostile or ambivalent (both hostile and benevolent components) form. Consistent support for a hostile prejudice model was found. This model was comprised of beliefs that people with developmental disabilities may harm others, should be kept separate from others, and are dependent on others. Also, greater dehumanization was associated with greater prejudice, and prejudice mediated the effect of dehumanization on participants’ social policy beliefs. Study 3 (N = 151, MTurk) provided construct validity for the newly developed multidimensional measure of prejudice. Study 4 (N = 156, undergraduates) showed that presenting a person with developmental disabilities in either humanizing or individuating ways reduced dehumanization and prejudice and, in turn, increased the favorability of social policy beliefs. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Emerging adulthood is the developmental period from 18 to 25 years of age when young people explore the possibilities of life with support from their parents. However, young people with an out-of-home care background usually navigate this life stage with little or no support. As a result, many care leavers experience poor outcomes including homelessness and low educational achievements. These narratives fuel low expectations and a negative stereotype toward care leavers. This study offers an alternative perspective by sharing positive stories of care leavers. Specifically, it explores the factors that promote the successful transition to emerging adulthood for care leavers in Ghana. Four key themes emerged from the thematic analysis: networks of social support, personal capacities, preparation for adulthood, and positive relationships. These are the factors facilitating the care leavers’ successful transition into emerging adulthood. The study has offered recommendations for policy-making and practice including extending the statutory leaving care age. © 2018 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood and SAGE Publishing.

AB  - Is reducing large-scale intergroup conflict the business of corporations? Although large corporations can use their power and prominence to reduce intergroup conflict in society, it is unclear to what extent stakeholders support corporate Intergroup Responsibility (CIR). Study 1 showed that support for CIR correlates in theoretically meaningful ways with relevant economic, social, and moral attitudes, including fair market ideology, consumer support for corporate social responsibility (CSR), social dominance orientation, symbolic racism, and moral foundations. Studies 2 and 3 employed experimental designs to test the hypothesis that business leaders who advocate for intergroup tolerance boost perceptions of corporations and their leaders as moral, just, and fair, which in turn, increases stakeholders’ support for CIR. We found support for this hypothesis across two highly publicized and contentious events related to racial conflict in the U.S.: The White supremacy rally in Charlottesville and the federal government’s announcement about the planned rescinding of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration policy. Specifically, exposing participants to real-world tweets by CEOs who advocated intergroup tolerance following these events increased participants’ support for CIR. This effect was mediated by heightened perceptions of corporations and their leaders as moral, just, and fair. Taken together, these findings enhance our understanding of the factors that shape stakeholders’ reactions to CIR; highlight intergroup conflict as an emerging arena for CSR; and illustrate the power of ethical intergroup leadership. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Implementing strategy demands an organizationwide effort, where teams should not operate in isolation. A challenge many organizations face in implementing their strategy is eradicating silo thinking and creating shared understanding of strategy between interdependent teams—that is, intergroup strategic consensus. However, strategy process research is silent on how such intergroup strategic consensus can emerge. Drawing on social identity theory, we offer a lens to understand what influences the degree of intergroup strategic consensus. We unveil a tension between organizational and group identification such that organizational identification enhances intergroup strategic consensus, whereas group identification reduces it. Moreover, we hypothesize that high group identification crowds out positive effects of organizational identification on intergroup strategic consensus. Data from 451 intergroup relationships between 92 teams within a service organization support these hypotheses. We replicate our results using 191 intergroup relationships between 37 teams from another organization. These results allow us to develop an understanding of intergroup strategic consensus, expand the conversation in strategy process research to between-team interdependencies, and challenge the assumption in management literature and practice that higher identification is always desirable. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Individuals living in long-term residential care homes are often viewed through a negative lens. These residents have increasingly complex care needs, and their functional, communication and cognitive challenges can support conceptualizations of difference and disability perpetuating negative stereotypes of age and dementia. However, engaging in meaningful activities and relationships with older adults, including those with dementia, has been shown to promote positive attitudes. Specifically, intergenerational programming that provides opportunities for meaningful engagement between children and older adults has been shown to support positive emotional experiences through socializing and building relationships. This qualitative study explored the development of relationships between school-aged children and older adults with dementia living in a long-term residential care home. Residents in long-term care homes and children typically have limited opportunities to interact with each other; in this study, participating in an intergenerational dance programme provided an opportunity for meaningful relationships to develop. This paper focuses on the development of the children’s attitudes and understandings of their much older dance partners. Seven girls between the ages of seven and nine participated in ballet classes with residents in a long-term care home for one hour each week over a six-month period. All of the residents had a diagnosis of moderate to advanced dementia. Further, all of the residents also had other chronic health issues such as cardiac, respiratory and/or neurological diseases. The children were interviewed at the baseline, three- and six-month intervals. Prior to beginning the dance programme, the children anticipated their dance partners to be unwell and unable. However, by the end of six months, the children described the residents much more positively highlighting their abilities and strengths. Over time, through participating in a structured intergenerational programme, the children’s views of disability and difference disappeared as they formed dance partnerships and developed meaningful relationships. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The present research aimed to deepen our insight into the role of group membership on victim blaming by incorporating the Belief in a Just World (BJW) theory in a system justification perspective. Study 1A (N = 220) and Study 1B (N = 127) supported the status of BJW as a system justification ideology. In particular, BJW was related to other well-known system justification ideologies (Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation), and had similar antecedents (Need for Closure) and consequences (prejudice). Study 2 (N = 134) and Study 3 (N = 247) investigated the role of victims’ in- versus out-group membership on victim blaming. The results showed that, despite the potential influence of prejudice but in line with the similarity hypothesis of Lerner and Miller (1978), ingroup victims were blamed slightly more than outgroup members, based on ethnicity or sexual orientation respectively. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Social attitudes to transgender persons and other gender minorities vary around the world, and in many cultures, prejudices and social stigma are common. Consequently, transgender persons face challenges related to discrimination and negative attitudes among the public. The purpose of this study was to compare life satisfaction, loneliness, mental health, and suicidal behavior among transgender students with cisgender students' experiences in a nationwide sample of Norwegian students pursuing higher education. Methods: In total,50,054 full-time Norwegian students completed an online questionnaire (response rate 30.8%), of whom 15,399 were cisgender males, 34,437 cisgender females, 28 individuals who reported being binary transgender (12 transwomen and 16 transmen), and 69 individuals non-binary transgender persons. The measures included questions concerning gender identity, life satisfaction (Satisfaction With Life Scale), loneliness (The Three-Item Loneliness Scale), mental health problems (Hopkins Symptoms Check List), mental disorders, and suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and self-harm. Chi-square tests, Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences between gender identities. Results: Transgender students reported significantly more psychosocial burdens on all measures. There were no significant differences in any of the measures between the binary and non-binary transgender students. Conclusion: The findings call for increased awareness about welfare and health for transgender students in Norway. Higher education institutions need to consider measures at various levels to establish a learning environment that is more inclusive for gender minorities. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Evaluating other people's social encounters from a third-person perspective is an ubiquitous activity of daily life. Yet little is known about how these evaluations are affected by racial bias. To overcome this empirical lacuna, two experiments were conducted. The first experiment used evaluative priming to show that both Black (n = 44) and White Americans (n = 44) assess the same mundane encounters (e.g. two people chatting) less favorably when they involve a Black and a White individual rather than two Black or two White individuals. The second experiment used functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate that both Black (n = 46) and White Americans (n = 42) respond with reduced social reward processing (i.e. lower activity in the ventral striatum) and enhanced mentalizing (e.g. higher activity in the bilateral temporal-parietal junction) toward so-called cross-race relative to same-race encounters. By combining unobtrusive measures from social psychology and social neuroscience, this work demonstrates that racial bias can affect impression formation even at the level of the dyad. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Research has shown that discrimination is harmful to health, but there is relatively little known about discrimination experienced by people from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds in resettlement countries and associated health effects. This qualitative-focused mixed methods paper reports on discrimination experienced by refugees and asylum seekers, responses to discrimination, and impacts on health. Methods: As part of a broader study of housing, social inclusion and health, surveys were completed by 423 adult refugees and asylum seekers living in South Australia who had been in Australia for up to 7 years. The survey included questions on discrimination based on skin colour, ethnicity and religion, as well as questions on hope, trust, belonging, sense of control and health (including the SF-8). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 survey participants, purposively sampled by visa status, continent and gender, further exploring experiences of discrimination. These and survey open-ended responses were analysed thematically. Results: Twenty-two percent of survey participants reported experiences of discrimination since arriving in Australia (14% in the last year), and 90% of these felt that discrimination had harmed their health. Key settings of discrimination were public transport, within the neighbourhood, and in relation to employment. Those who reported discrimination had significantly worse mental health (p <.000) but not physical health. Discrimination was also associated with less sense of belonging (p =.001), lower levels of trust (p =.038), reduced sense of control (p =.012) and less hope (p =.006). Incidents described in interviews and the open-ended survey responses included incivility, physical assault, and denial of services, experienced across intersecting characteristics of race/ethnicity, religion, gender and visa status. Responses to discrimination spanned affective, cognitive and behavioural dimensions, ranging across types of experience, participant characteristics and context, with most individuals reporting multiple response types. While some of the responses were reported by participants as protective of health, participants' reflections indicated significant negative impacts on mental health in particular. Conclusion: Discrimination featured in the resettlement experiences of a significant number of refugees and asylum seekers, with participants reporting clear negative impacts on mental health. Addressing discrimination is a key resettlement and health issue requiring urgent action. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Compared to many other forms of social bias, weight bias is pervasive, socially accepted, and difficult to attenuate. According to the common ingroup identity model, strategies that expand group inclusiveness may promote more positive intergroup attitudes and behaviors, particularly when people are aware of unjust treatment of others included within their shared identity. Considering that most people are not aware of the social justice issue of weight discrimination, we hypothesized that a common ingroup identity would be effective in reducing weight bias primarily when unfair weight-based treatment was made salient (i.e., that fat people experience discrimination in employment). Participants were randomly assigned to conditions following a 3 (discrimination salience: weight discrimination, height discrimination, control) × 2 (group identity: common ingroup, control) design and completed an evaluative measure of weight bias. Results revealed a significant interaction, showing that when weight discrimination was salient, participants in the common ingroup identity condition reported less weight bias than participants in the group identity control condition. When a common ingroup identity was emphasized, weight bias was lower when weight discrimination was salient compared to when height discrimination was salient and the control condition in which nothing about discrimination was mentioned. These results were not moderated by participant weight. This study demonstrates that a common ingroup identity can be effective in reducing weight bias if a cue is provided that fat people experience disparate and unjust outcomes in employment. Given the serious consequences of weight bias for health and well-being, and the relative ease of implementing this prejudice-reduction intervention, the common ingroup identity model has potential application for reducing weight bias in a range of real-world settings. However, these findings should be considered preliminary until they are replicated in well-powered and pre-registered future research. © Copyright © 2020 Brochu, Banfield and Dovidio.

AB  - The American College of Physicians (ACP) has long advocated for universal access to high-quality health care in the United States. Yet, it is essential that the U.S. health system goes beyond ensuring coverage, efficient delivery systems, and affordability. Reductions in nonfinancial barriers to care and improvements in social determinants of health are also necessary. This ACP position paper calls for ending discrimination based on personal characteristics; correcting workforce shortages, including the undersupply of primary care physicians; and understanding and ameliorating social determinants of health. The ACP calls for increased efforts to address urgent public health threats, including injuries and deaths from firearms; environmental hazards; climate change; maternal mortality; substance use disorders; and the health risks associated with nicotine, tobacco use, and electronic nicotine delivery systems in order to achieve ACP's vision for a better U.S. health care system. © 2020 American College of Physicians.

AB  - Portugal is one of the most egalitarian countries in Europe in terms of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals’ legal rights. However, regarding education Portugal still lacks specific policies, plans and interventions to protect LGBTI students. To assess the perceptions of self-identified LGBTI youth regarding their school context, a total of 663 participants (aged from 15 to 20 years old) filled in an on-line questionnaire about their school climate. One hundred and forty-six of them answered an open-ended question about their personal experiences. A thematic analysis of these answers was conducted, and four main categories were identified: (i) victimization, (ii) coming out experiences, (iii) support networks, and (iv) demands. Most participants reported experiences of discrimination, and several sources of prejudice were identified. Furthermore, participants also recognized a lack of LGBTI information in school curriculum and made several demands. Besides inclusive laws, we suggest that the safety and the well-being of LGBTI youths in Portuguese schools depend upon others measures, such as teacher and school staff training, curricula inclusive of LGBTI diversity, and local strategies, such as Gay-Straight Alliances. © Copyright © 2020 Gato, Leal, Moleiro, Fernandes, Nunes, Marinho, Pizmony-Levy and Freeman.

AB  - We examined whether the Dark Triad traits predict race- and sex-based prejudice or just a generalized antisociality. American MTurk workers (N = 266) reported their approach tendencies towards targets who were varied by sex (i.e., same sex, other sex) and race (i.e., same race, different race) and responded to questionnaires capturing the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) and political personality (i.e., social dominance and authoritarianism). Social dominance, narcissism, and psychopathy revealed a generalized pattern of limited approach (i.e., prejudice) towards members of both sexes and racial in-group and out-group members. In contrast, Machiavellianism and authoritarianism were only linked to limited approach towards racial out-group members. Sex differences in approach tendencies towards different race and opposite-sex others were fully and partially mediated by individual differences in the Dark Triad traits and social dominance (respectively), the Dark Triad traits accounted for more variance than social dominance in same sex and different race approach tendencies, and some of the links between personality and approach tendencies were moderated by the sex of the participant. Results were discussed in relation to how personality traits can account for prejudicial attitudes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intergroup changes occur often between subgroups who are asymmetric in status (e.g., size, power, prestige), with important consequences for social identification, especially among the members of lower-status groups. Mergers offer an example of such changes, when subgroups (merger partners) merge into a common, superordinate group (post-merger group). Lower-status subgroups frequently perceive they are less represented in the post-merger group, therefore committing less to the changes a merger implies. Five studies offered an intergroup relations’ perspective on mergers (N’s = 479, 150, 266, 113, and 229, respectively), examining how functional indispensability (instrumental contribution of the ingroup) positively influences perceptions of representativeness in the post-merger group (relative ingroup prototypicality), which, in turn, affect post-merger identification and, finally, change commitment. Additionally, the role of cognitive information processing (heuristic vs. systematic) on prototypicality was explored. Results suggest that functional indispensability impacts relative ingroup prototypicality (Studies 1–5), and this may be moderated by information processing (Study 2). Moreover, prototypicality and identification with the superordinate post-merged group mediated the effect of functional indispensability on change commitment (Studies 1–3). These findings provide important theoretical insights into prototypicality perceptions held by lower-status merger partners and minority groups in general, by identifying functional indispensability as a source of prototypicality other than relative status. In addition, by proposing a functional approach to the relations between social groups, these findings suggest better practices for managing structural changes, such as combining sources of strategic/functional and identity fit when announcing an intergroup change. © Copyright © 2020 Rosa, Giessner, Guerra, Waldzus, Kersting, Veličković and Collins.

AB  - Objectives: In two studies, we examined the effects of age-related stereotype threat on eyewitness memory using the misinformation paradigm to (a) examine stereotype threat in the context of a more ecologically valid memory task and (b) to determine the relationship between task difficulty and susceptibility to stereotype threat. Methods: After watching a video that depicted a crime, older and younger adult participants were presented with a written synopsis in which information consistent or inconsistent with the original event was presented. Half of the participants were then presented with information designed to activate negative stereotypes about aging. Finally, participants completed a memory test. Results: In Study 1, when participants were instructed to report information from either the video or the synopsis to complete the final memory test, older adults under high stereotype threat were less accurate than those under low threat. In Study 2, when participants were required to engage in more controlled processes at retrieval and respond with only video information, older adults under stereotype threat performed as well or better than those under low threat. Discussion: The results are consistent with the Regulatory Focus Model of Stereotype Threat. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: People in socially disadvantaged groups face a myriad of challenges to their health. Discrimination, based on group status such as gender, immigration generation, race/ethnicity, or religion, are a well-documented health challenge. However, less is known about experiences of discrimination specifically within healthcare settings, and how it may act as a barrier to healthcare. Methods: Using data from a nationally representative survey of France (N = 21,761) with an oversample of immigrants, we examine rates of reported discrimination in healthcare settings, rates of foregoing healthcare, and whether discrimination could explain disparities in foregoing care across social groups. Results: Rates of both reporting discrimination within healthcare and reporting foregone care in the past 12 months were generally highest among women, immigrants from Africa or Overseas France, and Muslims. For all of these groups, experiences of discrimination potentially explained significant proportions of their disparity in foregone care (Percent disparity in foregone care explained for: women = 17%, second-generation immigrants = 8%, Overseas France = 13%, North Africa = 22%, Sub-Saharan Africa = 32%, Muslims = 26%). Rates of foregone care were also higher for those of mixed origin and people who reported "Other Religion", but foregone healthcare was not associated with discrimination for those groups. Conclusions: Experiences of discrimination within the healthcare setting may present a barrier to healthcare for people that are socially disadvantaged due to gender, immigration, race/ethnicity, or religion. Researchers and policymakers should consider barriers to healthcare that lie within the healthcare experience itself as potential intervention targets. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Adopting a differentiated threat approach, we investigated the relationship between cultural, economic, and criminal threat on attitudes toward four different ethnic minorities in Germany (Muslims, foreigners, refugees, and Sinti and Roma). We hypothesized that the effect of different types of intergroup threats on ethnic prejudice varies with the perceived characteristics of minority groups. Using a representative sample of German adults, we found that cultural and economic threat primarily predicted attitudes toward Muslims and foreigners, while criminal threat played a minor role in attitude formation among the majority population. For refugees and Sinti and Roma, all three types of intergroup threats were found to be equally important for the prediction of attitudes toward these minority groups. These results are only partially in line with the culture-specific threat profiles of these minority groups in the German context. Therefore, we discuss the tenability of the differentiated threat approach to explain the genesis of ethnic prejudice in different cultural contexts. © Copyright © 2020 Jedinger and Eisentraut.

AB  - The post-9/11 era has seen a surge in writings on “Muslim” issues in the West, but little is known about Muslim children's perspectives. Attitudes toward, and beliefs about, the religious ingroup and outgroup were examined in the present study with 5–6-year-old Muslims of Pakistani heritage in the United Kingdom (UK) and Saudi Arabia (SA). Participants completed trait attribution and liking tasks and answered questions on God beliefs and religious practice about themselves, Muslims (ingroup) and non-Muslims (outgroup). Participants described ingroup members more positively, liked them more, and inferred that they held more religious beliefs than outgroup members. Liking was positively associated with outgroup liking for UK participants, who described outgroup members more positively with more religious beliefs, compared with SA participants whose ingroup attitudes were negatively associated with outgroup attitudes. Our findings are discussed in the light of theory and research, and implications for education contexts and well-being are considered. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cosmopolitanism and its application for education in western societies has been well examined. Yet cosmopolitanism in society and in education has not been systematically explored in many Asian societies. Facing a large number of people from diverse backgrounds, the society and its education system in Hong Kong are troubled by issues similar to those found in western postindustrial societies, related to cultural and national belonging and identity. Prejudice and racism towards ethnic minorities–particularly those from South Asia and Africa, is quite common. Additionally, animosity and hostility to mainland Chinese newcomers has increased and intensified in the context of Hong Kong’s “repoliticization” after its 1997 handover. This article aims to explore how cosmopolitanism is understood, valued, and approached in Hong Kong education. We start by exploring the role of decolonization and nationalization in political education in Hong Kong. We then discuss cosmopolitanism, and consider how it impacts particular social and educational issues in Hong Kong. We also provide an analysis of discourses on cosmopolitanism taken from Hong Kong General Studies and History textbooks, to identify challenges faced in facilitating cosmopolitan values, a balance of identities, and global citizenship in Hong Kong education. © 2020, © 2020 National Institute of Education, Singapore.

AB  - Rebranding men’s dietary choices in the mind of the mainstream Australians to include more plant-based options, is a difficult task. Eating meat is a way to satisfy nutritional requirements but also has an embedded symbolism of power to which Australian men are accustomed. Vegetarian men are seen by the majority of the male population and the social discourse surrounding gendered food as betraying the social expectations about masculine behavior despite research showing the need for higher intake of fiber to reduce non-communicable diseases and improve planetary health. Those who have adopted vegetarian diets are exposed to ridicule and may face social isolation because of their unorthodox food choices. In order to reshape the meat consumption of men in Australia, we must recognize the gendered dynamics of dietary choices that associate meat consumption with masculinity. This research examines the power of the current food discourse and social constrains imposed on vegetarian men based on a 2019 survey in Sydney, Australia with 1053 male participants who have different frequencies of meat consumption. The participants were asked to express their opinion about vegetarian dietary choices, and the dominant view is that they provoke non-acceptance and various degrees of aversion. Instead of practicing overt dietary choices, those who embrace vegetarianism prefer to be unidentifiable as such to avoid social prejudice. While individual dislike may change over time, the current mass perception of vegetarianism is of unmanly behavior. A new role for institutions and policies related to public health, environmental wellbeing and use of resources in motivating a greater uptake of plant-based food choices, is also needed. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Urespa, meaning “to grow together” in the Ainu language, is a social venture founded at Sapporo University in 2010. The Urespa club brings Indigenous Ainu and Wajin (i.e. non-Ainu) students together in a curriculum-based environment to co-learn the Ainu language and Ainu cultural practices. The initiative’s aim is to restory the conventional narrative of Otherness in Japan by creating a transformative space or “micropublic” in which students can work collaboratively across ethnic difference. In this paper, we argue that Urespa succeeds in effecting an inclusive social setting for both Ainu and Wajin students through the design and implementation of a process which promotes and, recursively, is shaped by, a transcultural form of social encounter. The challenge this makes to the promotion of multicultural programming within Japan in recent decades is important although not without controversy. © 2020, © 2020 The Department of Anthropology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to validate and adapt the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-Stigma (AAQ-S) to the Spanish context. Method: The study included the participation of 1212 subjects, with an average age of 17.12 years old. Results: The confirmatory factorial analysis revealed a number of adequate fit indices for the new version of the scale χ2 /df = 3.24; Comparative Fit Index = 0.96; Incremental Fit Index = 0.96; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.060; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.035, in which the factorial structures displayed gender invariance. The two factors comprise the scale both exhibited high internal consistency (+0.90) and temporal stability. Conclusion: The Spanish version of the AAQ-S proved to be a robust and adequate psychometric instrument. In this sense, future lines of research focused on determining the role of psychological flexibility in stigma and the processes of change at the base of interventions could benefit substantially from the use of AAQ-S. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Bisexual-identified students face ongoing challenges such as denial of their identity, negative stereotypes, biphobia, and sexual harassment at school. Stigma and denial of bisexuality contribute to the erasure and invisibility of bisexual people, resulting in limited role models and positive representation for bisexual youth. Based on three years of ethnographic research in a U.S. public high school, this article examines how social regulation of gender and sexuality work to reinforce notions of proper femininity and uphold cis-heteronormativity. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Islamophobic hate speech on social media is a growing concern in contemporary Western politics and society. It can inflict considerable harm on any victims who are targeted, create a sense of fear and exclusion amongst their communities, toxify public discourse and motivate other forms of extremist and hateful behavior. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for automated tools to detect and classify Islamophobic hate speech robustly and at scale, thereby enabling quantitative analyses of large textual datasets, such as those collected from social media. Previous research has mostly approached the automated detection of hate speech as a binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is often inappropriate for both theoretically informed social science and effective monitoring of social media platforms. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we build an automated software tool which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and balanced accuracy is 83%. Our tool enables future quantitative research into the drivers, spread, prevalence and effects of Islamophobic hate speech on social media. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Most studies of planned lesbian motherhood via donor insemination (DI) have sampled lesbian mothers in individualistic societies where adults have relatively distant connection to their family of origin. Our study examined the experiences of biological and non-biological lesbian mothers in five families who had children through DI after disclosing their motherhood status to their family networks in Portugal, a familistic society. The first theme identified by thematic analysis—“But why do you want to have a child?”—encapsulated the reactions of biological mothers’ family of origin to the announcement of motherhood. Disclosure was mostly met by a shocked response in the family, rooted in the belief that lesbian women should not have children. The second theme—“But you weren’t pregnant, how is this your child?”—summarized the reactions of non-biological mothers’ family of origin to the disclosure of motherhood status as they considered refusing to recognize their grandchild in the absence of biological connection. Prejudice against lesbian-mother family formation was associated with the specific intersection of lesbianism and motherhood, but relationships between the mothers and their families were largely repaired because of familistic values. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Messaging Motivations Questionnaire (MMQ) is a concise 8-item measure, which consists of two subscales capturing people’s typical motivations to text. The MMQ was developed through focus groups and item analysis based on a pilot study, followed by a larger validation study involving a sample of 982 young adults. Factor analyses supported a 2-factor structure, yielding highly reliable scale scores: Escape, characterized by the wish to escape or avoid internal or external stimuli when texting; and Express, characterized by the use of text messaging over richer forms of communication media to facilitate self-expression. Criterion validity of the MMQ scores was established using measures of problematic smartphone use, social anxiety, self-esteem, and the Big Five dimensions of personality. Women exhibited slightly higher scores on both subscales. There were no race/ethnicity-related MMQ score differences, and marginal age-related differences. The MMQ is a promising tool for counselors to better understand and discuss their young adult clients’ texting behaviors, as well as for future research focused on texting behavior and its consequences. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Assessment and Research in Counseling (AARC).

AB  - A series of policy decisions beginning in 1965 produced an exclusionist climate in the United States. Lyndon Johnson sought to eliminate prejudice from the nation’s immigration system but inadvertently curtailed opportunities for legal entry from Mexico that created a large undocumented population. In waging the Cold War, Ronald Reagan launched an intervention in Central America that displaced many more thousands who also became undocumented residents. The Wars on Crime and Drugs of Presidents Nixon and Reagan created a prison industrial complex that imprisoned blacks and Hispanics. George Bush’s War on Terror unleashed a rising tide of deportations swept Latino migrants into the immigrant detention system. Finally, President Trump transformed a humanitarian problem affecting Central American families and children into a manufactured immigration crisis for the nation as a whole. The result is among the most repressive and exclusionist context of immigrant reception in American history. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The number and size of “new immigrant destinations” (NIDs) in the United States grew quickly over the 1990s and 2000s, but Latino newcomers residing in them witnessed a profound negative turn in institutional and political reception after 2005. The present article takes stock of the causes and consequences of this shift, showing how intensifying enforcement and exclusionary policy-making at the federal and state levels after 2005 stoked anti-immigrant sentiment and institutional closure in many NIDs, especially in the South. Though the Latino “second generation” is just now beginning to come of age and to enter the workforce in NIDs, offering new opportunities for data collection and analysis going forward, the extant literature suggests that this shift has significantly weakened its prospects for structural incorporation and upward economic mobility, which are now strongly stratified by citizenship and legal status. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the US South and Midwest, early immigrant populations consisted primarily of young, Latinos recruited to work in low-wage jobs. After six or seven years, family members from Mexico and Central America began joining early arrivals, changing the character of immigrant interactions with host residents and institutions. While many natives viewed the single men as migrant workers, important for economic services, the arrival of women and children stimulated ambivalent reactions in North Carolina and Iowa rural communities. This suggests that native perceptions of immigrants can be traced, in part, to immigrants' roles in local economies, including their participation in multiple livelihoods and their deployment of cultural labor. The contradiction between anti-immigrant sentiments and the need for immigrant labour can be understood as a reaction to increasingly precarious economic conditions facing both natives and immigrants in the twenty-first century and the changing values of productive and reproductive economies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Under the assumption that stereotyping can be prejudicial to the development of children’s critical thinking abilities, this paper reports on a study that examined how the pedagogical intervention of awakening to languages may develop children’s critical thinking and instill a sense of cultural relativism that encourages them to challenge stereotypes from an early age. Based on a mixed-methods research design, a psychometric test was specifically developed to tap changes in participants’ stereotyping behavior added to a follow-up interview to formulate a detailed picture of their questionnaire responses. Both the quantitative and qualitative results confirmed the hypothesized attitudinal change in the participants, turning cultural absolutes within their and across other cultures into cultural variations. In view of these findings, it follows that awakening children to languages have a transformative value of enhancing their cognitive capacity towards viewing the world critically. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The attitudes and beliefs behind people’s responses to nuclear facilities has been since the 1970s one of the main concerns of environmental psychology and related disciplines. However, analyses have mainly focused on (1) understanding how risk perception and the lack of procedural and distributive justice in the relationship between local communities and authorities and developers impact those attitudes and beliefs, and (2) the perceptions of publics living within the same borders as the facilities. Less attention has been given to how the deployment of nuclear facilities affects communities beyond the border, and, relatedly, can be impacted upon by other intergroup relations and processes, such as more symbolic dimensions of justice. This paper aims to offer a preliminary exploration of how those intergroup processes might play a role in people’s attitudes and beliefs regarding nuclear energy, based on an analysis of the Portuguese media representations of nuclear facilities in Almaraz, Spain. The implications of these analyses for both energy policy and environmental psychology will be discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - A growing body of evidence documents that Islamophobia is a significant social issue in the UK. This evidence also reveals an empirical link to “Islamist” terrorism, revealing a nexus between security and the social emergence of prejudice. Drawing on critical approaches to security and applying them to the case of the UK in 2017, this article explores this nexus conceptually and empirically. To do so, it examines the discourses of various governance institutions (including the media, the political elite, and security professionals) as they respond to “Islamist” terrorist events. It argues that these governance institutions individually and collectively–and often unwittingly–stigmatised and securitised “Muslim” identity. The structural emergence (i.e., the institutionalisation) of Islamophobia in the UK, this article contends, can largely be understood through these processes. This article therefore offers an illustration of some of the logics of how prejudice is embedded in societal structures, which has normative implications for how these processes might be successfully contested. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order for adolescents to learn about sex and relationships, the education must be of significance and meet their needs and interests. The study investigated adolescents’ conceptions of learning and education about sex and relationships. A phenomenographic approach was used. Six focus group interviews were conducted with adolescents ages 18–19 in Sweden. The results showed that stable ground for learning implies select issues of importance, that is, values and prejudices, up-to-date knowledge, and practical skills. These issues should be dispersed throughout the school years in relation to the students’ own maturity. This seemed to enable internalization of different aspects of sex and relationships. Learning about sex and relationships can create meaning for youth and generate progress by fostering autonomy and identity, correcting misconceptions, counteract prejudices, not in isolation rather in society in a defined culture. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) is an evolving educational approach for preparing healthcare professional students to provide patient care in a collaborative team atmosphere. One of the important outcomes to be achieved is understanding the stereotypical views of health professionals held by themselves and by others to eventually reduce negative and harmful stereotypes and to foster an environment of mutual respect and trust amongst healthcare professionals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a change in healthcare students’ stereotypical belief about the characteristics of healthcare professionals before and after an IPE activity focused on smoking cessation. The Student Stereotype Rating Questionnaire (SSRQ) was used to assess the students’ stereotype ratings of their professions and other healthcare professions before and after the IPE activity. The ratings were made in relation to nine attributes. Sixty-eight students from five different majors (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Respiratory Therapy) participated in the IPE activity. All the students involved in the activity responded to both the pre and post surveys (response rate, 100%). The participating students‘ combined ratings revealed a significant change in the perspectives of medical, pharmacy, and respiratory therapy students in all of the nine attributes. While for public health students, differences were significant in two aspects: professional competence and practical skills. Three central themes emerged after the IPE session from the open-ended questions: roles and responsibilities, patient-centered care, and integrated healthcare team. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that stereotyping exists among different healthcare profession student groups in Qatar and that IPE can impact both hetero-stereotypes and auto-stereotypes. The positive change in perception following the IPE activity indicates the effectiveness and the value of these short duration IPE activities in negating stereotypical views. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Size scholars routinely discuss the negative effects of fat stigma within youth culture. For example, fat kids are more likely to be bullied than their thinner peers, increasing their risk for depression, loneliness, anxiety, and behavior problems. These studies, however, do not adequately address kids’ active resistance to fatphobia and size discrimination. In this chapter, I highlight the importance of kids’ resistance work at Girls Rock Camp. Pulling from my own experiences as a (fat) camp counselor, I explore the different ways campers push-back against fat stereotypes. While this push-back creates dialogue around size privilege and oppression, organizational obstacles for fat bodies result in conflicting messages about body positivity. Kids challenge size discrimination on an interpersonal level by showing their stomachs, writing anti-shame lyrics, and criticizing unrealistic beauty standards. Adult volunteers, though, continue to navigate organizational sizeism through inaccessible seating, a culture of fat talk, and anti-fat emotional labor. I argue that while Girls Rock Camp indeed helps kids fight against fat prejudice within youth culture, it simultaneously privileges thin adult bodies at an organizational level. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A post-civil war country may cease military activity, but the social rupture impacts political discourse and ethnic relations, and can lead to collective violence against minorities. Sri Lanka has witnessed multiple examples of anti-Muslim sentiment and violence since the civil war termination, most infamously in 2014 when ethnic riots affected large numbers of people. Buddhist monks appeared to play a prominent role. The lengthy war and ethnonationalist ideologies have produced politico-religious shifts associated with ‘Buddhist extremism’, implicated in these riots and other aggressions. This paper uses interview data to explore the question: what causal mechanisms link post-civil war and extremist ideologies, and how this can lead to ethnic rioting. Interview respondents argue that promoting a monolithic national identity in a heterogeneous country enhances divisions, which can be politically expedient. An outright war victory, militarization of society and lack of peacebuilding sustain ethnic tensions that can be mobilized for further anti-minority violence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Intergroup contact reduces prejudice against a variety of social outgroups and seems to be particularly effective at reducing prejudice in individuals most prone to it—those high in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). The present study examines the moderating roles of RWA and SDO in the contact-prejudice relationship, targeting dissident, dangerous, and derogated outgroups: lesbians and gay men, people with schizophrenia, and Indigenous Australians, respectively. In total, 234 participants self-reported contact and prejudice against these outgroups and completed RWA and SDO scales. Contact predicted less prejudice against lesbians and gay men and Indigenous Australians in participants high in RWA and participants high in SDO. However, contact only predicted less prejudice against people with schizophrenia in participants low in RWA or SDO. The results suggest that the ability for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice in prejudice-prone individuals may depend on the outgroup targeted, specifically the threat they pose and the level of prejudice held against them. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - South Africa continues to bear a heavy burden of HIV and a significant proportion of the nation’s population consists of immigrants from other severely afflicted African nations. Yet little is known about how migrant populations respond to HIV in shifting cultural and clinical landscapes. Analysing 21 ethnographic life history interviews, this paper explores the social complexities of living with antiretroviral therapy and disclosure of serostatus among HIV-positive Mozambican migrants in Johannesburg. It focuses on (i) conceptualising the ‘biosocial ambiance of illness’; (ii) how transformations occur in perceptions of disease; and (iii) how stigma produces an ambit of loneliness and secrecy, which inflects disclosure unevenly in different life-spaces and health-worlds. The net effect of these three processes is a silence which is detrimental to the social normalisation of HIV, treatment-seeking and clinical drug adherence, which in turn may increase rates of morbidity and mortality and contribute to drug resistance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Approximately seven million students are being raised by LGBTQ+ parents. Marriage equality may prompt more LGBTQ+ families to “come out” to their children’s schools. This has implications for school systems, which are inadequately prepared to support these families. Until now, the focus on LGBTQ+ families has been on how they navigate the school system and advocate for themselves. We think that rather than trying to “fit” families into the existing system, an approach that alters the system to support all families is warranted. We review the literature on LGBTQ+ family issues. Next, we define targets for change in the schools: multicultural competency, heteronormativity, and anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice. Then, we review empirically supported prejudice-reduction interventions that can be employed systems-wide. Finally, we describe an approach to systems change that fits well with the overarching goal to create safe, supportive, and inclusive environments for LGBTQ+ families. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The paper focuses on the role of the ‘Balkanist discourse’, as a collection of negative prejudices on the Balkan people and cultures, in constructing the individual and collective identities of labour migrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Particular emphasis is given to investigating to what extent the Balkanist discourse meta-narrative affects the integration of the labour migrants in host countries’ societies and their reintegration into BiH upon their temporary or permanent return. Based on an analytical model that emphasizes the mutual conditionality of everyday and public discourses, i.e. the typology of Balkanist discourse variations, this study undertakes a discourse analysis of the life stories of 10 young labour migrants from BiH. The research results show that variations of the Balkanist discourse are a dominant referential framework for the migrants in interpreting their own experience and social phenomena in both host country and BiH, regardless of the migrants embracing these Balkanist discourse stereotypes as part of their personal identity or feeling resistance towards them. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The implications of intergroup contact for the social integration of rural migrant workers have received limited scholarly attention in China. Drawing on Allport's contact hypothesis and its recent extensions, this study investigates, from the perspective of urban residents, the situational and relational contexts within which intergroup encounters occur. Using the Urban Resident Survey conducted in 2014 across thirteen cities in China, we compare contact between urbanites and migrants in two social spaces: the workplace and the residential community. We also examine whether their associations with intergroup friendships differ for urbanites with kinship ties to migrants. Our findings highlight the complexities of contact, along with its strengths and limitations in bringing diverse groups closer together. Workplace contact is positively associated with intergroup friendships, whereas residential community contact is negatively related to such ties. Furthermore, kinship relations with migrants can undermine positive contacts but do not provide a buffer for negative encounters. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article explores the role of schools in responding to the ambivalent relationships between the Chinese and non-Chinese in Indonesia. It examines the multicultural position that Indonesian teachers adopt and the pedagogical strategies they employ in promoting positive inter-ethnic relations. Through interviews with teachers in three schools with different student ethno-religious compositions in Medan, the article argues that the multiculturalism paradigm embraced by the majority of teachers leans towards a liberal multicultural outlook, employing mostly content integration and prejudice reduction. The heterogenous school in the study has more potential to empower a multicultural school culture due to the school demography compared to the homogenous school. However, such efforts still focus heavily on maximising intergroup contact and less on engaging students critically. This article considers theories of multiculturalism in tandem with Indonesian’s concept of nationalism and national identity, including the vision of diversity enshrined in the national motto Bhinneka-Tunggal-Ika (Unity-in-Diversity). © 2018, © 2018 British Association for International and Comparative Education.

AB  - Introduction: Sexuality occurs throughout life and exhibits different manifestations; however, it is mutilated in older adult women. Objective: Analyze sexuality in older adult women who attend outpatient consultation at the Longevity, Aging and Health Research Center (CITED, Spanish acronym) Method: Qualitative study, with a phenomenological approach about sexuality and the experiences associated with it, in 60 older adult women who attended the outpatient consultation at the Longevity, Aging and Health Research Center (CITED), in the second half of 2018. Results: Older adult women define sexuality in a heterogeneous way. They give it great importance, despite considering it typical of younger ages, and prioritizing other more culturally accepted activities. They perceive themselves in a lower place in relation to men of this age, and the rest of the family. The prejudice that limits their satisfaction with the sex-erotic sphere of sexuality was identified as a form of gender violence in an important group of them. Conclusions: Older adult women displace the dimension of the couple, and the sex-erotic relationships of their sexuality due to family demands, placing them in a lower social step, which translates into a manifestation of gender violence. © 2020.

AB  - The Palestinian National Authority has signed into law human rights protocols that promote, protect and ensure the rights of all children and the rights of persons with disabilities, including the right to an inclusive, equitable education. These protocols are supported by a series of laws and policies which seek to realise the aim of respecting all human rights entitlements. However, chronic occupation has devastated Palestine's infrastructure, fractured the economy, and fragmented the integrity of the State, with the consequence that inclusive education is difficult to achieve. Shame, stigma, and prejudice about disability, and general ignorance about the rights of children are also significant barriers to inclusion. This research focuses on the inclusion of children and young adults with disabilities in educational and vocational training centres in Palestine. Two, semi-focused focus groups were conducted with mothers of children with disabilities to explore their attitudes to disability and whether their children were being provided with an education that met their needs as learners with disabilities. The data was analysed against the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, and reveals that the mothers generally valued the centres. However, low expectations and lack of respect for, or understanding about, children's rights, mean that children with disabilities do not have equal opportunities to make the most of their talents and develop to their fullest potential. As a result, children will continue to face discrimination, segregation or exclusion, not only within educational settings but also within their communities. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Taking into account the stereotypical image of the small town of Marsabit (Northern Kenya), often described as a “far” and “not Kenyan” space affected by ethnic clashes and famine, appears useful to inquire how social relations build the space of the town reproducing new and ancient ties. The use of the town centre’s maps is a good method for processing qualitative data and to acquire additional information about the urban space. By looking at the maps of Marsabit centre, it is possible to recognize that the ethnic lines in town are porous and flexible. Ethnicity creates and maintains group boundaries offering the very foundation of social interaction and subsequently of the understanding of (urban) space by individuals and groups. To delve into the spatial dimension of ethnic relations may allow a better understanding of the actual reality of a region characterized by fragile political, economic and social balances. © 2020, Viella.

AB  - This study researches the association between schools' ethnic diversity and the three dimensions of teacher burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Two possible explanations, teachers' ethnic prejudice and teachability perceptions of the students, are examined. The first hypothesis states that teachers who work in schools with a high ethnically diverse student population will perceive these students as less teachable, leading towards less positive relationships and therefore are more likely to develop a burnout. The second hypothesis is that teachers are less prejudiced towards ethnic minorities when teaching in high ethnically diverse schools, develop more positive relationships with their students, and as a consequence are less likely to develop a burnout. Through a multilevel analysis, we investigated data (2014- 2015), which was gathered from 635 secondary school teachers in 45 urban schools. The findings indicate that only teachers' emotional exhaustion is dependent on the school context. The students' ethnic diversity contributes to emotional exhaustion via the lower level of teachability that teachers attribute to the students in these schools. This study indicates the importance of positive teachability perceptions of students for teachers to remain engaged within their schools and to teach in a culturally responsive way. © 2020 Vereniging voor Onderwijsresearch (VOR).

AB  - The author uses restricted geocoded tract-level panel data (1986–2014) that span the prison boom and the acceleration of residential segregation in the United States from two cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 and Children and Young Adults) to study whether the association between childhood neighborhood disadvantage and adult incarceration varies by race and ethnicity. Sibling fixed-effects models suggest that exposure to childhood neighborhood disadvantage increases the likelihood of incarceration in adulthood, net of observed and unobserved adjustments. However, the association appears weakest for blacks, especially black boys, compared with whites and Latinos. This suggests a more consistent likelihood of incarceration for blacks across all neighborhood origins. The author discusses potential theoretical explanations, including discrimination in profiling, policing, surveillance, and other prejudicial policies in the criminal justice system that are likely to uniquely affect blacks from all neighborhoods. © SAGE Publications Inc..

AB  - Social Identity Theory suggests that individuals are motivated to support/oppose policies and politicians that benefit/harm members of their ingroup as a means of protecting their social status. Since the Republican Party's rhetoric against immigrants in recent decades has often been viewed as an assault upon those of Latinx descent, it is not surprising that strong majorities oppose restrictionist immigration policies and support the Democratic Party. However, the existing literature has overlooked why a sizeable minority of Latinx voters express support for restrictionist immigration policies and the politicians who espouse them. Our analysis of Latinx voters with the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES) demonstrates that the degree to which individuals prioritize their US American identity over their Latinx identity has a significant influence over support for conservative immigration policies and GOP candidates. This relationship emerges above and beyond partisanship, ideology, and other key explanatory factors. Such attitudes likely represent an individual social mobility strategy in which members of a social group attempt to "pass"as a member of a higher-status group. Prioritizing a US American identity, supporting the Republican Party, and expressing hostility toward the interests of undocumented immigrants are a means of distinguishing themselves from a social group that has become increasingly associated with negative stereotypes. In contrast, those who are unwilling or unable to make this transition are likely pursuing a collective social mobility strategy (e.g., linked fate) whereby they attempt to enhance their individual status by elevating that of the entire social group. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Virgínia Leone Bicudo, a black woman from São Paulo born in 1910, was a very active character in the field of health education, social sciences and psychoanalysis. Her master's dissertation, defended in the 1940s under the title ‘Study of Racial Attitudes of Blacks and Mulattoes in São Paulo', was the first work about race relations defended at a Brazilian university. Her research had an innovative character, since it showed that there is color prejudice independent of class prejudice, contrary to what was believed at the time. The present work rescues the findings and conclusions of the study of Virgínia, using for this the technique of Analysis of Nuclei of Sense in order to bring the speeches of the interviewees that were more representative of the conclusions pointed out by the author. With this, we aim to contribute to future resumes on the findings of Virgínia, which show enormous relevance despite having passed more than 70 years. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Despite broad research on the connection between in-group and out-group attitudes, empirical studies dealing with the relationship between nation-related and anti-immigration attitudes rarely provide a consistent theoretical framework. On one hand, it is assumed that if persons agree with nationalistic statements, they might develop an orientation against strangers. On the other hand, one might imagine the existence of simple factor correlations among nationalism, patriotism, and anti-immigration attitudes. It can be argued that if people form a group, they will be automatically confronted with out-group members. Both proposals can claim some plausibility. But as several empirical studies mirror varying theoretical assumptions, the author compares different structure models on the basis of German International Social Survey Programme data. Two models lead to satisfactory solutions. Their respective theoretical meaning is discussed in detail. As a result, personal construct theory is integrated here as a theoretical framework with which to explain the correlational structure of a model with three factors without assuming any causality between them. © American Sociological Association 2018.

AB  - Schooling and education, in general, are perceived as a means of integrating children of new immigrants into Canadian society and preparing young immigrants for their future careers. High school education and the subjects taken prepare these young immigrants for postsecondary education and entry into the labour market. However, these newcomer students, particularly those of African origin, are discouraged by systemic structures from pursuing school curricula that may lead them to their aspired careers. This is, for a major part, the result of the role played by teachers and school career counsellors as gatekeepers. Research shows that teachers and career counsellors have pre-conceived negative, racist and prejudicial stereotypes about African students and their abilities for educational performance and success. Further, Canadian schools promote linguistic structures, authority patterns, and types of curricula that alienate African immigrant students. We contend that schools need to implement culturally appropriate career guidance programs that are conducted by professionals trained in cultural sensitivities. As such, this paper argues for the inclusion of teachers and counsellors who appreciate the culture and learning styles of these students, and who can serve as identity models for the students. In addition, we advance the need for inter-school-community mentorship programs that facilitate minority students’ aspirations into the careers of their choice. © 2020, Canadian Ethnic Studies Association.

AB  - The text raises the debate about the constitution of psychology in Brazil, pointing to its bases imported from countries with realities quite different from those found here, in social and economic as well as historical, cultural and racial aspects. Psychology since 1962 has been based on models that rarely take into account the context in which it finds itself: a country that lays its foundations on slavery, prejudice, violence, the 20 years of a truculent military dictatorship, exclusion, mass incarceration and the extermination of indigenous and black populations, murders of homosexuals and transsexuals. In the current scenario, which intensifies aspects always present here and dismantles the strategies of their confrontation, it is urgent to rethink the practices and psychological knowledge producers and breeders of colonial subjectivities, in times that, paraphrasing Hannah Arendt, announce them selves as dark, but at the same time challenge psychology, especially clinical, to awaken from their sleep and enchanted dreams. © 2020.

AB  - Although research consistently shows that persons with direct experience and other forms of contact with mental illness endorse less mental health stigma than others, it is unclear how stigma is expressed by persons experiencing mental health symptoms who have not formally been labeled. One possibility is that unlabeled persons may engage in “defensive projection” and thereby endorse more stigma. Research with young adults with untreated mental health problems suggests that “self-identification” is associated with less stigma and may moderate this effect. The present study investigated whether having a subclinical mental disorder is related to greater stigma and whether self-identification moderates this relationship. Four hundred ninety-four college students and general community members were administered scales assessing psychiatric symptoms, self-identification of mental illness, and 2 dimensions of stigma (agreement with negative stereotypes and microaggression behavior). Findings supported the defensive projection hypothesis, in that persons with subclinical mental disorders demonstrated more stigma than others. Findings also supported that the defensive projection was moderated by self-identification; however, findings indicated that self-identification did not completely override the effect of having a subclinical mental disorder on stigma, as participants with high self-identification and subclinical mental disorder still demonstrated higher scores in both aspects of stigma than participants with no subclinical mental disorder. Findings suggest that antistigma interventions need to place more emphasis on the normalization of mental health conditions to reduce instances in which persons reject others partly because they struggle to accept aspects of themselves.

AB  - A theoretical model is proposed to predict the influence of media consumption on social interaction intentions regarding individuals with mental illness. This model of mediated interaction intentions is informed by media priming theory, as well as the reasoned action approach. It incorporates stigma beliefs and prejudicial attitudes to uniquely predict the influence of media exposure on social inclinations. An experimental examination reveals partial support for the hypothesized model via the mediator of attitudes, though not social stigma. Nevertheless, all analyses support the contention that prejudice and stigma are unique perceptions that should be treated as conceptually and operationally distinct. Moreover, prejudice and stigma (as attitudes and norms, respectively) are suitable concepts to employ in an interpersonal adaptation of the reasoned action approach predicting sociobehavioral inclinations. This study contributes to theorizing about how media can have problematic interpersonal outcomes due to their influence on underlying social perceptions. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) © 2018 American Psychological Association

AB  - Background: Snail-meat is probably the greatest subject of food prohibitions in several African climes and beyond. These prohibitions fuel deficiencies of micronutrients which contributes significantly to maternal morbidity and mortality. Yet, motivations of consuming prohibited foods such as snail-meat are seemingly non-existent. Objective: This study was designed to examine ethnic attitudes towards snail-meat intake during pregnancy and other correlates of snail-meat consumption among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria. Method: Using cross-sectional design, four-hundred copies of a structured questionnaire were administered to randomly selected respondents. Multi-item measures were used to assess variables. Data were analysed using One-way ANOVA and Spearman rank correlation-coefficient. Results: Univariate analysis shows that 62.3% of respondents have consumed snail-meat since they became pregnant. Age, marital status, religion and ethnicity have no significant effects on snail-meat consumption (p> 0.05) but education did (p< 0.05). Health motivation, convenience, sensory appeal, ethnic attitudes and willingness-to-consume are significantly and positively related to snail-meat consumption but price is significantly and inversely related to same (p< 0.05). Food insecurity and financial capacity maintained insignificant relationship with this consumption (p> 0.05). Conclusion: Having decreased education is predisposing towards increased snail-meat consumption. Perceived importance of health benefits accruable from snail-meat consumption, perceived ease at which snail-meat could be accessed/prepared, snail-meat's attraction to the senses, cost, ethnic group's disposition towards the consumption of snail-meat during pregnancy and stimulus to consume snail-meat during pregnancy are significant social phenomenon maneuvering snail-meat intake among pregnant women in the study area. © 2021 Cognizance Research Associates - Published by JLLS.

AB  - When British soldiers and civilians entered the Allied-occupied Rhineland after the First World War, they were often surprised to discover that the individual Germans they encountered had little in common with the image of the enemy promulgated by British propaganda during the war. While face-to-face encounters with an often disconcertingly friendly civilian population inevitably forced the British to re-evaluate their wartime visions of the enemy, certain negative stereotypes of the German enemy nevertheless persisted in the context of the occupation. Several British commentators even found it necessary to fall back on these stereotypes when trying to explain the friendly attitude of the local population. To some, German friendliness only served to demonstrate the servile disposition of the Germans towards any form of authority; to others, it confirmed the existence of a supposed division in Germany between a liberal, peace-loving and civilized south and west and the “real” enemy, an autocratic, militarist and expansionist Prussia. Moreover, the British self-image in the Rhineland was frequently constructed in opposition to a real or imagined German enemy. The attitude and behaviour of the occupiers was regularly presented as characteristically “British” and measured not only against how the Germans had treated the populations of occupied regions of France and Belgium during the war, but also against how the stereotypical “Hun” would have behaved in the case of a German victory. © 2020 Angles.

AB  - In the West, negative stereotypes of Muslims and Islam are not limited to the post-9/11 era, and surface not only in the media and non-fiction but also in literature, fine art, film, and children’s cartoons. This article focuses on depictions following 9/11, specifically on the ways in which the dominant image of the Muslim as ‘enemy’ can be subverted in film through an analysis of Ae Fond Kiss (dir. Ken Loach, 2004). It focuses on questions of identity, and the emergence of what social anthropologists such as Vertovec (1997) label ‘new ethnicities’ (the development of hybrid or syncretic cultural identities). The acknowledgement of new ethnicities can serve to counter facile negative stereotyping and the entrenched bias that sometimes permeate mainstream British media and culture. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This paper provides a brief outline of the reception history of Othello in Poland, focusing on the way the character of the Moor of Venice is constructed on the page, in the first-published nineteenth-century translation by Józef Paszkowski, and on the stage, in two twentieth-century theatrical adaptations that provide contrasting images of Othello: 1981/1984 televised Othello, dir. Andrzej Chrzanowski and the 2011 production of African Tales Based on Shakespeare, in which Othello’s part is played by Adam Ferency (dir. Krzysztof Warlikowski). The paper details the political and social contexts of each of these stage adaptations, as both of them employ brownface and blackface to visualise Othello’s “political colour.” The function of blackface and brownface is radically different in these two productions: in the 1981/1984 Othello brownface works to underline Othello’s overall sense of alienation, while strengthening the existing stereotypes surrounding black as a skin colour, while the 2011 staging makes the use of blackface as an artificial trick of the actor’s trade, potentially unmasking the constructedness of racial prejudices, while confronting the audience with their own pernicious racial stereotypes. © by the author, licensee Łódź University – Łódź University Press, Łódź, Poland.

AB  - This paper aims to point out to the social position of women in early 19th century England with references to Jane Austen’s Emma and Charlotte Bronte’s Villette. In the first part, in addition to the definition of the ideal Victorian woman, limited educational, economic, and social opportunities of women will also be pointed out. In the second part, Villette will be handled in terms of its approach to the social problems of women such as their limited job and educational opportunities. Social norms drawn for an ideal Victorian woman and the significance of the institution of marriage for women will also be scrutinized. In the third part, Emma will be studied in terms of its reflection of the social position of women. With the analyses of two novels, the paper aims to conclude that in the Victorian Era, women were seen as social inferiors because of the prejudice against them in society. Examining how Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen became the voice of the injustice and prejudices against women, the paper concludes that Victorian women could only justify their presence on earth by dedicating themselves to others through self-effacement, duty, and sacrifice. In addition to this, the paper also points out that in early 19th century England, women faced many difficulties to obtain social, economic, and educational rights that are equal to those of men. This paper is dedicated to the examination of the social position of Victorian women because although this issue is referred to superficially in many articles, few articles handle the subject thoroughly. Hereby, the paper aims to engage in a scrutinized study of the issue on two novels of the period both of which provide fruitful and clear examples to the object of the study. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Mental maps are the type of maps that everyone creates in their minds to orient themselves in space. The orienting process takes place on a daily basis, mostly unconsciously. Even the citizens of the same city tend to perceive urban space differently, emphasizing on different parts of the city, as their perceptions reflect their lifestyle, habits, preferences, experiences, but mostly the feelings that the space itself provokes to them. Human-centered factors, such as mental capacity, memories, emotional state, age, gender, as well as social-cultural ones, such as social media influences and prejudices, have a great significance on mental mapping. Inspired by Kevin Lynch (1960) and Jack Nasar (1990), this paper analyzes the center of Thessaloniki, through information and mental maps gathered from 50 interviews with residents, both men and women from different age groups and a range of social classes. The analysis traces the features that attract (e.g. the water element) or repel (e.g. the presence of marginalized groups) the inhabitants of Thessaloniki, their feelings (e.g. insecurity) and the daily routes they follow for various activities. It attempts to identify their common but also different perceptions of the city, the stereotypes, prejudices and their origins. However, the most important role seems to be played by the experiences that each person has lived in specific places. Finally, apart from being unique products that reveal each person’s intimate thoughts about space, mental maps constitute a useful tool to discover the image held by the inhabitants of a city in order to promote its sustainable development. © Association of European Geographers

AB  - The present study aims to use Sociocultural Identity theory to education with reference to teaching and learning English as a second language in the EFL textbooks development. The findings of this study revealed that there is a need to use the cultural sensitive and context-appropriate materials in the EFL textbooks. It is urgent to teaching materials correspond with the learners’ attitudes, religious opinions and preferences. Because, textbook is not only a commercially accessible reference book which is utilized in a language teaching program, it additionally serves as a significant way to convey political and ideological orientation. Moreover, textbooks decide not only content teaching and learning environments, but also what dominant or valid culture is passed on. Then one goal of textbooks is to serve as a means of facilitating the integration of content about ethnically, racially and culturally diverse individuals. To this end, textbook writers should avoid cultural inequalities and prejudices that learners can absorb in their learning, and have a balanced representation of social / cultural components such as ethnicity, gender, and race. © 2020 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - In the context of an increasingly globalized world and of the emerg McLuhan), nowadays, great importance is awarded to the teaching of intercultural communication skills in ESL courses as well as to students in different fields of the humanities such as communication studies, journalism, international relations, etc. Fostering intercultural communication skills in young adults helps them cope with contemporary issues like intolerance, cultural shock, fear of differences, discrimination, and religious prejudice. This article explores some practical activities that can be used in order to help students become more emphatic and more flexible towards those of different cultural backgrounds, and generally more flexible in their use of communication strategies in their home communities. Methods such as role- and focus groups are believed to bring more benefits to an intercultural communication course owing to the fact that most people are inclined to learn more by experiencing than by simply hearing and/or reading. © 2020 Ovidius University.

AB  - This article adopts a comparative approach to examine the ways in which both novels explore the theme of alienation in relation to questions of gender and race through the spatial strategies of the novels; of particular importance in my investigation is the act of walking in the city, and the forms of escape that two leading characters in the novels-Nell and Mr Ma-adopt in order to react against the social reality of the metropolis of London. My focus of inquiry, while choosing two works that are not often put together for analysis, also departs from previous studies that often focus on the two writers' use of humor and characterization, elements of which Lao She had acknowledged the inspiration that he drew from Charles Dickens's novels. I argue in this article that it is the spatial articulation of the two novels, and the characters' response to the various prejudices of their time and the constraints that they face as de facto “outsider” to the city that constitute the major connection between the two writers, both of whom drew inspiration from the city for their artistic composition and social critique.

AB  - Background: The chapter explores the intersection of multimodal and digital literacies and racial identities of Black Caribbean immigrant youth in the United States (U.S.). Drawing on ethnographic research on the ways in which adolescent students embody their identities online, the chapter details some of the tensions that arise when these adolescents attempt to navigate a new home country that racializes their cultural and national identities and literacy practices. Context: The chapter offers a meta-analysis of case studies five Black Caribbean immigrant adolescents' multimodal and digital literacy practices in response to the racialized category "Black." Looking across four ethnographic case studies, and through the thematic metaanalysis of data, the chapter presents data snapshots of pivotal events that reflect issues of race. These events highlight the dialogic ways that these youth make use of literacy practices to understand what it means to be Black and immigrant, and to challenge these dominant, racialized representations that negate their cultural identities. Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to explore the tensions that arise when these adolescents attempt to navigate a new home country that racializes their cultural and national identities and literacy practices. In the case of Black Caribbean immigrant youth, part of this newcomer experience involves negotiating what "race" and "blackness" mean in terms of their academic, social, and personal lives. Thus, the chapter illustrates how young people use their modally and digitally mediated practices to negotiate racialized positionings across physical and virtual spaces, affinity groups, and the school and social contexts of their adopted U.S. homes. Findings: As Black Caribbean immigrants, these young persons engage in emotional identity work in their talk about and/or experiences of race. The adolescents' emotional response to racialized categories was defined by contesting feelings of pride, shame, and resilience. Two salient themes that characterized these tensions are the conflicting sense of 1) national pride versus the racial prejudice, and 2) deficit versus worthy. Their feelings of self-worth were intrinsically connected to racialized identity labels "Black" and "immigrant." However, the modal tools and spaces they used and created serve as sites of resilience and identity (re)framing. Conclusions: Adolescents developed their own personal and/or public voice that allowed them to reevaluate their self-worth, importance of social status, opportunities for advocacy, and their redefinitions of identity labels. Modal spaces and tools offered these adolescents alternative frames of reference within which they could evaluate and reposition Self. The intentional responses of these Black immigrant youth offered positive ways to see and present themselves while challenging deficit narratives of persons of color. © 2020 Teachers College, Columbia University.

AB  - In this article we present thematic analyses of semistructured interviews with three Latina undergraduate students who are first-generation college and who also self-identify as “Dreamers” and as DACA recipients. The interview data used to inform this article stem from 2 larger qualitative studies in which we applied social constructivist epistemology to interpret the participants’ perspectives and experiences associated with their schooling. In addition, we discuss broadly the impact of the current political climate on the 3 participants’ lives, and how the intersectionality of racial oppression and social class inequality create barriers for them. We also explore the unique family and interpersonal relationships that the Latina participants face when attaining an education and how they may influence their educational aspirations. We couch the perspectives and experiences of these self-identified Latina Dreamers in the current charged political era, where anti-immigrant sentiment, and especially anti-Latinx sentiment, continues to emanate from the nation’s highest office. Our findings are structured into 4 themes including Educational Goals and Aspirations, Unable to Find Targeted Assistance, Culture Shock on Campus, and Political Influence on Campus. Recommendations for educational leaders in K–12 and higher education environments are provided. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)<strong xmlns:lang="en">Public Significance Statement—A focus on Latinas and education is both important and timely. Given the recent anti-immigrant discourse and the criminalization of Latinx populations, combined with the realities of a border wall and detention and separation of families without due process, it is imperative that we have a better understanding of how the current political era influences Latinas’ educational pathways and trajectories, and how educational leaders can best serve their interests.

AB  - This paper surveys 1 of the author’s 3 lifetime research themes, namely the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination. We first review large-scale surveys documenting the prevalence of prejudice and discrimination suffered by minorities in Canada including Indigenous, African Canadians, Francophone minorities in English-Canada, and English-speaking communities in Quebec. There is growing evidence of the mental and physical health consequences of being victim of discrimination in Canada and elsewhere in the world. We review laboratory studies using the Minimal Group Paradigm showing that the mere categorisation of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination. In line with Social Identity Theory, the degree of ingroup identification and the need to achieve a positive social identity help account for the classic ingroup favoritism effect obtained in Minimal Group Paradigm studies. Thus, both social identity needs (Social Identity Theory) and competition for scarce resources articulated within Realistic Conflict Theory combine to account for prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup antagonisms. Interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination are discussed including intergroup contact and diversity training. As scientific consultant, the author helped develop the French Radio-Canada television documentary, La Leçon de Discrimination, which won best television educational program in the world and was successfully adapted as a prodiversity pedagogical tool in Canada and worldwide. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement—Experiments show that mere categorization of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination between groups. There is mounting research documenting the negative mental and physical health consequences of being victim of systemic discrimination. Intergroup contact and diversity training help reduce prejudice and discrimination. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Cet article examine l’un des 3 thèmes de recherche privilégiés par l’auteur au cours de sa carrière, notamment la psychologie sociale des préjugés et de la discrimination. Sont d’abord examinées les enquêtes à grande échelle qui documentent l’étendue des préjugés et de la discrimination à l’égard des minorités au Canada, à savoir les Autochtones, les Afro-Canadiens, les minorités francophones dans le Canada anglais et les minorités anglophones au Québec. Il existe des preuves grandissantes des répercussions de la discrimination sur la santé mentale et physique des victimes, au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde. L’auteur passe en revue les études en laboratoire ayant utilisé le paradigme des groupes minimaux qui ont révélé que la catégorisation des gens « eux contre nous » et la détermination de groupes suffisent à favoriser l’apparition de préjugés et de discrimination. Conformément à la théorie de l’identité sociale, le niveau d’identification au sein d’un groupe et le besoin d’atteindre une identité sociale positive contribuent à l’effet classique de favoritisme au sein d’un groupe, mis en relief dans le cadre d’études reposant sur le paradigme des groupes minimaux. Ainsi, à la fois les besoins d’une identité sociale (théorie de l’identité sociale) et la concurrence pour des ressources limitées, décrite dans la théorie du conflit réaliste, agissent de concert et expliquent les préjugés, la discrimination et les antagonismes intergroupes. L’article se termine par une discussion des interventions visant à amoindrir les préjugés et la discrimination, dont les contacts intergroupes et la formation sur la diversité. En tant que consultant scientifique, l’auteur a contribué à la production du documentaire télévisé La leçon de discrimination, pour la chaîne francophone de Radio-Canada. Ce documentaire, qui a remporté le prix mondial du meilleur programme éducatif pour la télévision, a été adapté avec succès pour en faire un outil pédagogique en faveur de la diversité au Canada et dans le monde entier.

AB  - Is fundamentalism universal across religious cultures? We investigated this issue by focusing on 3 questions: (a) the dimensionality of fundamentalism, as measured by the Religious Fundamentalism Scale (Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004); (b) the very nature of fundamentalism as denoting dogmatic belief, moral rigorism, or strong groupness; and (c) interreligious prejudice as predicted uniquely, additively, or interactively by religiousness and sociocognitive rigidity. We collected data from 14 countries of Catholic, Protestant, Christian Orthodox, Buddhist, Jewish, and Muslim tradition, regrouped in 7 cultural-religious zones (N = 3,218 young adults). We measured fundamentalism, the 4 dimensions of religiousness (believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging), authoritarianism, existential quest, and interreligious prejudice—negative and discriminatory attitudes toward various religious outgroups and atheists. Across religious cultures, we found that: (a) the scale is unidimensional; (b) fundamentalism is best conceptualized as a combination of dogmatic belief (believing and low existential quest) and moral rigorism (behaving and authoritarianism) and occasionally as strong groupness (belonging and authoritarianism); (c) religious dimensions, additively to and interactively with, authoritarianism and low existential quest predict interreligious prejudice (in monotheistic cultures); and (d) anti-Muslim attitudes were the highest, but fundamentalism and religiousness related most strongly to antiatheist sentiments.

AB  - Public Significance Statement: Based on time-use diaries from the American Time Use Survey, stay-at-home fathers (SAHFs) found time with children to be meaningful, happy, less tiring, and less stressful than time alone. SAHFs also reported higher feelings of sadness when spending time with a spouse and significantly more stress and less happiness while interacting with nonspouse adults. Attending to SAHFs’ subjective well-being and social contact has important implications for SAHFs, their partners, and their children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) © 2020 American Psychological Association
Stay-at-home fathers (SAHFs) face negative stereotypes and social stigma, which may be linked to negative feelings during social contact. In this study, we compare SAHFs’ social contact and time alone to that of stay-at-home mothers and parents of other work/caregiving statuses. In addition, we analyze SAHFs’ subjective well-being when with their children, spouse, nonspouse adults, and when alone to more accurately capture the positive and negative valences of their experiences. Using individual-level time-use diaries from the American Time Use Survey (N = 35,959), a nationally representative sample, we find that compared to fathers working full time, SAHFs spent more time alone, more time with only their children, and less time with adults. SAHFs reported that this alone time was meaningful, not negative. They reported more happiness when interacting exclusively with children. These findings refute some stereotypes that primary caregiving fathers only stay home with their children as a last resort and further support the new fatherhood ideal that contemporary fathers desire to be more actively involved in child rearing. Unfortunately, SAHFs reported significantly more sadness, more stress, and less happiness while interacting in a variety of contexts with adults. Connecting our work with previous research, we believe these findings are best explained by either exclusion of SAHFs or increased salience of social stigmas felt by SAHFs in social situations with adults. These indicators of emotional well-being during social contact have important implications for parent physical and mental health.

AB  - I explore how empathetic visual argument may be the mode best suited for eliciting appropriate force to the reasons given by arguers who face systematic identity prejudices. In the verbal mode, this force is often skewed through epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007), argumentative injus-tice (Bondy 2010), and discursive injustice (Kukla 2010). Highlighting their reliance on the Aristotelian sense of enthymeme, I show how visual arguments are highly context specific. Using Ian Dove’s Visual Scheming (2016) and the theory of the Retort collective (2004) via case study, I demonstrate how the visual mode can leave the appropriate force in the arguer’s control. © Harmony Peach.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan city, China, in late December 2019, has now spread globally with over 43 million people infected and about 1.16 million deaths as of 30 October 2020. COVID-19 is a novel and highly transmissible disease where little is known, which is why health authorities and the public alike have reasons to be concerned. With the spread of the disease, there has been an ‘infodemic’, which is defined as an influx of all kinds of information, including authentic information and also rumours, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the origin, prevention and treatment of the disease. With the growth of infodemics over social media and mass media, prejudicial and xenophobic acts became more evident, presenting additional challenges for health authorities. Effective con-trol of pandemics such as COVID-19 thus requires large-scale, multifaceted response measures including risk communications. A transdisciplinary collaborative One Health approach has been increasingly advocated as an effective strategy to address diseases that occur at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. Similarly, the role of social science in risk communications in recent epidemics such as Ebola has been widely acknowledged. Timely interdisciplinary reviews, including a social and behavioural sciences lens, are needed to optimise the pandemic response through effectively combating communication challenges associated with infodemics and many other challenges in future epidemic responses. © 2020, Royal Society of Queensland.

AB  - Recent work on the social effects of video gaming has moved away from the view they are detrimental, and has instead demonstrated how they may be a force for good. One example is how collaborative intergroup play can reduce prejudice between groups. However, this literature is at a nascent stage, and many of the intricacies of such a mechanism are unknown. Previous work has predominantly used attitude scales and ignored other measures. Factors such as the role of the opponent in games and what may be the mechanism behind any effects have likewise received little attention. In this laboratory study, participants played collaborative games with an outgroup member or alone. Their opponent was also reported to be computer controlled or controlled by another person. Following play, intergroup anxiety was reported, and participants wrote a short passage of prose regarding the outgroup and rated on attitude scales. Analysis demonstrated that playing with outgroup members was indeed an effective method of increasing the positivity toward outgroup members, reflected in both scale and prose measures. Anxiety was also found to be a significant mediator; however, it was less clear whether a human opponent moderated any effects. Further ideas of how these findings could be developed are then discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) © 2018 American Psychological Association

The work of Pierre Bourdieu Language and Symbolic Power is an example of a certain sociological prejudice regarding the treatment of language as a fundamental topic. This work consists of three parts: the first presents Bour-dieu's criticism of John Longshaw Austin; the second deals with certain general aspects of the analytical tradition that must be analyzed by contemporary sociology; the last part will be dedicated to defending the Austinian theory of speech acts. © 2020.

AB  - We explain how Participatory Action Research (PAR) and storytelling methods have been used to create a new intersubjective awareness of sustainability potential among a group of farmers in Denmark. We asked the following intervention question: How can PAR be combined with storytelling to create new intersubjective perceptions about farmers’ sustainability in their daily work life? The question of creating voluntary democratic participation was crucial for all stakeholders in this project. Through a storytelling “futures workshop” concept the need for a new story about the industry was acknowledged and initiated to make choice of a non-status quo future. In this process, we utilized PAR to create new beliefs about being part of sustainable food production. The participants decided to co-author a counternarrative to the dominant political economy narrative about agriculture in Denmark. First, we contribute an understanding of the difference between PAR and AR. PAR develops collective storytelling approach, whereas AR stays with the intervenor’s narrative. Our second contribution is to overcome several short-comings of the triplebottom line approach. In particular, we developed metrics and objectives to flex out the people and planet aspects, rather than the usual reductions of these to profit metrics. © 2020, Organization Development Institute.

AB  - In Chile, bilingual intercultural education (EIB) is a State policy that incorporates the teaching of the language and culture of indigenous peoples in the school curriculum. The research problem suggests that carrying out EIB in the classroom is limited by epistemological challenges put to those responsible for implementing it. The article presents research results that describe the perception of mentor teachers related to factors that affect the teaching of the Mapuche language and culture in the pedagogical relationship with the traditional educator, in three schools located in Mapuche communities in La Araucanía. The methodology is qualitative, with a descriptive level, in which semi-directed interviews were conducted with the participants. The analysis of the information was done by using the grounded theory technique. Results show that there is a negative perception towards EIB, when it is conceived as an educational policy imposed by the State, which limits a paradigmatic breakdown of the school for teaching Mapuche language and culture in the classroom. Conclusion is that there is an urgent need to discuss and question the EIB policy, which due to its functional focus increases racism and prejudice towards the Mapuche in school education. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink intercultural education from a critical perspective, which arises from subjects who have historically been subordinated. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background/Context: With the incessant wave of anti-Black and anti-immigrant sentiments, the extant political situation in the contemporary United States presents an ideal space, place, and time to investigate Black immigrant students' experiences and examine the ways in which dominant racial and linguistic ideologies shape their literate identities and position them in schools and society. While the Black immigrant population overall continues to increase, the Black immigrant student population in United States K-12 schools has experienced a steady upward trend. This student population shares some of the racialized experiences of Black American students but also reflects distinctive cultural, linguistic, and literate identities, and experiences that we, as educators, must acknowledge and embrace if we are to help them effectively navigate the educational and social terrain of the U.S. Purpose/Research Questions: The purpose of this article is to amplify (counter)narratives that highlight one adolescent African immigrant's (Noemi) identities and languages within and beyond school spaces, to exemplify the ways in which she utilizes alternative literacies to accommodate, and/or resist racial and immigration status-based microaggressions. The study was guided by the following questions: 1) What are Noemi's literacy, language, and identity practices in and beyond school spaces? 2) What are the ways in which she utilizes these practices to resist stereotypes and other forms of marginalization? Research Design: Utilizing a narrative case study approach, the article highlights the lived experiences of a single participant - Noemi. Narrative case study allowed me to intentionally give life to Noemi's stories regarding her home and school experiences, the ways in which she has been positioned due to her unique identity, language, and literacy practices, and her methods of resistance. Data Collection and Analysis: Data sources included two semistructured interviews and a Venn diagram that consisted of a comparison of the focal participant's home and school literacies. A relational content analysis was conducted using the information provided in the Venn diagram, and interview data were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Critical race theory, a raciolinguistic perspective, and resistance theory were considered in the analysis and framing of the resulting counternarratives. Findings/Results: Noemi's counternarratives were characterized by three emergent themes: (a) being raised African in America, (b) racial literacies, music, and social media, and (c) race, language, and the sociopolitical climate. Each of the themes and their corresponding subthemes were supported by elements of critical race theory and a raciolinguistic perspective. In addition, Noemi's counternarratives consisted of numerous "clapbacks" (effective responses to criticisms, stereotypes, and dominant ideologies) that served as indicators of resistance. Conclusions/Recommendations: Noemi's counternarratives suggest three acknowledgments to be made. First, educators must acknowledge identity practices beyond those seen in academic spaces and tap into the vast metaknowledge of their immigrant populations. Second, we must not lose sight that dominant, hegemonic messages with regard to languages, literacies, and cultures are not only produced by the dominant group, but that they are also (re)produced by the media and nonwhite people to marginalize and maintain structural hierarchies. Therefore, critical conversations are needed with native nonwhite groups to prevent discriminatory practices and maltreatment of immigrant students. Finally, if we are to create equitable and socially just academic environments, educators must acknowledge manifestations of resistance (in its many forms) and use this knowledge to help transform schooling environments in which immigrants, like Noemi, are expected to thrive. They must also identify the ways in which they function as part of institutional norms, to create situations that require students to leverage "clapbacks" in schools. © 2020 Teachers College, Columbia University.

AB  - This article is devoted to the study of online hate speech against the Roma minority and, at the same time, to the study of the heuristic possibilities of modern analytical tools. The authors' study revealed that the Roma community is of relatively little interest to ordinary users on social networks, rendering hate speech against Roma on Ukrainian web space uncommon. The authors found that there is only one large public group, which was discovered in the Ukrainian-language Facebook sector, that concerns Roma and contains hate speech against them. The authors also found that, out of all Twitter messages created by users from Ukraine (during March - September 2018), only 80 posts are related to Roma (“Gypsies”), and only 45 of them contain hate speech. The analysis of the content of these Facebook and Twitter messages demonstrated that the mechanisms of forming hate speech against Roma in online environments remain unchanged: ethnicity-related stigmatization; spread of negative stereotypes, fears and prejudices; emphasis on "otherness". The channels spreading hate speech on social networks are local autonomous groups, which are usually created by one author and later, if the publications provoke the interest of the audience, can become a "mouthpiece of hatred." The main difference between online and offline hate speech is the possibility of rapid spread: only a few hate statements, which are repeated many times in the comments of followers, can cause significant harm and lead to crimes in real life. Use of the available tools for data mining and social network analysis has shown that these tools allow researchers to extract data from social networks and use them as an empirical basis for sociological research. However, the study of online hate speech on Ukrainian web space is difficult due to the difficulties of semantic analysis — primarily reflected in the fact that there are no dictionaries to identify hate speech in the Ukrainian context and only imperfect tools for text analysis (including commercial) exist. © 2020.

AB  - African elites’ perpetual hope for export-led growth based on primary commodity extraction continues to suffer from harsh economic, political and now also climatic and public-health realities. Among the contradictions, COVID-19’s economic lockdown amplified two of the most difficult aspects of South Africa’s regional and inter-ethnic relations: increased working-class desperation as township economies suffered the most from the pandemic, and the inability to send remittances back home. Although new dimensions emerged during 2020 – e.g., mass social-media trolling, Cabinet ministers’ biases translated into legislation, and protests at African countries’ Pretoria embassies – there were indications well before COVID-19 that local hostility to the continent’s people would ratchet up, just as Cyril Ramaphosa took the African Union chair. Xenophobic upsurges regularly witnessed in Johannesburg suggest that this ongoing melting pot of African entrepreneurs suffers some of the continent’s most extreme political-economic contradictions. However, there are antidotes to top-down neoliberalism still emanating from the African Development Bank and World Economic Forum-Africa, some of which are potentially progressive, including unprecedented anti-authoritarian protests in at least 18 countries. But the first step is recognising just how much the official rhetoric, even from organic African elite sources, departs from reality. © Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa, 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths in the first six months of 2020. It also exposed and led to increases in the inequalities that exist worldwide. This paper draws attention to the prejudices and biases toward three vulnerable social groups—women, the elderly and Asian ethnic minorities during the crisis. It shows that while women ‘held up more than half of the sky’ both inside and outside the house, they struggled against rising domestic violence and various forms of sexism. The elderly, the most at risk of infection, are being ‘abandoned,’ ‘abused’ or ‘obliged’ to sacrifice themselves to the capitalist market economy. Ethnic minorities, especially Asian/Chinese immigrants in western countries have been subjected to racial stereotypes in their everyday life. Although the coronavirus will disappear, the ‘shadow’ of the pandemic will undoubtedly remain unless we rebuild solidarity and work together to reflect, reconcile and redress the inequalities entrenched in our societies. © 2021 by the author(s).

AB  - Debojoy Chanda makes an examination of the work of early twentieth century Anglo-Indian social scientist Cedric Dover. He posits that Dover’s anti-racist writing was a clarion call to Anglo-Indians and those interacting with them. Chanda argues that Dover identifies the supremacist nature of the British in their dealing with Anglo-Indians, based on their flawed racist thinking. Drawing on Dover, Chanda concludes with a more generalised and global call against racist thinking and the prejudice that accompanies it. © 2020, Massey University. All rights reserved.

AB  - This contribution in three parts analyses for the first time Ion Pillat’s Buddhist poetry of his debut volume (Visări budiste [Buddhist Reveries] from Visări păgâne [Pagan Reveries] (Bucharest: «Minerva» – Institut de Arte Grafice și Editură, 1912) compared against plausible European and Asian religious and literary sources, contexts, and significance, in order to palliate the callous non-sense of some literary critics and the cultural prejudice inflicted by some scholars of religion. The five poems – A Buddhist Prayer (a title subsequently changed to A Prayer to the Buddha), Samsara [saṃsāra], Towards Nirvana, Karman and A Hymn of Worship – are illustrative of the wider topics and literary moves of an ‘Asian Renaissance’, and highlight the Buddhist legacy of Eugène Burnouf (1801-1852), a professor of the Collège de France who would become the founding father of modern Buddhist Studies worldwide and whose Magna Carta of Buddhist Studies would also have a Romanian echo, from Odobescu (who moreover frequented his classes) to Eminescu (who authored more and better Buddhist cantos) or Georgian (the first to critically edit Sanskrit texts) to young Pillat, a schoolboy, then student in Paris since 1905, to become the first translator into Romanian of another pupil of Sanskrit India in Paris and Harvard in the 1910-1914, T.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to understand the conceptions of individuals in psychological distress about their sexuality. METHODS: qualitative study held at a Psychosocial Care Center. Fifteen people assisted in the service participated. A semi-structured questionnaire and script with identification data survey and guiding questions were applied. Data were analyzed by Content Analysis. RESULTS: the following categories emerged: Prejudice of assisted people regarding homosexuality; Prejudice of assisted people regarding the expression of sexuality and the social context; Prejudice to the affective relationship among people assisted in CAPS; Prejudice of people assisted in the expression of female sexuality; Prejudice of society to the sexual orientation of assisted people. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: sexuality understanding showed that these are conceptions linked to prejudice and stigma of society. Although sexuality was present, it is clear that it was surrounded by taboos, myths and value judgments, in which the only way to deal with it was through repression.

AB  - Previous studies showed that people are more willing to express prejudiced attitudes towards others when their past behavior has established their credentials as non-prejudiced persons. We examined this moral licensing effect in organizational contexts on a sample of 318 elementary school teachers. First, participants were given the opportunity to disagree with a set of discriminatory sentences. Next, all participants were required to express their attitudes towards hiring a disabled person for a specific job within the educational working environment in a hypothetical scenario. We also investigated the associations of participants' decisions with other personal characteristics such as gender, age, and previous contact with persons with disabilities. We found that participants in the moral licensing condition expressed a stronger endorsement of the discriminatory decisional alternative. Results are discussed concerning the educational context regarding the inclusion of people with physical or mental disabilities within the academic working environment. © 2019 West University of Timisoara Publishing House & The Euroregional Center for Applied Psychology.

AB  - The aims of this research were (1) to develop a valid and reliable instrument for measuring an anti-immigrant attitude toward the Middle East refugees, (2) to test whether ethnic minority political exclusionism and national attachment and self-sacrifice will associate with the anti-immigrant attitude, and (3) whether the Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and Social dominance orientation (SDO) will associate with a hostile attitude toward the Middle East refugees. Confirmatory factor analysis of a 9-item self-report instrument for measuring the anti-immigrant attitude toward the Middle East refugees yielded a single factor underpinned by the components of the triangular theory of hate: passion (fear), the negation of intimacy (repulsion), and commitment (devaluation). Two structural models for prediction the anti-immigrant attitude toward the Middle East refugees were developed. Ethnic minority political exclusionism and national attachment and self-sacrifice were significant predictors of the anti-immigrant attitude. RWA and SDO were also significant predictors of the anti-immigrant attitude. Thus, it appears that a 9-item scale to measure an anti-immigrant attitude toward the Middle East refugees is a valid and reliable self-report instrument. © 2019 West University of Timisoara Publishing House & The Euroregional Center for Applied Psychology.

AB  - Background: The visual screening performed in schools is sometimes the only opportunity to detect uncorrected refraction errors (URE) causing low visual impairments, prejudice in the acquisition of knowledge, dropout and school repetition, poor motor skills, difficulty in social interaction and low self-esteem in schoolchildren. Objectives: To compare the detection of URE in elementary school children by visual screening (measurement of the AV with the Snellen table) and photoscreening; to evaluate the accuracy of the SpotTM Vision Screener (Welch Allyn) as an autorefractor by comparing its refraction measurements with those of the autorefractor Topcon KR 800 (Japan) and to verify the proportion of glasses with ready to ClipTM technology dispensed at the time of the students’ evaluation. Methods: Two hundred ninety-seven students were submitted to visual screening (cutoff point: AV monocular ≤ 0.7 and/or difference two Snellen lines between the eyes), photoscreening (cutoff point: hypermetropia≥ 3, 00D, myopia ≥ 0, 75D and astigmatism > 1D) and the measurement of the refraction error under cycloplegia with the photoscreener and autorefractor. Only the refraction data of the right eye were analyzed. The findings were converted into vectors of magnitude for analysis. Results: The sensitivity and specificity values of the visual screening method were 67.2% and 63.5% and photo screening were 76.1% and 79.1%. The mean difference between refraction by SVS and autorefractor was of + 0.154 SD combined with -0.170 DC in the 6-degree axis for the right eye of each patient. Conclusions: In the population evaluated the method of refractive screening by photoscreener was more effective than the visual screening. The comparison of the results of refraction under cycloplegia with the autorefractor validated the use of photoscreener as an accurate refraction method for the measurement of refractive errors in schoolchildren. The majority of the students received their glasses with ready to Clip™ technology at the time of prescription. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this study we investigated the relationship between the anti-prejudice norm and the expression of attitudes towards minority groups. Participated 100 people who evaluated a list with 16 target groups of prejudice, answering two questions: indicate the groups that feel less prejudice; and which ones do you prefer. The results showed that there are different levels of prejudice depending on the target-group, with the women, blacks and people with disabilities being the most protected by the norm. A hierarchical analysis of clusters evidenced an organization of the groups, classified as naturalised, blamed, sexual and political minorities. The anti-prejudice norm and the attitudes presented a strong and positive relation (r = 0.65, p < 0.001). A multilevel logistic regression analysis showed that this relation was moderated by the type of group. These results contribute to the studies on the expression of prejudice, besides demonstrating the role of norms in the understanding of the phenomenon. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - We introduce and examine the effects of parasocial contact between out-groups—or contact that occurs when someone observes a media portrayal of contact between members of two out-groups. Our study examines Hispanic people’s perceptions of Black or Native American out-groups after observing positive contact between a member of one of those groups and a majority group (White) person. Based on social identity theory, we predict that parasocial contact between out-groups will exacerbate prejudice toward the Black out-group, relative to observing African Americans not interacting with the majority out-group. The study’s findings, however, do not support our expectation. All forms of contact improved attitudes about African Americans, even when the stimulus materials featured Native Americans. Results are discussed in terms of the cognitive liberalization potential of contact. © Copyright © 2020 (Chanjung Kim and Jake Harwood)

AB  - Drawing from intergroup contact theory and social identity theory, this study explored the indirect effects of out-group partisan media exposure (Fox News for Democrats; MSNBC and CNN for Republicans), and out-group interpersonal political discussions with members of the opposing political party on intergroup bias and intergroup competition through party identity as a mediator. We also accounted for the effects of in-group partisan media exposure (Fox News for Republicans; MSNBC and CNN for Democrats) and interpersonal political discussion with members of one’s own party. The results suggested that interpersonal political discussion with “the other side” (out-group interpersonal discussion) and exposure to in-group media increased prejudicial attitudes and competitive intergroup behaviors, not only directly but also through enhanced party identity.

AB  - Training programs for the awareness of autism for professions are supported under the leadership of the United Nations. Misinformation can cause socially destructive results as that which is incorrect is assumed to be known correctly. This study included a total of 308 participants comprising 226 (73.4%) preschool teachers and 82 (26.6%) school counselors. The basic questions related to the awareness and knowledge of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were selected based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2). It was attempted to categorize the questions into four fields: (1) social interaction, (2) social communication and speech, (3) limited interest pattern with stereotypical and ritualistic behaviors, and (4) comorbidities, etiological characteristics, and the relationship between vaccinations and autism. The results of the study indicate that the awareness of ASD, including core symptoms, was extremely lacking in preschool teachers and school counselors. Moreover, they had extreme prejudice to information known to be incorrect. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - This analysis focuses on the ways in which the interwar Yugoslav women’s movement contributed to national and international political processes of that time, and it divides into two parts. The first deals with the national efforts of the Yugoslav women’s umbrella alliance and its endorsement of the concepts of Yugoslavia and a Yugoslav nation. The second analyses the international activities of Yugoslav women’s organisations on a global and regional level. It investigates the ways that women’s co-operation was used to promote peaceful solutions to regional and international conflicts. However, the national and international women’s movement was a social product of its time. Although promoting pacifism and transnational concepts, in many ways it also faced, mirrored, and sometimes perpetuated contemporary social and national conflicts and prejudices. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study employs data from the NORC General Social Surveys to assess the extent, if any, to which the effects of both religious affiliation and personal religiosity on opposition to same-sex marriage are attenuated once effects for prejudice against same-sex relations (hate the sin) and prejudice against sexual minorities (hate the sinner) are controlled. Our results show that an initially robust set of affiliation and religiosity effects are substantially reduced once the effect of prejudice against same-sex relations is controlled but remains relatively unchanged when a control for prejudice against sexual minorities is introduced. The implications of these findings and potential explanations for the persistent religious effect on opposition to same-sex marriage are also discussed. © 2020 North Central Sociological Association.

AB  - There are worrying signs of rising intolerance towards Muslim immigrants in the majority of European societies. We use data from the 2014/2015 wave of European Social Survey to analyse negative attitudes toward Muslim immigrants in France, Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic. Results of the analyses reveal that both levels and determinants of the anti-Muslim attitudes vary greatly. The levels are highest in Czech Republic and Poland, the two countries that have a very low Muslim population. Nevertheless, contact with immigrants reduces hostility toward Muslims also in these two countries. We find that theoretical approaches commonly used in studies of anti-immigrant attitudes are better suited to explain negative attitudes in Western European than in Eastern European countries. We argue that future research on hostility toward immigrants in Europe should focus more on Eastern European countries, as attitudes toward immigrants in several of these are worryingly negative. © 2021

AB  - Background: We examined the effects of mass media usage on people's level of knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear of infection, prejudice towards infected people, and anxiety level. In addition, we investigated whether knowledge about COVID-19 can reduce fear, prejudice, and anxiety. Methods: We performed an anonymous online survey in 1,500 residents aged 19–65 years between April 24 and May 5 of 2020. Anxiety level was assessed using the generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale. We used a questionnaire to investigate COVID-19-related media use, knowledge about COVID-19, fear of infection, and prejudice towards infected people. We analyzed the relationships among the variables using the structural equation model. Results: Media use had significant effects on fear of infection, prejudice against infected people, and anxiety. Knowledge about COVID-19 had a significant protective effect on fear of infection, prejudice against infected people, and anxiety. However, the effect of media use on knowledge about COVID-19 was not statistically significant. There was a partial mediating effect of prejudice against infected people and fear of infection on media usage and anxiety. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated significant effects of mass media coverage regarding COVID-19 on fear, prejudice, and anxiety. While knowledge about COVID-19 could decrease fear, prejudice, and anxiety, the use of mass media did not enhance this knowledge. Medical societies should guide mass media reporting of COVID-19 and provide appropriate public education. © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Scholars have addressed how the socially marginalized, individuals with fringe viewpoints, or the politically marginalized in authoritarian regimes use social media to organize or connect in secret. Yet intensifying partisan polarization and prejudice in the United States has made it necessary to study how mainstream partisans in liberal democracies use social media to organize in secret. This study explores why mainstream partisans in the United States—average Republicans or Democrats—organize in secret online and analyzes the unique functions of social media for political organizing amid contextual marginalization. Through interviews with group leaders and a digital ethnography of a secret Facebook group in the United States, I find that mainstream partisans use social media to form secret political groups when they are the minority in their local community and that the online secret group serves several unique functions for members. First, the group operates as a community of solidarity for those reticent to disclose their political beliefs and as a community of contention to criticize and revitalize the minority Party in their region. The group also operates as a community of practice, allowing members to learn and rehearse communication among like-minded others. These findings hold implications for how scholars study communication in a digital and polarized era and how practitioners gauge public opinion. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This article explores the challenges facing British Muslim women in the UK today in the face of increased racism. Taking Fanon as an initial inspiration, we ask: how can British Muslim women reconcile a British and Muslim identity when government strategy and widespread prejudice make these two identities irreconcilable? The study uses social dreaming as a method to provide opportunities for uncovering hidden and unconscious emotions and thoughts among the participants. We provide a contextual background followed by an analysis of the dreams and associations provided by the group. We conclude that the difficulties in identity for the women are accompanied by profound emotions of fear, mourning and desperation, as well as gender insecurities in relationships with men. Finally, we suggest that policymakers and community leaders should focus on issues around belonging, acceptance, safety and agency for British Muslim women in order to encourage stronger and fairer integrated communities. © Policy Press 2020

AB  - Background: The number of new HIV infections has increased and implementation of school-based health education programs on AIDS have been advocated for a long time. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of an intervention of HIV/AIDS on the knowledge of HIV/ AIDS prevention and control among first year university students. Methods: An awareness questionnaire was adopted to assess awareness and knowledge of HIV/AIDS pre-and post-health education among first year university students in Qinghai, China. Independent sample t-test, chi-square test, and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. Results: A total of 2,165 and 2,062 first year university students were respectively recruited pre-and post-HIV/AIDS health education. The awareness rate increased significantly after the health education intervention (from 48.59%, 95%CI: 46.47%-50.72% to 76.24%, 95%CI: 74.35%-78.06%). Students from Hui and Tibetan ethnicities, and those holding prejudices against AIDS patients were less knowledgeable than their counterparts regarding HIV/AIDS related knowledge, whereas urban-dwellers and those with higher paternal education were positively associated with awareness of HIV/AIDS related knowledge (p <0.05). Conclusion: HIV/AIDS awareness among first year university students improved greatly after receiving an education intervention, which underscores its utility as part of the approaches of HIV/AIDS control and prevention. © 2020 Liu Y et al.

AB  - Introduction â Approximately 10 million people in Brazil have some hearing impairment. Because of the natural progression of hearing impairment to presbycusis, coupled with the increasing number of young people exposed to the risk factors for early hearing loss, the social impact of hearing impairment is high. Objective â A team of otolaryngologists and speech therapists conducted an unprecedented worldwide campaign in the primary health sector, aiming to reduce the global burden of hearing impairment with preventive measures. Methods â A cultural information campaign called Ear Parade was developed. It lasted 3 months, during which Saõ Paulo received information on the prevention of deafness and the importance of hearing rehabilitation to reduce prejudice against the use of hearing AIDS. Results â The information was relayed through an art exhibition of public paintings, including 62 sculptures of ears, 2.40 meters high, which colored the city, elucidating the beauty of hearing. The media coverage impacted 170 million people, and at the end of the campaign, a nongovernmental organization was established to raise resources for hearing rehabilitation. In addition, an auction of the ear sculptures raised money toward hearing aid batteries and stem-cell research for hearing. Conclusion â The present paper presents the effects of this campaign. Information dissemination is a powerful preventive measure for the primary healthcare system to reduce future treatment expenditures. © 2020 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the thought-provoking papers that constitute ‘Stranger Races: Reflections on Alterity in Constructions of the Self’, the authors make clear that our always already social confrontation with alterity is complex, multifaceted and context sensitive. They also make clear that thinking about alterity is a central, if not the central, element of anthropological study, an endeavour that sheds light on such socially destructive forces as primitivism, essentialism, racism, and ethnic and religious discrimination. In the essays, the authors also stress, albeit indirectly, that the dynamic linkages between self and other cannot be reduced a set of rules or an abstract formula. Indeed, the tangled nature of processes that play out in the construction of identity cry out for ethnographic elaboration. For me, the most important contribution that the authors make devolves from their exploration of the turbulent conceptual space between self and other. It is the space between self and other that is important to explore. As the essays in this special issue demonstrate, in the creative space between self and other, we are able to extend anthropological practice to the public domain in order to showcase alternatives to xenophobia and prejudice and to advocate for social practices that celebrate mutual respect. That is a path that leads to a powerfully productive anthropological future. © 2020 The University of Western Australia.

AB  - Fans are singular productive consumers. One of their typical practices is the production of fanvideos. An increasingly common trend in fanvideos is the creation of memes, a phenomenon of the modern internet related to ironic humor. This study aimed to analyze how fans, based on media texts, related to successful popular culture franchises. For this purpose, we performed an interpretive content analysis of fanvideos based on popular culture franchises posted on YouTube. Results demonstrate that meme fanvideos are made for play with and through the franchises, play dirty tricks, and criticize the politics. It happens by a variety of types of performances and techniques that dialogue both with the fictional universes and with different spheres of social life, often revealing an attitude of social criticism. Nevertheless, this interface makes room for a reproduction of prejudiced practices that target stigmatized identities. This process illustrates the intensive use of information and communication technologies and the ubiquity of the media, as well as the political tensions increasingly present in ordinary social life. These outcomes show how productive consumer behavior collapses with other social spheres when the meaning of products and brands is appropriated and re-signified through skilled creative consumer practices. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - This article analyzes the factors that may increase the vulnerability to HIV/AIDS of Colombian immigrants residing in Spain. We performed a qualitative research with hermeneutical approach to analyze the reality of social reception of in Spain using in-depth interviews. Results showed that, of the 34 Colombian migrants interviewed, who lived in the cities of Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, 85.3% self-reported as homosexuals and 14.3% as bisexuals; their average age was of 27.6 years old and the average time living in Spain was 4.8 years. We found that these immigrants had enough knowledge about HIV/AIDS but believed in several preconceptions and fictions connected to the dominant machismo and sexism from their home country. We concluded that the sociocultural sexual prejudice they had developed in their home country, as well as cultural obstacles and ignorance of the social norms from the host society may be common factors to increase the migrants’ vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. © 2020, UNIV SAOPAULO.

AB  - Social distance is operationalized as the willingness of respondents of the general population to engage in direct, immediate, reciprocal social interactions with persons of another group and to achieve a degree of closeness through these interactions. The aim of this study was to examine the willingness of students with typical development to accept a certain type of social relations with peers with disabilities in inclusive education, as well as the association of gender and age differences in social distance with the type of disability. A modified Bogardus social distance scale was used for research purposes. The sample consisted of students with typical development sand their peers with disabilities (N-398), aged from 7 to 15 years of age who attend inclusive primary schools on the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The results of the study showed that students with typical development do not generally reject social contacts with their peers with disabilities, as shown by the overall lower social distance, but social distance grew in areas of emotional and physical closeness. Students expressed the highest social distance toward peers with autism, while the lowest social distance was manifested towards peers with sensory impairments. Gender and age differences were confirmed. The girls expressed lower social distance, as did the students of higher school age (from 11 to 15 years of age). © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Survey research finds that millennials have less prejudiced views of racial/ethnic minorities than other generations, leading some to label millennials as postracial. However, attitudinal survey research may be subject to social desirability bias because it documents statements or beliefs instead of actions. Moreover, most audit studies focus on people who make hiring decisions or own rental property and are therefore often older than millennials. This study uses a correspondence audit to investigate discrimination among millennials via “roommate wanted” advertisements. We sent over 4,000 emails and found a tiered pattern of discrimination against Asian (Indian and Chinese), Hispanic, and Black room-seekers. However, whether Asian and Hispanic room-seekers face significant discrimination varies based on whether they use predominantly White first names or traditional first names. Our findings shed light on the future of our racial system, expand our knowledge of discrimination beyond the traditional Black/White binary, and illustrate the persistence of anti-Blackness. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This paper analyzes a flow correction educational program, aimed at teenagers in the final years of elementary school developed by the State of Acre in partnership with the Roberto Marinho Foundation. From a qualitative approach, the research had based on the assumptions of Historical-Cultural Psychology. The empirical field was the Cruzeiro do Sul city in the Acre state and the data were produced through document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Seven professionals participated in the study: one coordinator, two advisors and three teachers. The program has a methodology, which is highly valued by the professionals involved, called “Telessala” that has developed from videos, printed materials and “Unidocente” teachers. The conception of education that underpins the project comprises the detached development of learning, disregarding the social constitution of the psyche. In this logic, learning and development have considered dependent on personal effort, contributing to the maintenance of prejudice against students with trajectories marked by the denial of the right to learning. ©

AB  - This article examines the Jewish and Catholic experience of acceptance, rejection and discrimination in late nineteenth-century Britain through the lens of the celebrations of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in the summer of 1897. Arguing that the Anglo-Jewish and English Catholic hierarchical discourses created at the time of the Jubilee reveal the continuing profound insecurities felt by the minority leaderships, the article will dissect the various ‘stories’ created around the events of the Jubilee, particularly in London. It will consider in turn how narratives were created stressing Victoria’s personal role of liberator; how a premium was placed by the hierarchies on the different demographic strands of the minority communities behaving in aropriate ‘English’ class roles; and how this narrative was complicated–first by Irish nationalism and migrant Jewish radicalism, and secondly by the prejudices of the wider British establishment. Ultimately it will contend that the events of the Jubilee revealed a continued exclusion of Jewish and Catholic groups from the British ruling class, and that anti-Catholic sectarianism and antisemitism was not solely a matter of economic discrimination and physical violence against working-class communities, but also subtler forms of prejudice against more prosperous Jews and Catholics. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

RESULTS: in the risk factors category, four subcategories emerged: Family adversity factors; Social contagion; Adverse life events; Personal characteristics. Conflicts, lack of support, drug use in the family, meeting someone who cuts themselves, social networks, religiosity, history of sexual violence and bullying were identified as risk factors that influence self-injury. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: adolescents pointed out the need for prejudice-free dialogues in schools, in health and family devices, configuring protective factors to avoid this practice that comes from several negative events throughout life.

AB  - The Malaysian government’s move to introduce Jawi-Khat in the Malay-language curriculum in Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools has been fraught with tension and opposition, especially among the Chinese Malaysian community. Being the second-largest ethnic group in Malaysia, the Chinese’s negative response to the initiative has generated some implications for the country’s socio-political order. Sin Chew Daily, the first newspaper to break the news, was accused by then Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng of stirring fears among the Chinese community. Lim’s condemnation of the Chinese daily and the manner in which the whole Jawi-Khat episode played out have raised questions over the roles of Chinese newspapers vis-à-vis their counterparts of other languages in the reportage of the Jawi-Khat move. Thus, a study on the ways three top vernacular-language newspapers in Malaysia, namely, Sin Chew Daily, The Star and Harian Metro, covered this issue, was conducted. The extent of news coverage, news sources, news frames and valence of the reports were analysed. The research findings reveal that each of the newspapers framed the Jawi-Khat controversy differently. Sin Chew remains a classic ethnic newspaper, having reported extensively on the issue and actively pursued the voice of opposition of various stakeholder groups towards a policy that impacts on Chinese education, a key area vital to the Chinese community. Otherwise, the three newspapers have, to varying degrees, performed the interpretive function within a controlled media landscape and attempted to de-escalate conflicts and misunderstanding arising from the Jawi-Khat move. © 2020, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of different percentages of Muslim population and their interactions with non-Muslims on their religious views and intergroup attitudes. By analyzing three different datasets of Pew Research Center, with an aggregation of more than 39,000 Muslims' responses from 40 different countries, this paper offers a counter-argument against the use of the previously mentioned approach. This will be presented by analyzing these datasets from three different levels of analyses. Unlike the present social contact literature in which the primary focus is on the host/majority population's nature of interaction with minorities and its effects on the former's intergroup attitudes, this research focuses on minorities' contact with majority members and its impact on their religious and intergroup views. Consequently, our findings indicate a more meaningful and factual understanding of Muslim minorities' religious views and intergroup attitudes emerges when their social experiences are taken into consideration. © 2020 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to understand the psychosocial repercussions experienced by caregiving parents, resulting from care for the child with dysphagic cleft lip and palate. METHODS: qualitative study, developed in a tertiary hospital in September 2016. The sample defined by theoretical saturation consisted of seven mothers. Data collection was performed by unstructured interview, being audio-recorded and fully transcribed. Symbolic Interactionism was used as theoretical framework, and Thematic Content Analysis as methodological framework. RESULTS: the following themes emerged: diagnosisimpact and coping; coping with overload and stress; interaction between caregivers as an acceptance and coping strategy; impact on family and social life of caregivers; and curiosity coping, and family and community prejudice. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: despite the physical and emotional overload, the mother figure plays the main and determining role in care, reflecting the complexity of care.

AB  - Background Increasing numbers of children with perinatally acquired HIV (PaHIV) are transitioning into adult care. People living with behaviourally acquired HIV are known to be at more risk of psychosis than uninfected peers. Young adults living with PaHIV face numerous risk factors; biological: lifelong exposure to a neurotrophic virus, antiretroviral medication and immune dysfunction during brain development, and environmental; social deprivation, ethnicity-related discrimination, and migration-related issues. To date, there is little published data on the prevalence of psychotic illness in young people growing up with PaHIV. Methods We conducted a retrospective case note review of all individuals with PaHIV aged over 18 years registered for follow up at a dedicated clinic in the UK (n = 184). Results In total, 12/184 (6.5%), median age 23 years (interquartile range 21-26), had experienced at least one psychotic episode. The presentation and course of the psychotic episodes experienced by our cohort varied from short-lived symptoms to long term illness and nine (75%) appear to have developed a severe and enduring mental illness requiring long term care. Conclusion The prevalence of psychosis in our cohort was clearly above the lifetime prevalence of psychosis in UK individuals aged 16-34 years, which has been reported to be 0.5-1.0%. This highlights the importance of clinical vigilance regarding the mental health of young people growing up with PaHIV and the need to integrate direct access to mental health services within the HIV centres providing medical care.

AB  - Many critics focus on the prejudice of the slavery system and its negative impact on the American society after the Civil War in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, while at the same time overlook the moral corruption of the white community that oppressed and mistreated not only the blacks but also the powerless whites. The child Huck suffers from abuse and inhumane treatment at the hands of his violent father that makes him form an alliance with the runaway slave, Jim, and search for illumination and freedom on a raft down the Mississippi River. This implies that violence was an emblem of the whole nation that was not only practiced against blacks but also against the helpless children. The white community in the novel takes advantage of the insecure status of Huck and Jim, as a child and a runaway slave, respectively, that presents whites as frauds and murderers. © 2020 DSR Publishers/The University of Jordan.

AB  - Background: Since the earliest study about nursing faculty and student attitudes about caring for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in 1992, there have been less than 20 additional studies reported in the literature. Yet, PLHIV continues to report stigma and experience discrimination. Nursing faculty attitudes are part of the informal curriculum. Negativity about caring for PLHIV can adversely impact student perceptions as well as their care. Current research in this area is essentially non-existent. Objective: To describe the attitudes of the university nursing faculty toward caring for PLHIV; and to identify the relationship between faculty attitudes and explanatory factors such as age, education, religion, nationality, teaching in a clinical setting, years of experience, and university attributes. Methods: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study with nonrandomized electronic purposeful sampling. The Healthcare Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale (HPASS) is a 30-item scale with three subscales: Prejudice, stereotype, and discrimination. The English and Spanish versions of the HPASS exhibit stable psychometric properties for cross-cultural research. The HPASS was delivered to university nursing faculty in six countries across three continents. Results: A sample of 368 nursing faculty completed the HPASS. The mean composite score was 2.41 (SD = 0.69), six-point scale with lower scores indicating more positive attitudes, with subscale scores: Stereotypes 2.55 (SD = 0.84), discrimination 2.28 (SD = 0.74), and prejudices 2.41 (SD = 0.63). Peruvian faculty had the highest scores while Canadian had the lowest. Significant correlations were observed between attitudes and the three subscales, and between the three subscales and the composite score. Conclusion: Attitudes of the nursing faculty toward caring for PLHIV were slightly positive to slightly negative depending on the region and country. Knowledge deficiencies about HIV persist, incorrect beliefs are common, and attitudes appear to be influenced by culture. The correlation between subscales justifies continued research to implement targeted interventions. Education about HIV/AIDS can address knowledge deficits while structured interactions with PLHIV can facilitate experiential learning. © 2020 Leyva-Moral et al.

AB  - This study addresses Douglas Pratt's 2010 claim that New Zealand's non-Muslim majority experience “angst” in relation to a growing Muslim population. Based on interviews with non-Muslim New Zealanders we identified two key discourses. Firstly, participants constructed New Zealand as a safe haven and as tolerant and accepting of different religions and cultures. However, this tolerance and acceptance was conditional on Muslim assimilation and on participants’ sense of security and safety. Secondly, in constructing Muslims, gender-based oppression was created as problematic. Further, Muslims were constructed as not all terrorists, suggesting a default link between Islam and terrorism. Media was constructed as deliberately overplaying this link. Overall, angst about the increasing numbers of Muslims in New Zealand society was not identified. However, the core underlying stance was that, to be accepted, those with different social norms should assimilate and not threaten current cultural norms. Covert racism was highlighted in this study. © 2020 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.

AB  - South Africa, a country that was once colonized, had deliberate and hateful laws pre-democracy, which discriminated against, and segregated races with the intention to divide and conquer territories through marginalization. A case study emerges within this context, which exposes the racial prejudice that still persists, more than 20 years post-democracy. The article is important because it illustrates the historical injustices that exist based on gender imbalances between men and women. It makes a case for racial prejudice that racial inequalities foster resentment that ultimately prevents social cohesion. The article postulates averments such as, whether the description made in the return of service amounts to unfair discrimination on the basis of race, gender and infringement to dignity. This article critically analyses a South African court judgment in which the presiding Judge made several punitive orders against three deputy-sheriffs acting in their public capacity. It will be argued in the circumstances that this was a bold, brazen and a triumphant decision in addressing the colonial ills of the past in South Africa presenting a cure for the indifference and segregation on the basis of race. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: The leading causes of street involvement worldwide are poverty, family conflict, and abuse. A common misconception is that street involvement is due to delinquency, a belief leading to social exclusion and social inequality for children in street situations (CSS). Exploring community perceptions of CSS and the reproduction of social difference and inequalities can help reduce stigma and discrimination. Objective: To explore how stigma and discrimination of CSS was produced and reproduced in specific contexts of culture and power. Participants and setting: Social actors including CSS, healthcare providers, children's officers, and police officers in western Kenya. Methods: Using a sociological conceptualization of stigma, this qualitative study explored the stigmatization processes that take shape in specific contexts of culture and power. We conducted 41 in-depth interviews and 7 focus group discussions with a total of 100 participants. Results: CSS were often labeled “chokoraa” or garbage picker, a label linked to undesirable characteristics constituting “evils” in society and stereotyped beliefs that they were “delinquents,” reinforcing their “otherness” and devalued social status. CSS experienced individual and structural discrimination leading to exclusion from social and economic life. Conclusion: CSS were stigmatized when labeled, set apart, and linked to negative characteristics leading to their experience of status loss and discrimination. CSS's differentness and devalued status served to limit their access to societal resources and deemed them unworthy of equal rights. Interventions involving various social actors are needed to challenge negative stereotypes, reduce stigma, and uphold CSS's human rights. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Nominally fought over competing interests in Korea and Manchuria, the Russo-Japanese war had a significance that far outweighed its strategic reach. Central to its legacy was its outcome-the defeat of an old European Great Power by an aspiring non-European imperial state. This outcome inspired a great deal of racial and geostrategic introspection, whilst intensifying concerns in the West about 'Yellow Peril' that would one day overthrow European dominance. This article argues that the impact of the Russo-Japanese War on racial thinking in Japan was as significant as it was abroad, to the extent where the conflict was understood by key intellectuals as nothing short of a race war. These figures, including political philospher Katō Hiroyuki, historians Taguchi Ukichi and Asakawa Kan'ichi, and biologist Oka Asajirō, identified the outcome of the conflict as evidence that the established Eurocentric hierarchy of races was wrong. Japan's success, they argued, showed that the Japanese race (distinct, it should be noted, from other Asians) was at least on a par with their white rivals. Furthermore, some argued that it was in fact the Russians who should be excluded from the upper echelons of the racial hierarchy. Their work reveals the profound impact of the events of 1904-1905 on Japanese self-perception and confidence-and reveals the roots of racial attitudes that continue to bedevil the nation in the 21st century. © 2020, Japan Focus.

AB  - This article compares various collective actions carried out by ethnic Chinese residents against violence in their communities, and the negotiations these residents initiated with local authorities on this issue, in two suburbs of Paris, Aubervilliers and La Courneuve. Although French national policy toward immigrant minorities has been guided by the principle of "color-blindness,"some municipalities in the Paris region have gradually recognized the increasing diversity of their populations, and have incorporated the vocabulary of multiculturalism in their local governance. Consequently, the municipalities' different approaches to identifying and coping with violence against Chinese residents vary according to how they perceive the diversity of local residents, and according to inter-ethnic relations in those areas. We consider that the different degrees of recognition with regard to Chinese communities within the two municipalities have affected the consequences of the Chinese residents' collective actions, and their sense of inclusion in the cities where they live. Beyond the appearance of inter-ethnic conflicts, our comparative study demonstrates the intersectional cause of violence against the Chinese population - especially with regard to the disparities, both social and spatial, among Chinese residents themselves. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020.

AB  - Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21(a), criminal defendants can move to have their case transferred out of the local district if local prejudice is so high that impartial jurors cannot be found. Scholars and some courts have been quite fond of transfer for prejudice under Rule 21(a), especially in cases of extreme local prejudice. Courts have continued to grant transfer motions in these cases. And scholars have largely defended these grants of transfer, arguing that transfer is the best way to guarantee a fair trial when local prejudice is high. This Note challenges this traditional thinking and advocates for a counterintuitive way to guarantee the defendant a fair trial: Eliminate transfer for prejudice under Rule 21(a) altogether. To make this argument, this Note first argues that the Rule’s main benefit to defendants, as identified by courts and scholars, is that it allows defendants to move a trial to a less-prejudiced jury pool when local prejudice is high. But this benefit has been stripped away by social media. Social media has made it so transferable cases under the current doctrine will always have national coverage, thus making any transfer pointless at eliminating prejudice because all districts will be equally prejudiced. At the same time, social media has exacerbated some of the harms of the Rule by making a prejudicial transfer—a transfer that harms the defendant—likely. This harm, along with other harms outlined in this Note, shows how leaving the Rule in place actually threatens a defendant’s right to a fair trial, and therefore, elimination of the Rule will better protect a defendant’s right to a fair trial. © 2020, School of Law Publications.

AB  - Child psychotherapists regularly find themselves working across ‘cultural difference’, yet this reality is given little thought in trainings, be it in supervision, teaching, or in the training analysis. A growing body of literature in the psychotherapy professions emphasises the great anxiety provoked by ‘cultural difference’, and the ensuing defences that are ordinarily employed by individuals; this literature identifies an urgent need for psychotherapists to find more consistently thoughtful ways to engage with issues of race, culture and social class differences. Using Bourdieu’s concept of ‘habitus’ to build a working definition of ‘cultural difference’ and a psychosocial methodology, I interviewed eight child psychotherapists to ask what fantasies about working with ‘cultural difference’ we might hold. Thematic analysis identified two fantasy structures: ‘Difference as Dangerous’, in which ‘cultural difference’ is variously associated with all kinds of badness, including sexual perversion, violence, child abuse, neglect and shame; and ‘the Profession in Peril’, in which it was felt that the child psychotherapy profession is threatened by ‘cultural differences’, both from without and from within. Using discourse analysis, two further fantasies were examined: ‘Neutrality’ in the therapist, in which the therapist is imagined to transcend ‘cultural difference’; and ‘The Location of Difference’, in which it is imagined that one person in a pairing contains all the ‘difference’ and its negative associations, while the other is felt to be ‘normal’. These four fantasies show how powerful projections are able to enter the consulting room. There is an urgent need for the child psychotherapy profession to give thought to ‘cultural difference’, in order to avoid reproducing prejudiced stances; this becomes imperative, as issues of ‘cultural difference’ become more politically explosive. © 2020 Association of Child Psychotherapists.

AB  - Despite increasingly liberal attitudes in the UK, people who identify as bisexual face unique challenges from both mainstream society and within the LGBTQ + community. Negative stereotypes persist surrounding bisexuality, such as people are confused or hiding their ‘true’ sexual orientation as a gay man or a lesbian. No research explores the experiences of bisexual people with an intellectual disability. However, LGBTQ + people with an intellectual disability are a minority and potentially face double discrimination. Eight bisexual people with intellectual disabilities took part in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences. Participants' narratives were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. The study highlighted that being bisexual was an essential part of their identity. They experienced the same challenges, such as biphobia, as bisexual people without an intellectual disability. Participants were fearful of disclosing their sexuality to family, friends or their support staff, but overall, this has been a positive experience by enabling individuals to be their authentic self. Participants’ sexuality could pose challenges within their intimate relationships if their partner was not also bisexual. The research highlights the importance of LGBTQ + support groups to people with intellectual disabilities as a safe space to explore their identity, build connections with peers and provide support to integrate within the LGBTQ + scene. There is a clear need for those supporting people with intellectual disabilities to have training surrounding bisexuality and the distinct issues that this group can face. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to describe attributes associated with the Quality of Life of Brazilian transgender children and adolescents according to their own perception. METHOD: descriptive study conducted with 32 participants between eight and 18 years old, who were either interviewed or participated in focus groups. The statements were transcribed, grouped with the aid of the Interface de R pour les Analyses Multidimensionnelles de Textes et de Questionnaires software, version 0.7 alpha 2 and described according to the definition of Quality of Life by the World Health Organization concerning to the mental, physical, and social dimensions. RESULTS: it was possible to identify the family nucleus as the main social support for transgender children and adolescents. However, the experience of prejudice and discrimination were negative attributes associated with Quality of Life. CONCLUSION: the statements indicate that lives of transgender children and adolescents are impacted by social, physical, and mental factors due to the stigma and discrimination experienced. It is expected to contribute to the formulation of public policies related to transgender children and adolescents and expand the discussion on the citizens' duties and rights in relation to transsexuality.

AB  - The Indra Congress is a global network of community artists, cultural practitioners and educators. An alternative mediator of arts and culture for intra- and inter-personal social change, it provides a safe space for youth to communicate social issues. The network actively participates in a biannual programme where representatives of the different Indra hubs come together in a face-to-face congress. The art-based approach challenges stereotypes, prejudices, inequalities and descriptive myths in order to build bridges, to promote empathy and to help develop positive relationships. In this article a reflection on Indra practise and the use of arts for social change is related to critical questions and the on-going discussions about cultural literacy. The analysis relates to the analogy upon which the Indra Congress draws its practice namely that of the description of the god Indra’s net and intersecting points. It starts with an experiential analysis of the Pathways, Indra Congress event and its host, ARROWSA. The article further analyses how themes of diversity and local and personal narratives intersect with critical cultural diversity. As such, it promotes that the Congress embodies a practice of cultural literacies, that promotes the sharing of differences and commonalities through collaboration in the arts and culture. © 2020 Critical Arts.

AB  - O relato de história de vida não é, como muitos pensam, uma metodologia de fácil aplicação, pelo menos em se levando em consideração o pensamento de Walter Benjamin, para quem a história não é simples relato de fatos, mas um encadeamento de experiências que nem sempre podem ser expressas sem correr riscos que, em grande medida, prejudicam ou violentam a consciência do indivíduo que faz do relato um meio para encontrar “redenção” (Erlösung) de experiências do passado marcadas de sofrimentos. Acrescente-se a isso o fato de que, segundo o autor, com a modernidade, perdeu-se a capacidade tanto de contar quanto de ouvir experiências de vida. O texto trabalha essas questões, além de buscar contribuir com os estudos sobre identidade, na perspectiva da psicologia social crítica, que utiliza o método de relato de história de vida. © 2020

AB  - Based on young peasant narratives, this article analyses the sexual division of labour in rural areas, focusing on tensions produced by generational differences. Data obtained from four stages of pedagogical workshops (2015-2016), using the life history methodology with 150 young people from two schools based in agrarian reform settlements in Paraná, show the impacts of gendered labour on the process of peasant youth socialization. The study provides evidence of generational conflicts in a shifting context, as well as the pedagogical and cultural impact stemming from access to systematic knowledge and debates on the theme, especially, the revision of prejudices and the shift of discourses, practices and attitudes towards gender equality, notably, through the agency of young peasant women. © 2020

AB  - The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) plan of action called for the equal participation of women and men in all areas of family and household responsibility, including family planning, child-rearing, and household chores. This plan of action admonished government to promote and facilitate such participation. The emerging trend to include fathers in maternal and child health services motivated low- to middle-income countries including Jamaica to sign on to global initiatives such as the ICPD and the Sustainability Development Goals for maternal and paternal involvement in the reduction of maternal mortality rates. However, lack of proper infrastructure in the public health system in countries like Jamaica does not sufficiently accommodate fathers during antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal services, neither does it has far reaching programs targeting fathers. This oversight in maternity care is partially due to the lack of guidelines to lead the process, limited space at clinics, and inadequate privacy on some delivery suites. Addressing the gaps to involve more fathers in pregnancy and child-rearing is an unexplored opportunity or innovative strategy that could assist Jamaica in meeting its international obligations to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates. This could also lessen the burden of childbearing and child-rearing on women, while changing the narrative of the negative stereotypes of fatherhood to a positive one in Jamaica. Research has also shown that several undesirable situations are preventable if the pregnant woman gets social and psychological backing, not only from excellent maternal and child health care but also by a social system, particularly from the spouse of the pregnant woman (World Health Organization, 2007). © Copyright 2020 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the birth experiences of obese women in regard to their encounter with birth attendants. Methods: Qualitative, in-depth interviews with 10 women were conducted in February 2020. Data were analysed using a descriptive phenomenological method. Results: Four interrelated constituents were identified: The preconception and prejudice of being unhealthy and less able; Being unique among all the other unique women; “Talk to me, not at me”—the importance of information and communication, and; Feeling secure enough to be in the 'birthing bubble'. Conclusion: For the women in our study, being obese meant experiencing challenges as well as opportunities during childbirth and in their encounter with birth attendants. Experiences of preconceptions, alienation, a focus on risk and a loss of autonomy in encounters with birth attendants were found to negatively impact the birthing process. The women desired affirmative and inclusive encounters; these kinds of encounters may improve the birth experiences of obese women. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The architect Burnham Kelly hired social scientist Leon Festinger to analyze friendship among residents living in veteran housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946. Festinger accomplished this by linking friendship to mundane social events—such as neighbors chatting in common courtyards—and he attributed these events to the subtle but meaningful ways that architecture organized people in space. In studying social relations between neighbors, Festinger wondered if class or racial attitudes played a role in whether or not tenants became friends. Festinger framed his housing study in apolitical terms, but his research provided a methodological framework for later analyses of desegregated public housing that had major political consequences. These studies of racially integrated housing found their way into the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, where they provided evidence for the plaintiff’s claim that desegregation could be accomplished peacefully. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Perturbed by a racially motivated homicide in his homeland and a more recent murder (under investigation at the time of writing) in the United States, the author makes a strong case in favour of Social Justice Educational Leadership. The exploratory investigation examined the following questions: (1) What leadership processes are school leaders adopting to ensure equity and social justice in multicultural schools? (2) What strategies are school leaders providing their staff to continue supporting quality education for all students, irrespective of cultural background? The research sought to extend the debate between educational leadership processes and the ongoing quest towards social justice as embodied in schools in Malta. A qualitative approach emanating from literature review on critical multicultural education was used in the study. Three school leaders known for their stance on issues of race, prejudice, discrimination, oppression, and marginalisation offer their valuable insights on leadership practices inundated with successful processes leading towards more socially just schools. Findings advocate for a wider discussion on the possibilities for effectively addressing the challenges of leading and managing the multicultural school, based on justice and equity principles. © 2020 British Educational Leadership, Management & Administration Society (BELMAS).

AB  - This study primarily aims to identify the factors that helped emo kids in 2010 move through the emo-identity discrimination and be able to obtain a certain level of achievement. Facebook is the social network that allows users to track friends' posts back over 10 years. Content analysis was conducted by using two coders to rate 1,432 Facebook posts published during 2010 until 2019, based on the variables: (1) emo-related content, (2) emotion expression, (3) being a part of fandom, (4) the group of fandom, (5) friend(s) and (6) family appearance. The results from logistic regression analysis reveal that past emo kids' Facebook posts are increasing in the contents about friends, family, and fan objects over time. However, the number of posts with emo music or emo fan object was reduced. Having social support and belonging to social group, like fandom, might help past emo kids overcome the hard time that they had got prejudiced. Future studies should develop a model or existing theory to explain the complexity of individuals' overlapping identities blended in social networking profiles. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

AB  - In Job 30:1-8, Job dehumanises his detractors: he depicts his low-class opponents as vile creatures in the wilderness. Dehumanisation has been a common strategy to devalue outgroups from Job's time to our own. It functions by assuming a human-animal hierarchy (in which animals lack value), and mapping it onto a social hierarchy, delegitimising the animalised individuals at the bottom. By using this strategy, Job reveals his prejudice around other species and low classes. The logic of the divine speeches, however, overturns both these prejudices. The speeches respond to Job's classism, not by denying that low-class humans are animals, but rather by celebrating animals (38:39-39:30). For Job, the non-human was a source of derision; for God it is a source of delight. © 2020

AB  - This study, aiming to reveal the experiences of prospective social studies teachers on project-based values education, was carried out in phenomenological design, which is one of the qualitative research designs. The study group consisted of 37 second-year students who received values education as an elective course in the social studies teaching department of a public university and who carried out projects for the values that they determined within the scope of the course. To create a project, the prospective teachers chose values such as equality, responsibility, sensitivity (cultural heritage), helpfulness, attaching importance to being healthy, patriotism, and savings. They implemented their projects on these values to the groups that they found appropriate. At the end of the process, a semi-structured interview form was used as data collection tool to reveal the participants’ experiences of project-based values teaching. Descriptive analysis and content analysis were used to analyze the study data. As a result of the study, we concluded that the participants selected the values for their projects for reasons such as “raising awareness on the related values, embodying abstract values, eliminating prejudices, emphasizing the importance of cooperation in society”. Project-based values education was observed to provide the participants with many advantages such as “provision of experience both for values education and the teaching profession, project planning and conduction, improving communication skills, developing a sense of spirituality.” © 2020

AB  - A topic in contemporary political philosophy that has received substantial attention recently is whether minorities have the right to mistreat nonhuman animals. Mostly the debate is focused on minority practices in the West, such as Muslim religious slaughtering. However, other minority contexts, especially Iberian ones, have been largely ignored. In this article, I place the Portuguese case study at the center of political philosophy debates and assess whether this cultural practice ought to be banned. I do this by looking at four arguments routinely used in these debates. These arguments are that Portuguese bullfighting ought to be allowed because it has an economic role in the community, it helps address social prejudice, it promotes friendship and, and allowing it is a way to be legally consistent. I reject the four arguments and defend that bullfighting, in the Portuguese case, should be banned. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020

AB  - The aim of the paper is to assess the effects of an intervention program derived from the contact theory of intergroup attitudes toward the Roma minority. A sample of 150 high school students from two midsized towns were randomly assigned to a control group and an experimental group. Participants in the experimental group attended six sessions of a Junior Project Manager program run by a local organization, which included project management lessons, a lesson on the discriminated minority and positive, cooperative direct contact with the Roma minority in work settings. Participant attitudes were measured prior to and after the intervention program. The intervention program had a positive impact on intergroup attitudes, intergroup trust, approach/avoid tendencies and intended future cooperation. The results indicate that this was the first successful attempt to change intergroup attitudes using direct contact in a Slovak context. © 2020 Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Systemic racism is a public health crisis. Systemic racism and racial/ethnic injustice produce racial/ethnic disparities in health care and health. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities in stroke care and health exist and result predominantly from unequal treatment. This special report aims to summarize selected interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in stroke prevention and treatment. It reviews the social determinants of health and the determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in care. It provides a focused summary of selected interventions aimed at reducing stroke risk factors, increasing awareness of stroke symptoms, and improving access to care for stroke because these interventions hold the promise of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in stroke death rates. It also discusses knowledge gaps and future directions. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - Centring on the imaginary, this article examines the multi-layered interactions between music, collective consciousness and social actions in mainland China. I note that behind the prejudice against ‘floating’ migrants and a collective ignorance of their suffering lies the Chinese imaginary, or a set of common-sense understandings and expectations based on normative and emotionally appealing images. I argue that the power of Chinese propaganda music can be understood as deriving from its ability to supply and conjure up such images, which serve the state’s evolving strategic needs and promote the three fundamental beliefs by (re)interpreting past or fictional actions and their outcomes. Naturally growing within certain ‘moulds’, Chinese musicians do not challenge these images in public performances, but some of them are positioned as musical rebels to maintain the illusion of autonomy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Heterosexism, in the form of microaggressions, contributes to hostile, anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) college campus climates, thereby limiting sexual and gender minority students’ social engagement and academic persistence. Using Tinto’s model of institutional departure, we examined the degree to which experiencing microaggressions affects sexual minority college students’ retention as a function of their feelings of discomfort in the classroom. Mediation analyses were performed on a subsample of data from 152 self-identified LGBTQ college students at a southern university in the United States to examine relations among experiences of self-reported microaggressions, self-rated classroom discomfort, and expressed intentions to transfer from the university. Self-reported discomfort in the classroom accounts for the relation between experiences of microaggressions and LGBTQ students’ intentions to transfer from the university. Specifically, LGBTQ students who experienced microaggressions more often reported greater discomfort in their classrooms and reported fewer intentions to continue studying at their university. Universities should strive to implement campus-wide programs that help minimize microaggressions, encourage cultural competency and comfort in the classroom, and combat anti-LGBTQ prejudice to better support students in their day-to-day academic endeavors. LGBTQ students who feel safe and supported in the classroom may be protected from heterosexism and social isolation and, thereby, may be more likely to persevere in their academic pursuits. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This report examines the relationship between pediatric anxiety disorders and implicit bias evoked by threats. To do so, the report uses two tasks that assess implicit bias to negative-valence faces, the first by eye-gaze and the second by measuring body-movement parameters. The report contrasts task performance in 51 treatment-seeking, medication-free pediatric patients with anxiety disorders and 36 healthy peers. Among these youth, 53 completed an eye-gaze task, 74 completed a body-movement task, and 40 completed both tasks. On the eye-gaze task, patients displayed longer gaze duration on negative relative to non-negative valence faces than healthy peers, F(1, 174) = 8.27, p =.005. In contrast, on the body-movement task, patients displayed a greater tendency to behaviorally avoid negative-valence faces than healthy peers, F(1, 72) = 4.68, p =.033. Finally, implicit bias measures on the two tasks were correlated, r(38) =.31, p =.049. In sum, we found an association between pediatric anxiety disorders and implicit threat bias on two tasks, one measuring eye-gaze and the other measuring whole-body movements. Converging evidence for implicit threat bias encourages future research using multiple tasks in anxiety. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Hostility toward same-sex parenting is widespread. Literature supports one persistent argument against same-sex parenting which focusses on the concern for children’s wellbeing, whereas lesbian and gay parents’ ability is sometimes evaluated positively. In particular, the belief that children need both a father and a mother impacts the evaluation that same-sex parents are unfit to raise well-adjusted children. The present research aimed to investigate linking mechanisms and conditional processes underlying the evaluation of same-sex parents’ ability. Cisgender heterosexual Italian participants (N = 320) read one of four vignettes describing a family situation–two types of same-sex (step)parents (i.e., lesbian and gay (step)parents) vs. two types of different-sex (step)parents (i.e., heterosexual (step)parents)–in which a child misbehaved in the context of a mild family disagreement. After reading the vignette, the participants rated parenting ability and to what extent the child’s misbehavior was attributable to the parenting relationship. Moderated-mediation analyses indicated that same-sex (step)parents were perceived as being less capable parents compared to different-sex (step)parents by giving them greater responsibility for the child’s misbehavior, among participants with medium and high levels of gender role beliefs. Implications for research on sexual discrimination are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - “Why Not Eat Insects?” inquires a short book, really a pamphlet, first published in London in 1885. Working against the common perception of bugs as pests—at best, an absurdly obvious nonfood, and at worst, a toxin—the author, Vincent M. Holt (who provided no autobiographical details that might establish his credentials) aimed at reversing his readers’ general disdain for insects as low and troublesome forms of being, as well as the specificWestern objection to entomophagy. Cockchafers, caterpillars, and grubs, he asserted in his opening pages, were “clean, palatable, and wholesome” foods. Indeed, as eaters, these insects were more discerning “than ourselves.” It followed, therefore, that eating insects was not a form of pica (themental and physiological disorder of consuming nonfood items); rather, refusing to eat them was merely a provincial prejudice of Europeans, born of ignorance about the consumption of insects, a practice Holt assured his readers was common around the world.1 We pose a variant of Holt’s deceptively simple question by bringing to the fore the underlying provocation in his manifesto and critique: Why not study food? Why hasn’t food, or the knowledge and practices that surround its production, preparation, distribution, and ingestion, mattered much to historians of science, medicine, and technology? Arguably, the only universal historical constant of human existence (besides death and taxes) is the need to eat and drink. Yet, claims and practices surrounding food and beverages vary widely across time and space. The historicity of food embraces notmerely geographic, economic, and political pressures, but also a wide range of claims—theological, legal, medical, traditional—that shapewhat can, should, or will be consumed by any person or society. Food has long been an object of serious study across the humanities and social. © 2020 by The History of Science Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Team projects in engineering are critical sites for professional and personal development as students interact with peers and faculty on projects designed to simulate professional engineering work. These projects allow students to practice behaviors and roles to support their engineering identity development and sustained participation in STEM. However, such projects can also have negative impacts on students from underrepresented populations. Multiple studies of women’s experiences on such teams point to unequal gender dynamics and negative experiences. Few studies, however, have focused on racial dynamics. To fill this gap, the current study uses phenomenology to explore the experiences of African American males on multiracial student engineering teams. Eight African American male engineering students were interviewed three times over the course of a semester as they worked on team projects. Intergroup contact theory (ICT), a social science theoretical framework based on the contact hypothesis to reduce anxiety between distinct social groups via interaction under specific conditions, informed the study design. Overall, participants described positive team experiences that included personal interactions and significant awareness of the negative stereotypes about African Americans in engineering and society. The participants also described a lack of friendship opportunity and conflict associated with unmet expectations. Interestingly, participants described their proactive effort to dispel negative stereotypes. Emergent themes are discussed as well as implications for faculty’s approach to student teams or unconscious bias of teammates. © 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.

AB  - The suicidal behavior of women has been pointed out as an effect of the diffuse violence suffered by women in the public and private spheres. However, in order not to universalize their psychological suffering, it is necessary to consider other social demarcations that impact their mental health, such as sexuality. The purpose of this study was to analyze the life histories and personal experi-ences of women of different sexual orientations who manifested suicidal behav-ior, in order to ascertain the relation of self-extermination with gender dispositifs and sexuality. For this, nine cisgender women, three self-declared lesbians, three self-declared bisexuals, and three self-declared heterosexuals were interviewed. After analyzing the interviews, five categories were found: “Sickening Masculin-ity”, “Aesthetic Ideal” and “Romantic Relationships” were observed in the three sexual orientation groups; “Heterodissidence as Debauchery” was identified in lesbian and bisexual women groups; and the “Caring” category only came up among heterosexual women. In the end, such categories point to similarities and distinctions in the narratives of each sexual orientation group and the impact of gender-based violence, arising out of social misogyny. © 2020, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - In recent years, banters on worldwide health have given expanding consideration to the significance of healthcare system, which incorporate the establishments, associations, and assets (physical, budgetary, and human) collected to convey social insurance benefits that address population issue. Underdeveloped countries have numerous difficulties in the development of Emergency medical services. Progress has been made in low-developed countries with the usage of the Basic Package of Health Service (BPHS) by the Ministry of Public Health to give social insurance that would have the most financially savvy sway on normal medical issues. The greater part of the crisis care conveyed in low-developed countries is given by military area and non-administrative associations. The drawn-out objective of value medicinal services for every single underdeveloped countries may be met by a blend of explicit objective arranged tasks, outside guide, residential obligation, and time. However, modern updates on the internet of things IoT, cloud computing mobile, and web development technology are offering a wider scope in providing an effective health care system. The infrastructure needed to detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) that complies completely with WHO guidelines is lacking across many parts of the globe, especially in under developing countries. We outline the health equity, smart health care, the process of a healthcare system evaluation to overcome challenges and problems faced for testing covid-19 in such countries during this pandemic situation. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

AB  - Background:People with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience high unemployment due to external (stigma, parental overprotection and low expectations) and internal (learned helplessness) barriers. Although Lebanon was a pioneer among Arab countries in its legislative and social activism toward inclusion of disabled people, stigma persists and a benevolence model of disability still prevails.Aims:This article aims at identifying the needs of people with ID, and proposing directions for future work toward their inclusion in the Lebanese workplace, based on identified needs.Methodology:A literature search for articles on ID in Lebanon and national and regional reports on employment of people with ID over the past two decades was performed, excluding all documentation using unclear definitions of ID or focusing on mental illness.Findings:Analysis of the literature highlighted the need for more familiarity and contact with, for more visibility of, and more market-competent training for people with ID in Lebanon.Conclusions and implications:Prejudice and faulty conceptions of ID can be reduced by increasing visibility of people with ID through increased everyday life contact opportunities. Change is urged at the level of organisational sheltered training to provide a more market-competent training for ensuring proper job placement of people with ID in mainstream labour. © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - This study aimed to identify elementary school teachers’ perceptions of their writing experiences and examine the factors forming their writership identities by analyzing their perceptions. This study is a phenomenological study conducted with six elementary school teachers. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview form. The data were analyzed based on Gee’s (2010) theory of discourse. The results showed that the teachers described writing as an essential skill used for transferring emotions and thoughts. They stated that language skills were interrelated and that there was a need to have a certain set of skills to be able to write. The development of technology had reduced the need for classical writing, and social prejudices had reduced the teachers’ willingness to write. The teachers consider themselves neither very successful nor very unsuccessful writers but a medium level in general. They were happy when writing, even though they did not like expressing their feelings. They thought that writing successfully had a profound effect on academic achievement and that the largest share in educating individuals to be good writers was in teachers' hands. © 2020 Published by KURA Education & Publishing.

AB  - The purpose of this life history (i.e., counter-life herstory) study was to illuminate Black women faculty pathways in U.S. P-20 computing education. Counter-life herstories come from counterstories, life histories, and herstories, which are powerful social justice tools that uncover hidden truths about marginalized groups’ experiences. This study provides a suitable methodological approach to investi-gate various educational pathways. As an emerging Black woman scholar, with a bachelor’s degree in computer science, I have a “unique angle of vision” to situate Black women’s unique lived experiences in U.S. computing education’s social-political context. I used an integrative conceptual framework, with an overarching Afrocentric feminist epistemology, which was anchored by critical race theory and Black feminist thought. Furthermore, I analyzed data elements such as timelines, counter-life story interviews, and reflective journal writings. I co-constructed and interpreted the counter-life herstories of five Black women faculty in computing. Black women faculty who persist in obtaining PhD degrees in U.S. computing education do so by their resiliency and ability to bounce back from insurmountable barriers (e.g., negative stereotypes and biases) than their new positive reinforcements or intense academic preparation. This study builds upon limited knowledge about Black women faculty’s educational experiences before joining academia while directly supporting the U.S. national interest to diversify the computing workforce. © 2020 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has brought increased incidents of racism, discrimination, and violence against "Asians,"particularly in the United States, with reports of hate crimes of over 100 per day. Since January 2020, many Asian Americans have reported suffering racial slurs, wrongful workplace termination, being spat on, physical violence, extreme physical distancing, etc., as media and government officials increasingly stigmatize and blame Asians for the spread of Covid-19. The links with social media are increasingly evident, as anti-Asian sentiment increases, with reports of anti-Asian sentiment spreading and Asian-Americans fighting hate via social media. Using integrated threat theory, this study explores the links between prejudice/hate toward Asians-Americans, in particular Chinese, and social media use. Three key results emerged from the study. First, the more a social media user believes their most used daily social media is fair, accurate, presents the facts, and is concerned about the public (social media believe), the more likely that user is to believe Chinese pose a realistic and symbolic threat to America. Second, men and women significantly differed on each type of prejudice, with men scoring higher on intergroup anxiety and women higher on symbolic and realistic threat. Third, respondents who do not use social media on a daily basis are less likely than those who use Facebook to perceive Chinese as a symbolic threat. Implications and recommendations for practitioners, health workers and government are proposed. © Croucher, Nguyen and Rahmani.

AB  - This article examines the case of La Palmada en la Frente (1970), a one-issue political cartoon magazine, drawn and written by cartoonist Lugoze and produced in the context of a scare campaign against the possible election of the socialist Salvador Allende (1969-1970). This ephemeral document belonged to a larger group of publications that used humor and cartoons as ideological weapons. An extensive examination of this source allows a recast of the relationship between popular culture and politics in the Chilean experience of the global sixties. This essay argues that political cartoons work as a portal through which to understand behaviors, social problems, prejudices, fears, stereotypes, and myths that can enforce and challenge the study of Latin American popular culture and the sixties.Â © 2020 by the University of Texas Press.

AB  - Purpose: The increase in autism prevalence and presentation in the media suggests a rise in public awareness. This paper aims to explore what factors (contact, knowledge and ethnicity) may be associated to positive attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Design/methodology/approach: An online survey examined contact with and knowledge of ASD among Black, Asian and White ethnic groups to predict public attitudes to people with ASD. Findings: In multiple regression models, the results suggested that the level of contact predicts positive attitudes towards autism when demographic factors were accounted. The level of knowledge about autism were significantly associated to attitudes, but not consistently when demographic factors were accounted. However, differences in knowledge and attitudes to people with ASD were identified amongst Black, Asian and White ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications: These findings have implications for policy and public health and education campaigns, including ensuring contact and knowledge of autism among the public. Originality/value: These findings have implications for policy and public health and education campaigns, including ensuring contact and knowledge of autism among the public. Additionally, further effort is required to target public knowledge and attitudes to autism, particularly among ethnic groups. Institutional support tailored to encourage structured and unstructured contact across public domains such as education, health, social and care practices could effectively reduce prejudice between the public and people with ASD over time. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - People who are bisexual are more likely than their gay and lesbian peers to report experiencing prejudice in their daily lives. Although frequently used for research, existing measures of binegativity provide an incomplete assessment of binegative attitudes, often because they were created as extensions of measures of homonegativity and racism rather than as a distinct form of prejudice. We sought to fill this void by developing a scale to measure binegativity based on (a) existing scales measuring biphobia or binegativity, (b) the scholarly literature on biphobic and binegative interactions reported by bisexual people, and (c) responses to open-ended items about bisexuality and bisexual people. Parallel item sets were created to examine potential differences in how binegativity manifests when directed toward bisexual men and women. A usable sample of 435 heterosexual participants responded to 118 potential binegativity items, and a collection of existing measures of prejudice (e.g., racism) and individual difference measures (e.g., agreeableness, socially desirable responding) for validity purposes. A multiphase item reduction procedure and exploratory factor analyses yielded three highly correlated scales to assess binegativity. Validity was supported via a host of external measures. Known-groups validity was supported across levels of political ideology and with a second sample of bisexual participants (n = 60). Our analyses resulted in the Group-Based Attitudes toward Bisexuality (GBAB), Attitudes toward Bisexual Men (ABM), and Attitudes toward Bisexual Women (ABW) scales. These scales may help us better understand binegativity, which could lead to prejudice reduction efforts that improve the lived experiences of bisexual people. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Among a national sample of Dutch respondents (N = 1,155), this study examined whether the belief configuration of personal political orientation differs for individual level of education, and how it is related to negative attitudes toward immigrant-origin groups and refugee policies. In agreement with the ideological sophistication perspective, the endorsement of social conformity and the acceptance of group-based inequality were found to be more strongly part of the political orientation of higher compared to the lower educated participants. Furthermore, the endorsement of social conformity and acceptance of group-based inequality were associated with more negative feelings toward immigrants and more negative attitudes toward policies in relation to refugees. These findings add to the existing literature that has predominantly examined education and political orientation as two independent correlates of anti-immigrant and refugee attitudes. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

AB  - Background: Interprofessional collaboration between pharmacists and physicians in primary care has been linked to improved patient outcomes. How professionals position themselves and each other can shed light upon their relationship, and positioning theory can be used as a tool to better understand intergroup relations. Objectives: 1) To identify how community pharmacists position themselves, and how they are positioned by general practitioners. 2) To assess how well these positions correspond, how the positions align with a proactive position for the pharmacists, and discuss how the positions could potentially impact collaboration. Methods: In this qualitative study, data were collected through six focus group interviews held between June and October 2019, three with pharmacists and three with physicians. The focus group interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Systematic text condensation method. Positioning theory was used as a theoretical framework to identify the positions assigned to community pharmacists by the pharmacists themselves and by the physicians. Results: Twelve pharmacists and ten physicians participated. The pharmacists positioned themselves as the “last line of defense”, “bridge-builders”, “outsiders” – with responsibility, but with a lack of information and authority – and “practical problem solvers”. The physicians positioned pharmacists as “a useful checkpoint”, “non-clinicians” and “unknown”. Conclusions: The study revealed both commonalities and disagreements in how community pharmacists position themselves and are positioned by general practitioners. Few of the positions assigned to pharmacists by the physicians support an active role for the pharmacists, while the pharmacists´ positioning of themselves is more diverse. The physicians´ positioning of pharmacists as an unknown group represents a major challenge for collaboration. Increasing the two professions´ knowledge of each other may help produce new positions that are more coordinated, and thus more supportive towards collaboration. © Pharmacy Practice and the Authors.

AB  - Social adjustment, and feeling isolated, is one of the critical issues faced by the Hijra's from our society, due to sexual prejudices and stigmas. However, no one bothers how they actually feel, how they see themselves? The idea behind the paper is to identify the impact of looking-glass self (self-concept) on happiness, self-esteem, and satisfaction with life, among transgender from Hijra community, to accentuate the reality of how they feel, what is their self-concept, and its relationship with the mentioned constructs. The current study was conducted in India; snowball sampling is used to contact the respondents of the mentioned category, and variance-based structural equation modeling techniques on second-order construct, using two-stage approach, were used to study the relationships between the constructs used for the current study. The outcome of the study depicts that there is a presence of significant relationships between the mentioned variables, which show that the respondents are strongly maintaining their self-concept but that does not mean anyway that they are also happy and enjoying the social treatment given to them. This study is for the social workers, government as well as for the society, who pretends as a flag bearer of quality and promotes diversity in India. It will be an eye-opener for all those who really want to support such marginalized community as they have already achieved a place in the gender column under the gender category as other “Third Gender.” The current study is original and contributes in understanding the truth behind the real journey of the mentioned community. How they feel, what they expect is still untapped; this paper will raise voice for them to contribute in respectful living in Indian society. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This paper is an attempt to point out how John Updike's novel The Coup (1978) conforms to the traditional Western notions and conventions about Africa and Africans. The methodology of this paper involves a textual analysis of The Coup whereby significant passages from the novel are cited and elucidated with regard to the ideas of Orientalism as a discourse to reveal how Updike employs such a discourse to render a distorted image of Africa and African cultures as he draws heavily on stereotypes and traditional prejudices as embodiment of the darker side of the human psyche. At the same time, this paper is meant to point out the seemingly authoritative stance of Updike through the sources he consults and the techniques he utilizes to endow his negative discourse with a tone of authority, knowledge, and expertise. This seemingly authentic stance provides Updike with the means to adopt a superior, Western voice of power in the creation of truth with regard to Africa as a nation and to the East/West relationship as a dichotomy. As the novel relates, Updike not only justifies the American intervention in Africa, but he does injustice to the humanity of the African personality which he diminished through racist stereotyping. It is, therefore, through utilizing this Orientalist/postcolonial approach and relevant data that this paper concludes that Updike displays absolutely no insight into the characters involved in this novel. Instead, he weaves African colonialism, Islam, the Cold War, socialism, capitalism, and exploitation of every variety into a novel with a few too many characters that are explored just enough to make them into two-dimensional cartoons of real human beings. As such, Updike's The Coup is no more than an attempt to assert the authority of the West, specifically the United States, as a superpower that surpasses the Soviet Union in its control over Africa and African resources. © 2020 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - The study examined the ethnic identity and other-group orientation of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. The data were collected from 504 Chinese respondents (252 students, 252 parents) using Phinney’s (1992) Multiethnic Identity Measure. The results showed that the parents had a stronger ethnic identity than their children. For both groups, the mean scores for affirmation and belonging were the highest among the four ethnic identity components, and the ethnic identity achievement mean scores were the lowest. The results indicate that the Foochow Chinese respondents had a foreclosed identity, whereby they have made a commitment to their ethnicity without extensive exploration of the meaning of belonging to their ethnic group. Gender and socio-economic background have significant effects on strength of ethnic identity, but Chinese-medium education is not linked to ethnic identity. The findings suggest that the Chinese are moderating their ethnic identity, but their positive other-group orientation is far from the level of cultural adaptation that is required for assimilation. © 2020 IJSCL.

AB  - Combining two qualitative and a quantitative method, we explored whether school’s physical environment promotes multicultural values or reflects intergroup climate in two multiethnic communities in Croatia. Croatia offers unique context for this study because minority youth from two ethnic groups use their right on minority language education and hence attend separate minority schools. Results show that the representation of ethnic symbols in schools is a reflection of inter-ethnic relations in the specific intergroup context. Specifically, ethnic symbols are overrepresented in the post-conflict context compared to the more harmonious multi-ethnic community. In harmonious intergroup context, multiculturality is promoted by emphasizing common identity, and by giving space to symbols of both minority and majority group. However, in the conflicted intergroup setting we found overrepresentation of symbols emphasizing intergroup differences. Results of focus groups as well as of the quantitative survey confirm that schools physical environment reflects intergroup relations in each community. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Around one-sixth of the European population have a disability, yet there are few self-declared disabled politicians. Despite scholarly and political interest in the under-representation of various social groups, little attention has been paid to disabled people. This article identifies and analyses the barriers to elected office faced by disabled people by drawing upon interviews with 51 candidates and elected politicians in the United Kingdom. It reveals barriers which occur throughout the political recruitment process, from initial participation to selection and the election campaign. They broadly fall into: (a) a lack of accessibility, including the built environment and documents; (b) a lack of resources to make events and activities accessible; and (c) ableism, including openly expressed prejudices but also a lack of awareness and willingness to make processes inclusive. While people with different impairments encounter some distinct barriers, all of them have similar experiences of obstacles and exclusion which go beyond those faced by people from other under-represented groups seeking elected office. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - A significant number of native-born citizens hold anti-immigrant attitudes. Social science scholars often point to intergroup contact between native-born citizens and foreign-born residents as the solution to group threat fears regarding immigrants. Through social interaction, prejudice and stereotypes are expected to be replaced by empathy and positive attitudes. Studies indicate that immigrant friendship, greater frequency of contact in more social domains, and higher quality interactions, lead to pro-immigrant attitudes, while intergroup contact under poor social conditions may have null or negative effects. Methodological changes and an analytical focus on contact structure and interactional process will offer a better test of intergroup contact theory as it pertains to attitudes toward immigrants. © 2020 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - This study used an online survey of a sample of sexual minority Vietnamese women (N = 302, Mean = 21.23) who self-identified as lesbian (48.7%), bisexual (42.2%), and other (8.9%). The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship among self-disclosure, internalized homophobia, and symptoms of depression. This topic has never before been studied in Vietnam. Structural equation modeling indicates that a higher level of self-disclosure with friends and coworkers leads to less self-stigmatization and less sexual prejudice. In addition, sexual minority women’s self-disclosure affects all three aspects of depression (negative affect, positive affect, and interpersonal relationships). © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Some humor, while making us laugh, contains shadows of hostility toward those who cause strife – the racists, the bigots, the unaware and uneducated. Believe it or not, humor does have the ability to educate, to counter stereotypes and, if all else fails, to get even. Although humor can perpetuate and preserve stereotypes, it can also redress a wide variety of prejudices and preconceptions. Humor may not have been a powerful enough weapon to overthrow despotic regimes such as, for example, the US during slavery, Nazi Germany, or the former Soviet Union, but it did provide hope to the oppressed. This paper examines humor used by all kinds of oppressed people including African-Americans, Asians, women, Moslems, the disabled, and Jews. The authors conclude that society is better off if people get even with bullies and persecutors using humor rather than violence. Humor can educate the educable. Humor provides victims with psychological strength, and enables them to rise above despair and hopelessness. © 2020, Addleton Academic Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scene inconsistency is known to impair cognitive performance. We extended this line of inquiry to the field of intergroup relations, and examined the effect of scene inconsistency on prejudice. We conceptualized members of a subordinate ethnic group in their original sociocultural context as a consistent scene, and their appearance in a dominant ethnic group’s host sociocultural context as an inconsistent scene. Under the context of the intergroup dynamic between Han Chinese and Tibetan Chinese, four experiments were conducted to confirm that scene inconsistency increases prejudice, Specifically, when Tibetan Chinese were associated with the context of Han (versus Tibetan) Chinese, Han Chinese participants were less willing to interact with (Experiment 1), expressed greater social distance from (Experiment 2), and less willingness to hire Tibetan Chinese (Experiment 3). Furthermore, Experiment 4 provided a cognitive strategy to buffer the negative influence of scene inconsistency on intergroup relations, revealing the moderating role of comparative thinking. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Literature on collective violence usually treats an act of aggression as a unidimensional phenomenon—occurring or not. The social psychological perspective on intergroup relations shows, however, that different aspects of an intergroup situation (social context, differences in status, past relations) lead to different behaviors. This article describes the development and initial validation of the multifaceted concept of intergroup collective violence. In a series of three studies (N = 1,420, N = 1,000, N = 1,019) using mixed methodology, we constructed a scale for measuring acceptance of intergroup collective violence. Results show that it is a multidimensional phenomenon, dependent on 1) the ethnicity of the victims; 2) the perception of threat posed by them; and 3) the ideology. The results can have a substantial impact on the discipline, providing theoretical explanation of the differences in outbursts of violence in similar situations, such as pogroms. © 2020, Universitaet Bielefeld.

AB  - The new era of information technology brings new opportunities but also poses new threats. In our paper, we ex-amine whether a shift from traditional print and broadcasting to new online media results in the increased nor-malization of hate speech towards minorities, and whether this change can subsequently increase prejudice towards minorities. Our research uses data from a representative two-wave longitudinal survey of Polish adults. In wave 1 (N = 1060), data on respondents’ primary sources of information about the world (TV, newspapers, radio, online, social media, blogs) was collected. Wave 2 (N = 628), conducted six months later, included measures of perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech and Islamophobia. We found that respondents who were fre-quent social media users expressed higher levels of Islamoprejudice and perceived higher normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech than the respondents who got their news from traditional mass media. We also found that an increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech can act as one of the mechanisms through which use of social media is linked to higher Islamoprejudice. © 2020, Universitaet Bielefeld.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To know the experiences of family members of children with cystic fibrosis under the light of the theory of Callista Roy. METHOD: Qualitative research that used the adaptation theoretical framework of Callista Roy for inductive content analysis. Fifteen family members, in a university hospital, between 23 and 63 years old, participated in the study, from September to October 2018. RESULTS: Two categories were elaborated: "Evaluation of stimuli" and "Evaluation of behaviors". The first has three subcategories: "focal", "contextual" and "residual". And the second, four subcategories: "physiological domain", "self-concept", "role function" and "interdependence". FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: During the evaluation of stimuli, work overload and stress were identified as focal stimuli. Regarding contextual stimuli, it was noticed that the social life of caregivers was prejudiced. As for residual stimuli, the fear of loss is constant, and it appears that the emotional aspect of family members is the most affected comparing with physical exhaustion.

AB  - Radicalization and violent extremism are pressing problems across the world. After initially addressing problems in defining radicalization and extremism, this article sketches a new social-developmental model based on a systematic integration of theories and empirical findings. We propose a three-step model of radicalization starting with ontogenetic social-developmental processes during the most dynamic period for social development, from early childhood to late adolescence. These processes include the interaction of societal, social, and individual risk and protective factors. In adverse cases this interplay encourages the establishment of proximal radicalization processes between early adolescence and middle adulthood. We assume that four interrelated but distinct social-developmental processes are central conditions for radicalization and extremism: identity problems, prejudice, political or religious ideologies, and antisocial attitudes and behavior. These proximal processes are triggered by actual societal, social, or individual conflicts (such as economic crisis, victimization) and marked by continuous intergroup processes. The more intense the proximal processes, the greater the likelihood of extremist attitudes and behavior. The article closes by discussing implications for early prevention and an outlook for further re-search. © 2020, Universitaet Bielefeld. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many contemporary social epistemologists take themselves to be combatting an individualist approach to knowledge typified by Descartes. Although I agree that Descartes presents an individualist picture of scientific knowledge, he does allow some practical roles for reliance on the testimony and beliefs of others. More importantly, however, his reasons for committing to individualism raise important issues for social epistemology, particularly about how reliance on mere testimony can propagate prejudices and inhibit genuine understanding. The implications of his views are worked out more fully by some of his immediate successors; I examine how François Poulain de la Barre, and (briefly) Mary Astell analyze the social conditions for epistemic agency in a Cartesian vein. © 2020 Towarzystwo Naukowe Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego.

AB  - Social and economic backwardness of Muslims in India in various fields, such as employment, education, housing and access to infrastructure, is well-documented, particularly in the Sachar Committee Report. Despite the constitutional promise of equality and non-discrimination, discrimination in various forms is the lived reality of Indian Muslims. Growing anti-Muslim prejudice in society and in the institutions of the State is responsible for Muslims' inability to realise their rights to equality and nondiscrimination. Often there is a legal struggle to enforce constitutionally guaranteed rights and access benefits in welfare schemes. This article discusses the legal struggle to access the pre-matric scholarship under the Prime Minister's 15 Point Programme when the State of Gujarat refused to implement the scheme. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 |

AB  - While linguistic prejudice is commonly understood to concern individuals or social groups because of the way they speak, we can also see it as damaging language used about individuals or social groups. In this article, I start by looking at the traditional sociolinguistic understanding of linguistic prejudice, then go on to look rather widely at various forms of prejudicial/sexist language about women. In doing so, I identify various lexical asymmetries and associated "lexical gaps". The main part of the article takes this further by exploring how certain insults to men draw on an understood prejudice again women. I illustrate this with a "telling case": three naturally occurring examples of prejudicial, sexist language recently used by British prime minister Boris Johnson: big girl's blouse, man up and girly swot. For all three to work, they draw on what we might call a discourse of "Women as ineffectual". I conclude with a discussion of intentionality as regards this sort of prejudicial language use, what it is intended to achieve and how it can be resisted. © 2020 Jane Sunderland, published by De Gruyter 2020.

AB  - Consideration of the prevalence of regional prejudice in Brazil shows how stereotypical assumptions about culture, race, and socioeconomic class inform regional biases. A comparison of discriminatory social media posts after the 2014 and 2018 presidential elections reveals similarities in most of the racist and xenophobic language in the two election cycles but an increase in references to Venezuela and Cuba and heightened animosity toward the Partido dos Trabalhadores in 2018. Racism directed by social media users against nordestinos is part of a historical continuum of oppression fostered by regional stereotypes and failed public policies that have real-life implications for Brazil’s nordestinos. A consideração da prevalência de preconceito regional no Brasil mostra a centralidade de premissas estereotipadas sobre cultura, raça e classe socioeconômica.

AB  - Past research has linked poor psychosocial adjustment among children who express gender nonconformity (GNC) to poor peer relations (e.g., facing ridicule and rejection); however, very little research has explored whether it is possible to improve children’s appraisals of GNC. The present study attempted to replicate a previous intervention that was conducted among 8- to 9-year-old children from Hong Kong that successfully improved children’s appraisals of gender-nonconforming peers. Specifically, it tested whether the same intervention was successful at improving appraisals of gender-nonconforming peers in a sample of children from Canada and among both 4- to 5-year-old and 8- to 9-year-old children. To do so, we employed an experimental vignette design among 4- to 5-year-old (n = 176; 48% girls) and 8- to 9-year-old (n = 182; 49% girls) children. In the intervention condition, targets were presented who displayed mostly gender-nonconforming preferences, some gender-conforming preferences, and positive attributes. Following the intervention, participants’ appraisals of gender-nonconforming and gender-conforming targets were assessed through verbal reports, a sharing task, and a rank-order task. Overall, the intervention did not improve appraisals of GNC, and there were no differences based on age or gender of the participants, or gender of the targets. We discuss possible reasons why there was a cultural difference in the effectiveness of the intervention and how future intervention work in this area might be strengthened. © 2020 University of Toronto Press Inc..

AB  - The analysis we propose aims at identifying those limitations of the acts of knowledge that have emerged under the pressure of bureaucracy and politicization of institutions that administer public knowledge—the school at all levels, research centers, academies, etc. It seems of first urgency to examine without prejudice some topics such as: 1) knowledge and the institutions that manage it. We note the institutionalization of the forms of the procedural unfolding of knowledge and the standardization of the narratives that express it. This fact has social consequences that are easy to identify: No knowledge (truth) is recognized unless it enters the circuit of the institutions that manage the knowledge networks and alternative narratives (to the standard ones) develop epistemologically relevant effects only when they are allocated relevant expression space (the institutional mechanisms of authoritarian imposition block any attempt at non-conforming discourse). 2) formal narratives of knowledge and their political function prove the entry of the sciences into the circuit of the economy of symbolic goods. In social practice, the mutual negotiation between the various forms of public authority and the (compliant) education systems is transparent. Public education puts into circulation metanarratives about science that have an implicit ideo-logical dimension. © 2020, Center Transylvanian Studies. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the interwar period, for the first time in their history, Romanian Roma managed to organise themselves on a modern basis, by forming Roma associations and unions, and issuing their own newspapers and programmes. In an effort to de-fine themselves, they became politically active, claiming and negotiating rights. In my article I analyse the context of the interwar Roma movement, how Roma leaders of the time saw themselves and their movement, what programme(s) they had, and how they tried to achieve their goals. This was a serious challenge: As they were not self-sufficient, they heavily depended on support from Romanian institutions, and hence they had to act with caution in order to avoid any hostile reac-tions from the Romanian majority. Overall, the discourse of Roma elites in interwar Romania ranged between: 1) a national approach directed inwardly, toward the Roma, for ethnic mobilisation purposes, including calls to unite in order to acquire their rights, efforts to combat ethnic stigmatisation, discussions on ethnonyms (Gypsy vs. Roma) or on the importance of Roma in Romania and worldwide, the beginning of a national/ethnic mythology (past, origin, enslavement, heroization vs. victimization, etc.); and 2) a pragmatic approach directed outwardly, toward Romanian authorities and public opinion; rather than a national minority, Roma leaders presented the Roma as a social category with specific needs, due to their historical legacy. Of these two, throughout the interwar period, pragmatism prevailed. Special emphasis was placed on the issue of social inclusion, and on identifying specific problems and solutions (i.e., better access to education, settlement, deconstruction of prejudices, etc.). © 2020 by the author.

AB  - The article deals with the Requiem genre and its evolution in the context of a philosophical worldview through various historical periods of human development. The basis for this is the periodization proposed by V.V. Mineev, which reflects different attitudes to death in the process of evolution of philosophical and scientific thought. Views of the public consciousness concerning the issues of death resonate not only with philosophical reasoning and scientific works, but also with works of art. In the field of music, this is particularly evident in the genre of Requiem, which produces immediate response to social change. The author traces the transformation of ideas about death from superstitious – fantastic nature to medical justification of death, its treatment and prevention. The Requiem originated within the walls of the Catholic Church as a cult genre, capable of instilling religious fear in parishioners. Over time, it has freed itself from prejudice and gradually accumulated not only the memories of a particular deceased person who, but also the recollections about all mankind. The latter trait manifests itself in a departure from the Latin text and images of the Last Judgment, as well as in introducing secular texts into the spiritual genre. © Siberian Federal University.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the experience of parents whose children are in active treatment for various types of cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 parents. Through interpretative phenomenological analysis, five themes were derived: A) response to the diagnosis, b)parental "navigating" through the new life situation, c) "being in the hospital", d) sources of additional "burden ", and e) those who made the process of treatment easier. The majority of parents used active coping strategies; for example, they tried to mobilise existing resources, focused on the present and lived a "day-by-day " kind of life. As aggravating circumstances of treatment, they noted inadequate physical conditions, increased costs of living, inadequate .support of family members and a prejudicial environment. During the process of medical treatment, parents found the following factors helpful: Child's strength, other parents' support, community members, and the expertise of medical staff. This paper emphasises the complexities and importance of understanding parenting processes that can operate throughout the disease trajectory for families experiencing paediatric cancer. The findings on the experience of parents gives increasing insight into difficulties but also into parental protectiveness, which can contribute to defining the interventions for strengthening their parental role. © 2020, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Political Sciences.

AB  - The Kingdom of Serbia fought in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918. These events merged into a devastating experience of an all-out war, completely reshaping all aspects of contemporary life. As the first centenary of these events has recently shown, the memories of wartime still play a very prominent role in the Serbian national narrative. By 1915 around 20% of Serbian combatants belonged to some of the country’s minorities. Second class citizens on the social margins of society, the Serbian Roma constitute those whose wartime history is the least known to research and the public. However, the wartime diaries kept by Serbian soldiers are full of causal references to their Roma fellow combatants. This article provides an overview of the duties Roma soldiers played in the war, based on the perspective of Serbs who were fighting alongside them. The article tackles the general image and the position of the Roma population in the Kingdom of Serbia. In addition, the horrific challenges the war created for Serbian society are tackled from the perspective of those who were, already in peace time, in the most disadvantageous situation socially and economically. Overall, despite the unifying experience which the wartime suffering imposed on all citizens of the Kingdom, the old prejudices towards the Roma survived after 1918. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - The perception that mental patients represent a threat may support attitudes and behaviours of social exclusion and a contrary position to the precepts of the Psychiatric Reform. In this sense, this article has the objective of elaborating the Scale of Perceived Threat from the Mentally Ill and reporting the preliminary evidences of its factorial validity and internal consistence. For this purpose, two studies were performed: Study 1 performed an exploratory factor analysis composed of 244 university students aged 17 to 56 years old (M = 22.98; SD = 5.61); and study 2 performed a confirmation factor analysis from a sample of 247 university students aged between 17 and 51 years old (M = 23.08; SD = 5.75). The final scale was composed of nine items grouped into two factors: dangerousness and unpredictability, and presented good psychometric properties, being able to be used adequately to evaluate the perception of threat regarding the mentally Ill. © 2020, PUC de Campinas.

AB  - Asian American adolescents’ cross-race friendships are poorly understood, partially due to the model minority stereotype. Using data from 915 Asian American adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study for Adolescent to Adult Health, the present study examined the influence of cross-race friendships (based on peer nomination data) on Asian American adolescents’ psychological well-being trajectories, as well as the moderating role of school context (numeric marginalization, school prejudice). Results showed that cross-race friendships promoted Asian American adolescents’ psychological well-being, particularly in early adolescence and in schools where adolescents lacked critical mass of same-race peers or where prejudice was widespread. Similar findings were observed for cross-race friendships with the majority group, and more evident effects emerged for cross-ethnic friendships.

AB  - U.S. Latinx youth from immigrant backgrounds bring to schools their transnational literacies, complex lived experiences of marginalization and resistance, and politicized translanguaging practices that are seldom recognized in classrooms. This article examines U.S. Latinx bilingual youth who participated in a podcast project within a Chicanx/Latinx Studies high school course that mobilized their bilingualism for literacy instruction. This ethnographic classroom study explores a curricular unit that allowed young people to use new media technologies to tell important stories of themselves and their social worlds at a time of heightened anti-immigrant sentiments in the United States. Through translanguaging and translingual frames, I demonstrate how Latinx young people contest racist narratives, reclaim who they are, and author new spaces for solidarity. Findings detail the ways that students utilized podcasts as a tool to promote creativity and self-expression, and to connect personal experiences to broader pressing discourses about immigration, language, racialization processes, and resistance. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: Education system supplies the required manpower in order to ensure the national prosperity. A salient link between education and business sector is a prerequisite to cater economically productive manpower. Economic and social development supplements each other that can only be ensured via a functional education system. A dysfunction education system created by a biased clustering policy develops a greater horizontal and vertical mismatch with the job market in many developing nations. This mismatch dents the quality of business management that halts the national prosperity. Therefore, the role of education has become questionable. This research aims to bridge between education and business sectors. Design/methodology/approach: Given the differentiated nature of research questions, multiple techniques are used to collect the data. However, this research bears the norms of qualitative method. Both secondary and primary data are used. While, secondary data are collected by the banks, Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) and by the University Grants Commission (UGC), primary data are collected through interviews. Document review and data collected through personal communication with members of staff of sampled banks and institutes of HE also supplements. Data were collected from six commercial banks and from the Central Bank. Findings: Findings suggest that clustering system favours science graduates by depriving business counterpart, which creates an atmosphere of educational disparity. This disparity affects the symbiotic and reciprocal relationship that exists amongst different provisions (i.e. secondaryand tertiary) of education. Favoured clustering system further contributes for a larger “horizontal educational mismatch” with job market. Therefore, science graduates occupy the places in the banks where business graduates should ideally be employed. Being a dysfunction system, education fails to support substantially for social and economic developments. Originality/value: A few studies are conducted in the area of HE in Bangladesh but none covers the issue of impact of clustering system of education in secondary provision on HE and job market. Graduates' performance in carrying out the jobs is seen as the most important element for the business management. This study has suggested a unique way forward which would be able to reduce the mismatch between education system and job market, enabling a substantial business management process. Considering this, the paper is first on its kind. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the experience of immigrant student integration at a state school in Sao Paulo. Data was collected through interviews with the head teacher, the pedagogical coordinator, teachers and Bolivian immigrant parents; classroom observations, break time and meetings regarding projects for immigrant students; application of the proximity scale among students and analysis of school performance. The results showed that, in terms of professional and parental perceptions, there was a significant reduction in displays of prejudice and discrimination, as well as greater interaction among students. School initiatives focussed on immigrant culture should be highlighted, as well as the incorporation of the theme of immigration into the curriculum via learning roadmaps produced by teachers. Finally, the importance of democratic management and collective participation for a more inclusive school is also underlined. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Academic failure in Brazil is chronic and complex, therefore it is significant to listen carefully to those who deal with everyday challenges in public schools. The purpose of this research was to identify the teachers hypotheses concerning the difficulties in learning at school and to analyze some aspects underlying the explanations provided by those teachers. Information was collected by means of 133 questionnaires and focus groups with teachers working on Elementary School level. Thematic analysis of contents and the frequencies of words were used in order to systematize and interpret the results. Most teachers, 88 percent, explain that difficulties in learning are related mainly to the lack of support and encouragement by the students families; 69 percent highlight aspects associated with students, such as lack of interest, of attention, of preconditions, in addition to indiscipline and emotional problems. They also emphasize issues pertaining to public policies: reduced age for registration in Elementary School without the corresponding structural adaptations in the school, inadequate teaching materials, and continued academic progression without supporting the children with learning difficulties. We have concluded that even if such explanations, at a first look, indicate prejudices against families and students, upon careful examination, they reveal contemporary symptoms of the consumerist society, dissonances in the family-school relationship, and depreciation of education. What teachers say is an denounce of a market of handouts and workbooks, beside some types of training which dismiss their knowledge. The training courses, nicknamed teacher deformations by teachers, seem to be out of the context of the concrete problems faced by the public schools. Finally, what teachers say also bespeak the universe of mediatic manipulations towards the interests and values of families and students. © Emerson de Pietri.

AB  - This research aimed to analyze social representations on the inclusion of young people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in the high school (HS) segment, from the perspective of Young Natives in Inclusion-Oriented Pedagogy (YNIOP) attending a public high school in Planaltina, Brasilia-DF. It is a qualitative, descriptive-interpretative research. Data were obtained from the application of the Free Word Association Questionnaire to 186 young students, among which seven had ID. We prototyped this data with the help of the Iramuteq software. The results suggest that, underlying a social representation that is fully favorable to the inclusion of people with ID in the HS segment, there is the search for the affirmation of an identity compatible with norms, constitutional principles and legal procedures that strongly condemn expressions of prejudice and discriminatory attitudes. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - An important, but unexamined, predictor of mental illness stigma is an extrinsic religious orientation, or a motivation to participate in religion for social reasons. High extrinsic religious orientation correlates positively with other types of prejudice. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between diagnosis, religious orientation, and stigma. Participants (n = 334) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, randomized to read one of three vignettes about a person with a mental illness (schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, or depression), and completed measures of mental illness stigma and religious orientation. Using multiple regression analyses, researchers assessed the impact of diagnosis, extrinsic-personal, extrinsic-social, and intrinsic religiosity on specific aspects of stigma as measured by the Attribution Questionnare-27 subscales (i.e., blame, anger, pity, danger, fear, help, avoidance, segregation, and coercion). Analyses suggested that diagnosis was a key predictor of stigma, and that schizophrenia was the most stigmatized. Multiple regression analyses revealed that extrinsic religiosity was also an important predictor of stigma; extrinsic religiosity was associated with increased stigma in several domains and moderated the relationship between diagnosis and overall stigma. High extrinsic religiosity was associated with increased stigma, with both simple and moderating effects. Simple effects may be related to increased social conformity among religious people. As a moderator, extrinsic religiosity may weaken the link between diagnosis and stigma; high extrinsic religiosity was associated with greater stigma for diagnoses perceived as more "controllable" (i.e., anorexia nervosa, depression) such that levels were similar to schizophrenia. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Introduction: In the last decades, improvements in the care of pregnancy and child development have been observed worldwide. However, pregnancy problems remain high in most countries. There was a concentration of care in the prenatal period as the primary approach for improving pregnancy results. Currently, attention to the care of pregnant women, women who have recently given birth, and newborns are focused on the care of preconception to improve the results of pregnancy and improve the outcomes of child growth and development. Objective: Describe the evidence for preconception care (PCC) and information to the health care provider, as well as describe instruments to present health care providers with PCC, its definition, its components, recommended interventions, and the scientific basis for recommendations. Methods: There was a search for published and unpublished literature related to scientific evidence for the effectiveness of PCC in improving pregnancy results. The search was carried out based on Pubmed and using data scraping techniques, in the material available on the internet and disseminated by international organizations, such as the World Health Organization and reports by government agencies. Results: It is reported that the literature on the scientific basis for PCC is fragmented, and most publications discuss evidence of one or a few interventions, with the majority of reports considering PCC for specific populations, such as women with chronic health problems and couples with infertility. However, these publications do not offer a realistic view of the proposed PCC interventions, with the scientific evidence that supports them. The general aspects of the existing literature and the recommended preconceived care interventions are described, together with the quality of the scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendations behind each of these interventions. Conclusion: Many clinical interventions have been identified that could be offered to women before conception to help avoid adverse outcomes. Most of these interventions have scientific evidence to support their role in improving pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, it is recommended that clinical care providers incorporate evidence-based prejudice services in their daily care of women of reproductive age, in an effort to improve women's health before and during pregnancy, as well as improve pregnancy outcomes for women and their children. © 2020. this article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License

AB  - Grounded in intergroup threat theory, much research has illustrated the negative impact of the contextual presence of ethnic minorities construed as threats by the mainstream society on racial attitudes. This study examines the possibility that the presence of other “non-threatening” ethnic minorities could undermine such negative impact. We contend that the presence of genuine diversity can promote multicultural experiences and reduce people’s tendency to single out specific ethnic groups as threatening. Analysis of telephone survey (N = 2407) and government by-census data in Hong Kong shows that proportion of district residents being South Asians and proportion of district residents using Mandarin as their usual spoken language were associated with lower levels of social and political tolerance when proportion of district residents being other ethnic minorities was low. The negative impact became weaker when proportion of other ethnic minorities increased. The pattern of results was more conspicuous among less educated citizens. © 2020 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - The present study aims to explore classical and modern prejudice towards individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) among a sample of Italian university students who attend Social Sciences and Physical Sciences degree courses. A convenience sample of 280 university students (51.4% doing Social Sciences degrees, and 48.6% doing Physical Sciences degrees) participated in this research. Two separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were carried out to examine the relationship between the variables in order to identify which predictors affect the expression of prejudice towards people with ID. The results showed that classical prejudice was predicted by males, no prior work experience with individuals with ID, Big Five, personality traits such as agreeableness and openness, low reactive empathy, reduced quality of contact, and intergroup anxiety. Modern prejudice was predicted by males, students who attended Physical Sciences degree courses, no prior work experience with individuals with ID, low parallel and reactive empathy. Limitations and practical implications are discussed. © 2020 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - Researchers investigating reactions to interracial police officer-civilian interactions are increasingly interested in utilizing more naturalistic stimuli. To facilitate this research, we introduce the IPOC (interracial police officercivilian) Database, a freely available set of real-world videos of interracial officer-civilian interactions with norming data. These short, audio-less videos represent a range of interactions focused on the arrest (e.g., traffic stops, foot chases). To create this database, participants evaluated a set of 78 videos on the social category membership (e.g., age, race) of officers and civilians and aspects of the interaction (e.g., aggressiveness) and scene (e.g., neighborhood safety). Videos were then blurred in order to measure officer and civilian aggressiveness in the absence of race cues. Then, 38 videos were equated across multiple dimensions based on civilian race (19 Black, 19 White). The database includes all 78 videos, the subset of 38 equated videos, and ratings for open access use in future research. © 2020 Guilford Publications, Inc.

AB  - Objective: We investigated user requirements for a smartphone application to coordinate layperson administration of naloxone during an opioid overdose. Materials and Methods: We conducted interviews and focus groups with 19 nonmedical opioid users and other community members in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which has one of the highest overdose rates in the country. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: We found high levels of trust and reliance within ones own social group, especially nonmedical opioid users and members of the neighborhood. Participants distrusted outsiders, including professional responders, whom they perceived as uncaring and prejudiced. Participants expressed some concern over malicious use of a location-based application, such as theft when a victim is unconscious, but overall felt the benefits could outweigh the risks. Participants also trusted community-based organizations providing services such as bystander training and naloxone distribution, and felt that a smartphone application should be integrated into these services. Discussion: Individuals affected by opioid use and overdose reacted positively to the concept for a smartphone application, which they perceived as a useful tool that could help combat the high rate of opioid overdose fatalities in their neighborhood. A sense of unity with others who have shared their experiences could be leveraged to connect willing bystanders with victims of overdose, but risk must be mitigated for layperson responders. Conclusion: Based on participant experiences with overdoses, trust-based considerations for the design of smartphone applications to facilitate layperson response will be critical for their adoption and use in real overdose situations. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Understanding the development and structure of people’s concepts of national groups can contribute to an understanding of their behavior in the political arena, including perhaps the recent rise in nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment. Here, we provide a developmental investigation of concepts of national groups in a sample of 5- to 8-year-old Canadian children (N = 79). Using an extensive battery of measures, we assessed the extent to which children conceive of national groups as socially constructed versus as having deeper, perhaps biological, “essences” that shape their members’ physical and psychological makeup. At younger ages, Canadian children tended to essentialize national groups, including in a biological sense. At older ages, the biological conception of national groups subsided, but children continued to view these groups as meaningful and informative. A statistical comparison with 5- to 8-year-old American children’s responses to the same measures (N = 70; using data from Hussak & Cimpian, 2019) revealed a great degree of overlap, despite substantial differences between the two countries in how national identity is conceived and described. These findings add an important piece to our understanding of the development of concepts of national groups.

AB  - This article is part of a larger study investigating the perceived value of using comics as an information resource in the teaching and training of mental health and social care professionals in a higher education setting. We surveyed 108 library users at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which specialises in mental health and social care and is a centre for both treatment and training. The study showed that most participants believed that comics have a potential role to play in mental health care training, and that challenges remain in getting comics perceived in ways that are not limited by existing prejudices or socio-cultural assumptions. Amongst other findings, the study found no significant association between the age or gender of participants and their attitudes to comics in an academic context. Participants considered that the most useful application of comics within the mental health and social care domain was their potential use in medical or therapeutic settings with young people. Even when our sample was not dominated by participants who reported reading comics regularly, the study showed that recent experience of reading comics seems to positively influence how comfortable participants feel about using comics for teaching or learning. © 2020, Open Library of Humanities.

AB  - As COVID-19 crosses the globe, disabled people are subject to new medical and discursive realities. Focusing on the consequences of the latter, we utilize news reports from Canada and the UK to argue the current language of pre-existing conditions represents disability as non-life, explaining away the material realities facing disabled persons. This language ignores the distribution of care work in our societies, poverty, and other forms of exclusion facing disabled people and the population more generally. Work on ventilator users points to these existing inequalities, obscured as they may be. This story is not new. Outlining existing narratives within disability studies challenging disability as deadly biological and economic deficiency and situating the ‘pre-existing’ terminology therein, we look to work in disability studies and bioethics to challenge the disability–death equation. We end reviewing counter-narratives by and for disabled people, highlighting the ongoing and life-affirming resistance throughout the disability rights movement. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This work aimed at mapping the international scientific production concerning music education for the deaf, or musical notation for the deaf, in the ISI Web of Knowledge/Web of ScienceTM, one of the main databases there is. Its temporal cut encompassed the years from 1956 to 2017. The study tried to identify the main articles concerning the topic with a focus on the analysis of the characteristics, barriers and successful practices of such type of education. A bibliometric study was used and it identified 217 articles whose data were processed through the HistCiteTM software. The results pointed to the identification of the main journals, the most cited articles and the main authors in the area. Among the main characteristics in music education for the deaf, it was possible to see that it must be centered on melodic repetition, and that the presence of the family is essential in this process. The lack of listening skills and communication difficulties are the main barriers. The realization of interviews for the definition of criteria for the milestone of music education for the deaf, the creation of development inventories and the cognitive and auditory assessment are the main practices developed in the area. Thus, it was possible to imply that, along the period studied, a focus on the researches led the studies concerning the deafness issue in itself to the role of music education in the acquisition of basic skills by the deaf, as well as to studies on diversity and prejudice related to the deaf person. Likewise, it was possible to see that, concerning the role of the school, of the teacher and of the pedagogical infrastructure around music learning, the studies that were developed addressed deaf parents, children and adults as the main actors. © 2020 Emerson de Pietri.

AB  - The shared experience of societal discrimination and affirmation can provide a basis for empathy among members of different marginalized groups. However, the potential mechanisms and moderating conditions involved in this process have been little studied. This experiment examined how perceived societal (in)equity of one’s own group may influence one’s reaction to other marginalized groups. We randomly assigned 310 cisgender White lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults to conditions varying in LGB (in)equity salience (discrimination, affirmation, control) and in the target outgroup identity (transgender, Black). Participants completed a survey assessing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the outgroup, that is, indicators of allyship. Based on the emerging theory of stigma-based solidarity, we expected LGB discrimination to improve intergroup relations with transgender people (i.e. a group readily sharing a common superordinate identity with LGB people) but worsen relations with Black people (i.e. a group not readily sharing a common superordinate identity). Counter to expectations, allyship variables were not predicted by discrimination as a main effect or in interaction with outgroup identity. However, we found support for the mediating role of emotions in explaining the indirect effect of discrimination on allyship. For example, discrimination produced greater outgroup identification by elevating negative affect, but only when the outgroup was transgender people. Results for transgender and Black targets converged for outcomes requiring participants to consider societal injustice toward the outgroup. We observed only one effect for affirmation: It reduced LGB people’s empathic anger for both transgender and Black people. Results may inform efforts of coalition building. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Policy Relevance Statement: This study of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults suggests that emotion partially explains the positive effects of discrimination salience on LGB people’s support for other marginalized groups. Results also show that LGB people’s responses to other marginalized groups may depend on their sense of shared fate with the outgroup and their awareness of injustice facing the outgroup.

AB  - Introduction: School violence is a problem that involves a lot of bad consequences for the lives of students. So preventing and researching about it is very important. Objective: The objective of this study was identify the experiences of violence of students from public schools participating in the PSE-School Health Program and SPE-Health and Prevention in the Schools of Florianopolis. Methods: Participants were 871 students from the 9th grade of elementary school to the 3rd year of high school with an average age of 15 years and 6 months. Results: Regarding the experiences of violence, 81.6% stated that they had already witnessed scenes of violence, with 51.1% of these scenes occurring at school. Besides, 28% of the participants reported having already suffered prejudice at school. There was a significant statistical association between violent behavior and gender (being a boy), having a habit of watching movies and playing video games with violent content, skipping classes and having a regular to bad relationship with teachers. Conclusions: Violence is part of student's daily activities, involving a broad context and it is pretty much related to school. © The authors (2020).

AB  - The scientific novelty of the study consists of the unique, organic, integrative, synchronous and diachronic approach of this topic in the Romanian academic space after 1990. The author uses a diverse scientific methodology –inductive, deductive, cartographic, historical, statistical-mathematical, and analytical – from the intersection of political geography, geopolitics, geoeconomics, geostrategy, geo-culture and history. From the beginning of the book, he reveals an interdisciplinary vision, presenting his perspective through the complicated kaleidoscope of the main schools of geopolitics (American, German, French, British). Following in parallel, chronologically and thematically, the relations between post-totalitarian Romania and the USA, Germany and Russia, the author builds his conceptual, scientific and methodological edifice on a series of pillars, present in all five chapters: frontier, history, geopolitics, geostrategy, geoeconomics, geoculture. Benefiting from an impressive bibliography, the author offers an original and surprising view of the Romanian, American, German, and Russian geopolitical realities, managing to detach himself from prejudices, taboos, stereotypes, and leaving the sphere of official, formal and dull language, so often used in the Romanian space by politicians, journalists, and by some pseudo-specialists in geopolitics, security, etc. © 2020, Universitatea "Stefan cel Mare" din Suceava.

AB  - In this study, we built upon prejudice reduction interventions research (primarily in social psychology) and ally development investigations (primarily in applied psychology). We aimed to develop an intervention to foster knowledge and attitude change identified in both areas as central to reducing prejudice and increasing intentions to promote racial justice. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether online imaginal and psychoeducational interventions could contribute to White people’s needed understandings to engage in racial justice work. Additionally, if some interventions were successful, we aimed to determine which components were most effective. We used three intervention components, two of which were created for this study: imaginal contact with a person of color, learning and reflecting about racism and its impact on people of color, and increasing awareness of White privilege and positionality. We randomized participants to different combinations of the intervention components and control components to not only evaluate combined components but also dismantle the intervention, determining whether specific aspects of the intervention were more effective. Participants completed outcome measures about their attitudes and understandings prior to the intervention, immediately postintervention, and 3 weeks after completing the intervention. Findings demonstrated that the intervention and its components positively impacted outcomes of interest, with increasingly complicated learning requiring more comprehensive intervention to change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Policy Relevance Statement: Despite our efforts, subtle and overt forms of racism continue to exist in the United States. This study suggests that through intervention, White people can develop a greater awareness of racial justice issues. Organizations and institutions could benefit from utilizing similar low-resource interventions to combat prejudice and increase allied attitudes.

AB  - The purpose of social work is actualized through its commitment to diversity and differences in practice, as well as human rights, social, economic, and environmental justice. A review of literature on microaggressions and oppression against marginalized and vulnerable populations suggests important themes that social work instructors need to examine with students. It is unclear to what extent instructors use pedagogical tools to gain knowledge, skills, and critical consciousness to navigate social justice contents and manage difficult conversations with diverse student groups in class settings. Not much attention is paid in social work education on how well instructors are prepared to teach this content in depth and what challenges they face when facilitating highly sensitive and difficult discussions with students. This article described and evaluated five sets of reflective, experiential, and collaborative activities in a social justice course designed to help social work students examine the histories of various identity groups that have experienced discrimination and oppression and increase their self-awareness of both privilege and personal bias in one’s life. These activities include: (1) reflective reading notes; (2) critical reflection paper; (3) brief lecture and experiential class activities and discussion; (4) collaborative group presentations and role-plays; and (5) cultural competency plan. Thirty-two students completed the evaluation surveys to assess their overall feedback about course activities and 36 students completed anonymous online course evaluations to assess their level of attainment in all course competencies. Student feedback collected in course evaluations and surveys, students’ self-assessment of attainment of course competencies, and the instructor’s critical reflection and self-assessment, suggest that teaching social justice using a reflective, experiential, and collaborative pedagogical approach has a promising potential for advancing course objectives. Through these activities, students increased their knowledge on a range of topics such as racism, oppression, microaggression, social identities, intersectionality, privilege, and cultural humility, enhanced their understanding of various forms of prejudice and discrimination, and acquired critical skills and cultural competence that have direct application in social work field. © 2020, Sciedu Press.

AB  - This presentation is related to three aspects of the sociological theory of Florian Znaniecki and William Thomas: the concept of ethnic relations and immigrants attitudes in diaspora situation as well as the concept of recreate and building of an ethnic community. The main problem tackled in the paper can be narrowed down to the question: whether and how is the system of social relationships between different ethnic groups transferred into a migration situation? Relations between Polish and Ukrainian immigrants will be use as an example. What guides this paper is trading these realtions in the sphere of everyday life in one of New York's Lower Manhattan neighborhoods-East Village, where Polish and Ukrainian ethnic community in New York City formed in the second half of the 19th century. The text portrays the community eastablished by the immigrants, and especially its past and the character of Polish-Ukrainian neighborhood, which, as it turns out, resembles Polish-Ukrainian in the European borderland. In the analysis particular attention will be focus on microsocial determinants of mutual relationships as well as on the various elements of interethnic relations, including: spheres of cooperation, conflict areas, daily interactions, ethnic distance, mutual perceptions, etc. The text will give a short outline of the process of shaping and functioning of the ethnic community, its character, as well as the processes of changes of the ethnic community. © 2020 QuiEdit.

AB  - The minimal group paradigm, published by Henri Tajfel and his colleagues in the early 1970s, is a widely used experimental technique for studying intergroup perceptions and behavior. In its original form, it involved the assignment of participants to one of two meaningless categories and asking them to make allocations of rewards to other (anonymous) members of those groups. Typically, discrimination in favor of the ingroup is observed in those reward allocations. In this article, I examine the historical origins of this paradigm, noting that it was first mooted by another social psychologist, Jaap Rabbie, in the 1960s, although he is seldom credited with this fact. The intellectual disagreements between Rabbie, Tajfel, and Turner over the nature and interpretation of the paradigm are also discussed.

AB  - Based on 30 life history interviews with former members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), this article analyses the particular challenges ex-combatants with disabilities face when returning to civilian lives. Moreover, it uses an intersectional approach to explore how disability intersects with gender and geographic location to generate specific patterns of marginalisation for different groups of disabled ex-combatants. Findings demonstrate the lack of attention paid to the specific needs of disabled ex-combatants by post-conflict policies which, combined with cumbersome procedures and favouritism in the selection of beneficiaries, have left ex-combatants dependent on family networks for livelihood assistance. This dependency exacerbates prejudices against and the social isolation of disabled ex-combatants and detrimentally affects their self-esteem. Furthermore, the article shows how disability and gender intersect to generate additional forms of discrimination resulting from increased social stigma, patriarchal attitudes and the exposure to different forms of abuse, as well as how differences in terms of communal support network, the density of ex-combatant populations and political attitudes generate spatial variation in patterns of social and economic marginalisation. © 2020, King’s College London.

AB  - In post-conflict and segregated societies, overcoming high prejudice between groups is essential for peaceful coexistence. In this paper, we explore the roles of direct contact (face-to-face contact and cross-group friendship) and indirect contact (extended cross-group friendship) in reducing prejudice between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots living in Cyprus. Moreover, this study further explores whether the effects of direct and indirect contact vary between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, as well as across a ten-year period. To explore these issues, we analyze data from different representative samples of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots at two different time points (years 2007 and 2017). The results suggest that all three forms of contact have significant effects on prejudice. However, they also exhibit some variations by community (but not year of data collection) in the effects of direct (but not indirect) contact on prejudice. © 2020 European Sociological Association.

AB  - “Concept creep” is the gradual semantic expansion of harm-related concepts such as bullying, mental disorder, prejudice, and trauma. This review presents a synopsis of relevant theoretical advances and empirical research findings on the phenomenon. It addresses three fundamental questions. First, it clarifies the characterisation of concept creep by refining its theoretical and historical dimensions and presenting studies investigating the change in harm-related concepts using computational linguistics. Second, it examines factors that have caused concept creep, including cultural shifts in sensitivity to harm, societal changes in the prevalence of harm, and intentional meaning changes engineered for political ends. Third, the paper develops an account of the consequences of concept creep, including social conflict, political polarisation, speech restrictions, victim identities, and progressive social change. This extended analysis of concept creep helps to understand its mixed implications and sets a multi-pronged agenda for future research on the topic. © 2020, © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This article proposes photovoice as an innovative approach to group work with Black (K-12) youth in school settings. More specifically, this article focuses on how school counselors can use photovoice as a tool to address the race-related struggles (e.g., racial prejudice and discrimination) that Black students experience both inside and outside of school. Photovoice empowers students to take photos capturing issues of shared concern in and around their school and use as the basis of critical dialogue and collective action plans. The key features and stages of this approach are outlined. Implication for practice and future research are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 ASGW.

AB  - Efforts to increase diversity and inclusivity in engineering have had limited success in the United States where the percentage of women enrolling in engineering remains around 20%. One theory as to why women and minorities enroll in engineering at lower rates is stereotype threat which is the fear of fulfilling a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs. In our study, we utilized Picho and Brown's Social Identities and Attitudes Scale (SIAS), which we adapted for engineering students, to measure stereotype threat vulnerability in engineering undergraduates in the southern United States. With 179 survey responses, we answered the following research questions: (1) Is the Social Attitudes and Identities Scale psychometrically sound when modified for engineering students? (2) What populations are most vulnerable to stereotype threat? (3) How does stereotype threat impact students in terms of the six constructs laid out within the Social Identities and Attitudes Scale? Our results show that the SIAS scale can be effective in measuring stereotype threat vulnerability in engineering students and that women are significantly more impacted by stereotype threat than any other group. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Human Library (HL) is a nonprofit community event aimed at increasing awareness and reduction of prejudice toward stigmatized groups in the society. HL implements an unusual methodology in the format of a pretend ‘library’ where HL attendants so-called ‘Readers’ engage in short, face-to-face, direct contact with so-called ‘Books’ who are real individuals from various stigmatized social groups. Although HL has been widely used in various contexts since 2000’s and is recommended as the best practice of integration by European Commission, empirical research testing its effectiveness is limited. Our study presented the findings from four consecutive HL events conducted from 2016 to 2019 in Turkey (total N = 534). Including various control groups, we tested the effectiveness of HL as a direct intergroup contact intervention on affective (trust, empathy), cognitive (knowledge), and behavioral (e.g., willingness to talk to outgroup members) aspects of outgroup attitudes. Findings demonstrated that while overall outgroup attitudes became more positive after HL attendance, unlike merely participating in the event or not attending HL, actual contact (‘Reading a Book’), in particular, improved attitudes toward the target groups. While supporting the overall benefits of HL methodology as a contact intervention, our study demonstrated that HL may be more effective on certain dimensions of attitudes. Practical implications and possible limitations of HL, as well as perspectives for future research were discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Educators and social workers are essential to promote the social and digital inclusion of people with intellectual disability. Their perceptions about Internet use by people with intellectual disability may lead to prejudices that can hinder the opportunity of this group to get equal and meaningful access to the virtual arena. To identify potential prejudices among future professionals and to determine their initial training needs, a cross-sectional survey study was conducted. The aim was to examine and compare 433 education and social work students’ perceptions about Internet use by people with and without intellectual disability, in terms of online benefits, risks and safety. Results showed that students perceived the Internet to be more beneficial, but also riskier and less safe, for people with intellectual disability than for the general population. Differences were observed with regard to gender, university degree and frequency of contact with people with intellectual disability and a positive relationship was found between students’ Internet use and their perceived online benefits, risks and safety. These findings highlight the need for initial training programs that overcome future professionals’ prejudices towards people with intellectual disability and their capability to use the Internet safely. © 2020, © The British Society of Developmental Disabilities 2020.

Self-efficacy is a key component of social cognitive theory and highly predictive of an individual’s willingness to act. This study includes 232 teacher educators’ responses to a survey exploring their self-efficacy in working with LGBTQ students, teaching about LGBTQ events/figures, and helping preservice teachers reduce their prejudice about LGBTQ individuals. Ultimately, teacher educators need more resources to help increase their self-efficacy in integrating this topic into their courses. © 2020, © 2020 Association of Teacher Educators.

AB  - In Argentina, as well as in many countries, indigenous people have been the target of prejudice for centuries. This situation mostly dates to the "Conquest of the Desert", a military campaign waged by the Argentine government against the indigenous population during the late 19th century. Although in the last three decades, indigenous groups' claims for reparation and equal social rights have increased in visibility, most are still victims of cultural segregation and poverty. This study analyzes the relations among social representations and prejudice against indigenous people in a small city, where the descendants of both military people and the European immigrants who arrived at the beginning of the 20th century to settle in the "conquered" lands, live alongside descendants of the Mapuche indigenous groups who originally inhabited that same territory. Our analyses suggest a contradiction in the attempts to vindicate the indigenous people while maintaining their subordinated and segregated status in the community. That opposition is reinforced by imaginary frontiers created by the organization of urban spaces and representations of the relations between past and present that relegate indigenous people to the past and place them into the poorest and most violent neighborhood, implicitly marking them as criminals. Hence, social representations may be at the basis of the subtle expressions of prejudice that are very frequent. However, when the inhabitants of the city have to actually face indigenous people who are not clearly very different from them and when these indigenous people's claims become more visible, more blatant forms of prejudice become manifest. © 2020 The Authors. © 2020 ISCTE.

AB  - Over the past thirty years, immigrants in the US have been settling outside of gateway cities, going instead to a number of other new locations across the country. While much of the extant literature has focused on economic and family-based migration, in this paper I look at a different subgroup, officially resettled refugees. I explore the rationales that lie behind such a trend by examining placement data and a number of interviews with key figures in the US resettlement system at multiple levels. In particular, I examine the idea of refugees as an instrument of urban revitalization for smaller cities as well as the opportunities and challenges that their arrival has presented for these sites. I contextualize the arrival of refugees in smaller cities in the US within the current moment of rising racism, xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment across the country, as well as a resettlement program undergoing radical changes. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The Italian sociological scientific community has shown a limited interest in issues related to bisexuality. The purpose of this paper is to fill the knowledge gap on the subject, showing data of an empirical research conducted online on the Italian bisexual community. Design/methodology/approach: The article is based on a mixed methods online survey on Italian bisexual people, which included 218 interviews. The questionnaire was made up of closed and open-ended questions, to investigate their behaviours, habits and lifestyles. Findings: Social pressure and lack of understanding by others sometimes make difficult for bisexual people to show themselves openly for what they are, especially in some contexts, such as the word of work. From a sociological point of view, one can argue that one of the tools when bisexual people face the stigma related to bisexuality is to control, often in an obsessive way, the information they provide about themselves, carefully evaluating the contexts in which they can free themselves and the time when they must expose themselves in line with the expectations of the heteronormative society. Research limitations/implications: The non-probabilistic sample limits the external validity of the findings. There are also critical elements that characterise social research when transposed online: first, the profiles of the respondents not always are verifiable; second, the digital divide excludes some groups that cannot access the web or involves an over-representation of those who are more familiar with technologies. Originality/value: The work presented is the first Italian sociological study aimed at deepening the “invisible B” phenomenon of the LGBT acronym in a systematic way. Nowadays bisexuality remains under-researched in social sciences and overall in sociology. Putting “bisexuality” at the centre of the sociological attention appears important to provide serious and scientifically valid data and information useful both to develop the knowledge on this identity category and to contain forms of discrimination and prejudice. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Attitudes toward outgroups are an important determinant of peaceful coexistence in diverse societies, but it is difficult to improve them. The current research studies the impact of messages with negations on outgroup attitudes, more specifically on outgroup trust. All studies were preregistered. Using different target groups, Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence for the prediction that communicating negations (e.g., "they are not deceptive") enhances outgroup trust (more so than affirmations, such as "they are reliable," and no messages) among people who are initially low in outgroup trust. Three additional studies (Studies 3a, 3b, and 4), using both a causal chain approach and (moderated) mediation analysis, demonstrate that negations promote cognitive flexibility which in turn enhances outgroup trust among those initially low in outgroup trust. One final study suggests that these findings generalize to outgroup attitude change per se by showing that communicating negations also results in more moderate attitudes when the dominant initial attitude is positive (Study 5: high warmth) rather than negative (Studies 1-4: low trustworthiness). As such, communication that negates people's initial outgroup attitudes could be an effective (previously discounted) intervention to reduce prejudice in intergroup settings. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - This qualitative phenomenological study utilized interviews and focus groups to discern the impact of The Ulster Project, specifically Ulster Project Delaware, U.S. A (UPD). Ulster Project Delaware was formed as a response to sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Established to increase good will and religious tolerance between Catholic and Protestant Northern Irish, UPD includes adolescents from the towns of Banbridge, Coleraine, and Portadown, Northern Ireland. A discussion of the history of this sectarian violence, also known as "The Troubles, " contextualizes the study, as does an overview of the origin of Ulster Project International (UPI) and UPD. The founder of UPI hypothesized that participation in the Ulster Project would assist and facilitate increased religious, social, and political tolerance for differing religions and cultures, as well as foster increased good will between Protestants and Catholics. To decrease negative stereotyping of those whose faith and cultures differ and subsequently decrease sectarian violence, UPD participants (i.e., Northern Irish and American adolescents) engaged in integrated activities and intense retreats. The short-and long-term impact and efficacy of UPD from Northern Irish participants' perspectives are shared. © Common Ground Research Networks.

AB  - Background. This research is aimed at establishing and internally validating the risk nomogram of insulin resistance (IR) in a Chinese population of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods. We developed a predictive model based on a training dataset of 145 PCOS patients, and data were collected between March 2018 and May 2019. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model was used to optimize function selection for the insulin resistance risk model. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to construct a prediction model integrating the function selected in the regression model of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The predicting model's characteristics of prejudice, disease, and lifestyle were analyzed using the C-index, the calibration diagram, and the study of the decision curve. External validity was assessed using the validation of bootstrapping. Results. Predictors contained in the prediction nomogram included occupation, disease durations (years), BMI, current use of metformin, and activities. With a C-index of 0.739 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.644-0.830), the model showed good differentiation and proper calibration. In the interval validation, a high C-index value of 0.681 could still be achieved. Examination of the decision curve found that the IR nomogram was clinically useful when the intervention was determined at the 11 percent IR potential threshold. Conclusion. This novel IR nomogram incorporates occupation, disease durations (years), BMI, current use of metformin, and activities. This nomogram could be used to promote the estimation of individual IR risk in patients with PCOS. © 2020 Feng Jiang et al.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that threats related to infectious diseases would make persons less willing to affiliate with out-groups and that feelings of disgust and beliefs about the out-group members would mediate this effect. To test this hypothesis, American participants of European descent were presented with either a disease threat or control threat. Then they were shown a photograph of someone of the same race or different race. Participants were asked to indicate whether they would avoid the target person and to state their emotional and cognitive responses to the person. As predicted, disease salience decreased the desire to affiliate with out-group members, and both feelings of disgust and beliefs about the infection risk posed by the target person mediated this relationship. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The trial of Captain Max Thierichens of the Imperial German Navy in Philadelphia in 1917 was a national sensation. His ship, the Prinz Eitel Fredrich, first sought refuge in the United States in 1915, but eventu-ally the popularity of the captain and his crew became a liability as the country edged closer to war. In the hands of the infant Bureau of Investiga-tion and the print media, Thierichens’s amorous adventures became federal crimes linked to an international campaign against sex trafficking. A propa-ganda windfall, these charges reflected the anti-German sentiments gener-ated by the First World War, as well as other early twentieth-century social anxieties. In spite of his conviction and imprisonment, the actual facts of the case are still unclear. The personal and political purposes of the trial, however, are not. Ultimately, these highlight the vulnerability of American institutions to political pressure, popular prejudice, and social fears, espe-cially in wartime. © 2020, Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

AB  - The model minority stereotype (MMS) is the dominant stereotype associated with Asian Americans. It consists of seemingly positive components that depict Asian Americans as highly intelligent and hardworking, but it is also associated with negative stereotypes about Asian Americans, such as social incompetence and self-isolation. These stereotypes persist in the media not only in the United States but also in Canada. Even the very groups targeted by these stereotypes may endorse and internalize them, which could lead to a host of social and psychological consequences. The purpose of the current article is to outline a model that represents the Asian Canadian experience with the MMS and associated negative stereotypes through 2 studies. The first study assesses real-world responses to a media depiction of these stereotypes, focusing on how media consumers react to blatant depictions of Asian Canadian stereotypes and the degree to which they endorse or reject them. The second study examines whether endorsing and internalizing the MMS and associated negative stereotypes is related to the self-esteem and well-being of Asian Canadians, using generational status as a moderating variable. These studies highlight how context, such as living in Canada or being first generation compared with second generation, can be related to how one interprets and reacts to the stereotypes applied to them. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)What is the public significance of this article?: This research is the first to highlight that the model minority stereotype exists in Canada and has potential implications for Asian Canadians. We found that there are generational differences in the degree to which endorsing and internalizing these stereotypes relates to Asian Canadians’ psychological well-being and self-esteem.

AB  - Systems of oppression have shaped the prejudicial treatment of Black people based on the appearance of their hair, from the era of chattel enslavement to present-day America. Hair discrimination is a social injustice characterized by unfairly regulating and insulting people based on the appearance of their hair. A sampling of 90 African American community members narrated memories of hair discrimination using the guided hair autobiography method. While the hair narratives revealed texture, length, and style were the most common entry points into discriminatory behaviors, color, hair augmentation, density, and product choice were also tools of "othering" within a Eurocentric aesthetic value system. The narratives suggested that men and women experience interpersonal rejections early in their development in both emotionally intimate (at home with family) and public settings (at school with teachers and classmates). Sadness was the most frequently reported emotional response to these rejections. These findings extend the current literature on the psychological significance of hair within Black lives and pleads for policies of hair protection at work, hair-based professional development for teachers in schools, hair-influenced educational curriculum for students, community-based programming in hair care settings, and family interventions during hair combing interactions. © 2020 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of mental health professionals who self-identify as having a mental illness by analyzing how they describe their experiences in their own words. Twelve therapists volunteered to be interviewed for a larger study of working professionals living with mental illness that focused on perceived prejudice and discrimination in the workplace, revealing versus concealing one’s mental illness on the job, and how having a mental illness impacts one’s identity as a professional. This article reports on how these themes relate to practicing psychotherapists who are typically careful about with whom they share their mental health information. The results highlight that expressions of prejudice toward people with mental illnesses were commonplace among these mental health professionals and may contribute to an inclination among therapists to reveal their mental health history selectively, if at all, on the job. When it comes to sharing with clients, therapists tended to be thoughtful and deliberate about self-disclosure, only using it when they believed it would be beneficial to the client rather than to themselves. Regardless of whether they shared with clients, most of the therapists emphasized that having direct experience with mental illness enhanced their capacity to empathize with their clients, although sometimes empathy could trigger their own symptoms. The implications of these results for psychotherapists are discussed, including how psychotherapists with mental illness should care for themselves and how psychotherapists without mental illness can be more sensitive to their colleagues. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Policy Relevance Statement—Mental health professionals are not invulnerable to mental health challenges. This study describes how therapists who self-identify as having a mental illness understand the impact of their illness on their job performance, make decisions surrounding revealing versus concealing their illness, and perceive negative attitudes toward themselves on the part of other mental health professionals in the work place. This study suggests a need for anti-stigma programs tailored for mental health professionals for the benefit of both their colleagues and their patients.

AB  - Purpose Research on professional identity formation has largely ignored how race, ethnicity, and the larger sociohistorical context work to shape medical students' professional identity. Researchers investigated how physician-trainees considered underrepresented in medicine (URM) negotiate their professional identity within the larger sociohistorical context that casts them in a negative light. Method In this qualitative study, 14 black/African American medical students were recruited from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and Emory University College of Medicine between September 2018 and April 2019. Using constructive grounded theory and Swann's model of identity negotiation, the authors analyzed interview data for how students negotiate their racial and professional identities within medical education. Results The results indicated that URM students were aware of the negative stereotypes ascribed to black individuals and the potential for the medical community to view them negatively. In response, students employed identity cues and strategies to bring the community's perceptions in line with how they perceived themselves - black and a physician. Specifically, students actively worked to integrate their racial and professional identities by "giving back" to the African American community. Community-initiated mentoring from non-URM physicians helped to reify students' hope that they could have a racialized professional identity. Conclusions Race, ethnicity, and the larger sociohistorical context is often overlooked in professional identity formation research, and this omission has resulted in an underappreciation of the challenges URM physicians' experience as they develop a professional identity. Within the context of this study, findings demonstrated that black/African American physicians negotiated the formation of professional identity within a challenging sociohistorical context, which should be given greater consideration in related research. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

AB  - This study argues a case for multiculturalism as a possible approach for addressing the complexities of societies such as the BRICS, taking Brazil as a case study. It contends that knowledge derived from such a study can benefit Social Studies and Humanities worldwide, particularly considering that cultural diversity has been increasingly present due to globalisation, internationalisation and growing mobility of groups of people, including refugees all over the world, requiring new epistemologies and narratives in research. The paper firstly analyses the concept of multiculturalism, discussing its perspectives from more liberal approaches up to more critical, postcolonial and decolonial perspectives that focus on the challenge of prejudices that operate in terms of control and denial of pluralism. It discusses the multicultural composition of the population of Brazil as a BRICS country, analysing its main geographical and population characteristics. The main focus of the paper is to delve in the ways that Brazilian educational policies have been trying to address both international standards and the valuing of cultural identities and equity-oriented approaches that are inclusive and multicultural. It particularly focuses on the National Plan for Education and of the recent project for higher education institutions (called "Future-se"). Finally, it concludes by pointing out tensions and possibilities of such Brazilian endeavours in the context of the BRICS countries. Such a study may be relevant comparatively, hopefully providing reflections for new epistemologies and the potential value of these for the Social Sciences and Humanities. © 2020 Ivenicki.

AB  - This study aimed at identifying motivations, risk behavior and social practices, comparing tattooed and non-tattooed women. 316 women (50% tattooed) were surveyed online, answering questions on sociodemographic data, social practices, motivations, and risk behavior. Data collection strategies included snow-balling, social networks, personal contact, and visits to tattoo parlors. The main results indicate that the majority of women express satisfaction with their physical appearance after getting tattooed, and wouldn't get the tattoo removed. Being tattooed correlated with risk behaviors such as casual sex with unknown people, alcohol and drug use, and psychopathology. The sample presented more similarities than differences between tattooed and non-tattooed groups, suggesting that growing popularization and social acceptance of tattooing has led to a decrease of the differences between the groups. Such results may inform future research and the production of informative materials aimed at demystifying negative stereotypes associated to tattoos. © 2020 Universidade Sao Francisco.

AB  - The paper explores how evangelicals from Cordoba, Argentina, perceive their social position, intergroup contact interactions, and the ways they seek to manage otherness, in a context of increasing visibility of religious and non-religious diversity. Based on autobiographical narratives by 23 respondents, we describe different social interactions with religious and non-religious "others" in work, militancy, educational, and social contexts. The perception of negative stereotypes towards evangelicals is extended, as several personal narratives of prejudices (isolation, harassment or animosity) toward them emerged. The strategies to manage these interactions depend on each social context and each person, and may involve compartmentalization, re-signified participation, or even the avoidance of religious diversity, among others. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

AB  - This paper considers the motivation and function of the UK’s hate-crime framework, offering a historically located interpretation. It discusses the development of legislation to combat discrimination-and prejudice-motivated harassment and offending before examining recent assessments of the UK’s approach. It then provides a cursory examination of the historical context in which the UK’s legislative and policy developments emerged. After exposing the limitations of the current UK response and framing this in a wider domestic and international context, the paper concludes by arguing that the UK’s evolving hate-crime policy framework currently remains partial and serves to obfuscate its social control objectives, along with the political anxieties related to the ideological and political threats and disorder that underpinned its development. The article concludes by arguing that the current framework has recently downgraded – and increasingly sidesteps – the need to address internal manifestations of illiberalism, including institutional discrimination, workforce representativeness, racial and religious disparity, and equal opportunities. © 2020 Manchester Metropolitan University.

AB  - As a product of Council of Europe's initiatives to promote intercultural dialogue, the Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters through Visual Media (AIEVM) was published as a tool to help learners reflect on their intercultural encounters. This study aims to investigate whether the AIEVM can be used as an educational tool for English language learners in order to foster their critical thinking skills in a higher education context. Fifteen students taking an Intercultural Communication course at a state university in Turkey participated in the study. For the purposes of the study, videos were used as the type of visual media during the pedagogical treatment which took four weeks. The videos were chosen among ones which had the theme of stereotyping and prejudice. After reflective classroom activities by using the videos, students were given reflective writing assignments based on the AIEVM. Data were collected from weekly reflective writing samples, field notes and an interview conducted at the end of the pedagogical intervention. Bloom's Revised Taxonomy was used to identify the categories of critical thinking found in the data. The study revealed that the students displayed higher-order cognitive skills at the Applying, Analysing and Evaluating levels of the taxonomy, while the Creating category was not addressed in the reflections. It is concluded that the AIEVM can be used as an effective educational tool to foster critical thinking skills by using videos in English language teaching. © 2020 JLLS and the Authors - Published by JLLS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to analyze the perception of workers and managers about the psychosocial care network in a medium-sized municipality in the inlands of the state of Minas Gerais. METHOD: qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study involving twelve participants from different points of the network. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed in the light of Pierre Bourdieu's framework of constructionist structuralism. RESULTS: the actions offered by the services were based on the perspectives of resocialization, user embracement, group and multiprofessional care, and on approaches to harm reduction, recreation and daily organization. These were configured as the network resources/capital. Tensions were identified in family embracement and in relationships between families and users, as well as in the prejudice towards people with mental disorders. Final considerations: the social agents were willing to contribute to processes of change in order to overcome the focus on specialties, the lack of training of some teams, lack of infrastructure and of some components, especially those related to leisure and community life.

Such stressors may increase pandemic-related and general health risks both directly and indirectly and increase the risk for both general and traumatic stress. These stressors and their historical and social contexts are discussed, and implications for clinicians are provided. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although the homoparental family is growing, it is still a target of prejudice in our society. This study aims to report research conducted with 8 education professionals whose goal was to know the meanings that education professionals attribute to the homoparental family and their children's experiences in the school context. The instrument used was the dialogic interview and the results show the subjects recognize the homoparental family as a legitimate family model, with skills to raise their children. However, most of them are prejudiced and don´t feel prepared to deal with students from such families, with the homophobic bullying they experience and the prejudice of parents and the community. Thus, they request training. The analysis and articulation between the speeches of the participants, social constructionism and gender show that such issues demonstrate a naturalistic heteronormative view of sexuality and family. This study concluded that the social construction's speeches promoted new meanings to sexuality, identity categories, social inclusion, family, and training. © 2020, Sociedad Interamericana de Psicologia.

AB  - The outbreak of Covid-19 has been highly racialised and stigmatised around the world based on the origin of the virus and its highly infectious nature. Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being ‘non-Indian’ with negative affiliation, or worse ‘unwanted Indians’, but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - COVID-19 is the relevant disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmitted via close contact between persons. On March 12th, 2020, WHO announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, in view of its worldwide escalation. As the pandemic disease explodes, a parallel outbreak of fear and worry is also spreading. We react to fear symbolically, by arbitrarily relating it to other objects and events through derived verbal relations, so language may alter the way we experience events and consequently affects how we are functionally or dysfunctionally oriented to the world around us. In this paper we will outline the different human learning processes connected to fear responding, from the simplest type to the more complex cognitive ones, approaching them from the point of view of contextual behavioral science, a modern form of behavioral thinking. We will outline a model of intervention to foster psychological flexibility and more functional value-based actions. We will argue that in a pandemic and in the post-pandemic phase it could be a key for adapting to new and changed circumstances. © Clinical Neuropsychiatry.

AB  - Endorsement being seen as a platform for presentation of traits and performances of a product, it draws an analogy with ‘invitation to offer’ with the product or service voicing their presence via celebrity personalities attracting attention. Though the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson remains the original precedent on manufacturer’s negligence and absence of any contractual obligations to the consumer making him responsible towards the ultimate beneficiary, the ratio and obiter should be analysed in sharing a look-alike obligation on endorsers for injury ensuing from use of such product or service. Since the debate of Nestles’ Maggi brand, there has been a look out at the existing liability regime for the celebrity endorsers of such products. In the wake of flooding consumables in the free competitive market, falsification of critical data, misleading and non-obvious statements and superficial promising results often prejudice consumers’ choice as well as preference, thereby affecting their rights to claim for healthy, consumer friendly products and income justified and habit of consumerism. Moreover, being a ‘ideal’ ‘God like’ and ‘larger than life’ figure to common man, personalities from entertainment, sports and other popular industry invite a stricter interpretation on their ‘responsibility quotient’ because of the edge over other professional advertisements in terms of greater credibility and trust. © 2020, World Informations Syndicate.

AB  - This research goes from the assumption that regional autonomy is interpreted domestically, not within the national framework. As a result it creates various problems in the autonomous region. Among these problems is intercultural communication. This study assumes that cultural differences have the potential to cause problems in intercultural communication. It is motivated by: First, the world view, cultural values, history, and social organization, shared by each ethnic group, influence closed and open intercultural communication in the context of returning to nagari, ethnicity and the application of adat basandi syarak, syarak basandi Kitabullah (ABS-SBK). Second, withdrawal, prejudice, ethnocentrism, stereotypes, social distance and discrimination are inhibiting factors of open communication between ethnic (ethnic of native Minang and ethnic of Javanese) in Lunang village in the era of regional autonomy. Third, ethnic of Minang immigrants appear as a cultural mediator in the midst of communication problems between ethnic of native Minang and ethnic of Javanese. Data source in this research is qualitative data. With the reason that the components of data sought include aspects of community life, namely what is said and done by the informants, then all components are read by ethnography method and analyzed by communication theory. Ethnographic methods are used to describe how ethnic groups differ cultures, and communicate in the era of regional autonomy. The conclusion of the research is that the difficulty of recognizing cultural differences, causing serious problems and threatening the effectiveness of intercultural communication. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that women who sell sex (women sex workers [WSWs]) consistently report high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. The present study explores multiple factors that may contribute to the variation in WSWs' experiences of posttraumatic stress symptoms, including workers' racial identity, experiences of discrimination and control over their working conditions, the site of selling sex, and their clients' perceived sexual entitlement and violence. The study sample consisted of 314 self-identified WSWs. Online invitations to participate in a 30-min survey were sent to WSWs in the United States and Canada who advertise their services online on sites such as Facebook, the Erotic Review, and Backpages. The hypothesized structure of associations between the variables was tested using structural equation modeling. The model accounted for 68% of the variation in the traumatic stress reported, with direct and indirect effects for workers' racial identity, the site where they sell sex, and experiences of discrimination, especially by police. Clients' violence, on the contrary, was indirectly associated with traumatic stress, as violent clients were also significantly more likely to be perceived as sexually entitled, which, in turn, was the strongest predictor of higher traumatic stress. © 2020 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.

AB  - Studies on racial and religious discriminations in Malaysia tend to be avoided. This is due to their sensitive nature, possibly becoming political ammu-nition, and individuals being accused of seditious intent. Much that is necessary to discuss discrimination in Malaysia remains unclear. It is not known to what extent contact between groups is undesirable especially as neighbors in Malaysia. This study examined ethnic differences and predictors of racial and religious discriminations among 1200 Malaysians (319 Chinese and 881 Malays). Discrimination was conceptualized through having the attitude of not wanting people of a different race or a different religion as neighbors. Ethnic differences in discri-minating against others were found to be significant. Malays showed higher means of not wanting neighbors of a different race or religion compared to Chinese. Demographic factors and beliefs reflecting conservatism were not good predictors, explaining only slight variances. However, a person who discriminates based on religion was consistently a predictor of exhibiting racial discrimination, and vice-versa, with approximately double the odds among Malays. The finding highlights a strong interplay between race and religion, suggesting that Chinese and Malays conflate the two together. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Research indicates that increasing cultural awareness in adolescents may improve their relationships with peers of a different race or ethnicity. Few studies to date examine methods for improving intergroup relations in juvenile detention facilities in which racial tension often leads to de facto segregation, bullying, and violence. Forty-one diverse youth in a juvenile detention facility participated in a pilot program designed to increase cultural awareness using a developmentally appropriate group intervention. This 3-week manualized program was administered on two separate occasions to two groups of male adolescents housed in a secure facility. The findings showed a significant increase in cultural awareness within the group who differed in terms of self-identified race but not within the group who endorsed similar racial identities. Recommendations stemming from this study are meant to spark further investigation of effective interventions for juvenile offenders, as well as to supplement the small body of research informing relations between youth of color within detention facilities. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - A qualitative case study was used in this study in order to determine the pre-school education adjustment problems of a Syrian child refugee who had fled from his homeland and took refuge in Turkey. The research participants were the child’s family, teachers, and the principal of the school where the child was educated at pre-school. For the purposes of the study, data were collected through interviews and analyzed by the qualitative content analysis method. According to study results, one of the important factors affecting the adaptation of the children to the school is the communication problem. Another factor is the fact that Syrian families do not have sufficient financial condition. Also, official procedures, though not directly affecting the child, can indirectly affect children through parent-teacher relationships. Another remarkable result is prejudices, which have been examined in three different dimensions as children, parents and teachers, and recommendations for solutions were presented. © 2020, Ankara University.

AB  - We examined, in different work organizations, how subordinates high in social dominance orientation (SDO; individual desire to sustain group-based hierarchies) and in need for cognitive closure (NFCC, an individual's epistemic motivation to avoid uncertainty) comply with harsh power tactics as means to sustain asymmetrical intergroup relationships. We studied the interaction between SDO and NFCC in two organizations that differentially endorse hierarchy-attenuating and hierarchy-enhancing legitimizing myths. We compared the condition of person-environment (P-E) misfit in which subordinates high in SDO work for a hierarchy-attenuating organization and the condition of P-E fit where subordinates high in SDO work for a hierarchy-enhancing organization. We recruited participants from a hierarchy attenuating organization (N = 174) and another hierarchy-enhancing organization (N = 112). The study's variables were measured through an anonymous self-report questionnaire. A three-way interaction analysis confirmed our hypothesis. The simple-slope analysis revealed that the association between the subordinates' SDO and harsh power tactics only occurs in the hierarchy-attenuating (vs. hierarchy enhancing) organization at the conditional level of high (vs. low) NFCC. Since high-NFCC subordinates search for the attainment of cognitive closure, they attempt to solve the uncertainty of the P-E misfit trough the compliance with harsh power tactics, according to their desire to maintain stable intergroup hierarchies (e.g., high SDO). © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - In order to bridge the psychological and physical divide between different groups, researchers have harnessed the positive elements of the Internet to improve intergroup contact. One new and effective Internet strategy is Electronic- or E-contact. Unlike other contact approaches, E-contact is an experimental intergroup intervention that uniquely accommodates Allport’s contact theory and recategorisation processes, to create a structured, cooperative, synchronous and goal-directed online text interaction between members from different groups. E-contact has been found to successfully improve intergroup relations between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland and Muslims and Catholics in Australia; and reduce bias against lesbian women and gay men, people with schizophrenia, Indigenous Australians, and transgender individuals. This paper discusses the unique engineering and advantages of E-contact interventions in comparison to existing contact strategies, identifies the theories that guide E-contact interventions, provides meta-analytic evidence of its effects, and discusses the strengths, limitations and future directions for E-contact research. © 2020, © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This research examined facework in Face Negotiation Theory (FNT) and its relation to conflict resolution in intercultural interactions between youth groups in Indonesia. Indonesia is a multiethnic society with a history of communalism. This study used a critical discourse analysis of interviews and works of literature on facework and forgiveness and friendship building between majority and minority cultures of Javanese and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) universitiy students in Solo, a city which is known to be the spirit of Javanese culture. The results showed that being able to forgive, as well as having the ability of self disclosure helps youths in establishing a friendship. This served as a foundation of a peace-building approach through FNT in creating harmony, understanding cultural differences and eliminating prejudice, especially in parties with cultural conflict history. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - The research aimed to study the situations that condition access and quality of health care to lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transvestites and transsexuals (LGBTT) in health services from an integrative review of national and international literature, whose sample of 41 papers was selec-ted in PubMed, Lilacs and SciELO databases from 2007 to 2018. Access and health issues of LGBTT people were discussed in three dimensions: rela-tional, concerning intersubjective relationships among users and professionals; organizational, concerning the organization of services and work processes; and contextual, which covers the effect of vulnerable situations enmeshed with social determinants on the conditions of satisfaction of health needs. The related data showed that LGBTT populations are the target of prejudice, violence, and discrimination, which, added to different social indicators, engender a context of vulnerabi-lities in access and healthcare. It is necessary to transform health institutions’ practices and social relationships. Otherwise, there is a risk of increa-singly warding off those populations from health services. © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva. All rights reserved.

AB  - Detainees enact a "self" that is faced with the prejudices and stereotypes of the crime for which that detainee was convicted. Of all inmates, sex offenders face the greatest risk of receiving social condemnation alongside their prison sentence. This empirical study worked with 32 male sex offenders over 18 years old that were housed in the "protected" unit of the Due Palazzi. The following analysis explores how these men are required to manage their "self," hetero-narrations, perception of everyday interactions in the protected unit, and conceptions about the rehabilitation path. Moreover, the detainees' view on the prison's strategic opportunities for promoting effective change in their condition and identity are also examined. Discourse analysis applied to an open answer questionnaire showed that, rather than facing the stigma assigned to them, the detainees tend to minimize the importance of storytelling and construct alternative biographies to share with other inmates. Managing narratives allows the sex offenders to distance themselves from the perceived threats of living with other detainees; however, it also prevents the re-signification of their offenses. As such, the rules of "secrecy" must be considered by both qualitative researchers who conduct studies in prisons and prison administrators who plan the housing and treatment of sex offenders. © 2020 Queensland University of Technology.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the role of local migrants in urban economic development. A qualitative case study approach was used to examine the characteristics and role of the social capital of migrants from Wamena in Jayapura, Indonesia. The data used in this study were collected through in-depth interviews and field observation as well as statistical data from the Central Statistics Agency of Jayapura. The results indicate that the social capital of migrants reconstructed cultural values through an intensification of multi-ethnic relations within the domestic economic system of urban areas. Wamena migrants contributed to the economic growth in urban areas because of the correlation between norms, beliefs and social networking as forms of local wisdom. Local wisdom was able to strengthen the internal and external social relations of the Wamena migrant community in various economic activities as coping and survival strategies. Specifically, the findings of this study offer an additional view to the conceptual framework of sustainable livelihoods from Robert Chambers and Gordon Conway (1991), namely that local wisdom integrated with forms of social capital can be utilized to create sustainable livelihoods. Thus, this study shows that the local migrants from Wamena have formed a community-based economic system integrated with local wisdom to maintain a livelihood in urban areas, in this case Jayapura, Indonesia. © 2020 ITB Institute for Research and Community Services.

AB  - In this article, I describe how psychologists who work with language—in particular, naturally occurring social interaction—can develop evidence-based communication training for professionals. I start by situating my research in discursive psychology and conversation analysis and explaining some points of (dis)connection between mainstream and qualitative/critical psychology that nevertheless enable practical application and impact. I explain how I developed the Conversation Analytic Role-Play Method (CARM), which analyzes interaction “in the wild” in diverse institutional settings to explore what constitutes effective practice. Drawing on police crisis negotiation and community mediation intake telephone calls, I show how psychological matters (e.g., identity, prejudice) are relevant to and affect the progress and outcome of encounters. I explain how these data and findings, rather than hypothetical cases and simulations, have been used in workshops with practitioners. Overall, the article makes the case for discursive psychology and conversation analysis to provide rigorous, empirically grounded communication training with integrity.

AB  - Issue: Medical education has “muddy zones of practice,” areas of complexity and uncertainty that frustrate the achievement of our intended educational outcomes. Slowing down to consider context and reflect on practice are now seen as essential to medical education as we are called upon to examine carefully what we are doing to care for learners and improve their performance, professionalism, and well-being. Philosophy can be seen as the fundamental approach to pausing at times of complexity and uncertainty to ask basic questions about seemingly obvious practices so that we can see (and do) things in new ways. Evidence: Philosophy and medical education have long been related; many of our basic concepts can be traced to philosophical ideas. Philosophy is a problem-creation approach, and its method is analysis; it is a constant process of shifting frames and turning into objects of analysis the lenses through which we see the world. However, philosophy is not about constant questioning for the sake of questioning. Progression in medical education practice involves recognizing when to switch from a philosophical to a practical perspective, and when to switch back. Implications: In medical education, a philosophical approach empowers us to “slow down when we should,” thereby engaging us more directly with our subjects of study, revealing our assumptions, and helping us address vexing problems from a new angle. Doing philosophy involves thinking like a beginner, getting back to basics, and disrupting frames of reference. Being philosophical is about wonder and intense, childlike curiosity, human qualities we all share. Taking a philosophical approach to medical education need not be an unguided endeavor, but can be a dialog through which medical educators and philosophers learn together. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The processes of trasnationalism, especially large-scale migration from Eastern Europe (e.g. Poland, the Baltics, and the Balkans) are visible in the creation of new realities through the representation of cultural differences and distinctive social experiences enacted in diasporas. The aim of this article is to show how social ties and resources are used by migrants to cope with challenges of transnational belonging from grass-roots level understanding of the complexities of intra-and inter-ethnic relations enacted by the last two waves of the Lithuanian immigration in the USA, based on the fieldwork conducted in Chicago in 2002–2003, 2007, and 2013. Social belonging of the forced (end of WWII refugees) wave of migration was challenged by the political subjectivity applied to any immigrant group, including exiles from communism, resisting the assimilation into the melting pot politics dominant in America. The economic wave of post-socialist immigrants of the 1990s was challenged by the uncertainty and precarity of their lives and jobs, especially in terms of their legal status, command of the official language, and professional skills. Homeland nationalism and cultural citizenship are addressed in this article as strategies of coping with the aforementioned uncertainties. Homeland nationalism of the forced migration wave along with the practices of ethnification was marked by the moral imperative of ‘to cherish the home country’ and helped to withstand the ‘melting pot’ America. Cultural citizenship of the labor migrants appears as moral economy brought from the homeland and used for inter-ethnic networking of immigrants from the Eastern European region as compartmentalized lifestyle to cope with marginalization, especially of those without papers. © 2020, FB and Media Group of Estonian Literary Museum.

AB  - Communities living in Latin American slums present more vulnerability of diseases, high rates of infant mortality, and low life expectancy, generally as a result of the high levels of soil contamination. Furthermore, in our case study of the 4th District of Porto Alegre, the community depends on recycling materials from waste for their livelihood. In consequence, the public spaces are used as a garbage dump, accentuating health problems and making social interactions difficult. In this context, our applied research group aims to construct social spaces, improving the inhabitants’ quality of life through participative methodologies that encourage the use of the public spaces of these districts without prejudice of the economic system based on garbage. Our strategy relies on the actions and interactions of humans and the place in sub developed urban areas. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose Microaggressions are subtle verbal or nonverbal everyday behaviors that arise from unconscious bias, covert prejudice, or hostility. They may contribute to the persistent disparities faced by women in medicine. In this study, the authors sough to identify common microaggressions experienced by women faculty in medicin and to determine if specific demographic characteristics affect the reported frequencies of these microaggressions. Method The authors used chain referral sampling to collect real-life anecdotes about microaggressions from women faculty across the nation. Thirty-four unique experiences from those reported were identified and scripted then reenacted using professional actors to create 34 videos of the real-life microaggressions and 34 corresponding fictional “control” versions of the same situations. The videos, presented in a random order, were evaluated by faculty from 4 academic medical centers from 2016 to 2018. Results A total of 124 faculty (79 women, 45 men) participated. Women reported higher frequencies of microaggressions than men in 33 of the 34 videos depicting microaggressions (P value range: < .001 to .042, area under the curve range: 0.60–0.69). No such differences were seen with the control videos. Women identified 21 microaggressions as occurring frequently. No significant differences were found with respect to participants’ age, race/ ethnicity, academic rank, or years in medicine. Post hoc analyses showed that the microaggressions fell into 6 themes: encountering sexism, encountering pregnancy- and child care–related bias, having abilities underestimated, encountering sexually inappropriate comments, being relegated to mundane tasks, and feeling excluded/marginalized. Conclusions Privilege is often invisible to those who have it, whereas bias and discrimination are readily apparent to those who experience it. Knowledge of common microaggressions will allow for targeted individual, interpersonal, and institutional solutions to mitigate disparities in medicine.

AB  - With the lack of «gay» social spaces, their community has gone through integration but also fragmentation processes; the need to relate safely still emerges among its members. This study aims to understand whether the relationships between loneliness and relational motives towards People-Nearby Applications (PNAs) uses are moderated by individuals' sexual orientation. An online questionnaire including the Cyber Relationships Motives Scale and the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults - short version was administered to 618 PNAs users. No significant differences emerged between heterosexual people and people from sexual minorities except for the relationship between Social Loneliness and PNAs use to search for love, which emerged as positive for the first group and negative for the latter. These results suggest that nowadays the loneliness characterizing how people live local communities has the same role for both heterosexual people and sexual minorities, but also that the latter could still perceive stigma and prejudices when it comes to the search of romantic partners; it seems like PNAs have the role of adaptive answer to the troubles in meeting new people offline for them. © 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

AB  - The reclamation of slurs raises a host of important questions. Some are linguistic: What are the linguistic conventions governing the slur post-reclamation and how are they related to the conventions governing it pre-reclamation? What mechanisms engender the shift? Others bend toward the social: Why do a slur's targets have a special privilege in initiating its reclamation? Is there a systematic explanation why prohibitions on out-group use of reclaimed slurs vary from slur to slur? And how does reclamation contribute to shaping social identities and reversing oppressive social norms and stigma? Most analyses of slur reclamation advance a single model to answer these questions. The author argues that there are different varieties of reclamation. Two predominate, what she calls pride reclamation and insular reclamation. While many features unite pride and insular reclamation, they differ with respect to the purpose of the reclamatory act, the linguistic mechanisms reclaimers employ to execute the linguistic change, and the social and grammatical roles of the reclaimed slur. By distinguishing these two types of reclamation and offering a fine-grained characterization of their properties, the author argues that we gain deeper insight into the reasons why slurs may in principle only be ignited by the target group and why pride- but not insular-reclaimed slurs become available for use by out-group members. © 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - In the heated media debate on Muslims and Islam, the role of community representatives is understudied. This article will first use original research see to what extent Muslims get the chance to speak out in newspapers in Western Europe, and then demonstrate through findings from interviews how representatives of Muslim organisations operate in the media. We build on Kerstin Rosenow-Williams's perspectives in combining two features, namely 1) the internal and external role of representatives of Muslim organisations, and 2) the active-passive dimension of responses to prejudice and stigmatisation as suggested in social psychology, and will distinguish three patterns: protest, adaptation and decoupling. Throughout the article, we zoom in on the remarkable dissimilarity between the UK and Germany. The British case shows a larger Muslim presence in the newspapers and the tendency of Muslim representatives to use a protest strategy, while the German case shows a lack of Muslim actors in the newspapers and a tendency of Muslim representatives to use an adaptation strategy.

AB  - Prior evidence suggests that White participants who repeatedly approach images of Black people and avoid images of White people can exhibit a reduction in implicit racial bias (Kawakami, Phills, Steele, & Dovidio, 2007). In contrast, a recent study by Van Dessel, De Houwer, Gast, and Smith (2015) showed that mere instructions to perform approach-avoidance training in an upcoming phase produces a similar change in implicit evaluations of unfamiliar but not familiar social groups. We report 4 experiments that examined the replicability and generalizability of these findings for well-known social groups. Experiment 1 was a replication of the study by Kawakami et al. (2007) in a different domain (i.e., Flemish students’ bias toward Turkish people) showing relatively weak evidence for small approach-avoidance training effects on implicit evaluations and explicit liking ratings. Experiment 2 replicated the finding of Van Dessel et al. (2015) that approach-avoidance instructions do not influence implicit evaluations of social out-groups and found no instruction effects even when participants first completed training with nonsocial stimuli. Experiment 3 established the presence of a small approach-avoidance training effect on implicit (but not explicit evaluations) in a large online sample. Experiment 4 directly compared approach-avoidance training and instruction effects, corroborating (a) the effect of training on implicit evaluations which was both small and subject to boundary conditions and (b) the absence of such an effect of instructions. There were again no effects on explicit evaluations. Whereas the current findings provide supportive evidence for training-based approach-avoidance effects (on Implicit Association Test [IAT] scores: meta-analytic effect size current experiments: d = 0.18, Bayes Factor = 65.22; current and prior experiments: d = 0.23, Bayes Factor = 4404.42) and evidence for the absence of instruction-based effects (Bayes Factors < 0.19), they also illustrate that there is still much uncertainty regarding the boundary conditions of these effects and the underlying mental processes.

AB  - The paper deals with the applicability of Law 11,645/2008, which determines the inclusion of Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture in the Basic Education curricula, preferably in the areas of Art education and Brazilian literature and history. The objective is to investigate the applicability of this law in relation to the obligation of teaching Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture, in the teaching practices of high school history teachers. A qualitative approach was used and the semi-structured interview was used as a technique. The teachers, historians interviewed, work in state public schools in a city in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. A reflection was made about the processes of training and qualification of these teachers and the impacts of this law on their teaching practices. Teachers recognize the importance of this legislation, but do not consider it sufficient to bring about effective changes in schools, in order to overcome prejudices rooted in social practices strongly present in our society. The requirement for Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous History and Culture content in the referred law does not guarantee its applicability in the teaching of History, given the gaps identified in the initial and continuing education processes of the teachers surveyed. It is vital that history teachers resort in their teaching practices to value the memory of the various ethnic groups that make up our society as an instrument of consolidation of citizenship and democracy, which demands processes of teacher education in universities and in the teacher's practice spaces. © 2020 Emerson de Pietri.

AB  - The social psychology of intergroup relations has emerged largely from studies of how one group of people (e.g., whites) think and feel about another (e.g., blacks).  By reducing the social world to binary categories, this approach has provided an effective and efficient methodological framework. However, it has also obscured important features of social relations in historically divided societies. This paper highlights the importance of investigating intergroup relationships involving more than two groups and of exploring not only their psychological but also their political significance. Exemplifying this argument, we discuss the conditions under which members of disadvantaged groups either dissolve into internecine competition or unite to challenge the status quo, highlighting the role of complex forms of social comparison, identification, contact, and third-party support for collective action. Binary conceptualizations of intergroup relations, we conclude, are the product of specific sociohistorical practices rather than a natural starting point for psychological research. © 2020, © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - Purpose Identify how higher Body Mass Index (BMI) and weight discrimination are associated with romantic relationship formation and termination in young adults, and if the association was consistent for males and females. Methods First-year students (N = 1096) at entry to university (Time 1) provided BMI and self-reports of weight discrimination and romantic relationship status (in a relationship vs single); 550 were successfully resampled four months later (Time 2). Logistic generalized estimating equations (GEEs) examined if Time 1 relationship status was predicted by BMI and weight discrimination. Logistic GEEs were used to determine if Time 1 BMI and weight discrimination predicted Time 2 relationship status for the strata of students in, and out, of a relationship at Time 1. Results At baseline, students were less likely to be in a relationship if they had a higher BMI (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.92, 0.96) or reported weight discrimination (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.90). When stratified by gender, the association between higher BMI and weight discrimination with relationship status was only observed for females. Longitudinally, a BMI-based selection effect was observed for romantic relationship formation, but not termination. Of the students who were single at Time 1, each one unit higher baseline BMI decreased the odds of the student transitioning to a relationship by 9% at Time 2 (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85, 0.96). When stratified by gender the association of higher BMI decreased odds of relationship formation was only significant for females. No weight discrimination differences for selection in or out of a romantic relationship were observed. Conclusions These findings suggest a weight-related selection effect for romantic relationship initiation, but not termination, in young female adults with lower BMIs. Weight discrimination was not associated with romantic relationship initiation or termination in this sample. © 2020 van Woerden et al.

AB  - The prolific growth of social media in recent years has provided new forums which allow engagement in local town discussions; particularly via community Facebook groups. This study seeks to understand the role of community Facebook groups in a regional town in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia; particularly how they are used to portray youth, and their relevance to a grassroots youth justice reinvestment process. This research arose due to direct concern from a community working group. Seventeen semi-structured interviews, with 18 participants, were conducted with service providers in Katherine, NT. The data was then inductively thematically analyzed, resulting in six themes: staying informed in a regional context; vilifying youth and combating this; racism; impact on youth; tensions in positioning youth: right versus left; and adopting a strengths-based approach to youth. Community Facebook groups were noted as an important factor for staying informed in a remote context. As a key medium within the town, Facebook groups should be considered a source of community discussion and an appropriate avenue to influence community opinion. The racialization of community discussions about “problem youth” indicates a segregation issue in the town, which has been noted for many years. Community education and the promotion of the youth justice work currently being implemented in the town were considered key in changing mindsets and ultimately behaviors. Importantly, research and community development programs alike should consider the community Facebook group as a medium for positive social action. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Perceptions of economic and security threats have recently led to a change in priorities in the Western world, placing the protection of one’s own group well-being and safety over the importance attached to the defense of individual rights. Moreover, various studies have shown that such a reversal in priorities is associated with the rise of cold attitudes towards immigrants and minorities. The aim of the present research is to analyze the association between materialistic values and feelings of coldness towards various social groups, by considering the mediation effect of intergroup indifference, defined as being uncaring in regard to arbitrary policies affecting other social groups. The results supported the hypothesis. Materialistic values are indeed positively correlated with cold attitudes towards social groups, and this relationship is fully mediated by intergroup indifference. The results show that the study of intergroup dynamics should consider the role of intergroup indifference as it identifies a strategy of de-responsibilization that may be implemented blamelessly. © 2020, © 2020 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the ability to and interest in work, people with disabilities are employed at significantly lower rates than nondisabled people. Employment disparities highlight persistent social and cultural stereotypes that equate disability with unemployability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between employment of people with disabilities and disability prejudice in the United States. This study had the following research question: how does disability prejudice impact state disability employment rates? METHODS: To explore these questions, we used secondary data about state disability employment (2016), as well as disability prejudice data from 270,000 nondisabled people residing in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed states with higher disability prejudice scores have lower disability employment rates, suggesting employment disparities are intertwined with disability prejudice. CONCLUSIONS: Cultures and systems must be rid of harmful disability stereotypes to ensure people with disabilities can truly partake in their human and civil rights. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Introduction. Medical care in geriatrics has its own specificity, and in order to build a successful doctor-patient relationship it is important while studying medicine to learn some functioning aspects of this age group. Objective. The aim of this study is to explore and describe the role of emotional intelligence in the attitudes of medical students towards elderly patients, taking into account their the place of residence. The place of residence has an impact on social relations and socialization, which could effect with disparities in behaviour towards elderly patients.� Materials and method. Medical University of Lublin students from rural (N=71; M=23.44 SD=1.80) and urban (N=87; M=23.34; SD=1.38) areas took part in the study. Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE) and Attitude Towards Elderly Patients Questionnaire (ATEP) were used. Results. There are statistically significant differences between medical students from rural and urban areas in their attitude towards elderly patients (p=0.001), but no differences were observed between rural and urban residents in terms of emotional intelligence (general result, action factor and cognitive factor). Positive correlations were observed between action factor (r=0.322), cognitive factor (r=0.311) and general INTE result (r=0.358) and attitude towards elderly patients in the group of medical students from rural area.� Conclusions. Medical students from rural areas are characterized by a more positive attitude towards elderly patients than medical students from urban areas. The predictors of attitudes towards elderly patients are the cognitive factor of emotional intelligence and the place of residence of medical students. The results give the opportunity to design a well-developed programme of a geriatric course which could be matched to the personal predispositions of students. © 2020, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

AB  - This paper explores women's activism and political engagement in contemporary Pakistan. In this exploration with self-identified liberal and conservative groups of women, emerged their experiences and narratives about Feminism and Nationalism with a common moderator being religious affiliations. In this qualitative and phenomenological exploration, the informants belonged to various self-identified liberal and conservative women-led organizations. To this end, 20 women (age-range 23-48 years) were interviewed. Results indicated that gender roles and feminism were seen very differently between the two groups; gender and national identity were closely associated with Islamic values and there was a negative association between nationalism and feminist ideology. Women from liberal organizations, mostly feminists, emphasized pro-public-sphere engagement of women, rebelling against religious fundamentalism. On the contrary, many self-reported conservative women proclaimed nationalist, anti-feminists (they did not identify as Islamic feminists) and pro-private-sphere engagement of women. Many of the liberal informants complained about Pakistan's misogynistic society and hurdles they faced in demanding equal opportunities for women. This research has implications for gender equality and female identity in the context of nationalism, women's mobility and entitlement to the public sphere. The study also has applied significance for prejudices and stereotypes that make it difficult for women, to break away from fixed categories of gender role expectations. This paper informs academics and practitioners on socially and politically engaged Pakistani women's views regarding these narratives. The study concluded that women's activism is influenced by their religious views and their religious interpretation of feminism and nationalism in Pakistani society. © 2020 Gulnaz Anjum, published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the way AIDS is configured in the eyes of Indigenous and non- Indigenous women. Method: A descriptive study implementing a mixed approach, conducted in three indigenous villages and in a surrounding municipality. A semistructured interview script was used, with identification data and questions related to the disease perception, the way of seeing and feeling AIDS. The corpus was processed by IRaMuTeQ software and analyzed by Descending Hierarchical Classification, Content Analysis and Word Cloud. Results: A total of 164 Potiguara indigenous women and 386 non-Indigenous women participated. Three classes were formed: "AIDS and its repercussions", "Social aspects, spirituality and attributed feelings" and "Transmission modes". There was a better understanding of the etiology, treatment and AIDS transmission modes among non- Indigenous women, while the content mainly surrounds negative elements such as death, fear, sadness and prejudice among Indigenous women. Conclusion: The knowledge produced in interactions were formed according to the social context and gain its own significance. Such considerations may contribute to the direction of strategic HIV/AIDS control policies focusing on ethnic/cultural specificities. © 2020.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This qualitative study examined the racist and sexist experiences of doctoral women of color in the academy. Background Doctoral women of color (e.g., Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Latina Americans, and Native Americans) continue to experience racism and sexism in academic spaces. While few studies have explored the experiences of doctoral students of color and doctoral women of color, with a larger emphasis on how they respond to racism, our study sought to further the knowledge and discourse surrounding the intersectionality of racism and sexism in academic contexts by examining the intersectionality of race and gender systems that impact the lived realities of doctoral women of color as women and people of color. Methodology This qualitative study employed multiracial feminism and Mellor's taxonomy of coping styles as theoretical foundations to explore and understand how doctoral women of color experience and navigate racist and sexist incidents. Contribution The study contributes to research in various areas: (1) it expands our understanding of how doctoral women of color experience racism and sexism, (2) it deepens our perspective about the strategies and methods that they employ to negotiate and overcome these experiences, which can directly inform efforts to support and retain doctoral and other students of color, and (3) it encourages scholars to examine the experiences of doctoral women of color from an anti-deficit approach that acknowledges the social networks, skills, and knowledge that doctoral women of color rely on to disrupt and persist in inequitable contexts as they pursue academic success. Findings Our findings contribute a classification system that incorporates experiences of doctoral women of color with racism and sexism. Categories in this classification include covert, overt, and physical and material experiences. Our findings also present a classification system that represents navigational strategies of doctoral women of color, or the ways they respond to and overcome racist and sexist experiences. Categories in this classification include defensive, controlled, and direct strategies. Recommendations First, our findings suggest a critical need for administrators and educators to unfor Practitioners derstand the experiences of women of color and recognize the impact these experiences have on their persistence and success in college. Research on doctoral women of color is limited and very little is known about the entirety of their experiences in graduate programs. This study addresses this gap by exploring how doctoral women of color persist despite the intersectionality of racist and sexist alienation and marginalization. It is important that faculty and staff engage in culturally relevant education and training in order to better understand how to support doctoral women of color as they face these situations. We need more educators who engage in culturally relevant and responsive practices and pedagogy that seek to include their students' whole identities and leverage these identities in the classroom. Additionally, more educators need to be trained in ways to recognize and address racist and sexist incidents in their classrooms and dismantle systems of oppression rather than reinforce them. Specifically, we need to better equip educators to recognize the hard-to-distinguish sexist incidents, which, as our participants suggested, are well concealed within the fabric of our gendered and sexualized society. Second, this study can benefit those in program and resource development to create effective programming and strategies to engage these acts of resilience that enable women of color to succeed in graduate school. Rather than approaching the support and development of doctoral women of color from a deficit perspective of assisting them through challenges, it is more important to fully-engage with these students to recognize what coping strategies they have used that can better inform successful retention programs. Furthermore, mentorship from faculty was highlighted as an important means for participants to address and cope with their negative experiences. Thus, more mentoring relationships between faculty and the student and across student peer groups should be intentionally engaged. This is a system of support also noted in extant literature. As part of the doctoral socialization process, mentoring has many benefits for doctoral students. Specifically, for doctoral women of color, mentoring relationships can be a critical tool for supporting them in managing negative experiences, especially considering that it can minimize feelings of loneliness and isolation. Recommendations Our research contributes to the literature with emphasis on the ways in which for Researchers doctoral women of color respond to and cope with racism and sexism. Women in this study recount racist and sexist experiences and describe their decision-making processes about how and whether to respond. There were specific reasons that shaped their responses and coping strategies, which highlight awareness and confidence in their individual abilities. The study's findings also contribute to and expand Mellor's taxonomy, specifically the incorporation of sexism as a system inherently interlocked with racism. Current literature on doctoral women of color mainly highlights their experience with racism; this gap reinforces our contribution to the literature, specifically, in illuminating predetermined societal roles and expectations for doctoral women of color in academia. Most importantly, our research highlights the assets and agency that doctoral women of color mobilize in the face of racism and sexism. These assets include long-term goals and aspirations, awareness of interlocking systems of oppression shaping their experience in academic environments, commitment to empowering their communities through education, and the support they find within their personal and academic networks. These assets and agency serve as foundation to challenge longstanding deficit perspectives on doctoral women of color in academic spaces and for faculty and program administrators to consider when developing support services. Impact on Society Our findings encourage faculty, program administrators, and researchers to pay attention to racist and sexist issues as intersecting oppressions rather than distinct manifestations of prejudice to be confronted separately. Our findings also highlight the assets doctoral women of color rely on to overcome oppression and marginalization including their long-term goals and aspirations, awareness of interlocking systems of oppression shaping their experience in academic, commitment to empowering their communities through education, and the support they find within their personal and academic networks. Our hope is that this work encourages systems of higher education to create tangible ways to support doctoral women of color as they grapple with the multiple systems of domination that threaten their success in education, which is intertwined with success in other aspects of society. Future Research Lastly, future research may explore how the matrix of domination mediates responses of doctoral women of color to racism and sexism. This philosophical inclination is linked to our decision to use Mellor's taxonomy of coping styles as an introductory framework for our work in understanding navigational strategies. To that end, we argue that the taxonomy as it stands characterizes participants' responses based on their immediate approach to incidents. This framing fails to include the timing someone might need to process and decide to how to respond. Mellor's taxonomy positions participants who do not choose to respond immediately as compliant and acquiescent to racialized spaces and events. By doing so, we run the risk of oversimplifying and essentializing the complex processes individuals faced with racism and sexism undertake. At the same time, future research can examine the connection between responses or coping styles and ways that participants are internally transformed in their abilities and desires to address future incidents. There is an inordinate amount of focus on how individuals interact with oppressive incidents and yet very little is known about the ways that these interactions shape future responses. Additionally, the ways that doctoral women of color navigate situations outside the academy is not explored. For example, some of our participants shared how racist and sexist encounters empowered them or inspired them to address other incidents and to interact with family and community members. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effect of a novel antistigma intervention curriculum (ASIC) in reducing stigma toward psychiatry among medical students. Methods: Medical students from 8 hospitals in central Israel were divided into intervention (n = 57) and control (n = 163) arms. The students completed the 30-item Attitudes Toward Psychiatry (ATP-30) and the Attitudes Toward Mental Illness (AMI) scales at psychiatry rotation onset and conclusion. The ASIC was designed to target prejudices and stigma through direct informal encounters with people with serious mental illness (SMI) during periods of remission and recovery. Supervised small-group discussions followed those encounters to facilitate processing of thoughts and emotions that ensued and to discuss salient topics in psychiatry. The study was conducted between November 2017 and July 2018. Results: Significant between-group differences were found at endpoint for attitudes toward psychiatry and psychiatric patients (P < .001). Although changing attitudes toward psychiatry as a career choice was not part of the ASIC, a significant between-group difference emerged by endpoint (P < .001). Conclusions: Implementation of an ASIC that includes contact with individuals with lived SMI experience followed by supervised small-group discussions is effective in reducing stigma in medical students’ perceptions of people with mental illness and psychiatry. Further evaluation is warranted with regard to the long-term destigmatizing effects of an ASIC. © 2020 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Previous research shows that the first year of a school counsellor's career is one of the most critical stages. However, despite this importance, there is a limited number of studies that examine what novice school counsellors experience during their first year. The primary purpose of this qualitative study is to examine in detail the common experiences of novice school counsellors who have worked the first year of their professional career and to explore comprehensive themes regarding these experiences. Following a purposive sampling strategy, 33 school counsellors who started their profession in 19 different cities of Turkey were interviewed. As a result of the thematic analysis, five major themes emerged describing the first-year experiences of school counsellors: 'Introduction', 'Fighting against Prejudices', 'Organising Counselling Service Room', 'Incongruence between Training and Work Definitions', and 'Longing for College Years'. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Ageism is the most prevalent form of prejudice and is experienced by both older and younger people. Little is known about whether these experiences are interdependent or have common origins. We analyze data from 8,117 older (aged 70 and over) and 11,647 younger respondents (15-29 years) in representative samples from 29 countries in the European Social Survey. Using multilevel structural equation modeling, we test the hypothesis that older people are less likely, and younger people more likely, to suffer age discrimination if they live in a country with stronger structural support for older people. We also test the hypothesis that although stronger social norm against age discrimination reduce age discrimination suffered by older people it does not inhibit discrimination against younger people. These hypotheses are supported, and the results underline the neglected problem of ageism toward youth. Findings highlight that strategies for reducing age prejudice must address ageism as a multigenerational challenge, requiring attention to intergenerational cohesion and resource distribution between ages. © 2020 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Many government schemes were unsuccessful because lack of proper feedback on the ongoing schemes, where billion dollars investment is going to be in vain. Sentiment analysis is one of best approach to analyse opinions of the peoples on various government schemes. Sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques emerged to analyse huge social media corpora to track people's views on government policies, products and services. Sentiment analysis process consists of various phases which include data discovery, data collection, data pre-processing, and data analysis. Stemming is a process to generate the morphemes in natural language sentences for various applications such as sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and domain analysis. The stemming process involved two major errors, which are over-stemming and under-stemming errors. Most of sentiment analysis natural languages processing applications used Lancaster and Porter stemming algorithms where more than one word inflected into same morpheme, which causes the etymology behaviour of the stemming word and prone to classify the tweets false positives and false negative. The proposed un-prejudice light stemming algorithm prevent etymology behaviour of morpheme and sustain its meaning during stemming process by selecting a word which has maximum number of synonyms in lexical database.

AB  - Anxiety is an unpleasant, yet highly adaptive, aspect of human life. When coupled with the presence of specific situational threat cues, anxiety can promote functional threat-mitigating responses. Two experiments examined associations between anxiety and psychological responses that can reduce the threat of infectious pathogens. In each study, state anxiety was associated with heightened aversion toward possible sources of infectious disease (Study 1) and with prejudice toward a group heuristically associated with disease (Study 2), but only when the presence of situational pathogen cues was primed experimentally. State anxiety was unrelated to those outcomes in non-pathogen control priming conditions. These results highlight the joint roles that anxiety and situational pathogen cues may play in the avoidance of pathogens. At a broader level, findings provide insight into the processes by which general feelings of anxiety can promote functionally specific threat-management strategies. © 2020 Guilford Publications, Inc.

AB  - This contribution in three parts analyses for the first time Ion Pillat’s Buddhist poetry of his debut volume (Visări budiste [Buddhist Reveries] from Visări păgâne [Pagan Reveries], (Bucharest: Minerva – Institut de Arte Grafice și Editură, 1912) compared against plausible European and Asian religious and literary sources, contexts, and significance, in order to palliate the callous non-sense of some literary critics and the cultural prejudice inflicted by some scholars of religion. The five poems – A Buddhist Prayer (a title subsequently changed to A Prayer to the Buddha), Samsara [saṃsāra], Towards Nirvana, Karman and A Hymn of Worship – are illustrative of the wider topics and literary moves of an ‘Asian Renaissance’, and highlight the Buddhist legacy of Eugène Burnouf (1801-1852), a professor of the Collège de France who would become the founding father of modern Buddhist Studies worldwide and whose Magna Carta of Buddhist Studies would also have a Romanian echo, from Odobescu (who moreover frequented his classes) to Eminescu (who authored more and better Buddhist cantos) or Georgian (the first to critically edit Sanskrit texts) to young Pillat, a schoolboy, then student in Paris since 1905, to become the first translator into Romanian of another pupil of Sanskrit India in Paris and Harvard in 1910-1914, T.

AB  - Recent research in the social sciences suggests a methodological paradox as scholars work to make sense of the contemporary relationship between masculinity and homophobia. Representative surveys consistently find dramatically decreasing levels of sexual prejudice among all groups, among men and young men in particular. Qualitative scholarship, however, continues to find that enactments of homophobia remain integral components of contemporary masculine identities. In this article, we make sense of this shift and apparent methodological inconsistency. We do not question which measure is best. Instead, we argue for a need to understand the ways that gendered sexual prejudice transforms in ways that allow the relationship between masculinity and homophobia to endure—sometimes even when it appears to be in decline. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Does seeing Spanish-language news in the media change the racial and political attitudes of Whites and Spanish-speaking Latinos? We examine the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish, respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking Latino voters. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Children of immigrants are at risk of underachieving in school with long-lasting consequences for future life-chances. Our research contextualises the achievement gap by examining minority acculturation experiences in daily intergroup contact across different intergroup contexts. Acculturation researchers often find an adaptive advantage for minority youth with an integration-orientation (combining both cultures). But findings from Europe are inconclusive. Looking beyond individual differences in acculturation-orientations, this review shifts focus to the intergroup context of minority acculturation and achievement. We discuss longitudinal, multi-group, multi-level and experimental evidence of the up- and downsides of integration for minority inclusion and success in European societies. Our studies show that both (1) intergroup contact experiences and (2) intergroup ideologies affect achievement–either directly or through the interplay of (3) acculturation-norms, defined as shared views on acculturation in social groups, with individual acculturation-orientations. The findings suggest how schools can reduce achievement gaps through improving intergroup relations. © 2020, © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to describe drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) notifications in Brazil. METHODS: this is a descriptive study of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of DR-TB notifications in 2014 on SITETB and TBWeb, these being information systems on which cases involving special treatment regimens are registered. RESULTS: there were 1,574 cases, 94.8% of which had the pulmonary form, 27.6% involved primary resistance, and 50.9% were multidrug-resistant; 70.6% of cases were male, 87.0% were between 20 and 59 years old, 60.9% were of Afro-Brazilian, and 68.0% had less than 8 years of schooling; as for comorbidities, 13.1% of patients had AIDS, 11.3% had diabetes, 25.8% made harmful use of alcohol, 21.0% were illegal drugs users, and 22.2% were tobacco users. CONCLUSION: the majority of DR-TB notifications were related to men, young people, Afro-Brazilian and people with low levels of education; there was a high percentage of primary resistance, as well as multidrug-resistance and comorbidities, with emphasis on substance use.

AB  - Early modern ornament might profitably be considered as a set of systems, each with its own rules. It signaled wealth and status. It offered pleasure and prompted curiosity. It cut across the apparent divide between the vernacular and the classicizing. It was relational, understood in the context of a given subject but not necessarily subservient to it. The notion of ornament as essentially supplemental and the prejudice against ornamental excess are both children of the late eighteenth century. Both ideas depend on a post-Enlightenment conviction of the work of art as an autonomous, aesthetically self-sufficient object, an idea not fully formed in the early modern era.

AB  - Bilingual children have been shown to differ from monolingual children in several domains of human cognition. Comparatively few studies have investigated social-interactional processes in bilingual populations. Here, we investigated whether monolingual and bilingual children demonstrate similar susceptibility to an aspect of social functioning with broad societal reach: racial bias. We measured both implicit and explicit biases against African race individuals in 2 groups of monolingual preschoolers (native speakers of English or Chinese) and in 2 groups of English-Chinese bilingual preschoolers (tested in English or Chinese; total N = 160). We found that monolingual children demonstrated greater implicit bias against African race individuals than bilingual children, independent of their native language. Monolingual Chinese children demonstrated greater explicit bias than bilingual children, although monolingual English children's explicit bias scores did not differ from those of bilingual children. Findings are discussed in terms of cognitive and experiential mechanisms that may link bilingualism and racial bias. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Stereotype threat occurs when people are concerned about confirming a negative stereotype about their social group, and this often leads people to underperform within the threatened domain. Although this is well-documented, the majority of prior studies examining stereotype threat in older adults have focused on cognitive outcomes and comparatively less research has focused on how stereotype threat affects physical outcomes. In this study, we examined whether negative age-based evaluations invoke stereotype threat and adversely affect older adults’ gait, and whether this depends upon the difficulty of the gait task and upon participants’ evaluations of their own resources to cope with the demands of the gait task. To test this, we recruited 163 healthy, community-dwelling older adults and asked them to complete either an “easy” gait task (i.e., walking at their own comfortable pace) or a “difficult” gait task (i.e., walking within a 15 cm narrow base of support) along a 24′ temporospatial-measuring walkway. This was done in either the presence or absence of a negative age-based evaluation. Results showed that the adverse effects of stereotype threat (i.e., walking slower, with relatively more variability in speed, and with more step errors) were generally limited to participants completing the difficult gait task who were not confident that they had sufficient resources to cope with the demands of the task. Thus, stereotype threat can impair older adults’ physical performance, but the magnitude of this effect depends upon the task’s objective difficulty and on participants’ subjective evaluations of their own resources.

AB  - Considering possible criticisms of contact theory's validity for reducing negative attitudes in cases of intractable, complex intergroup conflict, this study examines the attitudes and intergroup relations of Israel's Jewish majority and Arab minority by comparing two university campuses that differed in Arab student enrollment rates and levels of religiosity. Participants were 100 Jewish and 100 Arab students. Blue University, with 20% Arab students, offered more opportunities for intergroup contacts than did the predominantly Jewish Orange University (1.9% Arab enrollment). As expected, findings showed more positive attitudes and relations between Jewish and Arab students at Blue University than at Orange University, thus corroborating the validity of contact theory in a major conflict situation. In operative terms, our findings suggest that in places wherein there exist intractable conflicts, it is worth establishing higher education campuses where students from the different groups can study together. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assess components of the Psychosocial Attention Network (RAPS) in crack user care in a Rio Grande do Sul municipality. METHOD: Qualitative study based on Fourth Generation Evaluation. Data collection occurred in 2014, through participating observation and interviews based on the Hermeneutic-Dialectic Circle. Ten uses, eleven family members, seven managers and eight workers at a Psychosocial Attention Center participated. The Constant Comparative Method was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Difficulties were observed in the network articulation with the general hospital, due to prejudice and the lack of structure of the team. SAMU's (Mobile Emergency Care Service) dependence on the Military Brigade for the service indicates a frailty of the network. The need to re-think the way therapeutic farms operate in the network is a consensus. CONCLUSION: RAPS is being implemented and its concretization depends on the involvement of professionals, managers and social control of users and family members.

AB  - This paper offers an explanation of the link between grandiose narcissism and support for radical right parties. Drawing on representative data of the GESIS Panel (N = 2827), focusing on support for the German radical right populist party Alternative for Germany in 2016 and treating grandiose narcissism as a two-dimensional concept, it is shown that the effects of grandiose narcissism are indirect rather than direct. The paper also reveals that it is mainly narcissistic rivalry that accounts for radical right party support, whereas narcissistic admiration has a protecting relationship. Finally, our results indicate that the indirect effects of narcissistic rivalry on radical right party support via right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, respectively, are mediated by anti-immigrant sentiment. All in all, our results suggest that in studies on ideological orientations and voting behaviour, both dimensions of grandiose narcissism should be considered due to their contradictory relationship. Moreover, our findings indicate that the success of radical right parties might be the expression of personality dispositions of some parts of the electorate. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to analyse ideas regarding pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV among groups of men who have sex with men in Mexico for future implementation in health services. Methods: During 2015, 54 people participated in four focus groups in three Mexican cities. Issues related to challenges for uses and limitations of PrEP were explored. Results: In contrast with other qualitative studies, which emphasised problems with relationships with other people for PrEP use or access to key populations, Mexican participants focused their concerns around the public health services organisation: PrEP is too expensive and the health services have no resources, which will affect services and result in discrimination. Participants identified possible stigmatisation related to prejudices of medical providers who do not approve the decreased use of condoms. As a potential solution, participants suggested that the Mexican Government could negotiate a lower cost for PrEP and public health services could provide the medication, with periodical review of the arrangements by civil organisations. Conclusion: In the current context of the new Mexican government, it is necessary to propose public politics focused on negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on the costs of the PrEP, coordinating public services with groups within civil society and strengthening policies and actions to reduce stigma and discrimination. © 2020 CSIRO.

AB  - Aims and Objectives: The finishing and polishing of removable orthodontic appliances can produce acrylic dust containing methyl methacrylate, which is potentially prejudicial to health. The aim of this study was to determine the average amount of acrylic dust produced by the finishing and polishing processes involved in removable orthodontic appliance fabrication and the associated risk factors. Materials and Methods: This descriptive observational study constituted samples of 93 orthodontic appliances (62 upper orthodontic plates and 31 lower orthodontic plates) manufactured by sixth semester students of the Dental Technology Study Program, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia, between February and May 2016, which satisfied the criteria. The amount of acrylic dust produced was calculated on the basis of the difference between the weight of an orthodontic plate after acrylic processing and the weight after finishing and polishing. Data were tested statistically using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney test, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test with P value 0.05 and performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 24.0. Results: The results showed that the average acrylic dust produced in the fabrication of a removable orthodontic appliance was 1.23g (range, 0.29-3.54g). The average acrylic dust produced by the upper orthodontic plate (1.34g) was greater than that of the lower plate (0.94g). Results also showed that the finishing process produced more acrylic dust (0.94g) than the polishing process (0.27g). Conclusion: The acrylic dust produced by the removable orthodontic appliance production process undertaken by sixth semester Dental Technology students at Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia, had an average weight of 1.21g. The finishing process produced more acrylic dust in comparison to the polishing process. Students' skill in producing orthodontic appliances and orthodontic plate design represents a major factor affecting the amount of acrylic dust produced. © 2020 Journal of International Oral Health.

AB  - Readers of Whitman’s poetry have long celebrated his radical portrayal of crossing racial boundaries. Yet, as recent scholars have documented, Whitman “erased” almost all of his references to black Americans in his Reconstruction-era writings. This article argues against the standard interpretation of this erasure, contending that it was a product of a rhetorical shift, rather than of Whitman’s increasing personal prejudice toward black Americans. By tracing Whitman’s rhetorical strategy from pre– to post–Civil War periods, I show that Whitman maintained a public commitment to a racially heterogeneous democracy. What changed, I argue, was his rhetorical approach. While Whitman’s prewar poetic experimentation was addressed to Americans more generally, his postwar writings were tailored to court the Americans who were least open to his democratic project—white Southerners. I conclude by examining the limitations of both rhetorical approaches, arguing that they point toward the need for a pluralist approach to social criticism. © 2020 by The Jack Miller Center.

AB  - Objective: To gain insight on the aspects that impact non-adherence to sickle cell disease treatment in a family with several sick members. Method: Single case study of four siblings with sickle cell disease monitored at a Referral Center in the state of Bahia, Brazil. Data was collected with the use of a questionnaire, open interviews and themed story-drawing. Results: The following themes emerged: Prejudice and discrimination promote self-isolation; Transportation problems prevent patients to get to health services; The health unit is a space that amplifies doubts and uncertainty; Hopelessness leads to treatment withdrawal. Conclusion: Social assistance, emotional, instrumental and educational support are essential to reduce the vulnerability of families experiencing sickle cell disease. The contents addressed in health facilities must include perspectives on positive experiences, encouraging hope and the construction of meanings during life in the process of chronic illness, in order to increase treatment adherence. © 2019, Universidade Federal do Parana.

AB  - Each person in Egypt, including the 15 million with disabilities and more than 3.5 million who are 65 and older, – have the right to access museums without barriers. Egyption law, requires accommodations for each disabled person so they have equal opportunity to participate in the cultural life of the community. Unfortunately, Egypt's museums have not prioritized accessibility, despite the legislation that establishes these rights of access. This forum identifies the source of the problem as a problem of public discourse and political will rather than the legal principles that have laid the foundations for universal design in western cultures. The author proposes a new strategic vision for Egypt's museums to work within their enabling legislation to interpret state policy in ways that can accelerate inclusive practices. This strategy acknowledges that the Egyptian context where accommodation has focused on a medical model, and acknowledges that the cultural challenges with implementation of a social model requires a shift in thinking that is already been achieved in other nations. Moreover, by working within their governing systems, the author suggests that the museum can lead a shift in public discourse toward removing environmental barriers in ways that benefit all people in Egypt rather than the medical model that promotes prejudice and victimhood of those who require accommodation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Public stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts. © 2020 Watanabe, Cunningham.

AB  - In this article, we test if international football matches in Latin America can be understood as nationalistic collective rituals and if participating in them leads to prejudicial attitudes toward immigrants and to legitimize the national social systems. Based on social identity theory and literature on collective rituals, we propose that participating in collective rituals makes cognitively salient social identity over self-identity through collective emotions. Therefore, individuals are more motivated to perceive the social systems as fair and legitimate and to show outgroup derogation. In Study 1 (N = 414), interest in football was associated with national identification a week before an international tournament in Brazil, Chile, and Spain. This association was mediated by fusion of identity with the national ingroup but not by experiencing collective positive emotions. In Study 2 (N = 118), we used an experimental design and showed that nationalism moderated the effect of participating in nationalistic collective rituals on measures related to behavioral intentions. Specifically, these rituals decreased outgroup prejudice among high nationalistic participants. Collective rituals are discussed as a form of collective self-affirmation that may have reduced defensiveness and led nationalistic individuals to behave according to the predominant values within a society. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

AB  - Objective: To describe the repercussions, from the perspectives of caregiver mothers, of confirmed congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in their offspring. Methods: A descriptive-exploratory study with a qualitative approach was carried out in the state of Espírito Santo in southeastern Brazil, with 25 women who had a child diagnosed with CZS. Results: Emerging themes from the content analysis were grouped into two categories: (1) inequalities experienced by mothers, including social inequality, poverty, and gender inequality; (2) the impact of a child with CZS on mothering, including feelings at the time of diagnosis, maternal isolation and mental health, experiences of stigma and prejudice, and exhausting itineraries searching for therapeutic care. Conclusion: The repercussions of CZS were a huge burden on already vulnerable women, and social inequalities and poverty were important markers in the mothers’ reports. Many of the families affected by CZS already lived in precarious social conditions and these conditions were exacerbated further. Robust public and social policies to support these mothers need effective implementation given that babies born with CZS need long-term care and support. © 2020 World Health Organization; licensed by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics

AB  - In this study, we examined the relationship between 159 predominately White pre-service teachers’ color-blind racial attitudes, emotion regulation, and psychological inflexibility with stigmatizing thoughts about race. Results indicated strong relationships between color-blind racial ideology and psychological inflexibility with stigmatizing thoughts about race. Specifically, emotion regulation difficulties (suppression strategies) served as a mediator between color-blind racial ideology (unawareness of racial privilege) and psychological inflexibility with stigmatizing thoughts about race. In addition, emotion regulation difficulties (lack of emotional clarity) served as a moderator between color-blind racial ideology (blatant racial issues) and psychological inflexibility with stigmatizing thoughts about race. Similarly, emotion regulation difficulties (impulse control difficulties) served as a moderator between color-blind racial ideology (institutional discrimination) and psychological inflexibility with stigmatizing thoughts about race. The study's overall findings highlight pre-service teachers’ difficulties with regulating their emotions in racial situations as well as how this difficulty in turn influences their ability to change negative thoughts regarding other racial groups. The study has implications for how pre-service teachers regulate racial emotions in the classroom as well as how they may potentially interact with racially diverse students. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Social norms in general have an important role in the regulation of intergroup relations. However, the effects of one specific type of social norms-in-group norms about intergroup contact-have not yet been extensively studied, especially among groups of different status or in different intergroup contexts. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of three types of contact norms (peer, parental and school) on four intergroup outcomes (ingroup bias, social distance, tendency to discriminate, prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup) among ethnic majority and minority adolescents from four different intergroup contexts of the Republic of Croatia, as well as to test for moderating effects of age, social status and intergroup context in the strength of these effects. The research was carried out on a sample of 1440 elementary and high school students, members of Croatian majority, and Serbian, Hungarian, Czech, and Italian minority. The results indicated that although all three types of norms predict most of the intergroup outcomes, their relative importance depends on the specific type of intergroup outcome (attitudinal or behavioural), group social status (majority or minority), intergroup context (history of a recent intergroup conflict or not), and for peer norms on the age of the adolescent. © 2020 Pehar et al.

AB  - Introduction and objectives: This study analyzes the relationship between parental styles (indulgent, authoritative, authoritarian, and neglectful) with the short- and long-term pattern of personal and social adjustment in children, teenagers and adults. Material and methods: The sample consisted of 2,119 Spanish children (59.2% female), 623 adolescents (12-18 years), 591 young adults (19-35 years), 509 middle-aged adults (36-59 years) and 396 older adults (60 years or more). Families were classified into one of four parental typologies (indulgent, authoritative, authoritarian and neglectful) based on their scores in the two main dimensions (acceptance/implication and severity/imposition). Children's personal and social adjustment was measured with family self-concept, self-esteem, aggressiveness, sexist prejudice, and internalization of social values of universalism. Results: The results showed a common short- and long-term pattern between parental styles and personal and social adjustment. The indulgent style was associated with equal or even better scores on personal and social adjustment than the authoritative style, while the lower scores corresponded to the authoritarian and neglectful parental styles. Conclusions: The findings are discussed considering the relevance of the cultural context in which parental socialization occurs. © 2019 Sociedad Española para el Estudio de la Ansiedad y el Estrés - SEAS

AB  - Attitudes towards immigrants in the United Kingdom are worsening. It has been posited that these attitudes may reflect covert racial and religious prejudices, particularly among conservatives. To investigate this, two studies examined the role that immigrant race (Black/White; Study 1) and immigrant religion (Muslim/non-Muslim; Study 2) played in immigrant infrahumanization judgements, using political conservatism as a moderating variable. There was a moderating effect of political conservatism; however, it was not in the predicted direction. The results of both studies indicated that immigrant race (Black) and immigrant religion (Muslim) predicted greater infrahumanization when political conservatism was low. Conservatives infrahumanized all immigrants equally (and more than liberals), but liberals were more sensitive to racial/religious biases in their evaluations of immigrants. © 2019 The British Psychological Society

AB  - This paper argues against dismissing as ‘populist nationalism’ every positive view of one's nation and ignoring patriotism as its antithesis. The European nation exists in two senses: as a large ‘social group’, a community of real people, and as an abstract community of cultural values promoted by intellectual elites grounded in a humanities-based education. The widespread prejudice that condemns every positive expression of one's relationship to the nation has proved counterproductive because it has prompted ever stronger spontaneous reactions in the form of primitive nationalistic egoism. This has weakened the commitment people feel towards their nation and the humanistic potential that the nation possesses as a cultural community of values. Consequently, anti-national European intellectual elites bear some responsibility – along with those preaching neoliberal individualism – for the success of populist demagogues and the decline in patriotic values. Given the state of education today, a revival of humanist culture for national elites seems impossible, making the continued rise of primitive nationalism appear unstoppable. © The author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study examined the joint influence of defendant race (Black/White) and mental disorder type (schizophrenia/depression) on mock juror decisions in a Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) case. We reasoned that unwillingness to vote for insanity would be more pronounced for a Black defendant with schizophrenia, given overlapping dangerousness and criminality stereotypes associated with those groups. Online community participants (N = 216) read a fictional second-degree murder case in which we varied mental disorder type and defendant race, then provided a verdict (guilty/NGRI) and answered questions regarding the trial. In line with hypotheses, participants were significantly more likely to vote guilty for a Black defendant with schizophrenia as compared to depression, but there were no significant differences for the White defendant. Results of this study suggest that bias in insanity trials can be exacerbated for a racialized defendant. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Our decision to believe what another person says can be influenced by vocally expressed confidence in speech and by whether the speaker–listener are members of the same social group. The dynamic effects of these two information sources on neurocognitive processes that promote believability impressions from vocal cues are unclear. Here, English Canadian listeners were presented personal statements (She has access to the building) produced in a confident or doubtful voice by speakers of their own dialect (in-group) or speakers from two different “out-groups” (regional or foreign-accented English). Participants rated how believable the speaker is for each statement and event-related potentials (ERPs) were analysed from utterance onset. Believability decisions were modulated by both the speaker’s vocal confidence level and their perceived in-group status. For in-group speakers, ERP effects revealed an early differentiation of vocally expressed confidence (i.e., N100, P200), highlighting the motivational significance of doubtful voices for drawing believability inferences. These early effects on vocal confidence perception were qualitatively different or absent when speakers had an accent; evaluating out-group voices was associated with increased demands on contextual integration and re-analysis of a non-native representation of believability (i.e., increased N400, late negativity response). Accent intelligibility and experience with particular out-group accents each influenced how vocal confidence was processed for out-group speakers. The N100 amplitude was sensitive to out-group attitudes and predicted actual believability decisions for certain out-group speakers. We propose a neurocognitive model in which vocal identity information (social categorization) dynamically influences how vocal expressions are decoded and used to derive social inferences during person perception. © Experimental Psychology Society 2019.

AB  - Childhood poverty in the U.S. is common and is associated with increased risk for negative outcomes in social-emotional, physical, and academic functioning domains beginning as early as toddlerhood. While research has addressed adults’ negative stereotyped beliefs about people in poverty, little is known about children's endorsements of stigmatizing stereotypes about people in poverty. In the current study, interviews were conducted with 94 socioeconomically diverse four to nine year-old children. Children in the study endorsed various. negative beliefs about people in poverty, with endorsement of negative beliefs emerging in the late preschool period (age four to five years). More socioeconomically advantaged children demonstrated a linear increase in overall stereotype endorsement with age. In contrast, less socioeconomically advantaged children demonstrated a curvilinear relation between age and stereotype endorsement, with endorsement first increasing and then decreasing over the period covered in the study. Implications for future research are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although scholars have long studied circumstances that shape prejudice, inquiry into factors associated with long-term prejudice reduction has been more limited. Using a 6-year longitudinal study of non-Black physicians in training (N = 3,134), we examined the effect of three medical-school factors—interracial contact, medical-school environment, and diversity training—on explicit and implicit racial bias measured during medical residency. When accounting for all three factors, previous contact, and baseline bias, we found that quality of contact continued to predict lower explicit and implicit bias, although the effects were very small. Racial climate, modeling of bias, and hours of diversity training in medical school were not consistently related to less explicit or implicit bias during residency. These results highlight the benefits of interracial contact during an impactful experience such as medical school. Ultimately, professional institutions can play a role in reducing anti-Black bias by encouraging more frequent, and especially more favorable, interracial contact. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objectives: We examined whether and how habitual mindfulness (defined as a broad manifold of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence) relates to ethical sensitivities, operationalized as moral attitudes (as measured by the Moral Foundations Questionnaire) and prejudice. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using factor analysis and path analysis in two independent samples (n = 358 and 424) of college students. Results: With regard to mindfulness, we found that two higher-order measures of self-awareness (i.e., reflective awareness and controlled sense of self in the moment) influenced two higher-order measures of self-regulation (i.e., self-preoccupation and self-compassion), as well as self-transcendence, which was additionally influenced by self-regulation. Path analysis showed that reflective awareness and self-transcendence were directly related to individualizing aspects of morality (i.e., an emphasis on care and fairness); only self-transcendence and social conservatism were related to binding aspects of morality (i.e., an emphasis on loyalty, authority, and sanctity). The individualizing stance, in turn, led to less explicit prejudice, more awareness of privilege, and, indirectly, a higher motivation to control one’s prejudiced reactions. Implicit prejudice, however, was not related to any of the examined variables. Conclusions: The Stoic and Buddhist conjecture that ethical sensitivities can be fostered through mindfulness might well work: Distinct aspects of the mindfulness manifold were directly and indirectly related to the moral foundations; explicit prejudice, awareness of privilege, and the motivation to control one’s prejudiced reactions were likewise related to select aspects of the mindfulness manifold. Within the manifold, reflective awareness and self-transcendence are key variables implicated in awakening and fostering ethical sensitivities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present research, we investigated the combined role of accent (native vs. nonnative) and race (European native or White vs. nonnative or Black) in real-time in-group categorization among Italian participants. We found that targets presenting mixed cues (i.e., Black persons with a native accent and White persons with a nonnative accent) led to the simultaneous and parallel activation of in-group and out-group representation in the early stage of person perception, showing that both accent and appearance were initially processed. However, later in the process, when accent and appearance did not match, the first played a major role in the participants’ construal of the target as “one of us.” Finally, we examined the role of social identification, beliefs on the importance of language and race, prejudice, social dominance, and contacts with first-generation Italians in the categorization process. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The 2016 U.S. presidential election coincided with the rise of the “alternative right,” or alt-right. Alt-right associates have wielded considerable influence on the current administration and on social discourse, but the movement’s loose organizational structure has led to disparate portrayals of its members’ psychology and made it difficult to decipher its aims and reach. To systematically explore the alt-right’s psychology, we recruited two U.S. samples: An exploratory sample through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (N = 827, alt-right n = 447) and a larger, nationally representative sample through the National Opinion Research Center’s Amerispeak panel (N = 1,283, alt-right n = 71–160, depending on the definition). We estimate that 6% of the U.S. population and 10% of Trump voters identify as alt-right. Alt-right adherents reported a psychological profile more reflective of the desire for group-based dominance than economic anxiety. Although both the alt-right and non-alt-right Trump voters differed substantially from non-alt-right, non-Trump voters, the alt-right and Trump voters were quite similar, differing mainly in the alt-right’s especially high enthusiasm for Trump, suspicion of mainstream media, trust in alternative media, and desire for collective action on behalf of Whites. We argue for renewed consideration of overt forms of bias in contemporary intergroup research. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Since its original formulation, Tajfel’s Social Identity Theory (SIT) has broadened considerably from its original focus on intergroup relations and is now applied to a wide range of phenomena. Indeed, the ‘social identity approach’ has become one of the most widely used perspectives in contemporary social psychology. In this article, I examine the popularity of Tajfel’s writings on social identity and intergroup relations, especially over the last thirty years when they started to become more generally used. I offer a critical appraisal of the original SIT, both as a theory of intergroup relations and as a theory of identity, concluding that its real value lies in its success in offering an over-arching perspective on the importance of groups in social life and its ability to stimulate new areas of research. I then widen the discussion to consider how the social identity perspective has been used in a number of other fields of enquiry. © 2019 The British Psychological Society

AB  - The present systematic review aimed to determine discrimination experiences of sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals and attitudes toward SGM among health care staff in health care settings. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review was conducted in 3 databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct) using keywords of sexual and gender minority, including “gay,” “lesbian,” “bisexual,” “transgender,” “LGB,” “LGBT,” “health care discrimination,” “stigma,” “homophobia,” “transphobia,” and “attitudes of healthcare professionals” from May to September 2016. Predetermined inclusion criteria were selected. Thirty quantitative studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. Discriminative behaviors experienced by SGM individuals were stigma, denial or refusal of health care, and verbal or physical abuse. Knowledge and educational levels, beliefs, and religion of health care providers affected their attitudes toward SGM patients and their homophobia level. These findings revealed that health care providers needed more education about SGM issues, and SGM-friendly policies should be created for improving health care for SGM individuals. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Two experiments test the existence of prejudicial attitudes toward nonnative Italian speech (specifically Chinese-accented Italian) within Tuscany’s high schools, among teachers and student samples. The research explores and integrates different methodologies: explicit inquiry (overt questionnaires) as well as implicit tests (Implicit Association Test protocol). The results outlined the existence of significant implicit negative attitudes toward Chinese-accented Italian and established the discrepancy between explicit and implicit attitudes. The discussion focuses on the sociolinguistic implications of these results, with respect to educational aspects and to future directions for research. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Prior work on aging and prejudice has identified that declining executive ability underlies older adults’ (OA’) increased anti-outgroup bias. The current work, however, suggests that there may also be a motivational reason. Here, we explored the possibility that for OA with relatively lower executive ability, anti-outgroup bias may serve an ironic purpose of maximizing a fundamental social goal: maintaining ingroup positivity. OA are more motivated than young adults (YA) to maximize positivity in everyday life. This process, however, can be cognitively effortful. We tested the novel predictions that (a) OA’ executive ability positively predicts their evaluations of ingroup members and (b) OA might preserve positive ingroup perceptions through anti-outgroup bias if they have lower executive ability. The present work tested these predictions using a timely example of an outgroup: Muslims. Study 1 verified that non-Muslim YA and OA identified with non-Muslims (vs. Muslims) as an ingroup. Study 2 then had 3 key findings. First, we replicated work showing a negative relationship between OA’ executive ability and their anti-outgroup bias by showing a negative relationship with their anti-Muslim bias. Second, OA’ higher executive ability related to their having more positive perceptions of ingroup non-Muslims. Finally, OA with lower executive ability had higher ingroup positivity by having higher anti-Muslim bias. These findings suggest that when OA lack the executive ability to directly maintain a motivational goal of being positive about themselves and their ingroups, they maintain positivity at the expense of others.

AB  - HIV stigma is a harmful social phenomenon present in United States (US)-based health care settings. This study assessed the efficacy of a participatory PhotoVoice-informed stigma reduction training program focusing on people living with HIV (PLWH) and targeting health care workers. Seventy-three (N = 73) participants were assessed at baseline (T1), within approximately a week of the training (T2), and at a 3-month follow-up (T3) regarding their HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes towards PLWH, and observations of enacted HIV stigma. Findings indicated that the training increased knowledge and improved attitudes (β = 0.56, p < 0.01; β = 0.58, p < 0.01, respectively) at T2, but these effects diminished at T3 (β = − 0.03, p > 0.05; β = − 0.29, p > 0.05, respectively). The training did not, however, have an impact on observations of enacted stigma at T2 (β = 0.10, p > 0.05) or at T3 (β = 0.02, p > 0.05). Additional participatory stigma reduction programs that involve diverse groups of health care workers, offer salient study incentives, include time-saving training methods, and comprise a variety of stigma measures, may be particularly beneficial. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Do political partisans hold their co-partisan political leaders to a higher or lower discursive standard than rank-and-file co-partisans? Previous research in non-political group contexts suggests competing answers to this question. Some research (e.g., Abrams et al., 2013) suggests that leaders (as defenders of the group) are afforded credits for transgressions and thus held to a lower behavioral standard for incivility than their constituents. Other research (e.g., Pinto et al., 2010) suggests the opposite, that is, that leaders are held to a higher standard than constituents and are thus judged harshly for transgressions in an effort to preserve the group's self-esteem and image. We conducted the first experimental tests of these competing hypotheses in the contemporary American political theatre by having people evaluate either a high-ranking (politician) or low-ranking (e.g., janitor) co-partisan who uncivilly attacks members of the opposite party. Eight experiments (N = 7511) consistently found that co-partisan leaders were judged more harshly for interpartisan incivility than were fellow rank-and-file partisans. This leaders' higher standard effect generalized to electoral and governing contexts, attacks on high and low ranking targets, both male and female politicians, across Democratic and Republican observers, and party-defending or selfish motives. Mediation and moderation analyses supported a pragmatic explanation for this result: people wanted their political leaders (more than their fellow partisans) to cultivate positive working relationships and govern effectively and incivility undermined this primary aim. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Past research consistently suggests that singles are stigmatized, but do they constitute a stigmatized group? The current research provides deeper insight into the stigmatization of single people by understanding their ‘group-y’ nature, and how group identification and perception map onto discrimination and prejudice. Study 1 examined the extent to which singles identify as part of a group. Participants were assigned a novel minimal group identity and then completed measures of group identification for four group memberships (e.g., minimal group, relationship status, sexual orientation, nationality). As hypothesized, singles' identification with other singles was lower compared to their identification with other identities—as well as compared to partnered people's group identification. Contrary to our hypothesis, singles did not perceive less discrimination towards singles relative to other aspects of their identity. Study 2 examined the extent to which singles are perceived as a group and the extent to which their group-y-ness vs. perceived responsibility for their group membership explains the acceptability of prejudice towards them. Participants completed measures of entitativity and perceived responsibility for similar out-group identities as in Study 1 (e.g., single people vs. people in romantic relationships). As hypothesized, singles were rated lower in entitativity than people in romantic relationships and other groups. Prejudice towards singles was also more acceptable than prejudice towards national and sexual orientation groups. Accordingly, perceived responsibility was a stronger predictor of the acceptability of prejudice towards singles than their entitativity. We discuss the importance of group-based theoretical perspectives for understanding the current and future stigmatization and well-being of singles. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The current article addresses bystander action to confront disparaging humor as a form of moral courage. We ask: When is disparaging humor seen as harmless fun or as a pernicious form of prejudice? What are the social and psychological processes through which bystanders confront, evade, or collaborate in disparaging humor? Three experiments (Ns = 95, 213, 220), involving a novel paradigm (‘the shared media paradigm’) test the role of bystander emotional responses (anger/amusement) in shaping action to confront disparagement humor, through emotion-based social influence. Study 1 demonstrates that bystander action to confront disparagement humor as prejudice is shaped by the angry (but not amused) responses of co-present others. Study 2 considers a moderator of the influence process: the role of one's own emotional reaction to disparagement humor (angry/amused). Bystander confrontation was more intense when one's own angry reaction was validated by that of other bystanders but there was otherwise mixed evidence that the two interacted to promote collaboration/confrontation. Study 3 tests the claim that disparagement humor is especially challenging to confront because humor disarms opposition. Intergroup commentary was seen as more amusing and confrontation was more strongly resisted when humor was used (vs. a non-humorous control remark). Overall, the results show that the reactions of bystanders play an important role in shaping what is (or is not) perceived to be prejudice. Courageous action to confront the disparagement of members of minority groups is enabled by the emotional signals of others who are co-present. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Interviewing is considered a key form of qualitative inquiry in psychology that yields rich data on lived experience and meaning making of life events. Interviews that contain multiple components informed by specific epistemologies have the potential to provide particularly nuanced perspectives on psychological experience. We offer a methodological model for a multicomponent interview that draws upon both pragmatic and constructivist epistemologies to examine generational differences in the experience of identity development, stress, and health among contemporary sexual minorities in the United States. Grounded in theories of life course, narrative, and intersectionality, we designed and implemented a multicomponent protocol that was administered among a diverse sample of three generations of sexual minority individuals. For each component, we describe the purpose and utility, underlying epistemology, foundational psychological approach, and procedure, and we provide illustrative data from interviewees. We discuss procedures undertaken to ensure methodological integrity in the process of data collection, illustrating the implementation of recent guidelines for qualitative inquiry in psychology. We highlight the utility of this qualitative multicomponent interview to examine the ways in which sexual minorities of distinct generations have made meaning of significant social change over the past half-century.

AB  - Objectives: This research aims to investigate the relationship between coming out to family and coming out in sports for lesbian and gay athletes and to examine the internalization of sexual prejudice as a potential mediator of this relationship. Methods: For this purpose, disclosure of sexual orientation to family, coming out in sports and internalized sexual prejudice in sports-related contexts, age, gender, socioeconomic status, education level, political orientation, type of sport (individual vs. team sport), years of sports participation were assessed on an Italian sample of 113 lesbian athletes and 63 gay athletes between 18 and 35 years of age. Results: Findings indicated that coming out to family was significantly associated with coming out in sports. In addition, the internalization of negative attitudes toward the visibility of lesbian and gay athletes in sport settings partially mediated the relationship between coming out to family and coming out in sports. Conclusions: These findings suggest that prior experiences of coming out in family contexts may provide additional resources to prevent the internalization of sexual prejudice, and this may promote the coming out in other life contexts. Moreover, we recommend that more efforts should be made to support sexual minority athletes who are not able to disclose their identity in sports environments. Research implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the reasons why pregnant and puerperal women fail to seek or accept treatment for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries, where there is a high prevalence of this disorder. To help fill this gap, this study investigated the factors influencing the decision not to seek or to refuse treatment for perinatal depression in a low-income community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Qualitative research was conducted in two primary health care units in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2017–2018. Five focus groups were held with 26 women. Convenience sampling was used, and the sample size was determined by data saturation. A content analysis methodology was used to identify theme categories to objectively describe the group’s manifest contents. Ten categories were obtained: stigma and misconception, self-image as a mother, socioeconomic stigma, lack of knowledge, lack of a health service approach to mental health, difficulty recognising depression symptoms, fear of children being removed, negative reaction to patient referral, denial of the problem and previous experience with the care unit. Perinatal depression is permeated with stigma and prejudice, and there is a belief that women with depression are unable to be good mothers. It is important to conduct programmes disseminating information about perinatal depression and implementing an approach that includes routine consultations so that women can access perinatal mental health services. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The high prevalence of childhood obesity has drawn increasing attention to the neurocognitive impairments associated with excess weight, and evidence has accumulated of a progressive decline in working memory at increasing levels of children's Body Mass Index (BMI). However, obesity is also a highly stigmatizing condition, and pervasive societal stereotypes depict individuals with obesity as less intelligent than those with average weight. For this reason, we investigated whether stereotype threat (i.e., the fear of confirming a negative stereotype attached to one's social groups) contributes to working memory impairments in children with excess weight. By applying a consolidated paradigm in stereotype threat research, primary school-age children (N = 176) performed a computerized working memory task that was alternatively labeled as diagnostic (i.e., stereotype-threatening) or nondiagnostic (i.e., non-stereotype-threatening) of their intellectual ability. Results confirmed that working memory decreased at increasing levels of BMI in the stereotype-threatening condition, whereas the relation between body weight and working memory was null when task diagnosticity was removed. This effect was not further moderated by children's direct experiences of weight-based stigmatization or by their personal endorsement of the obesity stereotype about intelligence. These findings suggest that vulnerability to weight-related stereotype threat emerges early in life and may contribute to working memory deficits in children with obesity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conflict induces psychophysiological responses, but less is known about responses to intergroup conflict. Intergroup relationships activate social processes, adding complexity to people's physiological responses. This study analyzes the psychophysiological responses to intergroup conflict considering sex differences. Thus, 150 young people were distributed in 50 groups in two conditions (conflict vs. non-conflict). Conflict was created in the interaction between two groups (three people each) in the laboratory. Their responses were compared to a control group. Mood, heart rate variability, cortisol, and testosterone were measured. Results showed that intergroup conflict induced a less pronounced decrease in negative and positive mood, and a reduction in parasympathetic activity (RMSSD of IBI). Moreover, women in conflict showed lower testosterone levels than men in conflict and control women. Finally, women's conflict perception correlated with their psychophysiological response. Results suggest that intergroup conflict induces emotional, cardiovascular, and endocrine responses, and that men and women interpret conflict differently. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examines intergroup contact in a real-life work setting of Jewish and Palestinian nurses working in joint medical work teams in Israel where membership is involuntary. Specifically, it investigates Jewish and Palestinian nurses’ experiences of working together in a hospital in Israel in the context of the protracted and asymmetric conflict between Israeli Jews and Palestinians. Thematic content analysis of 42 in-depth interviews, based on a grounded theory approach, reveals that Jewish and Palestinian employees alike experienced a sense of inequality and unfairness in the joint medical teams, blaming the other group for the asymmetric power relations. This, in turn, impaired the work atmosphere and made Jewish—Palestinian cooperation difficult in this real-life organizational setting. The findings contribute to the understanding of the complexity of asymmetric power relations in a joint Jewish—Palestinian medical work team within the context of protracted conflict. It shows that even when there are factors that are assumed to encourage an effective intergroup contact, such as superordinate goals and similar professional status, the influence of the broad sociopolitical context prevails and constitutes a hindrance to an effective intergroup contact in a mixed work environment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement—This research provides a direct perspective on a paradoxical reality: the need to maintain work relations based on equality and fairness vis-a-vis a dominant social discourse that fosters inequality and antagonism toward the other group. The study’s main contribution lies in the suggestion that real-life encounters in a reality that includes promotive intergroup relations factors, such as positive contact with outgroup members, a superordinate goal, support of the authority figures and equality status, may not be sufficient to overcome bias and sense of inequality and fairness when historic and contemporary asymmetric protracted conflict situations persist.

AB  - Children judge in-group members more favorably than out-group members. They also judge moral transgressions as more serious and more worthy of punishment than conventional transgressions. Here we asked whether children's judgments of moral and conventional transgressions vary by the group membership of the transgressor (in-group, neutral, out-group, or self). In addition, we asked whether judgments of the transgressions would extend to the transgressors themselves, including cases in which the self was the transgressor. Results show that transgressions committed by out-group members were judged as being more serious and more punish-worthy than those committed by members of other groups. In addition, children judged out-group transgressors more harshly, and the self more leniently, than other group members. Overall, results suggest that group membership does affect judgments of transgressions and transgressors, with out-group members consistently judged the most negatively and the self consistently judged the least negatively. However, when judging the transgressor or the seriousness of the transgression, domain distinctions do persist even as group membership varies. Although, when assigning punishment, domain distinctions persist only when judging the transgressions of out-group members and neutral individuals. These findings demonstrate the powerful effect of group membership on the judgments of both acts and actors, indicating that when judging transgressions children consider not only the moral or conventional status of the act but also the group membership of the actor. © 2019

AB  - Based on the social-cognitive information processing model and the theory of normative beliefs, this study tests if gamers normalise aggression in games, and whether these normative beliefs explain their aggressive behaviour in games. Experimental cross sectional, worldwide data was collected through an online survey of gamers (N = 1646). Participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing an instance of verbal harassment occurring either online (within a multiplayer game) or offline (within a board game café) and were asked how acceptable and tolerable they found the harassment. There was a significant moderate main effect of context which indicated that harassment was perceived as more normal in the online gaming scenario. Normative beliefs about cyberaggression significantly predicted both general and prejudiced cyberaggression. Additionally, normative beliefs partially mediated the relationship between age and general cyberaggression (small effect) and gender and general cyberaggression (large effect). As normative beliefs are dynamic and modifiable, cyberaggression prevention and intervention efforts should include modification of beliefs which support the legitimacy and acceptability of cyberaggression in games. These findings provide insight into how gamer culture around acceptability of trash talk relates to toxicity in games and suggest directions for further research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although anticipated HIV-related stigma—the expectation that one will experience prejudice and discrimination in the future as a result of others learning his or her HIV positive status—is theorized to be a robust predictor of antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence, the association between anticipated stigma and ART non-adherence has been inconsistent. It may be, however, that anticipated stigma reliably, but indirectly, contributes to poor ART adherence through other psychosocial mechanisms. In the current study, we examine whether anticipated stigma indirectly contributes to treatment non-adherence through increased medication concerns. In a cross-sectional study, 585 people living with HIV in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia completed measures of anticipated HIV-related stigma, HIV-medication concerns, and HIV-treatment adherence. A latent variable mediation analysis revealed that anticipated stigma was positively associated with increased medication concerns, which consequently contributed to treatment non-adherence. Results reveal a psychosocial mechanism by which anticipated stigma contributes to ART non-adherence. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A qualitative study was conducted with 11 Asian American men to examine their body image concerns. From two focus groups, we identified five themes using the thematic analysis approach: (a) messages about attractive characteristics for Asian American men, (b) factors that contribute to confusion about the ideal body image, (c) effects of negative body image, (d) coping with body image concerns, and (e) defining masculinity traits for Asian American men. Participants’ perceptions of what is attractive were closely linked to Western hegemonic masculinity, the media, and Asian sociocultural influences from family. Participants reported feeling confused about what constitutes an ideal body image for them due to the lack of representation and negative stereotypes in U.S. media and gendered racism in U.S. society. Their confusion also arises from discrepant messages they receive from their family and the media. They described several adaptive strategies to cope with negative body image. Lastly, the role of masculinity appears to be a complex issue and may be related to Asian notions of masculinity, Western hegemonic masculinity, and gendered racism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)Public Significance Statement: The study investigates culturally relevant body image issues among Asian American men. Results indicate that Asian American men’s body image concerns need to be understood within their unique social, cultural, and racial contexts.

The study informs culturally competent mental health assessment and interventions for Asian American men.

AB  - Using updated data from the General Social Survey/National Death Index (GSS/NDI) study, we examined whether the relationship between structural stigma—measured by aggregating 4 items assessing prejudice towards homosexuality to the community level—and all-cause mortality is present among gay men/lesbian women. Our hypothesis is based on emerging evidence that indicators of structural stigma specific to homosexuality, such as those used in the GSS/NDI, uniquely predict health outcomes among this group. Because the GSS/NDI lacked an identity-based measure of sexual orientation, we tested our hypothesis by employing a strategy that has a relatively high degree of sensitivity and specificity for ascertaining individuals most likely to identify as gay or lesbian: restricting analyses to individuals who reported same-sex sexual partners in the past year. We compared this approach against an alternative strategy, which has weaker specificity for identifying gay men/lesbian women: restricting analyses to individuals who reported any lifetime same-sex sexual behaviors. After controlling for 6 individual-level factors and fixed effects of survey year, structural stigma was associated with mortality among individuals who reported past-year same-sex sexual partners (HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.31). Further, there was a dose-response relationship with mortality in this group, such that those residing in communities in the highest quartile of structural stigma had the greatest mortality risk, controlling for these same factors (HR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.38). In sensitivity analyses, the effect size for structural stigma ranged from 1.54 to 2.30, indicating a consistent, but small-to-moderate, effect. In contrast, no association between structural stigma and mortality was observed among respondents who reported lifetime same-sex sexual partners, nor among those reporting only opposite-sex sexual partners. This analysis therefore delimits potential boundary conditions of the association between structural stigma related to same-sex sexuality and all-cause mortality, highlighting the conditions under which this association is (and is not) observed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Four non-Indigenous academics share lessons learned through our reflective processes while working with Indigenous Australian partners on a health research project. We foregrounded reflexivity in our work to raise consciousness regarding how colonizing mindsets—that do not privilege Indigenous ways of knowing or recognize Indigenous land and sovereignty—exist within ourselves and the institutions within which we operate. We share our self-analyses and invite non-Indigenous colleagues to also consider socialized, unquestioned, and possibly unconscious assumptions about the dominance of Western paradigms, asking what contributions, if any, non-Indigenous researchers can offer toward decolonizing health research. Our processes comprise of three iterative features—prioritizing attempts to decolonize ourselves, acknowledging the necessary role of discomfort in doing so, and moving through nonbinary and toward nondualistic thinking. With a nondual lens, working to decolonize ourselves may itself be seen as one contribution non-Indigenous researchers may offer to the collective project of decolonizing health research. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Young Black men who have sex with men’s (YBMSM) attitudes and personal beliefs about themselves and their risk for HIV can be modified as a result of experiences with racism and HIV stigma. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 HIV-negative YBMSM, aged 18–24, in North Carolina and Maryland. Data were thematically analyzed to capture participants’ experiences and thoughts related to stigmatizing experiences and their perception of risk for HIV. Participants reported experiencing HIV stigmatizing and blatant racist commentary related to their identities as YBMSM. Participants described diverse strategies to distance themselves from these negative stereotypes and decrease their sexual risk for HIV. The findings highlight that HIV stigma and racial stereotypes are one of the many types of discrimination that YBMSM experience within the Black and gay communities and in society; leading to psychological distress and an altered perception of self and sexual risk. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present paper addresses Baruch Spinoza’s radical affirmation of individual identity emergent from within the psychosocial tensions of group membership. Focusing upon psychological experience beginning with a lived history of fearful Inquisitional persecution, and continuing from conformity to rebellion within the constraints of the Amsterdam Jewish synagogue, we trace the psychological recognition of individual identity in Spinoza’s understanding of the self-determined, immanent acts of daily life. Spinoza’s multiple names are depicted as markers, corresponding to membership in mutually exclusive social groups, each constraining freedom of thought and action. © 2019 The International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies.

AB  - Guided by intergroup contact theory, this study examined participants’ communication with their most frequent contact with an invisible physical disability and their attitudes and stereotypes toward people with disabilities. Results indicated that participants’ perceptions of communication frequency and quality with the contact and the contact’s disclosure about disability all had a significant indirect effect on attitudes and stereotypes through social support and intergroup anxiety sequentially. Contact quality had significant negative direct and indirect effects on endorsement of stereotypes and a significant positive indirect effect on attitudes. Protective disclosure had a significant positive indirect effect on cognitive attitudes through social support. © 2019, © 2019 Western States Communication Association.

AB  - Background: A racially diverse registered nurse workforce could improve health outcomes for minority populations, and efforts to recruit students from underrepresented groups need to be strengthened. Purpose: To explore the perceptions of nursing held by African American undergraduate non-nursing science majors within the context of their career ideals. Method: Qualitative description was the research design utilized in this study. A purposive sample of 20 African American non-nursing science majors participated in semi-structured interviews. Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña's (2014) coding processes for qualitative analysis were employed. Results: Three themes were identified that described career behavior, ideals, and the participants' perceptions of nursing as a career: 1.) Career Development: Internal and External Contributions, 2.) The Ideal Career: Profession with Power, and 3.) Perception of Nursing: A Limited Profession. Findings suggest African American science majors carry a significant burden to overcome stereotypes for themselves and their communities, thus desire careers with power and autonomy. Conclusion: Careers in medicine were idealized whereas careers in nursing were devalued. These college students often embraced careers in medicine due to, in part, the perceived ability to overcome stereotypes and simultaneously rejected nursing careers due to desire to avoid negatively stereotyped careers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Studies of accounting in prisons have documented how the dominance of neo-liberal preferences in the management of prison systems has meant a focus on measuring cost-effectiveness and discharging accountability in a way which ignores important aspects of prison life such as decency and rehabilitation. The present work recognises the need for accounting studies to unmask the prejudiced, interested and potentially socially damaging use of accounting in prison reform by exposing how accounting is often a tool which can be used to discipline individuals consistent with the values of economic and political elites within a society. By applying a Foucauldian lens to the analysis of the prison systems of the major Italian States in the early 19th century, the study shows how accounting was an essential aid in ensuring that the correction of individuals was carried out consistent with the moral priorities of the liberal bourgeois society of the time. The specific visibilities created by means of accounting, upon which decisions on the life of prisoners were made and which still characterise modern prisons, reduced human life to a simplistic numerical representation. These were then used to reconstruct ‘deviant’ individuals as productive, obedient citizens, regardless of their specific circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metastereotypes, the stereotypes a person believes that those outside of their group hold of a social group to which (s)he belongs, have been implicated in problematic intergroup relationships and communication. Using an online survey administered to participants (aged 18–30, or 65 and older) recruited via Amazon’s MTurk (final N = 311), we tested the degree to which eliciting positive versus negative age-based metastereotypes affected perceptions of interage distance and the desire to avoid interage contact. The results of conditional process model analyses suggest that metastereotype valence has an indirect effect on these outcomes via intergroup anxiety, but that this is only the case when individuals believe that age-related stereotypes are applied to them personally by members of an age-based outgroup. These findings suggest that thinking of positive metastereotypes rather than negative ones could be a route to facilitating or improving interage contact, and that personalization could amplify these potential benefits. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The current pilot study examines pre-schooler’s play behaviour involving dolls with and without facial characteristics of Down syndrome over a period of 16 weeks. Play behaviours were categorized into one of 3 behavioural categories with predefined observational scoring grids: prosocial, antisocial, or neutral/no behaviour. Participants also individually received an adapted version of the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure, to assess in- and outgroup attitudes of participants towards children with Down syndrome. Positive and negative attitudes and behaviours towards Down syndrome dolls were analysed over time with pre and post-measurements. Results showed that, whereas children showed negative behaviour towards the Down syndrome doll at the start of the experiment, this negative behaviour disappeared by the end of the experiment. Furthermore, children showed significantly more positive play behaviour during the experiment towards the Down syndrome dolls. The results of this pilot study indicate that playing with Down syndrome dolls at preschool age can potentially be used as a low cost, non-invasive prevention program to foster future positive behaviours towards Down syndrome, setting the stage for interactions with real children with Down syndrome in inclusive education. Implications for meeting the needs of children with Down syndrome and their peers in inclusive education are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Intergroup contact is among the most effective ways to improve intergroup attitudes. Although it is now beyond any doubt that contact can reduce prejudice, in this article we provide evidence that its benefits can extend beyond intergroup relations—a process referred to as cognitive liberalization (Hodson, Crisp, Meleady, & Earle, 2018). We focus specifically on the impact of intergroup contact on environmentally relevant attitudes and behavior. Recent studies suggest that support for an inequality-based ideology (social dominance orientation [SDO]) can predict both intergroup attitudes and broader environmental conduct. Individuals higher in SDO are more willing to exploit the environment in unsustainable ways because doing so aids the production and maintenance of hierarchical social structures. In 4 studies conducted with British adults, we show that by promoting less hierarchical and more egalitarian viewpoints (reduced SDO), intergroup contact encourages more environmentally responsible attitudes and behavior. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data support this model. Effects are more strongly explained by reductions in an antiegalitarian motive than a dominance motive. We discuss how these findings help define an expanded vision for intergroup contact theory that moves beyond traditional conflict-related outcomes.

AB  - Learning one is similar to a stigmatized group can threaten one’s identity and prompt disassociation from the group. What are the consequences of learning of a similarity to a stigmatized group when that similarity implies possible recategorization into the group? We investigated how learning of an immutable, recategorization implying similarity with an outgroup affects implicitly and explicitly assessed prejudice. In Study 1, White participants who believed they had above average genetic overlap with African Americans showed decreased prejudice on implicit but not explicit measures. In Study 2, straight/heterosexual participants who were led to believe they exhibited some same-sex attraction showed reduced implicitly assessed prejudice, but only if they believed sexual orientation was biologically determined. Thus, learning of an identity-implying similarity with an outgroup can reduce implicit prejudice if that group membership is believed to be immutable. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Although intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, opportunities to experience such contact are often constrained by systems of segregation. Work on this problem has focused on divisions entrenched within institutions of residence, education, and employment. Our research employed a complementary approach, which treated segregation as the outcome of individuals’ movements over time within everyday life spaces. Taking as a case study Catholics’ and Protestants’ use of public environments in north Belfast, we used GPS tracking technology, combined with GIS analytics, to explore the time geography of residents’ activity space use over a 2-week period (Study 1). We also conducted a field survey to explore how psychological factors shaped their willingness to use activity spaces beyond their own communities (Study 2). Analysis based on around 1,000 hr of raw movement data revealed that north Belfast is marked by high levels of segregation, expressed via residents’ limited use of public spaces, facilities, and pathways located in outgroup areas. However, use of shared spaces is also common, with Catholics spending more time in such spaces than Protestants. Structural equation modeling suggested that residents’ self-reported willingness to use activity spaces outside their own communities was associated with both negative and positive intergroup contact—relationships partially mediated by realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anxiety over interaction across sectarian lines. Both kinds of contact and realistic threat were also associated with the time residents actually spent in spaces beyond their own communities. Opportunities for integrating psychological and geographic research on contact and segregation are highlighted.

AB  - Cities worldwide are striving to get to zero HIV stigma as a condition to get to zero new infections. We tracked an indicator of perceived HIV stigma across surveys of men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco from 2011 to 2017. Little improvement in perceived HIV stigma was observed, from 22.3% (95% CI 18.7–26.3) of MSM agreeing with the statement “Most people would discriminate against someone with HIV” in 2011 to 21.0% (95% CI 17.5–24.9) in 2017 (χ2 test for trend 0.252, p = 0.616). Success in ending the epidemic may flag without addressing the causes of HIV stigma. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Although intergroup contact is an effective means to improve intergroup attitudes, it does not always have a positive impact on them. This study introduces contact capacity as a factor that may impede intergroup contact. Longitudinal social network data (N = 6,600; Mage = 14.87 years) was collected in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and used to accurately calculate participants’ out-group, in-group, and total contact. Multilevel models (L1: students, L2: school classes) showed that the total amount of contact at Wave 1 negatively predicts individuals’ out-group friends at Wave 2 while controlling for out-group attitudes, existing out-group friendships and sociodemographic variables. An additional robustness check showed that this effect holds true for future in-group friendships. The study highlights the importance of contact capacity for whether people engage in intergroup contact and the contribution of social network analysis to contact research. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Using the 8th Round of the European Social Survey, we analyse the electoral competition between left-wing (LWPPs) and right-wing populist parties (RWPPs) in the six European countries where this type of competition has occurred (France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Lithuania and The Netherlands). By focusing on the competition between populist parties in the same sample of countries we can resolve what tells apart a LWPP voter from a RWPP voter. Thus, we study the factors that explain their different voting behaviour and confine our attention to the four main factors that affect populist competition: anti-elite attitudes, material deprivation, euro-scepticism and anti-immigration attitudes. Our results show that LWPPs and RWPPs voters are similar in their attitudes towards immigration and the European Union (EU) but differ in their attitudes towards elites and material deprivation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Tobacco control policies and other denormalization strategies may reduce tobacco use by stigmatizing smoking. This raises an important question: Does perceived smoking-related stigma contribute to a smoker's decision to quit? The aim of this study was to evaluate if perceived smoking-related stigma was associated with smoking cessation outcomes among smokers in Mexico and Uruguay. Methods: We analyzed prospective data from a panel of adult smokers who participated in the 2008-2012 administrations of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Surveys in Mexico and Uruguay. We defined two analytic samples of participants: the quit behavior sample (n = 3896 Mexico; n = 1525 Uruguay) and the relapse sample (n = 596 Mexico). Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate if different aspects of perceived stigma (ie, discomfort, marginalization, and negative stereotype) at baseline were associated with smoking cessation outcomes at follow-up. Results: We found that perceived smoking-related stigma was associated with a higher likelihood of making a quit attempt in Uruguay but with a lower likelihood of successful quitting in Mexico. Conclusions: This study suggests that perceived smoking-related stigma may be associated with more quit attempts, but less successful quitting among smokers. It is possible that once stigma is internalized by smokers, it may function as a damaging force. Future studies should evaluate the influence of internalized stigma on smoking behavior. Implications: Although perceived smoking-related stigma may prompt smokers to quit smoking, smoking stigma may also serve as a damaging force for some individuals, making quitting more difficult. This study found that perceived smoking-related stigma was associated with a higher likelihood of making a quit attempt in Uruguay but with a lower likelihood of successful quitting in Mexico. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In Zimbabwe, ethnicity has long informed the ways people make sense of their membership to the nation. Sport has since the turn of the century emerged as one of the major sites for the performance of ‘patriotic’ and subversive notions of ‘unity in diversity’. This article explores the significance of nicknaming and name-calling by Highlanders Football Club fans on virtual spaces, in illuminating the ethnic threat to dominant conceptions of nation in post-2000 Zimbabwe. The study argues that as psycho-social and cultural constructs, football team nicknames reveal deeper states of ethnic attitudes which indicate the politics of complex ethnic sentiments that destabilise popular notions of belonging to a nation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Adolescence can be a time of unconstructive behavior for many youth. This research examined if an intervention countering youth's stereotypes of teens as irresponsible fosters their constructive behavior. In two experimental intervention studies (Ns = 124 and 319) with seventh graders, stereotypes of teens as irresponsible were described as inaccurate portrayals; youth then provided their own observations of teens acting responsibly. Youth in this counterstereotyping intervention (vs. the control) held higher intentions for academic engagement and performed better on an academic task (i.e., a word-search puzzle). Over the 3 days following the intervention, their academic engagement was higher. Youth's risk taking was also reduced. Redirecting youth to see teens as responsible has the potential to provide a foundation for flourishing. © 2018 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Persons living with dementia and their carers experience stigma. Stigma intensifies social exclusion and threatens health and well-being. Decreasing stigma associated with dementia is a public health priority across national and international settings and is a key component of National Dementia Strategies. Research-based drama is an effective public health strategy for reducing stigma and enhancing well-being. In this article we focus on survey data from an evaluation of a research-based drama called Cracked: new light on dementia. Our analysis illustrates the effectiveness of Cracked in reducing stigma by: decreasing health care practitioners’ and family carers’ prejudice, fostering critical reflection about relational practices, and fostering a commitment to individual and collective action to address stigma. Cracked is well-positioned to respond to urgent calls for culture change, which include reducing societal misconceptions and stereotypes around dementia and promoting inclusive and meaningful engagement of persons living with dementia across all levels of society. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examines the discourses used by former service learners to describe their experiences of connection with intergroup others. These discourses were analyzed for how they balanced discourses of sameness with discourses of difference (MacPherson & Fine, 1995), as both are crucial for building intergroup solidarities that can actively engage inequality. Five discourses emerged in this analysis: emphasizing common humanity; engaging in real-time experiences; connecting through traumatic narratives; acknowledging mutual care, social distance, and hoping for others’ success; and grappling with personal accountability for social justice. Each resonated with a discourse of sameness and the dynamics of empathy. Each of the five discourses also increasingly focused on differences in social and biographical circumstance, which allowed some participants to claim a sense of social responsibility for others. Participants did not explicitly critique race and class inequality; thus, these dynamics were not represented as challenges that solidarities could address. The findings suggest the value of leveraging sameness and difference against one another within relational discourses to intensify reflexivity and criticality as integral parts of solidarity.

AB  - Ethnic diversity is generally associated with less social capital and lower levels of trust. However, most empirical evidence for this relationship is focused on generalized trust, rather than more theoretically appropriate measures of group-based trust. This article evaluates the relationship between ethnic diversity - at the national, regional and local levels - and the degree to which coethnics are trusted more than non-coethnics, a value referred to here as the 'coethnic trust premium'. Using public opinion data from sixteen African countries, this study finds that citizens of ethnically diverse states express, on average, more ethnocentric trust. However, within countries, regional ethnic diversity is associated with less ethnocentric trust. This same negative pattern between diversity and ethnocentric trust appears across districts and enumeration areas within Malawi. The article then shows, consistent with these patterns, that diversity is only detrimental to intergroup trust at the national level when ethnic groups are spatially segregated. These results highlight the importance of the spatial distribution of ethnic groups on intergroup relations, and question the utility of micro-level studies of interethnic interactions for understanding macro-level group dynamics. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

AB  - One of the central problems of contemporary political and moral thought is how to reconcile the cultural and social roots of morality with its objectivity or rational warrant, whether in the personal or political sphere. David Golemboski's reconstruction of Adam Smith's impartial spectator (European Journal of Political Theory, onlinefirst February 23rd 2015) provides a useful first approximation to this problem. What interests me is not whether Golemboski's critique of Smith's impartial spectator hits the mark, but rather, to what extent Golemboski's reconstruction of Smith's impartial spectator succeeds at addressing the problem of moral parochialism, as Golemboski claims. I shall argue in what follows that upon examination, Golemboski's reconstructed impartial spectator, far from resolving the problem of moral parochialism, actually exposes the limits of the value of impartiality as a resource for overcoming parochial prejudice, and the necessity of framing the problem of parochialism less as a matter of social and cultural bias than as a matter of the conditions of possibility of sound moral judgment. © 2016 Trustees for Roman Catholic Purposes Registered
