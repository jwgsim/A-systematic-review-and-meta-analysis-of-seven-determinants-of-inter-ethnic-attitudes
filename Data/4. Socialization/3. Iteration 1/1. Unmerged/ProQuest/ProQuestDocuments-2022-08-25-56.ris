T1  - MEANINGS AND IMPACTS OF CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS IN THE U.S. SOUTH
AN  - 2577680352
AB  - How do citizens interpret contentious symbols that pervade their community? And what downstream effects does state protection of these symbols have on how citizens of different backgrounds feel they belong in their community? We approach these questions through the lens of race and Confederate monuments in the American South. We rely on two original surveys to illustrate 1) the symbolic meanings Americans attach to these monuments and 2) how state protection of them impacts residents’ feelings of belonging. We find that perceptions of Confederate monuments vary by race: White U.S. residents are drastically less likely to perceive them as symbolic of racial injustice than are Black U.S. residents. Further, state protection of Confederate monuments leads to a diminished sense of belonging among Blacks, while leaving Whites unaffected. This research moves beyond scholarship examining simple support for or opposition toward contentious symbols, developing a deeper understanding of what meaning those symbols can hold for individuals and what their impacts are on individuals’ feelings of belonging and engagement in their communities.

T1  - Adaptation and Survival in the Civil War: The Experiences of a German American Soldier
AN  - 2515777377
AB  - Of the more than five hundred thousand immigrants who fought for the Union (nearly 24 percent of all northern troops), a little more than two hundred thousand of these men were Germans born abroad.1 Wanting to avoid the prejudices of old-stock soldiers, many preferred to enlist, whenever possible, in predominantly German fighting units.2 Although historians debate the extent to which the struggle either encouraged or impeded assimilation, few dispute how wartime experiences produced many different reactions and altered German Americans perceptions of themselves and the country.3 For German-born veterans inclined toward forms of assimilation, recoverable memories of wartime experiences became essential to subsequent efforts to make sense of the great upheaval and better grasp its relevance to their own lives.

Even when more thorough integrations were pursued by immigrants such as Humke, conscious adherence to an older Germanity usually persisted, reinforcing an almost dutiful interest in maintaining their special place within the diverse traditions of Deutschtum.7 This article examines Humkes transitioning into mid-nineteenthcentury America by placing emphasis on three overlapping aspects of his wartime service: (1) his military life and the bonds developed with fellow soldiers (producing a sense of belonging to both the army and the Union); (2) confrontations with southern civilians and slaves, which served as potent reminders of the stark alterity or otherness presented by the Old South (awakening explicitly northern patriotic sentiments that were made compatible with his German self-identification); and (3) the traumatic incarceration endured in the notorious Andersonville prisonerof-war camp (constituting not a break with his past but an experience that led to deeper reaffirmations of the above).

Not unlike others sowing their wild oats, I had committed my share of stupid but not truly wicked pranks and, like others my age, viewed the whole world as an object to be conquered.

[...]I decided to make the trip."

"16 Humke, his friend Dörmann, and several acquaintances who also spoke Plattdeutsch (Low German, spoken widely throughout northern Germany) agreed they must support the Union After harvest (October 1861), he and the others signed three-year enlistments in Clinton County and began training in Davenport as part of the Sixteenth Regiment Iowa Volunteer Infantry, which was labeled, somewhat misleadingly, the "German Regiment" because of the inclusion of large numbers of immigrant volunteers.17 While the regiment was largely old-stock American, Humke and his friends were attached to Company B, one of three companies heavily but not exclusively comprised of recruits who came from Prussia and neighboring states.18 Humkes subsequent war service was eventful.

T1  - Ageism Amplifies Cost and Prevalence of Health Conditions
AN  - 2348883500
AB  - Background and Objectives The persistent status of ageism as one of the least acknowledged forms of prejudice may be due in part to an absence of quantifying its costs in economic terms. In this study, we calculated the costs of ageism on health conditions for all persons aged 60 years or older in the United States during 1 year. Research Design and Materials The ageism predictors were discrimination aimed at older persons, negative age stereotypes, and negative self-perceptions of aging. Health care costs of ageism were computed by combining analyses of the impact of the predictors with comprehensive health care spending data in 1 year for the eight most-expensive health conditions, among all Americans aged 60 years or older. As a secondary analysis, we computed the number of these health conditions experienced due to ageism. Results It was found that the 1-year cost of ageism was $63 billion, or one of every seven dollars spent on the 8 health conditions (15.4%), after adjusting for age and sex as well as removing overlapping costs from the three predictors. Also according to our model, ageism resulted in 17.04 million cases of these health conditions. Discussion and Implications This is the first study to identify the economic cost that ageism imposes on health. The findings suggest that a reduction of ageism would not only have a monetary benefit for society, but also have a health benefit for older persons.

T1  - Personal and Societal Factors on Prejudice against Aboriginal People, Immigrants, Racial Minorities, and Refugees among Churchgoers in Australia
AN  - 2477271206
AB  - Psychology research on prejudice and religion has predominantly examined the personal factors associated with prejudice, with limited attention to societal factors. The present study analyzed data from the 2011 National Church Life Survey (NCLS) of churchgoers in Australia aged 15 years and over (N = 1,910; MAge = 54.3 years; SD = 19.2 years; range = 15 to 96; 61.0% women; 68.5% native-born) to determine the associations between personal and societal factors on prejudice against Aboriginal people, immigrants, racial minorities, and refugees. Findings showed that both personal and societal factors were associated with prejudice among churchgoers. For personal factors, the experience of church worship, Catholic denomination, and private religious commitment were negatively associated with prejudice. In addition, the immigrant status of the churchgoers was differentially associated with prejudice against Aboriginal people. Specifically, those born in other English-speaking countries were less prejudiced against Aboriginal people, compared to native-born churchgoers. In contrast, those born in non-English-speaking countries were more prejudiced against Aboriginal people than native-born churchgoers. For societal factors, the association between religious diversity and prejudice depended on the immigrant status of the churchgoers. Overall, religious diversity in the church neighborhood was negatively associated with prejudice against immigrants. Compared to the native-borns, immigrant churchgoers from both English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries were more prejudiced against immigrants, controlling for the religious diversity of the church neighborhood. Results are in line with the assertion that an integration of micro-level individual and interpersonal processes with macro-level societal factors represents a fruitful area for future research in prejudice.

T1  - The surprising politics of anti‐immigrant prejudice: How political conservatism moderates the effect of immigrant race and religion on infrahumanization judgements
AN  - 2331728788
AB  - Attitudes towards immigrants in the United Kingdom are worsening. It has been posited that these attitudes may reflect covert racial and religious prejudices, particularly among conservatives. To investigate this, two studies examined the role that immigrant race (Black/White; Study 1) and immigrant religion (Muslim/non‐Muslim; Study 2) played in immigrant infrahumanization judgements, using political conservatism as a moderating variable. There was a moderating effect of political conservatism; however, it was not in the predicted direction. The results of both studies indicated that immigrant race (Black) and immigrant religion (Muslim) predicted greater infrahumanization when political conservatism was low. Conservatives infrahumanized all immigrants equally (and more than liberals), but liberals were more sensitive to racial/religious biases in their evaluations of immigrants.

T1  - Anti-immigrant prejudice: Understanding the roles of (perceived) values and value dissimilarity
AN  - 2309758911
AB  - Although human values and value dissimilarity play pivotal roles in the prejudice literature, there remain important gaps in our understanding. To address these gaps, we recruited three British samples (N = 350) and presented Muslim immigrants, refugees, and economic migrants as target groups. Using polynomial regression analyses, we simultaneously tested effects of individuals' own values, their perceptions of immigrant values, and self-immigrant value dissimilarities on prejudice. Results indicated that favorability toward immigrants is higher when individuals hold higher self-transcendence values (e.g., equality) and lower self-enhancement values (e.g., power), and when they perceive immigrants to hold higher self-transcendence values and lower self-enhancement values. In addition, prejudice toward immigrants is higher when individuals who hold higher conservation values (e.g., security) perceive immigrants to value openness (e.g., freedom) more, suggesting a value dissimilarity effect. No value dissimilarity effects emerged when immigrants were perceived to be higher in conservation, self-transcendence, or self-enhancement values. Overall, these results showed that effects of values and value dissimilarity differ depending on which value dimension is considered. Additionally, the results revealed support for a novel mechanism with the motivation to be nonprejudiced underpinning the links between individuals' values and prejudice. Our discussion highlights the multifaceted manner in which values are linked to prejudice.

T1  - "GIRL STRIKERS" AND THE 1918 VANCOUVER STEAM LAUNDRIES DISPUTE
AN  - 2313622244
AB  - According to an annual federal report, seventeen accidents occurred in BC steam laundries in 1917, more than half among female employees.17 Ellen remembered an accident involving another female co-worker.

[...]she established the BC Women's Suffrage League at the Labor Temple, where she mobilized workingclass women, holding meetings of up to one hundred participants.26 Her advocacy for white working-class women led her to appear before the Board of Licence Commissioners at City Hall in 1915 to lobby for a "whites-only" hiring policy at hotels, a prejudicial stance Helena would reverse four years later. 27 When white women gained the provincial vote in British Columbia in 1917, Helena continued her union work, helping organize a strike at McLeod's Cafe after two union waitresses were fired.

[...]the executive decided against the strategy but passed a motion recommending union members be assessed one dollar a month to help strikers.65 The union continued to pressure Alderman Kirk.

According to a short article on the back page of the Daily World, on Halloween boys committed pranks, with the "only serious damage" being done to Wing Chung, a laundryman.

T1  - Enhancing the salience of free speech rights increases differential perceived free speech protections for criminal acts against Black versus White targets
AN  - 2269298499
AB  - Hate crime charges offer enhanced sentences for prejudice‐motivated acts in recognition of the injury that extends beyond the victim to other members of the targeted group. The present study builds upon and extends previous work illuminating how anti‐Black prejudice influences application of free speech protections to justify criminal acts against Black (vs. White) targets, which subsequently reduces support for hate crime charges for the act by investigating the potential effects of environmental cues that increase the salience of free speech rights. The present work tested the main and interactive effects of act target (Black vs. White), anti‐Black prejudice, and the salience of freedom of speech on perceived free speech protections for a prejudice‐motivated criminal act and the consequent influence on support for hate crime charges. Replicating previous findings, greater anti‐Black prejudice predicted more perceived free speech protections for Black‐targeted acts, which predicted less support for hate crime charges. Low‐bias participants viewed Black‐ versus White‐targeted acts as less protected by free speech rights and more deserving of hate crime charges; high‐bias participants viewed the two acts similarly. Making the right to free speech (compared to protections from search and seizure) salient amplified differential perceptions of free speech protections based on prejudice and target group, which predicted support for hate crime charges. This work holds implications for justification processes and highlights the importance of studying culture‐specific values.

T1  - I’m neither racist nor xenophobic, but: dissecting European attitudes towards a ban on Muslims’ immigration
AN  - 2240387321
AB  - During his presidential campaign, the new elected President of U.S., Donald Trump, called for a complete ban on Muslims from entering the United States. Although numerous European observers have been shocked by this proposal, using the most recent European Social Survey immigration module, this paper found that a sizeable proportion of Europeans support a similar ban in their own countries, e.g. Czech Republic (54 per cent), Hungary (51 per cent), Estonia (42 per cent), Poland (33 per cent), and Portugal (33 per cent). The paper also provides evidence that racism and immigration phobia play a key role in shaping Europeans’ support of a ban on Muslims’ immigration.

T1  - Intervention stigma: How medication-assisted treatment marginalizes patients and providers
AN  - 2298541812
AB  - Methadone and buprenorphine are drugs used to treat opioid use disorders, and are labeled the "gold standard" of treatment by the National Institutes of Health. Yet associating with these forms of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) subjects individuals to stigma from healthcare personnel both within and outside addiction treatment communities. This study uses the case of MAT to propose a new category of stigma: "intervention stigma." Unlike "condition stigmas" that mark individuals due to diagnosis, intervention stigma marks patients and health professionals due to involvement with a medical treatment or other form of intervention. In-depth interviews with 47 addiction treatment professionals explore how individuals working in MAT experience discrimination and prejudice from other healthcare professionals, especially abstinent treatment professionals who disagree with the use of medications to treat opioid use disorders. This discrimination and prejudice stems at times from stigma toward addiction diagnoses, and at other times toward unique features of MAT itself. The experiences of addiction treatment professionals illustrate how medical interventions can mark patients and professionals in ways that affect patient care, and thus must be added to the scope of destigmatization efforts operating in the health sector.

T1  - Belief in conspiracy theories and intentions to engage in everyday crime
AN  - 2265593102
AB  - Belief in conspiracy theories is associated with negative outcomes such as political disengagement, prejudice, and environmental inaction. The current studies – one cross‐sectional (N = 253) and one experimental (N = 120) – tested the hypothesis that belief in conspiracy theories would increase intentions to engage in everyday crime. Study 1 demonstrated that belief in conspiracy theories predicted everyday crime behaviours when controlling for other known predictors of everyday crime (e.g., Honesty–Humility). Study 2 demonstrated that exposure to conspiracy theories (vs. control) increased intentions to engage in everyday crime in the future, through an increased feeling of anomie. The perception that others have conspired may therefore in some contexts lead to negative action rather than inaction.

T1  - 'Austria First' revisited: a diachronic cross-sectional analysis of the gender and body politics of the extreme right
AN  - 2238517035
AB  - In this paper, Rheindorf and Wodak provide a discourse-historical analysis of extreme-right cultural politics in Austria, ranging from the blatant racism in the speeches of Vienna's former Deputy Mayor Johann Gudenus (now MP in the Austrian parliament) to the construction of an idealized national body in the election campaigns of the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (FPÖ), its programmatic agenda in handbooks and pamphlets, and the performances of far-right pop singer Andreas Gabalier. Rheindorf and Wodak argue that such cultural politics use a wide spectrum of discursive strategies both inside and outside established party politics and that the accompanying production of an ideal extreme-right subject is informed by nativist ideology. The cross-sectional analysis demonstrates that the cultural politics of the Austrian extreme right ranges from appropriated national symbols to coded National Socialist iconography. These politics pervasively construct a gendered and racialized national body, policed by a 'strict father' and nurtured by a 'self-sacrificing mother', vis-à-vis an apocalyptic threat scenario identified with migration, intellectual and political elites, cosmopolitanism and progressive gender politics.

T1  - 'Not always logical': binational/biracial marriages in Britain, 1900-1940
AN  - 2275070418
AB  - This essay explores the intersection of race, religion, and nationality in marriage by concentrating on unions between Britons and 'Arabs' (those from North Africa and the Middle East) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Focusing on this area, most of which was not in the British Empire, allows an analysis of the intersection between the empire and the larger world. Marriage was a nexus in the intertwined prejudices of race, empire, class, and religion. Though the British primarily blamed polygamy for any marital problems, their own gendered law of nationality was equally at fault. Indeed, the centrality of gender was clearest in three circumstances. First, many women refused to be 'white women in peril,' instead exercising agency in their relationships. Second, British men who moved to the Middle East, converted to Islam, and married Muslim women, became legal hybrids who struggled to pass on British nationality to their wives and children. Third, British-born women married to Middle Eastern Christians faced similar problems, despite marrying other monogamists. In the 1930s, the British government formed a committee to address these issues, but the committee failed to find solutions, in part because the members, like the British state, supported racial/national coverture for women and thus refused to consider granting women equal rights in nationality. As a result, women married to men of different races and nations remained vulnerable to desertion and divorce in the interwar period. Such issues both confirmed the importance of an imperial frame of mind, but also the fact that the dilemmas went well beyond the formal empire.

T1  - Right‐ and left‐wing prejudice toward dissimilar groups in cultural and economic domains
AN  - 2239104883
AB  - According to recent studies, people on both the political right and left show prejudice toward groups whose beliefs are in conflict with their own. This prediction applies to both cultural and economic dimensions of political beliefs. In three studies (N = 499) we demonstrate that people on both the cultural and economic right and left show negative attitudes toward groups on the other side of the given spectrum and that underlying this effect is the perception of value violation. In two out of three studies, we manipulated the extremity of target worldviews to further explore the causal chain between political beliefs, the perception of value violation, and prejudice. Our results showed a high degree of symmetry between the political left and right in their attitudes toward groups with dissimilar beliefs. However, although people on both sides of the political spectrum show prejudice toward each other, people on the cultural and economic right seem to be more sensitive to value violations than people on the left.

T1  - A Latent Class Analytic Approach to Identifying Structures of Classist Ideology from World-View Orientations
AN  - 2204475986
AB  - This study identified clusterings of individuals based on worldview orientations including epistemological style, right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance, and religious fundamentalism. The groups were compared on classist attitudes. U.S. participants (N = 272) completed a 2015 online survey. The latent class analysis's fit indices supported a three-group solution, including moderates (40%), progressives (35.8%), and traditionalists (25.2%). Assessing differences between classes, an analysis of covariance indicated that progressives had the lowest levels of classism, followed by moderates, then traditionalists, after controlling for demographics. This study illuminates worldview ideologies associated with classism and represents a step in understanding the underlying structure of classism.

T1  - "Some University Lecturers Wear Gay Pride T-shirts. Get Over It!": Denials of Homophobia and the Reproduction of Heteronormativity in Responses to a Gay-Themed T-shirt
AN  - 2186632775
AB  - This article explores an incident involving a gay pride T-shirt, printed with the slogan "Some people are gay. Get over it!," that I wore during a university lecture, and students' predominantly negative responses to it. I use the lens of modern prejudice research, particularly discursive psychological approaches to modern prejudice, to interpret the students' responses to a qualitative survey about their views on the T-shirt. They related strong feelings of upset and anger, particularly because I had-in their view-implicitly accused them of being homophobic. They passionately refused this supposed accusation on the grounds that "everything's equal now" and "gay people are no different from us." I argue that the ideological themes of cultural heterosexism and compulsory heterosexuality provide a productive framework for making sense of the students' responses, as they sanction a rational neoliberal subject who is both non-homophobic and inculcated into heteronormativity.

T1  - Street-level and government-level Islamophobia in the Visegrád Four countries
AN  - 2139171095
AB  - Islamophobic mobilization has become a crucial aspect of right-wing populist mobilization. Hafez's article focuses on the case of the Visegrád Four countries: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Based on reportedly widespread hostility against Muslims among the population in this region, one would assume a large potential for street-level activism analogous to the German Pegida. Yet, attempts to organize grassroots Islamophobic movements have not been particularly successful in the Visegrád Four. Using social movement theory, Hafez explains this by the fact that the issue of Muslim migration has been appropriated by the ruling parties, leaving little opportunity for independent grassroots mobilization.

T1  - Epistemic marginalisation and the seductive power of art
AN  - 2126717028
AB  - Many voices and stories have been systematically silenced in interpersonal conversations, political deliberations and historical narratives. Recalcitrant and interrelated patterns of epistemic, political, cultural and economic marginalisation exclude individuals as knowers, citizens, agents. Two questions lie at the centre of this article, which focuses on the epistemically – but also politically, culturally and economically – dominant: How can we sabotage the dominant’s investment in their own ignorance of unjust silencing? How can they be seduced to become acute perceivers of others’ experiences of oppression and reckon with their own participation in it? Situated at the intersection between political theory, aesthetics and epistemology, this article contributes a so-far-unexplored suggestion: that certain literary works create epistemic friction between shared, entrenched prejudices on the one hand, and representations of epistemic exclusion or authority, on the other. Their power to illuminate ideational, moral and experiential limitations makes them valuable tools in problematising, rendering visible and dislocating epistemic injustice, as well as other marginalisations it intersects with. To advance this argument, the article relies on insights from aesthetics, unpacking fiction’s multidimensional epistemic potential. Audre Lorde exemplifies literary works’ ability to seductively sabotage bias and provide audiences with prosthetic visions of unfamiliar experiences of marginalisation.

T1  - That latent sense of otherness: old and new anti-semitisms in postwar Italy
AN  - 2124554070
AB  - This article traces the evolution of anti-semitism in post-war Italy, from the early responses to the Holocaust to the increasingly concerning signs of contemporary anti-Jewish prejudice. Tracing the discourses of religious and secular attitudes towards Jews, the piece shows how resilient certain stereotypes are, and how assumptions about citizenship continue to undermine the respect of difference in Italy. With a reflection that is meant to be personal and scholarly at the same time, this contribution has the aim of facilitating a broader reflection, that spans instances of anti-semitism among the anti-racist Left, the correlation between unresolved anti-Jewish prejudice and widespread racist, anti-immigrant discourses, the challenges of a politicised memorialisation of the Holocaust, and also the role Jewish communities may play in this unsettling context.Alternate abstract:Italian summaryQuesto articolo prende in considerazione l’evoluzione dell’anti-Semitismo nell’Italia post-bellica, a partire dalle prime reazioni all’Olocausto fino ai preoccupanti segnali di riemersione del pregiudizio anti-ebraico nell’Italia contemporanea. Tracciando i contorni dei rapporti tra lo Stato italiano, la Chiesa cattolica e gli ebrei, questo contributo dimostra quanto alcuni stereotipi siano resistenti e adattabili, e quanto un certo concetto di cittadinanza continui ad ostacolare l’accettazione della differenza in Italia. Attraverso una riflessione che si propone di essere al contempo accademica e personale, l’articolo vuole facilitare una discussione più ampia, che consideri da una parte il rapporto tra anti-Semitismo e xenophobia, e dall’altra quello con l’anti-Sionismo, oltre alla politicizzazione della memoria dell’Olocausto e del ruolo, complesso, che le comunità ebraiche possono giocare in questo contesto.

T1  - More About When I’s Meet: The Intergroup Ramifications of I-Sharing, Part II
AN  - 2116550807
AB  - Previous research on I-sharing (the belief that one has shared the same, in-the-moment subjective experience with another person) revealed its promise for improving intergroup relations. We expand on this research by (a) pursuing the mechanism underlying I-sharing’s effects; (b) asking whether I-sharing promotes positive, behavioral intergroup outcomes; and (c) asking whether the effects of I-sharing generalize to the outgroup at large. Study 1 rules out the possibility that I-sharing promotes liking for an outgroup member via a process of subtyping. Study 2 shows that I-sharing promotes liking for an outgroup member because it promotes a general feeling of subjective connection to the I-sharer. Study 3 provides evidence that I-sharing promotes helping across intergroup lines, and Study 4 shows that I-sharing with one outgroup member reduces infrahumanization of the outgroup more generally. These four studies contribute to our growing understanding of the unique impact that I-sharing has on intergroup outcomes.

T1  - A weight‐related growth mindset increases negative attitudes toward obese people
AN  - 2108115336
AB  - In implicit personality theory, people with entity views or a fixed mindset perceive characteristics (e.g., intelligence) as uncontrollable, whereas people with incremental views or a growth mindset perceive characteristics as controllable. In addition to other benefits, the literature sometimes suggests that having a growth mindset will protect against prejudice, which the current two studies examine in terms of negative attitudes toward obese people. Participants (total N = 501) were randomly assigned to complete a questionnaire assessing attitudes toward an obese or nonobese person and a self‐theory questionnaire also assessed ideas about body weight. People with a growth mindset, and not fixed mindset, were more likely to have negative attitudes toward obese individuals, pointing to a potential downside of growth mindset in the obesity domain.

T1  - Community stigma, internalized homonegativity, enacted stigma, and HIV testing among young men who have sex with men
AN  - 2025382186
AB  - HIV testing is an important HIV prevention strategy for young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the United States, but the relationships between community‐ and individual‐level aspects of sexuality‐related stigma and HIV testing among YMSM are unknown. Data from a cross‐sectional survey included 334 HIV‐negative YMSM in Detroit. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine if place‐based community prejudice perceptions, internalized homonegativity, and sexuality‐related discrimination were associated with HIV testing. Increased perceptions of community prejudice were associated with lower odds of never testing, while increased internalized homonegativity was associated with greater odds of never testing. Experiences of discrimination had no association with HIV testing. Understanding the influence of sexuality‐related stigma (and especially place‐specific, community‐level stigma) on HIV testing could help improve public health messaging to increase HIV testing among YMSM.

T1  - Examining Discrimination against Women, non-Han Minorities, Intellectuals, and non-Communist Members among the Current China's Provincial Political Elites
AN  - 2025298334
AB  - Drawing on a new biographical database of the current provincial leaders, this article aims to test the hypothesis whether women, non-Han minorities, intellectuals, and non-Communist members are discriminated against in the Chinese political sphere. Our findings indicate that women, despite being underrepresented in leadership positions, do not suffer from discrimination in obtaining chief positions, after controlling for their capability related variables. Non-Communist members are still facing the glass ceiling, preventing their rise to the top of China's power structure, while at the same time being underrepresented in leadership positions. However, there is no evidence showing that intellectuals (i.e., doctoral degree holders) and non-Han minorities are suffering from underrepresentation, inequality, and discrimination. Further analysis indicates that traditional prejudice, discriminatory rule manipulation, and no well-defined and legally binding quotas are fundamental causes contributing to women's underrepresentation in power structure and non-Communist members' political discrimination.

T1  - Virginia’s Slavery Deliberations
AN  - 1994217027
AB  - For many deliberative theorists, the importance of a public exchange of reasons lies in its capacity to improve the quality of democratic decision making. The 1831-1832 debate over abolishing slavery in Virginia in the state’s House of Delegates raises the question of whether it can do so on its own. The bigotry of those opposing the abolition of Virginian slavery was matched only by the prejudice of those advocating for its end. This paper examines James Bohman’s sophisticated defense of deliberative democracy but argues for the value of negative and disclosive experience.

T1  - Islamophobic conspiracism and neoliberal subjectivity: the inassimilable society
AN  - 1992734214
AB  - O'Donnell analyses the confluence of Islamophobia and anti-government conspiracy theory in the works of the far-right think tank, the Center for Security Policy (CSP). He argues that, rather than only being a contemporary form of the religious and racialized demonologies that code 'Islam' as being the constitutive outside of 'the 'West-irrational, religious and authoritarian versus rational, secular and democratic-Islamophobic conspiracism should also be examined in the context of anxieties over the erosion of personal and state sovereignty under neoliberalization. Mobilizing an Islamophobic demonology that constructs 'Muslims' as inassimilable to 'American' subjectivity, the CSP's Islamophobic conspiracism projects this construction of absolute alterity on to American social and state systems. In doing so, O'Donnell contends, Islamophobic conspiracism takes neoliberalization's estrangement of the state and its citizens to its logical conclusion, transfiguring the societal processes that impact on the freedom of the individual-notably the state and civil society-into something inassimilable to that individual's claims to self-ownership and self-mastery.

T1  - "IS THAT DISCRIMINATION? I'D BETTER REPORT IT!" SELF-PRESENTATION CONCERNS MODERATE THE PROTOTYPE EFFECT
AN  - 2230284407
AB  - Prototypical kinds of sexism (a man derogating a woman) are more often detected than nonprototypical kinds (a woman derogating another woman) because the former ones match the mental representation of discrimination. We proposed a motivational process may also account for this prototype effect, and that the prototype effect is moderated by the observer's selfpresentation concerns. In two studies, we showed that under positive self-presentation instructions and under unspecified instructions, comparable levels of prototype effect are obtained, and are larger than under negative self-presentation instructions. These results suggest that the prototype effect which is typically obtained might partially be a consequence of a motivation to appear as egalitarian by reporting blatant forms of prejudice and discrimination rather than subtle ones.

T1  - Confronting Hate Collectively
AN  - 1949069167
AB  - Intimidation and harassment have spiked throughout the United States since the recent presidential election. Women, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, and LGBTQ people--including many of our own students--report palpable fear. In the 10 days after Election Day, the Southern Poverty Law Center collected 867 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment (Southern Poverty Law Center 2016). On November 16, 2016, a man in Sarasota, Florida, reported being physically attacked by a person who said, "You know my new president says we can kill all you f-ggots now" (Masek 2016). On November 17, 2016, a Puerto Rican family's car was vandalized in West Springfield, Massachusetts, with the words "Trump" and "Go home" scratched into it (Yan, Sgueglia, and Walker 2016). In late November 2016, more than 10 mosques received letters saying that Trump will "do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews" (Guerra 2016). In February and March 2017, Jewish cemeteries in St. Louis, Philadelphia, and Rochester, New York, were desecrated (Berlinger and Frehse 2017; Chokshi 2017).

T1  - Italian Validation of the Queer/Liberationist Scale (Short Version) in a Sample of University Students: Confirmatory Factor Analysis
AN  - 1883505328
AB  - The purpose of the study was to provide evidence on the validity and reliability of the Queer/Liberationist Scale (QLS, short version) among heterosexual Italian university students. The QLS analyzes new manifestations of sexual prejudice. A four-factor structure was supported. The subscales were related to gender, political ideology, religious beliefs, contact, supporting the civil rights of gay people, beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality, and sexual prejudice in the expected direction. Our results may be useful in planning intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual diversity.

T1  - Imagined contact can be more effective for participants with stronger initial prejudices
AN  - 1891673844
AB  - Imagined contact is an intervention that combines the prejudice-reduction of intergroup contact with the easy, low-risk application of imagery-based techniques. Accordingly, it can be applied where direct contact is difficult or risky. However, a possible limitation of imagined contact is that it may not be effective for participants with stronger initial prejudices, which would limit its usefulness and application. Two experiments (N1=103, N2=95) investigated whether initial prejudice moderated imagined contact's effects on explicit attitudes, behavioral intentions (Experiment 1), implicit attitudes, and petition-signing behaviors (Experiment 2) toward two different outgroups. In both experiments, imagined contact was more effective when initial prejudice was higher. Implications for imagined contact theory and application are discussed.

T1  - Television News Content of Minority Groups as an Intergroup Context Indicator of Differences Between Target-Specific Prejudices
AN  - 1880496565
AB  - Although research has shown that different types of prejudice are highly correlated, the existence of prejudice hierarchies indicates that individuals differentiate between target groups. Here we examine the relationship between television news coverage and differences in attitudes toward minority groups. We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N = 1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

T1  - Perceptions of Low-Status Workers and the Maintenance of the Social Class Status Quo
AN  - 1878226290
AB  - In this moment of increasing social inequalities after the Great Recession, studying the psychological processes that contribute to maintaining such inequalities is an urgent task for scholars. These processes include specific social-class-member perceptions that function to make these disparities seemingly fair. In particular, stereotypes and dehumanizing images of low-status workers have become powerful means for perpetuating social disparities across history and cultures. In the present work, we aim to reveal the invariance of these images and their importance in maintaining the social hierarchies through an integrated approach that combines a historical perspective with an illustrative review of the empirical research. Further, we aim to show how the stigma of low-status work affects the workers' self-view and may lead them to accept the status quo. We conclude by discussing the implications of this work for enriching the understanding of social-class divides and suggesting avenues for future research.

T1  - Cultural Expressions of Social Class and Their Implications for Group-Related Beliefs and Behaviors
AN  - 1878226288
AB  - In the wake of the Great Recession, rising inequality has increased social-class disparities between people in society. In this research, we examine how differences in social class shape unique patterns of cultural expression, and how these cultural expressions affirm ingroup beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 113), we provide evidence that cultural expressions of social class on an online social network can signal the social class of targets: by simply viewing the cultural practices of individuals captured in uploaded Facebook photographs, individuals express their social class in ways that allow it to be perceived by strangers at levels that are above chance accuracy. In Study 2 (N = 78), we provide evidence that individuals express their own ingroup space differently based on social class: Class-specific cultural practices (including interests in education, arts, newspapers, TV, and shopping) have implications for ingroup-related beliefs and political organizing. Individuals who reported being lower in subjective social class, relative to those reporting higher subjective social class, show cultural practices that relate to recognizing the ingroup's relative lack of control (lower group efficacy) and, in turn, a tendency to remain politically inactive when faced with an ingroup-related social disadvantage. In sum, our research provides evidence suggesting that expressions of culture derived from one's social class have the capacity to create and maintain social-class boundaries between individuals. Practical and political implications are discussed.

T1  - Warmth-Competence Tradeoffs in Impression Management across Race and Social-Class Divides
AN  - 1878226282
AB  - The Great Recession widened social-class divides, so social interactions across gaps in workplace status and in race generally may be more salient and more fraught. Different statuses and races both carry stereotypes that targets know (meta-perceptions, how they expect to be viewed by the outgroup). In both cross-status and cross-race interactions, targets may aim to manage the impressions they create. Reviewing literature and our own recent work invokes (a) the role of the Stereotype Content Model's two dimensions of social perception, namely warmth and competence; (b) the compensation effect, a tendency to tradeoff between them, especially downplaying one to convey the other; and (c) diverging warmth and competence concerns of people with lower and higher status and racial-group positions. Higher-status people and Whites, both stereotyped as competent but cold, seek to warm up their image. Lower-status people and Blacks, both stereotyped as warm but incompetent, seek respect for their competence. Overviews of two previously separate research programs and the background literature converge on shared findings that higher-status people, comparing down, display a competence downshift, consistent with communicating apparent warmth. Meanwhile, lower-status people, comparing up, often display less warmth, to communicate competence. Previous research and our diverse samples--online workplace scenarios, online cross-race interactions, and presidential candidates' speeches--suggest a novel, robust interpersonal mechanism that perpetuates race, status, and social-class divides.

T1  - 'The Germans are back': Euroscepticism and anti-Germanism in crisis-stricken Greece
AN  - 1862143686
AB  - The Eurocrisis has generated a deep and ongoing politicization of the EU within and across national public spheres, fuelling age-old and new political and social conflicts, which in turn shape public perceptions of crisis and the legitimacy of 'crisis government'. Focusing on Greece, an EU member state at the epicentre of the crisis, this paper examines how the European polity was contested in the first five years (2009-2013) of the 'Eurocrisis'. During this period, anti-German stereotypes resurfaced in the Greek public sphere in parallel with increasingly mainstream Euroscepticism. Nevertheless, analysis of news and social media content from this period shows that beneath this new-found scepticism towards the EU and Germany's role in it lie two much broader narratives: that of the power struggle between the people and the political elites; and that of an epic clash between diametrically different political ideologies.

T1  - Backlash
AN  - 1851015856
AB  - Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization. We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S. Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that, in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including support for violent versus non-violent collective action and unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical and self-fulfilling consequences.

Kunkeler's study challenges that assumption with his examination of Swedish fascist movements through the notion of self-identification. Using fascist periodicals, he traces the development of Swedish fascists' identification with the movement-in relation to matters of race, nation and the signifiers of 'fascism' and 'National Socialism'-from the early 1920s, when an overt attachment to Mussolini's project was evident, through a National Socialist phase showing cautious commitment to Nazi Germany, and ending with a final phase of strategic anonymity. In the face of criticism that fascism was an alien import, Swedish fascists adapted their public profile to accommodate such national sensitivities, developing a racialist ideology that was not confined by national borders and was believed to be more in tune with Swedish political culture at the time. When public opinion turned decisively against 'international fascism' in the mid-1930s, they were forced to discard the name and image of 'fascism' altogether and enter a final phase of public anonymity that, in any case, involved no significant ideological metamorphosis.

T1  - An Asian American community in the Southern United States: An exploration of fear of crime
AN  - 1802860243
AB  - This article is a qualitative study exploring fear of crime within an Asian American community in the southern region of the United States. As more and more Asian Americans move to the South, they force preexisting communities to encounter a burst of unfamiliar populations. The new makeup of communities in the South has resulted in fear of crime among the more recent residents. In interviews with leaders of the Asian American community, four major themes of fears were identified: violence against businesses, crime against personal property, invisibility and marginalization, and discrimination of individuals.

AB  - This paper looks at the context with which the research for the collection came out of. It draws on recent examples in the media and football and connects that up to the examples in the past particularly the incidents in the AFL that involved Nicky Winmar in 1993 and Michael Long in 1995 and the introduction of Rule 35. This paper sets the scene from which the rest of the collection positions itself.

T1  - Derogating obese individuals: the role of blame, contempt, and disgust
AN  - 1781480863
AB  - Weight stigma is pervasive and has profound negative consequences for obese individuals. The attribution-emotion approach of stigmatization holds that blame attributions relate to derogation stigmatized groups indirectly through anger and pity. Other research suggests that disgust is related to weight stigma. In the present studies, we investigate whether contempt is a reliable predictor of biases against obese individuals. Study 1 (N=297) shows that contempt partially mediates the relation between blame and both prejudice and support for weight related discrimination policies. Studies 2 and 3 (total N=406) added disgust and show that both contempt and disgust relate to social distance and prejudice. Contempt mediated the relation between blame and negative reactions toward obese individuals, even after controlling for other emotions, while disgust only mediated these relations in Study 2. Anger and pity did not show this mediating role, but pity was moderately associated with weight bias. Contempt is likely to play an important role in how people react to members of this stigmatized group.

T1  - Does authoritarianism imply ethnocentric national attitudes: A revised look at the "authoritarian triad" and right-wing ideology
AN  - 1790523732
AB  - Dozens of studies have shown that authoritarian people are ethnocentric. They are described as nationalistic, prejudiced, and hostile toward ethnic/national out-groups. However, it can be argued that this critical claim remains unproven, as researchers do not take into consideration the very conservative right-wing views typical of authoritarian people. To address this problem, two theoretical approaches were contrasted: the most commonly used right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) approach and the group authoritarianism approach. Both approaches define authoritarianism as the covariance of submission, aggression, and conventionalism, but they differ in that the former is inextricably related to right-wing ideology while the latter is not. This paper presents the results of two survey studies conducted on samples of 600 and 400 respondents. In Study 1, it was found that RWA and group authoritarianism had different patterns of relationships with in-group and out-group national attitudes, providing strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that the right-wing ideology generated ethnocentric national attitudes. Study 2 showed a strong direct effect of right-wing ideology on ethnocentric national attitudes, while the impact of "pure" authoritarian covariance is marginal and sometimes even seems to be negative (e.g.,ethnic prejudices). These findings suggest that authoritarianism has little to do with ethnocentric national attitudes. It is not the covariance of authoritarian attitudes that results in growing ethnocentrism. The true perpetrator can be found in the large component of right-wing ideology contained in such measurement instruments as the RWA scale.

T1  - Reducing Prejudice With Labels: Shared Group Memberships Attenuate Implicit Bias and Expand Implicit Group Boundaries
AN  - 1933733694
AB  - In three experiments, we used a novel Implicit Association Test procedure to investigate the impact of group memberships on implicit bias and implicit group boundaries. Results from Experiment 1 indicated that categorizing targets using a shared category reduced implicit bias by increasing the extent to which positivity was associated with Blacks. Results from Experiment 2 revealed that shared group membership, but not mere positivity of a group membership, was necessary to reduce implicit bias. Quadruple process model analyses indicated that changes in implicit bias caused by shared group membership are due to changes in the way that targets are evaluated, not to changes in the regulation of evaluative bias. Results from Experiment 3 showed that categorizing Black targets into shared group memberships expanded implicit group boundaries.

T1  - Alternatives: Silent compulsions: capitalist markets and race
AN  - 2010330839
AB  - This essay argues that the reproduction of racial categories and racial inequalities are both, in part, driven by processes fundamental to capitalist markets. Drawing from the work of Howard Botwinick and Barbara J. Fields, it suggests that racial problems are not solely the product of racial prejudice or racist institutional practices. Instead, it argues that seemingly race-neutral processes in capitalist markets are deeply racial in their implications.

T1  - An Underexamined Inequality: Cultural and Psychological Barriers to Men's Engagement With Communal Roles
AN  - 1730766745
AB  - Social psychological research has sought to understand and mitigate the psychological barriers that block women's interest, performance, and advancement in male-dominated, agentic roles (e.g., science, technology, engineering, and math). Research has not, however, correspondingly examined men's underrepresentation in communal roles, traditionally occupied by women (e.g., careers in health care, early childhood education, and domestic roles including child care). In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for research on this underexamined inequality by (a) outlining the benefits of increasing men's representation in communal roles; (b) reviewing cultural, evolutionary, and historical perspectives on the asymmetry in status assigned to men's and women's roles; and (c) articulating the role of gender stereotypes in creating social and psychological barriers to men's interest and inclusion in communal roles. We argue that promoting equal opportunities for both women and men requires a better understanding of the psychological barriers to men's involvement in communal roles.

T1  - Can stigma become a resource? The mobilisation of aesthetic-corporal capital by female immigrant entrepreneurs from Brazil
AN  - 1726785283
AB  - The proportion and visibility of Brazilian women and particularly the specific images of Brazil and Brazilians in the Portuguese imaginary have contributed to the construction of new versions of stigma and stereotypes surrounding them. Mainstream images of Brazilian women have incorporated prejudices about the sensuality of Creole women who are reminiscent of the Portuguese colonial imaginary. Starting from this stigmatised image, we show how Brazilian women entrepreneurs in the 'beauty' business filiere reinterpret and mobilise this perceived negative image, transforming it into an added value associated with an 'aesthetic' Brazilian body culture. This idea of 'body' aesthetics becomes a business resource transformed into aesthetic -- corporal capital, a key component of the Brazilian beauty business filiere. Empirically, this research is based on qualitative elements, in particular 25 interviews with Brazilian women entrepreneurs of the beauty filiere working in Portugal, collected for the project BELTS-W (Brazilian Entrepreneurial Links and Transnational Strategies -- Women).

T1  - A Religious Worldview: Protecting One's Meaning System Through Religious Prejudice
AN  - 1725035927
AB  - For some people, religion strongly influences their worldviews. We propose that religious outgroups threaten the foundational beliefs of people with strong religious worldviews (RWVs) by endorsing alternative belief systems and that this threat contributes to religious prejudice. To examine these ideas, we developed a measure of RWV strength and assessed the role of RWV threat in religious prejudice. Across five studies, strength of RWV was related to religious prejudice, including derogation and denial of alternative religious viewpoints, as well as support for suppressing, avoiding, and even aggressing against religious outgroups. These responses were strongest toward religious outgroups whose worldviews were the most different, and therefore most threatening. Mediational analyses revealed that strong RWV people expressed heightened prejudice because of the worldview threat posed by religious outgroup members. These findings indicate that the avoidance and subjugation of religious outgroups can serve as a worldview protection strategy for some people.

T1  - Diversity within Women of Color: Why Experiences Change Felt Stigma
AN  - 1719468129
AB  - This commentary offers additional considerations for better understanding and studying how women of color detect and respond to prejudice in the United States. Building on the thoughts raised by Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ), we highlight the importance of considering the socio-cultural and historic factors that differentially impact how sub-groups of women of color are perceived. Rather than generalizing work on stigma and discrimination across the diverse group of women of color, we discuss the importance and benefits of examining subgroups individually. In this commentary therefore, we pose research questions about three additional bodies of literature that add to Remedios and Snyder's ( 2015 ) ideas regarding experiencing stigma. First, we examine how stereotypes of subgroups of women of color differ. Next, we introduce other work in the field of intersectionality, e.g. gendered race, to argue that differences in the ways women of color are perceived may affect how they experience identity centrality, discrimination, and other identity-related processes. Finally, we provide empirical evidence highlighting the concept of intersectional invisibility as an additional form of felt discrimination.

T1  - On the Use of Race and Ethnicity as Variables in Violence Research
AN  - 1728660882; 201533335
AB  - Race and ethnicity are important social constructs. However, they are also complex constructs, and handling them appropriately and without bias in scientific research remains a challenge. This editorial identifies some limitations of common approaches to using race and ethnicity merely as 'social address' markers. The need to consider ways that race, ethnicity, and related constructs such as national origin might vary outside the United States is also addressed. Fourteen specific suggestions are offered for ways to improve the handling of race and ethnicity in psychology research, with a specific focus on the topic of violence research. These include fairly simple steps, such as using racial and ethnic designations as adjectives, not nouns, and providing detailed racial and ethnic membership for your entire sample without collapsing across dissimilar groups just because they are few in number. Others are more resource-intensive steps, such as adopting sampling frames that will lead to more diverse samples or greater inclusion of understudied groups. With specific regard to violence research, we need more research on topics such as hate crimes, cultural adaptations of prevention and intervention programs, and evaluations of whether prevention and intervention work equally well across racial and ethnic groups.

T1  - Managers are potential levers of discrimination within organizations: the role of group identification, assimilation endorsement and power
AN  - 1699176758
AB  - Two studies examined the relationship between identification with a high-position group in organizational settings (managers) and bias toward immigrants. In Study 1, (N=182; N=145), results showed positive relationships between identification with the managers' group and both in-group bias and prejudiced attitudes, indirectly through assimilation endorsement. In Study 2 (N=117), in addition to replicating the results of Study 1, we found a significant interaction, revealing that power moderated the link between identification with a high-position group and bias. Moderated mediation analysis indicated that linking managers' group identification to bias and prejudiced attitudes through assimilation was only significant for high perceived power. Results are discussed in light of interethnic ideologies and the social identity theory. Some practical implications are provided.

T1  - Twenty years on: lesbian, gay and bisexual police officers' experiences of workplace discrimination in England and Wales
AN  - 1680151405; 201515659
AB  - Twenty years ago Mark Burke's pioneering research into homosexuality and policing evidenced widespread prejudice and hostility toward lesbian, gay and bisexual police officers in nine forces across England and Wales. These serving officers were felt to represent the most serious kind of contamination and threat to the integrity of the British Police Service by their heterosexual colleagues. Twenty years on this research, which represents one of the largest ever surveys of LGB police officers in England and Wales (N=836), evidences that just under one-fifth reported experiencing discrimination, with those in small and large forces, those in senior ranks and non-uniformed positions, and those who identify as gay male and Black, Minority Ethnic experiencing the highest levels of victimisation in training, deployment and promotion. Like Brown and Woolfenden, the authors conclude that a central aim of the diversity reform agenda must be a renegotiation of the psychological contract between staff and the organisation. A relational setup must be sought where mutual expectations of exchange are established and efforts are made to create a rich working environment that draws upon and invests in the subjective and intersubjective identity characteristics of LGB police officers.

T1  - The person-based nature of prejudice: Individual difference predictors of intergroup negativity
AN  - 1758417047
AB  - Person-based factors influence a range of meaningful life outcomes, including intergroup processes, and have long been implicated in explaining prejudice. In addition to demonstrating significant heritability, person-based factors are evident in expressions of generalised prejudice, a robust finding that some people (relative to others) consistently score higher in prejudice towards multiple outgroups. Our contemporary review includes personality factors, ideological orientations (e.g., authoritarianism), religiosity, anxiety, threat, disgust sensitivity, and cognitive abilities and styles. Meta-analytic syntheses demonstrate that such constructs consistently predict prejudice, often at the upper bounds of effect sizes observed in psychological research. We conclude that prejudice theories need to better integrate person- and situation-based factors, including their interaction, to capture the complexity of prejudice and inform intervention development.

T1  - Biases in the Perception of Barack Obama's Skin Tone
AN  - 1667949849; 201512720
AB  - White Americans higher in prejudice were less likely to vote for Barack Obama than other Americans. Recent research also demonstrated that supporters and opponents of Mr. Obama engaged in skin tone biases, i.e., they perceive Mr. Obama's skin tone as lighter or darker in line with more positive or negative views of him. Across two studies we hypothesized that skin tone biases occur as a function of two independent sources: racial prejudice, which is always related to skin tone bias, and political partisanship, which is related to skin tone bias primarily during elections. Study 1 assessed perceptions of Mr. Obama's skin tone shortly before and after the 2008 Presidential election, and shortly after the first inauguration. Study 2 assessed perceptions in the middle of his first term, immediately prior to the 2012 Presidential election, and 1 year into his second term in office. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that partisan skin tone bias was limited to the election period, whereas prejudice-based skin tone biases occurred independent from any election.

T1  - From Sex to Gender: A University Intervention to Reduce Sexism in Argentina, Spain, and El Salvador
AN  - 1634405018
AB  - We present an intervention to reduce gender prejudice in future professionals of social sciences in three samples from Argentina (N = 28), Spain (N = 83), and El Salvador (N = 67), with slight differences across countries. The program was based on scientific research on sexism and gender-based power aimed at: (1) increasing awareness of gender inequalities; (2) reducing sexism in men and women; (3) providing participants with resources to implement social interventions. First the intervention is described, and then empirical evidence of its efficacy is provided. Results showed a reduction of benevolent sexism (BS), hostile sexism (HS), and essentialist views, and higher support for collective actions in Argentina (Study 1). HS and system-justifying beliefs were reduced and support for collective action increased in Spain (Study 2). In El Salvador, HS, BS (marginally), system-justifying, and homophobic beliefs were reduced (Study 3). Implications for interventions and policy making are discussed.

T1  - Commentary: Encouraging Confrontation
AN  - 1634404955
AB  - Sexism differs from other prejudices due to intimate interdependence between the sexes, requiring gender-specific research on effective ways to confront sexist behavior. Two central themes emerge from the current issue: (i) who can confront sexism successfully and (ii) how organizations and leaders should intervene. The burden to confront often falls on female targets, who experience social costs for doing so, especially when perpetrators have greater power. Targets therefore need allies, including men, who are not perceived as having self-interested motives for confronting. Organizations--through leaders and policies--represent the most important and effective allies. Organizational priorities can determine whether female targets suffer in silence or are empowered to confront. Fortunately, there is increasing popular interest, both among women and organizations, to address barriers to women's advancement. This special issue represents an important first step, outlining promising strategies for confronting sexism.

T1  - Fostering Trauma-Free Mental Health Workplace Cultures and Reducing Seclusion and Restraint
AN  - 1644721513
AB  - Literature on the factors which precipitate the use of seclusion and restraint on mental health consumers is typically confined to their behaviour and/or the behaviour and attitudes of the involved clinical staff. These understandings do not sufficiently take account of workplace cultural factors and political influences within a societal context of prejudice against people with mental illness. The elimination of coercive and restrictive clinical practices is called for by mental health carer forums, national and state level mental health reports and policies, and concerned mental health clinicians. The authors argue this will require radical change by all staff in the mental health system as violence is a systemic issue which creates a culture where clinical practices are prone to reinforcing this systemic violence. A mapping template and a warrants schema are presented as examples of tools to enable trauma-informed cultural change in mental health systems.

T1  - "Black Horror on the Rhine": Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War
AN  - 2048071610
AB  - In the aftermath of the First World War, a storm of protest met the stationing of colonial African troops in the occupied German territories. The campaign, spearheaded by legendary Congo reformer Edmund Dene Morel, influenced a broad spectrum of leftists, feminists, anti-imperialists, and pacifists in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. In the United States and Canada the mainstream labour movement—the American Federation of Labor in the United States and its Canadian affiliate the Trades and Labour Congress—generally did not respond to Morel’s appeal. In contrast, idealistic leftists, feminists, anti-imperialists, and peace activists—men and women most committed to the creation of a world without war, racial prejudice, and gender inequality—took up Morel’s anti-imperialist and blatantly racist campaign. This article seeks to explain how this seeming contradiction came to be.
Dans la foulée de la Première Guerre mondiale, une tempête de protestations s’est élevée contre le stationnement de troupes coloniales africaines dans les territoires allemands occupés. La campagne, dirigée par Edmund Dene Morel, légendaire réformateur du Congo, a influencé un large éventail de gauchistes, de féministes, d’anti-impérialistes et de pacifistes en Grande-Bretagne, aux États-Unis et au Canada. Aux États-Unis et au Canada, les courants principaux du mouvement syndical – la fédération américaine du travail et son affilié canadien le Congrès des métiers et du travail – n’ont de façon générale pas répondu à l’appel de Morel. En revanche, les gauchistes, féministes, anti-impérialistes et pacifistes – autant d’hommes et de femmes idéalistes, engagés dans la création d’un monde sans guerre, sans préjugés raciaux et sans inégalités entre sexes – ont adopté1 la campagne anti-impérialiste et ouvertement raciste de Morel. Le présent article cherche à expliquer cette contradiction apparente.

T1  - When do negative response expectancies undermine interracial relations? The role of the Protestant work ethic
AN  - 1542000776; 201426766
AB  - Although accumulating research indicates that negative expectations about interracial interactions undermine the quality of such interactions, little research has examined the factors that moderate the influence of negative expectations on responses to interracial interactions. We propose that individuals who endorse work-related ideologies such as the Protestant work ethic (PWE) expect that outcomes in interracial interactions should be contingent upon individual effort. As a result, such individuals are hypothesized to respond in a negative manner when they believe that regardless of their effort in an interracial interaction, interaction partners will respond negatively to them (termed negative response expectancies). Consistent with this hypothesis, negative response expectancies led to an increased desire to avoid interracial interactions (Studies 1a and 1b) and more antisocial behavior directed at an interracial interaction partner among individuals who strongly endorsed the PWE (Study 2). Across the studies, effects of negative response expectancies were relatively weaker or non-significant among individuals lower in the PWE. The implications of these findings for understanding the interplay between the PWE and expectancies in interracial interactions are discussed.

T1  - Socio-cultural influences on the transmission of HIV among gay men in rural China
AN  - 1511118646
AB  - Bisexual behaviours are relatively common among men who have sex with men in China. This pilot study aims to reveal the complex processes through which such men manage their sexuality, family responsibilities and sexual behaviours in a rural Chinese setting. A total of 15 men who have sex with men were recruited by purposive sampling. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted to explore participants' views about their sexual experiences and practices. The Chinese traditional moral code, family values and gender roles that form the crucial components of Confucianism were reflected in the participants' efforts to maintain familial and social harmony through a compromised form of sexual partnership. Most study participants demonstrated a mixed experience of social stigma, sexual naivete and ignorance of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Under cultural and family pressure, men who have sex with men entered heterosexual marriages with the intention of maintaining a balance between their collectivist (familial) obligations and their individualistic (same-sex sexual) desires. However, the opaque nature of their concurrent sexual relationships may endanger their personal health and accelerate HIV and STI transmission. Reducing the stigma and social prejudice associated with male same-sex sexual relations is essential for any culturally sensitive HIV-prevention programme to succeed in rural China.

T1  - TOWARD A FILIPINO CRITICAL PEDAGOGY: Exposure Programs to the Philippines and the Politicization of Melissa Roxas
AN  - 1511574713
AB  - Scholars often turn to the activism of US-born Filipino Americans in their militant confrontation of the US-supported Marcos dictatorship during the 1970s and 1980s as a political apex. This claim raises a series of related questions. What has happened to such militant activism since the downfall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986? Does a Filipino American identity motivated by the eradication of US neocolonialism in the Philippines and the ideals of collective emancipation for Filipinos in the US, the Philippines, and throughout a global diaspora still exist in the twenty-first century? In seeking to address these questions, this article also considers the ways in which Asian American studies can continue to honor and build upon its rich social movement legacy by advancing theoretical frames that are in interchange with global struggles and community experiences of resistance. Due to the persistent nature of discrimination felt by Filipino immigrant families in the US, tactics were enacted to shelter their offspring from having to face similar expressions of racial prejudice and ridicule.

T1  - Age, class and race discrimination: their interactions and associations with mental health among Brazilian university students
AN  - 1629330104; 201442352
AB  - Although research on discrimination and health has progressed significantly, it has tended to focus on racial discrimination and US populations. This study explored different types of discrimination, their interactions and associations with common mental disorders among Brazilian university students, in Rio de Janeiro in 2010. Associations between discrimination and common mental disorders were examined using multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for confounders. Interactions between discrimination and socio-demographics were tested. Discrimination attributed to age, class and skin color/race were the most frequently reported. In a fully adjusted model, discrimination attributed to skin color/race and class were both independently associated with increased odds of common mental disorders. The simultaneous reporting of skin color/race, class and age discrimination was associated with the highest odds ratio. No significant interactions were found. Skin color/race and class discrimination were important, but their simultaneous reporting, in conjunction with age discrimination, were associated with the highest occurrence of common mental disorders.

T1  - Religious toleration of Muslims in the German Public Sphere
AN  - 1559008042; 201432218
AB  - This study investigates public resistance towards Muslims' civil liberties, such as the wearing of headscarves, the provision of Islamic education and the building of mosques as well as the official recognition of Islam by creating a Islamic public holiday. Explanations were sought in negative perceptions and attitudes towards Muslims and individual value orientations. The main findings, based on path analysis and Mokken scale analysis of German 2009 survey data, are (1) that people differentiate between what they are asked to support, (2) that support for such restrictions exists among people with a negative as well as among people with a positive attitude towards Muslims, and (3) that individual value orientations have an independent effect on perceptions and attitudes towards Muslims and support for Muslims' civil liberties. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the relation between prejudice and tolerance, as well as the current debates about practising Islam in Western societies.

T1  - Cross-Gender Communication: A Gateway to the 21st Century
AN  - 1553512044
AB  - The present paper sets itself the task of analyzing the effects globalization had on gender identities, by bridging two different worlds through the "eyes" of Jane Austen's female characters of Sense and Sensibility, and Pride and Prejudice. Even though considered outdated by some, the two novels are still enjoyed by a number of people who regard them as mere reflections or contradictions of what is happening nowadays in all areas of social, cultural and political life. Both novels have a contemporary version as they have been parodied and turned into modern stories with sea-monsters and zombies, but still preserving something from the elegance and mannerism typical for 19th century England.

T1  - Themes in Heterosexuals' Responses When Challenging LGBT Prejudice
AN  - 1441796029
AB  - The purposes of this study were (a) to examine themes in heterosexuals' responses when responding to LGBT prejudice, and (b) to explore the potential influence of educational information about LGBT topics on these themes of responses. Heterosexual undergraduate students (N=225) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: participants received information about LGBT topics, or they did not. Then participants were asked to speak out in a written format against LGBT prejudicial statements they read in a blog taken directly from the Internet. Using content analysis, 16 codes were generated from the literature on the confrontation of prejudice and from participants' responses. The 16 codes were then grouped conceptually into four themes with the following percent representations in participants' responses: values (38.9 %), knowledge promotion (36.2 %), attack (16.7 %), and personal participation (8.4 %). No differences between conditions emerged in the prevalence of these themes. Implications for ally interventions, multicultural education, and future research are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Resilience in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals
AN  - 1442819011
AB  - To promote psychological health among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals, more comprehensive research on resilience factors in LGB individuals is needed. This article presents a theoretical framework based on the existing literature, with an eye toward guiding future research in this area. Social support clearly serves as a resilience factor for LGB individuals, in part through its ability to lower reactivity to prejudice. Social support is particularly effective when it specifically supports people's sexual orientation and is congruent with individuals' developmental needs. The ability to accept emotions and to process them in an insightful manner also buffers the negative impact of prejudice. In addition, hope and optimism allow LGB individuals to maintain psychological health when faced with prejudice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Position toward the status quo: Explaining differences in intergroup perceptions between left- and right-wing affiliates
AN  - 1442127416
AB  - Challengers, as opposed to defenders, of the status quo ascribe more negative motives for the attitudes of their opponents and more positive motives to their allies. This may be associated with a heightened social cost involved in challenging the generally considered good and true. Most social issues are associated with ideology, and conservatives display more prejudices than liberals. Hence, it is unclear whether ideology or position toward the status quo per se drives these attributions. In two studies, position showed to be a stronger predictor of biased intergroup perceptions than ideology. Both left- and right-wing affiliates displayed stronger biases when in opposition. This supports the notion that the challenging position per se, elicits group differentiation. Results are important for understanding of negative campaigning and political action.

T1  - Sexist Humor and Beliefs that Justify Societal Sexism
AN  - 1622295257; 201438253
AB  - Research suggests that sexist humor creates a context that justifies the expression of prejudice against women. The present research investigates whether sexist humor has broader social consequences related to societal sexism. An experiment supported our hypothesis that men higher in hostile sexist attitudes express beliefs that justify the gender status-quo to a greater degree after exposure to sexist humor versus neutral humor or non- humorous sexist material. Specifically, male participants higher in hostile sexism reported greater acceptance of current gender relations and greater acceptance of societal devaluation of women after reading sexist jokes than after reading neutral (nonsexist) jokes or non-humorous sexist material.

T1  - "I Guess What He Said Wasn't That Bad": Dissonance in Nonconfronting Targets of Prejudice
AN  - 1400007189
AB  - Although confrontations can be an effective means of reducing prejudicial responding, individuals often do not confront others due to the interpersonal costs. In the present research, we examined the intrapersonal implications of not confronting prejudice. In three studies, female participants were exposed to a confederate who made a sexist remark. Consistent with self-justification theories, in Study 1, participants who valued confronting and were given the opportunity to confront -- but did not -- subsequently made more positive evaluations of the confederate. Study 2 found that when participants were given a chance to affirm an important aspect of the self prior to evaluating the confederate, these inflated evaluations of the confederate did not occur. Finally, in Study 3, participants who initially valued confronting but did not confront a sexist partner reduced the amount of importance they placed on confronting. These data reveal that there are important intrapersonal consequences of not confronting prejudice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Act Your (Old) Age: Prescriptive, Ageist Biases Over Succession, Consumption, and Identity
AN  - 1933734507
AB  - Perspectives on ageism have focused on descriptive stereotypes concerning what older people allegedly are. By contrast, we introduce prescriptive stereotypes that attempt to control how older people should be: encouraging active Succession of envied resources, preventing passive Consumption of shared resources, and avoidance of symbolic, ingroup identity resources. Six studies test these domains, utilizing vignette experiments and simulated behavioral interactions. Across studies, younger (compared with middle-aged and older) raters most resented elder violators of prescriptive stereotypes. Moreover, these younger participants were most polarized toward older targets (compared with middle-aged and younger analogues)--rewarding elders most for prescription adherences and punishing them most for violations. Taken together, these findings offer a novel approach to ageist prescriptions, which disproportionately target older people, are most endorsed by younger people, and suggest how elders shift from receiving the default prejudice of pity to either prescriptive resentment or reward.

T1  - Obesity as a status cue: perceived social status and the stereotypes of obese individuals
AN  - 1433108387
AB  - Two studies examined the relationship between social status and obesity stereotypes. In Study 1, obese individuals were seen as having lower status than non-obese individuals, and status ratings were positively correlated with common obesity stereotypes. In Study 2, targets were depicted as overweight or lean, and as having a high-status or low-status job. High-status heavy targets were rated as less lazy and more competent than were their low-status counterparts, but status did not impact ratings of sloppiness or warmth. The findings indicate that obesity can serve as a status cue. Furthermore, the findings provide preliminary evidence that status is related to the attribution of certain stereotypes to obese individuals, while also highlighting the multifaceted nature of obesity stereotypes.

T1  - Sleep and prejudice: a resource recovery approach
AN  - 1433108359
AB  - Does sleepiness make one more likely to engage in stereotyping? Are people more likely to be prejudiced because of a poor night of sleep? Borrowing from ego depletion theory and research on self-control and prejudice, the present work investigates these questions. We suggest that sleep is a diminishable resource that fuels self-control and is, therefore, necessary for inhibiting prejudice. A series of 3 studies show that sleep did influence prejudice. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between sleep and prejudice was marginally moderated by negative implicit associations, such that this relationship primarily held true for individuals who have high negative implicit associations. These results highlight the critical role that sleep plays in suppressing prejudice.

T1  - Heterosexuals' Attitudes Toward Transgender People: Findings from a National Probability Sample of U.S. Adults
AN  - 1357002397
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Using data from a national probability sample of heterosexual U.S. adults (N=2,281), the present study describes the distribution and correlates of men's and women's attitudes toward transgender people. Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender people are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Audism: A Theory and Practice of Audiocentric Privilege
AN  - 1661813259
AB  - More than 30 years ago, Tom Humphries coined the term "audism" to describe audiocentric (based on hearing and speaking) assumptions and attitudes of supremacy. Only a handful of scholarly articles mention the concept of audism and not one of those is published outside of Deaf Cultural Studies. In this article, audism is broadly defined in the ideological contexts of individual, institutional, metaphysical, and laissez-faire prejudices. Audism is further explained in the context of overt, covert, and aversive practices of discrimination. Examples of the intersections of the theory and practice of audiocentric privilege are explored. Based on critical observations of audism as a stratifying system of oppression, four recommendations are made: increasing public awareness of Deaf American contributions to society (multiculturalism), infusing Deaf-centric curriculum content in education (equity), advocating intergroup dialogues as a transformative pedagogy that further exposes audism as a social injustice (intercultural responsibility), and promoting community service opportunities (ethical citizenship) for students to do volunteer work in the Deaf American Community.

T1  - Prostitution and Clients' Responsibility
AN  - 1364701639; 201327981
AB  - In the last decades of the twentieth century, a major change has occurred in the public understanding of prostitution, with the focus shifting from the sex worker to the client. On the social scientific side, studies on clients have growingly shed light on motivations and behaviors of men who buy sex. On the juridical-political side, in many countries across the globe a trend has emerged towards the criminalization of clients, represented as responsible for the perpetuation and proliferation of the sex market and for its oppressive and victimizing effects on sex workers. The aim of this paper is to retrace this turn and to discuss its political and cultural meaning, showing how the discourse on male responsibility in prostitution involves the risk of unilateral stances and partial views on the sex market. What I argue is that new gender-sensitive thinking on prostitution is needed, context-rooted and free from prejudicial understandings.

T1  - Berea College-Coeducationally and Racially Integrated: An Unlikely Contingency in the 1850s
AN  - 1512219175; 201410052
AB  - The anti-slavery ministry of Rev. John G. Fee and the unlikely establishment of Berea College in Kentucky in the 1850s, the first college in the southern United States to be coeducationally and racially integrated, are examined to further understand the conditions surrounding these extraordinary historical events. The Berea case illustrates how early twentieth century legal institutions were suffused with racism and justifications for racial discrimination even to the extent that they neutered the laws intended to provide redress to Black citizens, while the court approved of racial prejudice as a natural protection from what it considered to be an unnatural amalgamation.

T1  - Money and metaphor in Welby Prize winner F. Tonnies' "Philosophical terminology": Some critical considerations
AN  - 1504422814; 201405108
AB  - "Philosophical Terminology" (1899-1900), the essay by Ferdinand Tonnies with which he won the Welby Prize, constitutes the first -- and for long the only -- example of dialogue between sociology and semiotics. Tonnies delineated a complex theory of signs beginning from his theory of will as developed in his monograph Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887). Through an original interpretation of the analogy between word and money he was ahead of his times in foreseeing the fundamental role carried out by language in structuring social relations. All the same, his analogical approach to the relation between word and money -- as had already been observed by Victoria Lady Welby -- also represents the weak point in his argumentations in the essay in question. An important contribution for a better understanding of the relations subtending the social production processes of signs and language is that offered by Ferruccio Rossi-Landi with his homological method. Tonnies' own work can be read in this framework and further developed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race, neighborhood context, and risk prediction
AN  - 1551002081; 201431031
AB  - The role of neighborhood influence and context is largely absent from the literature on risk and prediction. In this paper, we argue that the differential treatment of black and white suspects, defendants, and offenders may result from the social and spatial mismatch, or separation, between both groups. This mismatch, in turn, has implications for attitudes towards members of both racial groups in the criminal justice system. Black neighborhoods are locked in a cycle of disadvantage in which certain structural characteristics -- concentrated disadvantage, residential instability, high crime rates, racial/ethnic heterogeneity, and implicit racial biases -- reciprocally influence each other. We propose a sociocognitive model that combines cognitive mechanisms of implicit racial bias (e.g. attitudes) and structural level (e.g. concentrated disadvantage) factors. The sociocognitive approach to risk prediction stresses the impact that personal beliefs and attitudes have on criminal justice actors' decisions about whom to arrest, prosecute, and imprison and thereby provides a framework for explaining why racial discrimination persists within an atmosphere that prides itself on being neutral and yet is often anything but. Finally, we offer recommendations for reducing racial prejudice and stereotypes, and minimizing their effects on judgments involving risk. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The difficulty of reconciliation
AN  - 1125221544; 201243272
AB  - Two notions of reconciliation exist. The weak or thin conception is akin to 'resignation'. It is sought by groups that have waged war against one another but have come to the realization that neither can win. Reconciliation in this sense results from an enforced lowering of expectations. In the stronger sense, reconciliation means a virtual cancellation of enmity or estrangement via a morally grounded forgiveness, achievable only when conflicting groups acknowledge collective responsibility for past injustice, and shed their deep prejudices by a profound and painful transformation in their identities. It is because this process is not possible without a somewhat brutal confrontation with oneself and a painful recognition of one's own moral degradation that reconciliation is difficult to achieve.

T1  - Mental Health in Violent Crime Victims: Does Sexual Orientation Matter?
AN  - 1692287981; 201523977
AB  - The present study investigates victim sexual orientation in a sample of 641 violent crime victims seeking emergency medical treatment at a public-sector hospital. Victim sexual orientation was examined as it: (a) varies by type of violent crime and demographic characteristics, (b) directly relates to psychological symptoms, and (c) moderates the relationship between victim and crime characteristics (i.e., victim gender, victim trauma history, and type of crime) and psychological symptoms (i.e., symptoms of acute stress, depression, panic, and general anxiety). Results showed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) victims were more likely to be victims of sexual assault. Heterosexual victims were more likely to be victims of general assault and shootings. LGBT victims demonstrated significantly higher levels of acute stress and general anxiety. Moreover, victim sexual orientation moderated the association of type of crime with experience of panic symptoms. Also, victim sexual orientation moderated the relation of victim trauma history and general anxiety symptoms. Results are discussed in relation to victimization prevalence rates, sexual prejudice theory, and assessment and treatment of violent crime victims. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Domination, Epistemic Injustice and Republican Epistemology
AN  - 1347781395; 201317768
AB  - With her conception of epistemic injustice, Miranda Fricker has opened up new normative dimensions for epistemology; that is, the injustice of denying one's status as a knower. While her analysis of the remedies for such injustices focuses on the epistemic virtues of agents, I argue for the normative superiority of adapting a broadly republican conception of epistemic injustice. This argument for a republican epistemology has three steps. First, I focus on methodological and explanatory issues of identifying epistemic injustice and argue, against Fricker, that identity prejudice fails to provide a sufficient explanatory basis for the spread and maintenance of such systematic epistemic injustice. Second, this systemic basis can be found not so much in the psychological attitudes of individual knowers, but in the relations of domination among groups and individuals in a society. Third, if such a presence of domination plays a primary explanatory role in all forms of epistemic injustice, it is likely that those who suffer from epistemic injustice will also suffer other forms of injustice and loss of status via the exercise of other forms of power and exclusion.

T1  - Disclosed and Willing: Towards A Queer Public Sociology
AN  - 1283643493; 201304237
AB  - This article contributes to recent debates on 'public sociology', expanding the notion and interrogating its utility for those who simultaneously carry out activism and scholarship. The idea of public sociology has underpinned the conviction that knowledge can contribute to inclusion or exclusion, depending on how it is used. This article argues that commitment to public sociology implies abiding by the guiding principles of accountability, intersectionality, reciprocity and reflexivity, and further represents commitment to activism, embracing politics as an intended effect of knowledge production. Building on personal experience as researcher and activist in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movement in Portugal, I also explore the epistemological and ethical impacts of taking on the role of scholar-activist. This offers a 'double agency' through which one may build and disseminate empirically grounded knowledge whilst maintaining a sense of social responsibility and political engagement. Bringing these ideas together, this article advances the notion of a 'queer public sociology': a critical framework that accounts for sexual diversity, and that acknowledges its politically situated character at the same time that it contributes to the dismantling of sexual prejudice and exclusion.

AN  - 1429624283; 201336008
AB  - Marriage, the special kind of union whereby a man and woman are joined together for the purpose of making a home and raising a family is as old as man. As unique as it is, the institution of traditional marriage in Africa has been grossly misunderstood by many prejudiced foreigners who claim that love has no place in the social enterprise. This paper, therefore, explores traditional Igbo marriage as portrayed by Elechi Amadi in two of his novels. It posits that love not only exists among the Igbo in particular and Africans in general but that it is actually celebrated in marriage which is a whole community affair. It concludes however, that like many things, traditional Igbo marriage has under gone some changes courtesy of the grinding wheel of time. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Indigeneity and consciousness in Brazil: Analyzing Sousa (1587) and Mendes Jr (1912)
AN  - 964197882; 201207700
AB  - This article analyzes understandings of indigeneity and legal consciousness in Brazil in the 16th, early 20th and 21st centuries. The article focuses on the often ignored work of Joao Mendes Junior, written in 1912, about the indigenous peoples of Sao Paulo and on Gabriel Soares de Sousa's Tratado descritivo do Brasil em 1587 [A Descriptive Treatise of Brazil in 1587]. Mendes' ideas about race, biology and indigeneity diverge considerably from hegemonic Western theories of racial purity and Social Darwinism, but his contribution has never really been acknowledged. This article argues that theories that better fit the organizing model of the free market have become more hegemonic and widespread. For this reason, social scientists should strive to bring into discussion epistemological alternatives to the hegemonic principles of capitalism, which foster exploitation, destitution and the privatization of public space.

T1  - Disunity in Diversity: The Controversy Over the Admission of Black Women to the General Federation of Women's Clubs, 1900-1902
AN  - 1018353867; 201214941
AB  - From 1900 to 1902, the General Federation of Women's Clubs' official commitment to "unity in diversity" was tested to the limits when an explosive debate over the admission of African American women's clubs deeply, and in some cases irreparably, divided individual clubs and state federations and nearly resulted in the loss of half of the organization's burgeoning membership. The controversy reveals a captivating, complicated, and at times bizarre struggle between Northern and Southern white members of the General Federation to defend their particular views of race and, in many cases, to obfuscate their own deep-seated racial prejudices. Most members ultimately sacrificed principle for the sake of federation unity, albeit a unity without racial diversity, and thus squandered the opportunity to combine the talents and energies of all organized women in an effort toward social justice and humanitarian reform.

T1  - Combined Effects of Masculine Gender-Role Stress and Sexual Prejudice on Anger and Aggression Toward Gay Men
AN  - 1545065387
AB  - This study was designed to examine the extent to which masculine gender-role stress, sexual prejudice, and antigay anger collectively facilitate antigay aggression. Participants were 135 heterosexual men who completed a structured interview assessing masculine gender-role stress, sexual prejudice, anger in response to a vignette depicting a non-erotic male-male intimate relationship (i.e., partners holding hands, kissing), and past perpetration of antigay aggression. The results indicate that the association between masculine gender-role stress and antigay aggression is partially mediated by antigay anger among sexually prejudiced men. These findings contribute to theoretical understanding of antigay aggression. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.

T1  - The Stigma of Obesity: Does Perceived Weight Discrimination Affect Identity and Physical Health?
AN  - 917532574
AB  - Obesity is widely recognized as a health risk, but it also represents a disadvantaged social position. Viewing body weight within the framework of stigma and its effects on life chances, we examine how perceived weight-based discrimination influences identity and physical health. Using national survey data with a 10-year longitudinal follow-up, we consider whether perceptions of weight discrimination shape weight perceptions, whether perceived weight discrimination exacerbates the health risks of obesity, and whether weight perceptions are the mechanism explaining why perceived weight discrimination is damaging to health. Perceived weight discrimination is found to be harmful, increasing the health risks of obesity associated with functional disability and, to a lesser degree, self-rated health. Findings also reveal that weight-based stigma shapes weight perceptions, which mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and health. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Constructing truths in a culture of disbelief: Understanding asylum screening from within
AN  - 854056840
AB  - While a multitude of immigration officers enforce the numerous laws and policies regulating the arrival of asylum seekers, their work is often hidden from the public eye and ignored by academic debate, leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Is the migration debate blinded by bureaucracy or oblivious to the complexity of the asylum screening process? This article originates from an ethnographic study, which included over 80 interviews, six months of participant observation and four years of familiarization with the main actors, framed by a triangulation scheme that allowed in-depth exploration of the field from within. The study's conclusions expose how identifying immigration officers' subculture is key to understanding asylum controls and to reach beyond the legal shield and the rhetorical concepts of political debate. Based on this empirical research, this article exposes how officers' criteria for screening individuals are not derived from regulations or laws but their own categorizations, rules and values derived from ambiguous stereotypes nurtured by officers' experiences and social prejudices.

T1  - Welcoming dogs: Levinas and 'the animal' question
AN  - 852899459; 201105422
AB  - According to Levinas, the history of western philosophy has routinely 'assimilated every Other into the Same'. More concretely stated, philosophers have neglected the ethical significance of other human beings in their vulnerable, embodied singularity. What is striking about Levinas' recasting of ethics as 'first philosophy' is his own relative disregard for non-human animals. In this article I will do two interrelated things: (1) situate Levinas' (at least partial) exclusion of the non-human animal in the context of his markedly bleak conception of 'the state of nature', and (2) drawing on Orwell, Wittgenstein and Gaita, argue that, despite his more positive evaluation of animality (specifically a dog named Bobby), Levinas is guided by a number of anthropomorphic prejudices; not least that the epithet 'the animal' can be used in the general singular.

T1  - In Search of the Defensive Function of Sexual Prejudice: Exploring Antigay Bias Through Shorter and Longer Lead Startle Eye Blink
AN  - 1545059511
AB  - To explore the theory that some men experience antigay bias because of a defensive reaction to uncertainties surrounding their own sexuality (cf. Herek, 1987), we conducted a study (n = 132 men) in which we physiologically measured the affective underpinnings of antigay bias while individuals with different levels of self-reported bias viewed sexually explicit material. Those higher in antigay bias exhibited less positive affect than did others, but did not appear to experience a defensive reaction. Given these results, combined with those of our previous studies, we conclude that evidence for the existence of a group of men who exhibit antigay bias because of a hidden or unconscious attraction toward men is difficult to demonstrate using current methodology.

AN  - 1030866753; 201230128
AB  - This research compares prejudice toward female politicians Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin through the lens of role congruity theory. We measured participants' evaluations of stereotypicality, competence, warmth, and voting likelihood. Consistent with hypotheses, Clinton was evaluated as less stereotypically feminine and less warm than Palin, whereas Palin was evaluated as less competent than Clinton. Furthermore, participant gender, benevolent sexism, hostile sexism, and political orientation predicted differential voting likelihood for Clinton and Palin. Implications for role congruity, ambivalent sexism, and female politicians are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When Knowledge Is a Double-Edged Sword: Contact, Media Exposure, and American China Policy Preferences
AN  - 1023025487; 201224892
AB  - Globalization affords greater opportunities to learn about foreign peoples than in the past. What impacts do interpersonal contact, media exposure to and knowledge about China have on the American people's China policy preferences? Two large surveys of U.S. citizens were conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009 to explore whether knowledge about China and prejudice against the Chinese people and the Chinese government would mediate the relationship between contact and media exposure on the one hand, and U.S. China policy preferences on the other. Results show that while knowledge played the expected mediating roles between contact and media exposure on the one hand, and prejudice against the Chinese people on the other, greater knowledge of China was actually associated with greater negativity toward the Chinese government, which in turn contributed to desires for tougher China policies. Both media exposure and interpersonal contact thus had mixed effects on China policy preferences. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Islamophobia in Austria: The Recent Emergence of Anti-Muslim Sentiments in the Country
AN  - 822925360
AB  - This paper examines the characteristics of Islamophobia in contemporary Austria. The country represents a particularly interesting case study of the dissemination of anti-Muslim sentiments as it has had a strong tradition of populist, right-wing politics, which was closely associated with the name of Jorg Haider until his death in 2008. However, publicly voiced prejudices against Muslims have remained comparatively rare. For some time, Austria's policy towards its Muslim population was even regarded as a model to be adopted by other countries. Even though this situation has started to change in the last three or four years, Islamophobia in Austria still seems to be more modest than, for example, in The Netherlands, where populist politics and anti-Muslim diatribes are closely connected. A further thesis to be confirmed in this research links anti-Muslim rhetoric in Austria with entrenched Judeophobic prejudices in the society at large. In this sense, some kinds of Islamophobia may serve as a cover for anti-Semitism. This view is very much in accordance with Austria's collective memory, which for a long time has demonstrated an amiable attitude towards Muslims, whereas Jews have always been seen as the utmost enemy. At a time when anti-Semitism has become socially disrespected, Islamophobia, a widely held attitude throughout Europe, is being used to appeal to Judeophobic sentiments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Political Partisan Prejudice: Selective Distortion and Weighting of Evaluative Categories in College Admissions Applications
AN  - 1866484872
AB  - Two methods by which people make prejudicial yet justifiable judgments were assessed in a simulated college admissions paradigm in which participants evaluated 2 applications. In the preference condition, the stronger applicant was described as a member of a different political party than the participant. In the control condition, no political party was indicated. Supporting a political partisan prejudice effect, among strong partisans, the stronger applicant was favored in the control condition, but the weaker applicant was favored in the preference condition. No effect was found for weak partisans. Additionally, participants supported their biases by altering the importance of (Study 1) and distorting the strength of (Study 2) different types of application information.

T1  - Championing Diversity: The Influence of Personal and Organizational Antecedents
AN  - 1866473467
AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine antecedents of championing diversity (i.e., extra-role behaviors aimed at ensuring the success of diversity initiatives). In Study 1 (N = 170 students), race and sex were marginally related to championing diversity, while extraversion, racial prejudice, and sexual prejudice held stronger associations with the behavior. In Study 2 (N = 299 employees), racial prejudice, sexual prejudice, and coworker support for diversity were all predictive of championing behavior. The findings suggest that both personal and social factors influence people's championing behaviors. Contributions, limitations, and future directions are advanced.

T1  - Development of Heterosexuals into Sexual-Minority Allies: A Qualitative Exploration
AN  - 858943660
AB  - Heterosexually identified individuals can serve a crucial role as allies in eliminating sexual prejudice and the resulting policies that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. However, few studies have systematically examined the development of heterosexual allies. Consensual qualitative research methods (Hill et al., The Counseling Psychologist, 25, 517-572, 1997) were used to analyze individual interviews conducted with a community sample of 12 heterosexually identified participants who demonstrated ally commitment through some form of LGBT activism. Findings revealed six domains that best described the development of these heterosexual allies. Participants described early role models, an evolving recognition and understanding of privilege and oppression, and conflict between an awareness of sexual prejudice and deeply held values of justice and equality. Participants also described barriers to LGBT activism and the rewards of ally work. The authors discuss implications for heterosexual ally development and, ultimately, for social justice and equality.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Motives Underlying Stereotype-Based Discrimination Against Members of Stigmatized Groups
AN  - 754046703; 201054081
AB  - We argue that the motivations that underlie stereotype-based discrimination against racial minorities and other stigmatized groups often fail to meet standard criteria for rational judgments. Stereotyping of such groups is often driven by threats to one's self-esteem and a desire to rationalize inequality, and declines when the perceiver is motivated to be accurate. Also, Bayesian racism-the belief that it is rational to discriminate against individuals based on stereotypes about their racial group-correlates highly with negative feelings toward minorities and the desire to keep low-status groups in their place, and correlates negatively with indices of rational thinking. The motives that drive social judgments call into question whether people engage in stereotype-based discrimination for rational reasons. Adapted from the source document.
