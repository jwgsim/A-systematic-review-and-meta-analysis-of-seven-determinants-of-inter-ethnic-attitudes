T1  - An intersectional approach to the understanding of patterns of marginalisation among ex-combatants with disabilities in Sri Lanka
AN  - 2436791757
AB  - Based on 30 life history interviews with former members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), this article analyses the particular challenges ex-combatants with disabilities face when returning to civilian lives. Moreover, it uses an intersectional approach to explore how disability intersects with gender and geographic location to generate specific patterns of marginalisation for different groups of disabled ex-combatants. Findings demonstrate the lack of attention paid to the specific needs of disabled ex-combatants by post-conflict policies which, combined with cumbersome procedures and favouritism in the selection of beneficiaries, have left ex-combatants dependent on family networks for livelihood assistance. This dependency exacerbates prejudices against and the social isolation of disabled ex-combatants and detrimentally affects their self-esteem. Furthermore, the article shows how disability and gender intersect to generate additional forms of discrimination resulting from increased social stigma, patriarchal attitudes and the exposure to different forms of abuse, as well as how differences in terms of communal support network, the density of ex-combatant populations and political attitudes generate spatial variation in patterns of social and economic marginalisation.

T1  - Application of Sociocultural Identity Theory to Education in EFL Textbooks Development
AN  - 2404394908
AB  - The present study aims to use Sociocultural Identity theory to education with reference to teaching and learning English as a second language in the EFL textbooks development. The findings of this study revealed that there is a need to use the cultural sensitive and context-appropriate materials in the EFL textbooks. It is urgent to teaching materials correspond with the learners' attitudes, religious opinions and preferences. Because, textbook is not only a commercially accessible reference book which is utilized in a language teaching program, it additionally serves as a significant way to convey political and ideological orientation. Moreover, textbooks decide not only content teaching and learning environments, but also what dominant or valid culture is passed on. Then one goal of textbooks is to serve as a means of facilitating the integration of content about ethnically, racially and culturally diverse individuals. To this end, textbook writers should avoid cultural inequalities and prejudices that learners can absorb in their learning, and have a balanced representation of social / cultural components such as ethnicity, gender, and race.

T1  - The Roles of Political Conservatism and Binary Gender Beliefs in Predicting Prejudices Toward Gay Men and People Who Are Transgender
AN  - 2251862004
AB  - Negativity toward gay men and transgender people is pervasive. Past research suggests that authoritarianism predicts biases against transgender people, in part due to an essentialist view of gender. To determine the generalizability of these findings, but with political conservatism as the focal predictor, we re-analyzed Norton and Herek’s (2013) large (n = 2281) nationally representative U.S. dataset. In doing so, we modeled a latent factor indicated by anti-transgender attitudes and prejudice toward gay men to capture prejudice toward gender non-conformists. That is, prejudice against transgender people and gay men on the political right might arise from perceived gender norm violations, which binary gender beliefs could potentially explain. Consistent with social dominance theory, results revealed that those more conservative in ideology were more likely to display prejudice toward gender non-conformists in part due to their greater endorsement of binary gender beliefs. Unexpectedly, and novel to the existing literature, conservatism predicted binary gender beliefs and prejudice toward gender non-conformists more strongly for women than for men. Binary gender beliefs seemingly function as a legitimizing myth to bolster existing hierarchical relations between gender conforming versus gender non-conforming people, particularly among conservative women.

T1  - On the Roles of Stereotype Activation and Application in Diminishing Implicit Bias
AN  - 2348218339
AB  - Stereotypes can influence social perception in undesirable ways. However, activated stereotypes are not always applied in judgments. The present research investigated how stereotype activation and application processes impact social judgments as a function of available resources for control over stereotypes. Specifically, we varied the time available to intervene in the stereotyping process and used multinomial modeling to independently estimate stereotype activation and application. As expected, social judgments were less stereotypic when participants had more time to intervene. In terms of mechanisms, stereotype application, and not stereotype activation, corresponded with reductions in stereotypic biases. With increasing time, stereotype application was reduced, reflecting the fact that controlling application is time-dependent. In contrast, stereotype activation increased with increasing time, apparently due to increased engagement with stereotypic material. Stereotype activation was highest when judgments were least stereotypical, and thus, reduced stereotyping may coincide with increased stereotype activation if stereotype application is simultaneously decreased.

AN  - 2488758904
AB  - I struggle mamereTo bringYour wordsInto nokum'sCabinBut the wordsAre in battleCompetingfor my mindI am a mixed-blood woman raised in Canada where my two ancestries have competing worldviews, from social, political, and religious ideology to ancient philosophies. These mixed ancestries also come with different social expectations. In the social-political world of Native Studies where I walk daily, my French grandmother, mamere, is argued as coming from a world of privilege because she was white-skinned, and my Cree grandmother, nokum is thought to come from a world of oppression because she was dark-skinned. Yet both my grandmothers experienced abuse and prejudice. How and where the abuses originated may be different, but they did occur. I have a lot to learn from my grandmothers, but it has taken me many years of inner conflict, self-righteousness, and pain to get to this understanding. To acknowledge both grandmothers having been oppressed means I cannot continue to think of the world in simplistic, binary terms of colonizer/colonized. I must legitimize the equality of suffering in both cultures. Indeed, my worldviews had been turned upside down as I began to identify with the feminist movement, nonetheless it is nokum's world that was shattered, demeaned, and distorted, so it is her world I bring to you today with this story. Another day I may talk about my mamere's patriarchal world, but today is for nokum.

T1  - Creating the exclusionist society: from the War on Poverty to the war on immigrants
AN  - 2316330432
AB  - A series of policy decisions beginning in 1965 produced an exclusionist climate in the United States. Lyndon Johnson sought to eliminate prejudice from the nation's immigration system but inadvertently curtailed opportunities for legal entry from Mexico that created a large undocumented population. In waging the Cold War, Ronald Reagan launched an intervention in Central America that displaced many more thousands who also became undocumented residents. The Wars on Crime and Drugs of Presidents Nixon and Reagan created a prison industrial complex that imprisoned blacks and Hispanics. George Bush's War on Terror unleashed a rising tide of deportations swept Latino migrants into the immigrant detention system. Finally, President Trump transformed a humanitarian problem affecting Central American families and children into a manufactured immigration crisis for the nation as a whole. The result is among the most repressive and exclusionist context of immigrant reception in American history.

T1  - Perceptions of Ethnic Groups in Bakauheni Sub-District, South Lampung Regency, Indonesia
AN  - 2426550787
AB  - Bakauheni constitutes a sub-district located in South Lampung, Indonesia. It is inhabited by diverse ethnic groups: Lampung, Sunda, Java, Batak, and Bugis. Their different cultural backgrounds often result in different perceptions among them. Therefore, this study aimed to explore perceptions by the ethnic groups living in the region.The current study was qualitative. An interview was undertaken in depth to investigate ethnic groups' perceptions. The data were analyzed using BIPLOT. The result of the current study showed that there were two main categories of perceptions among the ethnic groups living in Bakauheni: soft-hearted and hard-hearted perception. This suggests that communication inter-ethnic is important for attaining the harmony of social life.

T1  - Islamophobia, Racism and the Vilification of the Muslim Diaspora
AN  - 2410495495
AB  - Is Islamophobia a new phenomenon? Are Islam and the Judeo-Christian West still hateful of and hostile toward each other? Do Muslim women with veils and headscarves constitute a threat to the Wests secular and liberal values? What has fueled the sudden rhetoric of Islamophobia in the United States of America and Europe? How does Anglophone print and digital media report pressures, prejudices and discriminatory practices against male and female students? How do Western media cover the social exclusion of the Muslim diaspora? These questions need a thoughtful coverage and concentration in academia. It is believed that most of the grievous and painful stories experienced, for example, by Muslim immigrants- be they legal or illegal, asylum seekers, refugees, or whatsoever, still do not find a room in scholastic research. This paper utilizes the narrative research method to study and probe into the problem of Islamophobia, the vilification of and racism against Muslims in the United States of America and Europe. The usage of human stories, peoples personal experiences and narrative accounts or recounts of Islamophobic incidents (real or imagined) as the basis of this inquiry is particularly suitable for research because it can help understand the status quo of Muslim diaspora in the United States of America and Europe. Narrative data are retrieved from five major US-news publications and press elite (e.g., Foreign Policy, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and Chicago Tribune). The analysis of these data can be used to improve the situation of Muslim diaspora and their interaction with non-Muslims all over the world. The mediums cited above have been chosen because they are the prime source of information for intellectuals and policy-makers. Decidedly, they construct and build up ample epistemologies on Islamophobia and other epiphenomena of racism.

T1  - Masculinities, Money, and Mosques in Algeria's Civil War
AN  - 2216274382
AB  - To what extent did economic marginalization and political crisis activate prejudice, violence, and religious faith in Algeria's civil war during the 1990s? The Algerian novel Les Agneaux du Seigneur (In the Name of God), by Yasmina Khadra offers a glimpse. The novel shows how political and economic disparities intertwined with an increasingly strict interpretation of Islam. In turn, Islam's political applications and its militarized enforcement soon drew the country into a veritable civil war. The resulting breakdown of the cultural order simultaneously increased the pressure on men to fulfill a socially prescribed gender role and made the fulfillment of that role more difficult.

T1  - Expressions of a Fascist Imaginary: Adorno’s Unsettling of Cathexis
AN  - 2148955551
AB  - What is the structure of prejudice? In his 1951 essay, “Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda,” Theodor Adorno reflects on the mass psychological basis of fascism. Within that psychology, he identifies a logic of ego “enlargement,” which relates directly to the structure of prejudice. Fascism depends on affective attachments, magnified by prejudice (a magnification that takes place through identification with a leader). This is a clear theme in Adorno’s critical theory. In his previous work in The Authoritarian Personality, Adorno set out the task to discover differential patterns within the general structure of prejudice, with a specific focus on the function of prejudice. As a resource to encounter this theorizing of prejudice, I turn to Adorno’s “Prejudice in the Interview Material” (chapter 16 of The Authoritarian Personality). This is one of several solo-authored chapters of Adorno’s in the Authoritarian Personality project, where Adorno attempts “to examine the relation of anti-minority prejudice to broader ideological and characterological patterns.” On the surface, this chapter is quite literally a reporting of prejudice in the voices of interview subjects. But, I argue, Adorno’s review seems to highlight a dispersal of prejudicial energies, once directed into feelings of anti-Semitism, now into new resources of social, political, and economic division. Clear pathways for this dispersal form through what Adorno names as cathexis. This is a microscopic moment in the overarching argument of The Authoritarian Personality. But, as I hope to show, Adorno’s subtle engagement with this psychoanalytic referent for psychic and emotional energy invested in a person or thing can serve as a resource for making sense of the pathways of prejudice that fascism depends on. Here, I offer a reading of Adorno’s attention to cathexis in prejudice formation as a pathway for fascist discourse, as well as the possibility of its interruption.

T1  - Would you date ‘the undateables’? An analysis of the mediated public debate on the reality television show ‘The Undateables’
AN  - 2092734411
AB  - This article examines the different discourses in the online public debate surrounding the television dating show ‘The Undateables’. The programme, which exclusively focuses on dates of disabled people, was launched in the UK in 2012, and local adaptations of the format were broadcast in Belgium and the Netherlands. The article applies the dis/ability approach of Goodley and Runswick-Cole (2014) to examine the way in which representations of disabled singles are evaluated online. As a perspective, dis/ability destabilizes notions of normativity and enables an inquiry into not just marginalized identities, but also dominant identities. The analysis of blog posts, tweets and online press reviews of the first series of the British, Flemish and Dutch version of ‘The Undateables’ provides more insights into hegemonic and resistant notions on disability, dating and romantic relationships. This article argues that prejudices, as already identified by Morris in 1991, are still very dominant today.

T1  - The Paradox of Rising Ethnic Prejudice in Times of Educational Expansion and Secularization in the Netherlands, 1985–2011
AN  - 2085602551
AB  - We aim to clarify a puzzling paradox: while shares of highly educated and non-religious individuals—who generally hold less prejudice—have increased in the Netherlands, levels of prejudice against ethnic minorities have yet risen over time. To solve the paradox, we use cross-sectional data from 1985 to 2011 in counterfactual analyses. In these analyses we simulate that levels of ethnic prejudice within categories of education, church membership, and church attendance are kept constant at the 1985 level and a new simulated trend in prejudice is estimated for the 1985–2011 period. Our findings show that changing levels of prejudice within categories of education are partly responsible for the trend. We conclude that the increasing share of highly educated individuals has not resulted in a decline of prejudice in the Netherlands over time, because all Dutch have become more prejudiced over the years and in particular the higher educated.

T1  - Admired Rich or Resented Rich? How Two Cultures Vary in Envy
AN  - 2068664814
AB  - Rich people inhabit a distinct social category that may elicit universal images or perhaps different perceptions in different cultures. Whereas inequality research has mostly focused on lower socioeconomic classes, the current research investigates cultural variations of prejudices about rich groups, toward understanding societal dynamics. Three studies investigate stereotype content and evaluations of rich people in China and the United States, cultures that might be expected to differ. Consistent with U.S. data from the stereotype content model, Study 1 demonstrates mainland Chinese likewise view the rich in general ambivalently as competent but cold. Examining a more specific level, Study 2 identifies both distinctive and overlapping rich subgroups across the two cultures, but both reporting mixed stereotype content. Study 3 tests whether clearer cultural contrasts might occur in implicit (vs. explicit) stereotypes toward rich people: Both U.S. and Chinese respondents, however, expressed positive implicit stereotypes toward the rich compared with middle class, in contrast with their self-reported explicitly ambivalent (or, rarely, negative) wealth stereotypes. This research is the first to examine stereotype content about rich people on the subgroup level, and both implicit and explicit levels, offering theory-based social structure predictors of this culturally shared but somewhat variable stereotype content.

T1  - Sequential Stereotype Priming: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2067647938
AB  - Psychological interest in stereotype measurement has spanned nearly a century, with researchers adopting implicit measures in the 1980s to complement explicit measures. One of the most frequently used implicit measures of stereotypes is the sequential priming paradigm. The current meta-analysis examines stereotype priming, focusing specifically on this paradigm. To contribute to ongoing discussions regarding methodological rigor in social psychology, one primary goal was to identify methodological moderators of the stereotype priming effect—whether priming is due to a relation between the prime and target stimuli, the prime and target response, participant task, stereotype dimension, stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), and stimuli type. Data from 39 studies yielded 87 individual effect sizes from 5,497 participants. Analyses revealed that stereotype priming is significantly moderated by the presence of prime–response relations, participant task, stereotype dimension, target stimulus type, SOA, and prime repetition. These results carry both practical and theoretical implications for future research on stereotype priming.

T1  - Obscuring Oppression: Racism, Cissexism, and the Persistence of Social Inequality
AN  - 2406942119
AB  - This article outlines a generic process in the reproduction of inequality the authors name obscuring oppression. On the basis of 35 in-depth interviews with college students seeking to make sense of two contemporary social movements, Black Lives Matter and Transgender Bathroom Access, the authors demonstrate three ways people obscure (i.e., avoid, ignore, hide, or explain away claims of) oppression in response to minority protest: trusting the public (i.e., suggesting that an educated public would not allow inequalities to persist), appealing to order (i.e., arguing that if protesters followed the rules, society would be more welcoming to change), and dismissing oppression (i.e., framing movement claims as false or exaggerated). In conclusion, the authors argue that examining processes of obscuring oppression may provide insight into (1) the persistence of inequality in society, (2) linkages between color-blind racism and systemic patterns of sexism and cissexism in society, and (3) potential reactions to other social movements seeking justice for marginalized groups.

T1  - The Return of Character: Parallels Between Late-Victorian and Twenty-First Century Discourses
AN  - 2058311900
AB  - There has been an increasingly common trend in the UK to identify character skills and traits as the basis for various individual successes and achievements. In education policy and employment services, character has been linked to the making of successful, morally aware, employable and socially mobile citizens. This article explores the late-19th-century use of character discourses, focusing on the economist Alfred Marshall. During this period character was associated with future-oriented subjects – those displaying provident and thrifty habits and dispositions – and held particular class, race, and gender prejudices. The article draws parallels between this late-Victorian approach to character and the ‘return’ of character in 21st-century education and welfare-to-work policy, in particular, where cultivating character is linked to improving employability and social mobility. We can make productive comparisons between character’s Victorian legacy and its re-emergence more recently amid increasingly moralised discourses around poverty, inequality, and unemployment. In doing so, we might better understand the historical antecedents to stigmatising character discourses today, insofar as they leave the burden of responsibility for particular social outcomes in life and the labour market with individuals and their ability to cultivate their own human capital.

T1  - Who should be on the $10 and $20 bills? Preferences based on gender, sexism, race, racism, political affiliation, and political ideology
AN  - 2051120135
AB  - In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that a woman would replace Hamilton on the $10 bill. In April 2016, it announced that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, instead. After each announcement, we surveyed nationally representative samples of American adults and asked them what they thought of these proposed changes for the $10 bill (Study 1, N = 209) and the $20 bill (Study 2, N = 208). Predictors of currency preferences were gender, race, political affiliation and their respective prejudices and biases—sexism, racism, and political ideology. On the basis of social identity, system justification, and social dominance theories we predicted that privileged groups (i.e., males, Whites) and groups who desire to maintain the status quo (i.e., Republicans, conservatives, sexist and racist individuals) would prefer to leave Hamilton on the $10 bill and Jackson on the $20 bill. Results were consistent with these predictions: Overall, we found that under‐represented groups and more liberal individuals support the proposals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These findings suggest a bill of money is not just a piece of paper. The person depicted on U.S. currency can be perceived as an in‐group or out‐group member and this can affect judgements in line with relevant social psychological theories.

T1  - Grounds for dialogue: Intersectionality and superdiversity
AN  - 2058444237
AB  - This paper investigates the possibility of a fruitful dialogue between intersectionality and superdiversity. It argues that, despite the shortcomings of superdiversity, the complex migration-related configurations it focuses on can enable intersectionality to overcome some of its own challenges by becoming more precise and accurate. To empirically expose the mechanisms through which race-, gender-, and class-based inequalities are reproduced, it is necessary to anchor those mechanisms in a specific time and space – a historical, social, economic, and legal context. Through a case study of institutional responses to domestic violence, the paper demonstrates that superdiversity can help clarify the context in which these responses occur. Finally, by distinguishing between the object of study (the intersectional construction of disadvantage and prejudice) and the object of observation (public institutions where superdiverse situations are created by migration-related configurations), this paper examines a challenging situation for intersectional analysis in the context of Switzerland, a context that opens up to surprising articulations of discrimination and inequality for ‘migrants’ subjects to domestic violence.

T1  - The Social Psychology of the Black Lives Matter Meme and Movement
AN  - 1974474405
AB  - Since the 2012 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a string of publicized police killings of unarmed Black men and women has brought sustained attention to the issue of racial bias in the United States. Recent Department of Justice investigations and an expanding set of social science research have added to the empirical evidence that these publicized incidents are emblematic of systemic racism in the application of the law. The Black Lives Matter meme and movement are prominent responses to racism that have animated intense interest and support, especially among African Americans. We summarize recent social science research on Black Lives Matter. As a first step toward understanding the social psychology of the meme and the movement, we apply the dynamic dual-pathway model of protest to Black Lives Matter. Examinations of the dynamics of real-world movements such as Black Lives Matter may enrich psychology conceptually, methodologically, and practically.

T1  - Explaining prejudice toward the mentally ill: A test of sociopolitical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors
AN  - 1972217745
AB  - People with mental disorders often face prejudices that can further deteriorate their condition. We tested whether Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and Belief in a Just World (BJW), and characteristics of the mentally ill predict such prejudices. Both in a general population sample and a sample of health professionals and trainees, SDO, but not RWA and BJW, predicted more prejudice, although this pattern was less pronounced among health professionals/trainees. BJW interacted with the targets' gender in Study 1, predicting less empathy toward a male but not toward a female mentally ill person. In Study 2, depressed individuals were blamed more for their illness than those with schizophrenia or cancer. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

T1  - Not Melting into Air
AN  - 1979154331
AB  - Marxism failed years ago, but in our time of rapid global change, Karl Marx is as quotable as ever. “All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify”—shave that, from the Communist Manifesto, down to 140 characters, and you have learned-sounding retweetable material. Read on in Marx’s 1848 pamphlet, and you find a familiar engine behind all of the change: the bourgeoisie or owning class—our own One Percent—with its “naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.” His depiction of Victorian-era global political economy is strikingly familiar—“In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations,” he went on to write—but Marx expected that revolution soon would knock the global system off course and redirect it into history’s final phase of communism.

T1  - FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF RATIONAL AUTONOMY TO THE VIRTUOSITY OF EMPATHETIC EMBODIMENT: RECLAIMING THE MODERN SIGNIFICANCE OF CONFUCIAN CIVILIZATION
AN  - 1950619924
AB  - With the recent economic ascendancy of China, there has been increasing research on various aspects of Chinese culture and growing interest in the modern significance of Confucian teachings. Roger T. Ames, among others, has praised the Confucian legacy as one substantial resource for informing and inspiring new directions in human culture, a legacy that for the past two centuries and largely for economic and political reasons, has been muted and ignored. Heralding the emergence of a new world order, Ames argues that Confucianism offers people philosophical assets that can be resourced and applied to serve not only the renaissance of a revitalized Chinese culture, but also the interests of world culture more broadly. Remarkably, the insistence on this narrow definition of philosophy is not simply an innocuous preference in labeling. It showcases rather the deleterious ethnocentric biases that are still active in reducing all forms of non-Western thought, based on their alleged lack of philosophical reasoning, as religious and superstitious beliefs without the critical and rational spirit that is the privilege of Western philosophical traditions.

T1  - Weaving Solidarity: Migrant Women's Organisations in Athens
AN  - 1947034908
AB  - Migrant women living in Athens often describe themselves as caught in a condition of double marginality: they constitute a vulnerable group within the overall migrant population. Lacunae in immigration policy, undocumented work and spatial and social isolation, coupled with prejudiced views regarding women's ability to undertake collective action, are among the reasons why it may seem impossible that these women could engage in organising activities - and therefore also why these activities remain understudied. Based on a qualitative study of migrant women's associations and networks in Athens, we examine the condition of possibility of associational activity undertaken by migrant women. We argue that work, motherhood, and culture are the three domains of action that account for the formation of networks and associations. Moreover, we present migrant women's associational activity as a process that allows for the negotiation and reworking of a subject position that deploys recognition strategies in the urban setting of Athens.

T1  - Biased Elites, Unfit Policies: Reflections on the Lacunae of Roma Integration Strategies
AN  - 1946330478
AB  - In this article, I argue that policymakers employed unconscious biases and racist beliefs in the formulation and the implementation of the current EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies ('EU Roma Framework') and its corresponding national strategies. Using Critical Race Theory, I explore how these policies have reinforced the commonly held belief in the need to civilize and otherwise change the habits of the Roma, and consequently have further reinforced the power imbalance between the Roma and the dominant majority groups (hereinafter used interchangeably with 'non-Roma'). I analyse examples of Roma versus universal policies comparatively, emphasizing biases in formulation, implementation, and discourse. I show that the objectives of the EU Roma Framework and national Roma strategies toward Roma education involve ethnic presuppositions and are far less ambitious than the avowed Europe 2020 strategy; this policy mismatch will likely lead to further educational discrepancies post-2020. Finally, I conclude that policies focused on the Roma are doomed to fail if no prior and concurrent actions are taken to change prejudiced attitudes and the behaviours of non-Roma, in particular those biases influencing policy formulation and implementation.

T1  - The Failure of the Black Greek Letter Organization
AN  - 1935627157
AB  - Between 1906 and 1920, eight of the most prominent Black Greek-letter organizations were established. The creation of the Black fraternity had a dual purpose. First, these organizations were established for the greater purpose of pooling the resources of African Americans in the hopes of acquiring an education. Second, these organizations were formed as an attempt by Black students to gain acceptance into American society. Black Greek-letter organizations are some of the most influential organizations in the country. Collectively, these organizations claim approximately 800,000 members, with many coming from the social elite of Black culture. Despite the great influence and vast membership that these organizations possess, the activities of the Black Greek-letter organization have included secret meetings, selective membership, and a preference for lighter-complexioned members. Moreover, the failure and shortcomings of the Black Greek-letter organization have allowed Black elites to create a separate privileged society based on snobbery and arrogance and have thus enabled these organizations to perpetuate the vicious cycle of racial prejudice and White supremacy.

T1  - Is structural stigma's effect on the mortality of sexual minorities robust? A failure to replicate the results of a published study
AN  - 1957229605
AB  - Background The study of stigma's influence on health has surged in recent years. Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) study of structural stigma's effect on mortality revealed an average of 12 years' shorter life expectancy for sexual minorities who resided in communities thought to exhibit high levels of anti-gay prejudice, using data from the 1988-2002 administrations of the US General Social Survey linked to mortality outcome data in the 2008 National Death Index. Methods In the original study, the key predictor variable (structural stigma) led to results suggesting the profound negative influence of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities. Attempts to replicate the study, in order to explore alternative hypotheses, repeatedly failed to generate the original study's key finding on structural stigma. Efforts to discern the source of the disparity in results revealed complications in the multiple imputation process for missing values of the components of structural stigma. This prompted efforts at replication using 10 different imputation approaches. Results Efforts to replicate Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) key finding on structural stigma's notable influence on the premature mortality of sexual minorities, including a more refined imputation strategy than described in the original study, failed. No data imputation approach yielded parameters that supported the original study's conclusions. Alternative hypotheses, which originally motivated the present study, revealed little new information. Conclusion Ten different approaches to multiple imputation of missing data yielded none in which the effect of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities was statistically significant. Minimally, the original study's structural stigma variable (and hence its key result) is so sensitive to subjective measurement decisions as to be rendered unreliable.

T1  - West meets east: Mixed-race Jamaicans in India, and the avenues of advancement in imperial Britain
AN  - 1934029791
AB  - At the turn of the nineteenth century, small numbers of elite, mixed-race Jamaicans traveled to India in order to improve their financial and social statuses. They did so by joining the East India Company Army, or by working as lawyers and civil servants. This global movement - starting in Jamaica, continuing to Britain, on to India, and oftentimes back to Britain - allowed these individuals to reposition their identity as East Indian nabobs, rather than as West Indian elites. By divorcing themselves from an enslaved, African past, they could live more effectively as white Britons. But, as anti-black prejudice escalated at the end of the eighteenth century, it became much more difficult for Jamaicans of color to undertake this journey successfully, as well as to reframe their identities.

AB  - The resurgence of right-wing political parties across the globe raises questions about the origins of national identity. Based on the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice, we argue that people's tendency to submit to ingroup authorities (Right-Wing Authoritarianism [RWA]) and preference for group-based hierarchy (Social Dominance Orientation [SDO]) underlie people's belief in the superiority of their nation (nationalism) and attachment to their homeland (patriotism). We examine these hypotheses using three waves of data from an annually conducted national longitudinal panel study of New Zealanders (N = 3,838). As predicted, RWA had positive cross-lagged effects on nationalism and patriotism. Conversely, SDO had a positive cross-lagged effect on nationalism, but a negative cross-lagged effect on patriotism. Little evidence of reciprocal cross-lagged effects (i.e., national identity on authoritarianism) was found. These results demonstrate that nationalism and patriotism are related, albeit distinct, ways of identifying with one's nation that are ultimately rooted in authoritarianism.

T1  - Anxiety Reduces Empathy Toward Outgroup Members But Not Ingroup Members
AN  - 1954915073
AB  - Substantial research concludes that favoritism toward members of people's ingroup, or ingroup bias, motivates people to oppose public programs that assist needy outgroup individuals. I argue that a gap in the empathic capacity for ingroup and outgroup members motivates and maintains ingroup bias in helping behavior and is sensitive to contextual cues that trigger anxiety. Using a novel experimental design, Study 1 demonstrates that anxiety exacerbates the outgroup empathy gap. Study 2 replicates these findings with an explicit measure of outgroup empathy. Study 3 shows that the outgroup empathy gap causes individuals to become less supportive of helping needy outgroup members. These studies suggest that opposition to welfare programs may go beyond simple prejudice.

T1  - Understanding Perceptions about the Role of Traditional Practices Regarding Inheritance with Relation to Inheritance Feud Settlement: A Case Study of District Mardan Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-Pakistan
AN  - 1932041585
AB  - Pakistani society depicts a vivid picture of inequality in property ownership with prenatal preference to inheritance for sons over daughters. The customary law under the clutches of patriarchy is only meant for male dominating female in all social spheres. The current study deals with traditional practices of inheritance transformation with relation to feud settlement at family level. The main purpose of this study is to explore the extents of traditional approaches to feud settlement regarding inheritance as the main reason of dysfunctional legal system in the study area. A sample size of 182 respondents was randomly selected of those respondents who had at least 10 acres of land. Frequency distribution of data was observed to have a comprehensive data layout. Moreover, Chi square (%2) statistics was used to determine the level of association between dependant variable (Feud Settlement) with the independent variables (Customary Practices of Inheritance). Majority (78.0%) of the respondents believed that Jirga played an important role in transformation of inheritance while curtailing the chances of inheritance feuds through application of traditional practices. Most (89.6%) of the respondents disclosed that patriarchal system favors male members of the family in respect of transferring of property. Likewise, traditional set up is one of the major barriers in non transformation of inheritance. At bi-variate level, Jirga played a vital role in the transformation of inheritance in case of conflict and had a significant association (p=0.039) with feud settlement. Moreover, dowry to be considered as a share in inheritance of family had a significant association (p=0.005) with feud settlement. The study depicted that strong patriarchal system was influencing the inheritance practices in favor of male gender. In addition, Pakhtoon culture, being conservative and prejudice, was found to be the core impediment in the smooth transmission of equal property rights to both the gender. Women's participation in the traditional mechanism of resolving the issue of inheritance and speedy court system could lead to the mitigation of inheritance related feuds at family level

T1  - University students' support to penalty enhancement for hate crime
AN  - 1854813825
AB  - Laws enabling penalty enhancement for crimes motivated by hostility or prejudice, i.e. hate crimes, have become common in many countries. However, laws as a measure against hate crimes have been contested, because their deterrent effect has gained none or little support in the (limited) literature, and they may be considered symbolic rather than deterrent. This study investigates attitudes towards penalty enhancement for hate crimes. Previous empirical investigations of this question are scarce. The material consists of a survey targeting nearly 3000 Swedish university students. Support for penalty enhancement for hate crime was moderate, shown by one third of the total sample. Results supported the premise that students belonging to a minority group, assumed to be at risk of hate crime victimization, agree to a higher extent of penalty enhancement than students belonging to the majority. Previous victimization experiences and worrying about being victimized were not significantly related to punitive attitudes. However, respondents who perceived the risk of victimization to be increased for minority groups in general were more likely to support penalty enhancement for hate crime. Findings should be confirmed in a nationally representative sample since the public's perspective on the criminal justice system is important for understanding and dealing with the social problem of hate crime.

T1  - Testimonial Injustice and Mindreading
AN  - 1968181091
AB  - Miranda Fricker maintains that testimonial responsibility is the proper corrective to testimonial injustice. She proposes a perceptual-like "testimonial sensibility" to explain the transmission of knowledge through testimony. This sensibility is the means by which a hearer perceives an interlocutor's credibility level. When prejudice causes a hearer to inappropriately deflate the credibility attributed to a speaker, the sensibility may have functioned unreliably. Testimonial responsibility, she claims, will make the capacity reliable by reinflating credibility levels to their proper degree. I argue that testimonial sensitivity may be or involve "mindreading," the cognitive capacity by which we predict human behavior and explain it in terms of mental states. Further, I claim that, if testimonial sensibility is or involves mindreading, and mindreading is a function of brain processes (as claimed by cognitive neuroscientists), testimonial injustice cannot be corrected by testimonial responsibility. This is because 1) it appears to rely on conscious awareness of prejudice, whereas much bias occurs implicitly, and 2) it works at the individual level, whereas testimonial injustice occurs both individually and socially. I argue that the remedy for testimonial injustice is, instead, engaging in social efforts that work below the level of consciousness.

T1  - Negotiating Blackness
AN  - 1824565977
AB  - This article explores the experiences of young British people with African and Caribbean heritage during a volunteer tourism trip to Zimbabwe. It gives an ethnographic account of how racialized identifications and geographies surfaced - and were negotiated - through emotional encounters and embodied performances. Young volunteers contended with the racialized imaginaries of charity that painfully positioned their blackness as 'mis-fitting' in the performances of virtue central to volunteer tourism. However, they performed their blackness in ways that asserted value, variously invoking a proud 'authentic' bond with 'Africa' and forging connections around diasporic African cool. Volunteers' claims of authentic 'Africanness' often problematically homogenized Africa, but celebratory affects around transnational popular culture contained possibilities for disrupting denigrating hierarchies. This account illustrates the potential for youth studies to engage further with the 'more-than-representational' ways in which racialized difference comes into force, but that this approach can and should sharpen our analysis of enduring racialized prejudices.

T1  - Ethnicity Based Social Exclusion of Nomads in Khyber District Malakand, Pakhtunkhwa-Pakistan
AN  - 1932111386
AB  - This study aims at finding the links of ethnicity factors in social exclusion of nomads. The study nature was descriptive with main focus on to measure the association of ethnicity with social exclusion. The study notes the ethnic inequality within institutional rules, social attitudes and general practices and its contribution to social exclusion of nomadic communities. Social exclusion occurs because of numerous factors beyond individual or groups control, such as, religion, ethnicity, color, clan etc. It is multi-dimensional in nature, thus one factor, like ethnicity followed by unemployment, illiteracy, housing problems and lack of access to health care leads to social exclusion. This paper explores the contribution of ethnic affiliations' contribution in shaping exclusionary processes of nomads', with special focus on their relationship with the groups representing a dominant ethnic characteristic. The study was conducted during the year 2015 in Tehsil Dargai, District Malakand. A sample size of 97 respondents out of population of 130 was selected through random sampling procedure. Using a five level Likert scale collected the data. Chi square test was used to ascertain the association between ethnicity based deprivations and social exclusion among nomads. At bivariate level, social exclusion of nomads was found significantly associated with the stereotype perceptions of the people about nomadic way of life (P = 0.001) and the way policies are devised in our country (P = 0.004). Devising such policies that ensure special facilities to nomads and ensure their access to basic life facilities and public awareness to overcome the prejudices regarding nomadic way of life were major study recommendations.

T1  - Preference for the Diversity Policy Label Versus the Affirmative Action Policy Label
AN  - 1789707707
AB  - Study 1 assessed associations with the labels "diversity policy" (DP) and "affirmative action policy" (AAP) and perceptions of potential policy components. Student and community participants (N = 143) completed a survey assessing associations with one of the policy labels. Both policies evoked similar associations such as "race/minorities" and "equality/equal opportunity," but the AAP was more often associated with "bias/inequality/discrimination," "unfairness," and "racism/prejudice." When rating potential policy components, reverse discrimination was considered more likely under the AAP. In Study 2 we explored the evaluation of equivalent policy components associated with different policy labels. Student participants (N = 126) rated the policy labeled as the DP more favorably than the AAP. Both studies suggest more favorable attitudes toward the DP label.

T1  - Homonegativity in Italy: Cultural Issues, Personality Characteristics, and Demographic Correlates with Negative Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1783663128
AB  - This study is an extension of earlier research that investigated the nature of homonegativity among Italian people (Lingiardi et al. 2005). We used the Modern Homophobia Scale (MHS), adapted to be more appropriate for the Italian social and cultural context. Associations were examined between homophobic attitudes, demographics, and personality characteristics and contact with lesbians and gay men. Gender issues were considered twice, from the viewpoint of both the agent and the target of the prejudice. The findings indicated that people at higher risk of possessing homonegative attitudes are older; less educated; more involved in religion and politically conservative; characterized by a more conforming, moralistic, and rule-bound personality, according to Cattell's personality factors; and have poor contact experience with lesbians and gay men. Males tended to have higher levels of homonegativity toward gay men but not toward lesbians. Proposals to reduce antigay bias in the Italian context will be briefly discussed.

T1  - Integrating quality into quantity: survey research in the era of mixed methods
AN  - 1781312981
AB  - As widely recognized during the golden age of survey research thanks to the work of the Columbia school, the use of mixed strategies allows survey research to overcome its limitations by incorporating the advantages of qualitative approaches rather than seeking alternative methods. The need to re-think survey research before embarking on this course impelled the author to undertake a critical analysis of one of the survey's most important assumptions, proposing a shift from standardization of stimulus to standardization of meanings in order to anchor the requirement of answer comparability on a more solid basis. This proposal for rapprochement with qualitative research is followed by a more detailed section in which the author distinguishes four different types of mixed survey strategies, combining two criteria (time order and function of qualitative procedures). The most significant parts of the constructed typology are then brought together in a model called the multilevel integrated survey approach. This methodological model is concretely illustrated in an empirical study of homophobic prejudice among teenagers. The example shows how in research practice analytical mixed strategies can be creatively combined in the same survey research design, contributing to improvements in data quality and the relevance of research findings.

T1  - The Collective Value of "Me" (and it's Limitations): Towards a More Nuanced Understanding of Individual and Collective Coping with Prejudice
AN  - 1710569316
AB  - Within the social identity tradition, individual and collective responses to social disadvantage are typically seen as mutually exclusive. This study (N = 120) provides a more nuanced understanding of individual and collective responses to social disadvantage by examining the ways in which women anticipate responding to "daily sexism." We test how responses are independently related to ingroup identification, disidentification, and perceived ingroup homogeneity. Results show that women favor confronting sexism over inaction, even if that involves disparaging the ingroup. Specifically, women expect to engage in both individual and collective strategies in response to a sexist statement. Identification with women was positively associated with both collective and individual (nongroup disparaging) responses, but only collective responses related to broader intentions to engage in collective action for social change. Finally, perceived group homogeneity uniquely increased agreement with the sexist statement, endorsement of inaction, and group-disparaging responses. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Can (elaborated) imagined contact interventions reduce prejudice among those higher in intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS)?
AN  - 1660887487
AB  - Intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS) reflects an affect-laden revulsion toward out-groups. Previous attempts to weaken its prediction of prejudice have failed. Given that clinical approaches to disgust sensitivity successfully utilize mental imagery, we consider contact simulation interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to control, standard imagined contact, or an elaborated contact condition (elaborated imagined contact [EIC]; detailed imagination involving physical contact with a homeless person, with relaxation instructions). Both contact conditions (vs. control) significantly weakened the link between ITG-DS and prejudice, yet only EIC weakened the relation between ITG-DS and out-group trust. Mediated moderation analysis confirmed that EIC significantly attenuated the link between ITG-DS and prejudice through increasing trust. Clinically relevant treatments are thus valuable in severing the association between (a) ITG-DS and (b) lower out-group trust and greater out-group prejudice.

T1  - The effect of television viewing on ethnic prejudice against immigrants: A study in the Italian context
AN  - 1735657105; 201536976
AB  - Television viewers construct many different meanings from the programs they watch. Here, we investigated whether ethnic prejudice is differentially influenced by the genre of television programs in their portrayal of ethnic minorities. We also wanted to determine whether a higher educational level reduces ethnic prejudice and television use. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to 401 Italian adults. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between ethnic prejudice and television program contents and educational level. Viewing Reality and Variety Shows was positively related to ethnic prejudice, News and Public Affairs was negatively related, and Films and TV series had no apparent influence on prejudice. Educational level was negatively related to both ethnic prejudice and watching Reality and Variety Shows, and positively related to viewing News and Public Affairs and Films and TV series programs.

T1  - Assemblies in Art and Politics: An interview with Jacques Ranciere
AN  - 1692290873; 201521746
AB  - This interview was conducted on 8 October 2011 at the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. It was held during a symposium that reflected on the work of Ranciere and was a part of a broader engagement with the concept of autonomy and its relation to art organized by an umbrella group of universities and arts organizations under the name of 'The Autonomy Project'. A number of the symposium's participants - Peter Osborne, Gerald Raunig, Isabell Lorey, Ruth Sondregger, Kim Mereiene and Adrian Martin - contributed questions that formed the basis of this interview. The interview took place at a time when the longer-term possibilities of the Arab Spring and Occupy/Indignados movements were under general scrutiny. It was also a moment when the Van Abbemuseum itself was compelled to reflect on its own position of political autonomy in relation to neoliberal state directives, political populism at the local level and its own critique of aesthetic autonomy. Ranciere's work on aesthetics and politics has been as much appreciated as a clearance strategy against prevailing visual prejudices as it has served as a platform for rethinking the emancipatory potential of creative practice.

T1  - A sociofunctional approach to prejudice at the polls: are atheists more politically disadvantaged than gays and Blacks?
AN  - 1566612531
AB  - Prejudice against atheists is pervasive in the United States. Atheists lag behind virtually all other minority groups on measures of social acceptance. The sociofunctional approach suggests that distrust is at the core of anti-atheist prejudice, thus making it qualitatively different than prejudice against other disadvantaged groups. Accordingly, this research examined political bias against atheists, gays, and Blacks and the affective content accompanying such biases. Results indicated that atheists suffered the largest deficit in voting intentions from Christian participants, and this deficit was accompanied by distrust, disgust, and fear, thereby suggesting that the affective content of anti-atheist prejudice is both broader and more extreme than prejudice against other historically disadvantaged groups. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

T1  - Perceived control qualifies the effects of threat on prejudice
AN  - 1660023887; 201505464
AB  - People sometimes show a tendency to lash out in a prejudiced manner when they feel threatened. This research shows that the relationship between threat and prejudice is moderated by people's levels of perceived control: Threat leads to prejudice only when people feel concurrently low in control. In two studies, terrorist threat was associated with heightened prejudice among people who were low in perceived control over the threat (Study 1; N = 87) or over their lives in general (Study 2; N = 2,394), but was not associated with prejudice among people who were high in perceived control. Study 3 (N = 139) replicated this finding experimentally in the context of the Global Financial Crisis. The research identifies control as an important ingredient in threatening contexts that, if bolstered, can reduce general tendencies to lash out under threat. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Americans' Perceptions of Commitment to Strong Families Across Race and Ethnic Groups
AN  - 1551001332; 201430614
AB  - Theories of prejudice examining perceptual differences of in-groups and out-groups, such as social dominance and group threat perspectives, have found them to be important in generating hegemonic identity formations. This study uses data from the General Social Surveys to explore how these hegemonic group perceptions influence attitudes toward stronger families using race and ethnic groups as proxy measures where Whites are considered the in-group. A modified ecosystemic-interactionist approach along with elements from group threat and social dominance theories as support was used to investigate the underlying premise that group membership influenced respondents' perceptions of their own family vis a vis others. Overall, the study found support for the underlying premise that membership influenced group perceptions, group knowledge, and group beliefs about commitment to strong families. Additionally, these findings suggest that groups develop most of their beliefs and subsequently their attitudes from limited interaction with those they perceived to be in the out-groups. Other social factors, including media portrayals, geographic propinquity, and education, also play a role in group perceptions, group knowledge, and group beliefs about commitment toward strong families. They support the social dominance and group threat theories that give rise to hegemonic structure within the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Influencing the World Versus Adjusting to Constraints
AN  - 1821580139
AB  - Although higher social class carries mental and physical health benefits, these advantages are less robust among members of racial and ethnic minority groups than among European Americans. We explore whether differential reactions to discrimination may be a factor in explaining why. Working-class and middle-class Latino American women engaged in an evaluative interaction with a European American woman who rejected them and held either prejudiced or unprejudiced attitudes. We examined how participants responded to this rejection by measuring neuroendocrine reactivity, executive functioning, and the affective content of their verbal responses during the interaction. Among middle-class Latinas, rejection from a prejudiced, compared to unprejudiced, out-group member was associated with less adaptive stress responses, greater cognitive depletion, and more feelings of uncertainty. In contrast, among working-class Latinas, neuroendocrine, cognitive, and affective responses were similar across the two sources of rejection. Results suggest that social class is an important moderator of responses to discrimination.

AN  - 1660022092; 201506176
AB  - We conducted an analysis of data describing 2,522 second- and third-generation immigrants, exploring how downward assimilation might be associated with labor union membership, occupational skills, residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood, and prejudice. The sample was extracted from the Immigration and Intergenerational Metropolitan Los Angeles 2004 data set. Multiple regression results showed that union membership and occupational skills have a negative association with downward assimilation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Youth Perceptions of the Police: Identifying Trajectories
AN  - 1504422938; 201407771
AB  - The relevance of examining juveniles' attitudes toward the police has been firmly established in the literature. Employing group-based trajectory modeling, the present study builds upon this previous research by estimating police attitudinal trajectories among a general sample of youths. The models produced a 5-group solution for both males and females, with four of the trajectories remaining relatively stable over the time observed and one noticeably experiencing a downward trend. Furthermore, of the items making up the police attitudinal scale, for several of the groups, the item measuring prejudice most consistently oscillated away from the trajectory profile. Policy implications are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Pride and prejudice: gay rights and religious moderation in Belfast
AN  - 1512219441; 201410420
AB  - In the summer of 2008, a Northern Irish politician began publicly denouncing homosexuality. Her remarks galvanized responses from a broad range of groups and individuals. New voices joined the discussion of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) civil rights, including trade unions and political parties that had previously been silent. Notably, some Christian churches expressed their support for gay rights by participating in Belfast's annual LGBT Pride Festival. Since 2008, long-standing opponents of gay rights have modulated their critiques. This article draws upon ethnographic research with Belfast's Pride Festival to examine religious groups' increasing support for LGBT rights since 2008. I describe this engagement as a practice of moderation in terms of its social and political effects. Here, moderation is conceived not in spatial terms as a position between opposed poles, but as a discursive practice that transforms political and religious debates. Drawing from Bakhtin's (1981) concept of 'dialogism', I consider how these discussions of Christianity, sexuality and politics unfolded. A Bakhtinian approach to the production and reception of these debates reveals how moderation is socially and historically situated. Moderation is practised in relation to particular conditions and histories, yet has the potential to transform them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'We were here first, so we determine the rules of the game': Autochthony and prejudice towards out-groups
AN  - 1512218298; 201408682
AB  - This paper identifies autochthony -- the belief that a place belongs to its original inhabitants and that they are therefore more entitled -- as a relevant new determinant of out-group prejudice. We hypothesized that autochthony uniquely predicts prejudice towards migrant groups and that it mediates the relationship between national identification and prejudice. The mediation process was anticipated to be especially strong for people who perceive out-group encroachment, that is, those who feel that immigrants are 'getting out of place'. These hypotheses were tested in two studies using nationally representative samples of native Dutch participants. In Study 1 (N = 793), we showed that autochthony is an empirically distinct construct and that it is a unique predictor of prejudice. Furthermore, higher national identifiers expressed stronger claims of autochthony, and these claims were in turn associated with more negative feelings towards migrant groups. Study 2 (N = 466) showed support for a moderated mediation model: Beliefs in autochthony were only related to prejudice for participants who perceived out-group encroachment.

T1  - Gender Differences in Health Symptoms Associated with the Exposure to Physical Violence in Family: Data from the 2006 National Health Survey in Serbia
AN  - 1504423878; 201407805
AB  - This study analyzed gender differences in exposure to family violence in Serbia and its association with health symptoms. Using data from the National Health Survey 2006 in Serbia, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were run to examine the association between exposure to physical violence in the family (in the past 12 months) and the occurrence of 15 different health symptoms (in the past 4 weeks). Out of 12,646 interviewed adults (older than 20), women reported experiencing family violence nearly 1.7 times more often than men (1.28 % vs. 0.75 %). Women had nine health symptoms significantly associated with experienced violence, while men had four, even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Depression and insomnia were common for both genders. Results suggest that physicians should pay attention to health complaints, consider family violence as an associated factor, and address violence in a gender sensitive way that is free of prejudice and preconceptions.

T1  - Prejudice and 'Vladimir's choice' among Israeli Arabs and Jews: Symmetrical vs. asymmetrical trends
AN  - 1504423815; 201405300
AB  - The study adopted a group status perspective to examine the relationships between social dominance orientation (SDO), prejudice, and 'Vladimir's choice' tendency. It was hypothesized that for high-status group members (Israeli Jews), high SDO levels will be followed by increases in prejudice and 'Vladimir's choice' tendency, while for the low-status group (Israeli Arabs), a negative relationship should appear between SDO and the intergroup measures. The research sample comprising 100 Israeli Jews and 85 Israeli Arabs completed SDO and prejudice questionnaires, and performed a resource allocation task. As hypothesized, group status moderated the relationship between SDO and group prejudice. Contrary to our expectations, however, both samples exhibited a positive relationship between SDO and negative group prejudice. A positive relationship was also found between SDO and the positive prejudice factor in the Jewish sample, while no significant relationship was found between SDO and the positive prejudice factor in the Arab sample. Only group status correlated with Vladimir's choice preferences. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Waiting for Mr. Right: The Meaning of Being a Single Educated Chinese Female Over 30 in Beijing and Guangzhou
AN  - 1567048679; 201437810
AB  - Although female singlehood has become a lifestyle in western countries, never married and being over 30 is still viewed as 'special' in contemporary China. Chinese single females live in a culture of traditional social prejudice against singlehood. Traditional family and societal values in general place pressure on single females to marry and have a child. This phenomenological study explores the meaning of being single and presents a firsthand view of how such women feel. Ten never-married single females over 30 years of age took part in one-on-one telephone interviews. Constant comparison data analysis revealed three major themes in their lived experiences of being single: (1) awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of singlehood; (2) ambiguous attitudes towards marriage; and (3) adjustments in life needed to make living as singles worthwhile.

AN  - 1541997932; 201427360
AB  - Increasing numbers of female candidates are running for Congress in American national elections. Despite the rise in female candidates running for office, women are not significantly increasing their presence in the House and Senate. A much hypothesized influence over the electoral fates of female candidates is the role of gender stereotypes. However, political science scholars have struggled to pinpoint the effect of stereotypes on vote choice, if there is any effect. This essay compares the way social psychology and political science scholars theoretically, conceptually and empirically test for gender stereotype influence over evaluations of female candidates and politicians. Differences emerge in the theoretical assumptions made in the two disciplines, the types of measures used in research, and the empirical tests conducted to demonstrate the presence or absence of stereotypes in evaluations of women. The discussion explores how scholars studying female candidates and politicians can integrate insights from social psychology to clarify the role of stereotypes in candidate evaluation and choice.

T1  - Prevent-ing Muslimness in Britain: The Normalisation of Exceptional Measures to Combat Terrorism
AN  - 1512219893; 201410133
AB  - This paper argues that the Prevent strand of the British counter-terrorism strategy (CONTEST) and the related normalisation of exceptional measures to combat terrorism have had a significant impact on the ways in which Muslim communities can play out their Muslimness in Britain. State treatment of Muslims as a suspect community facilitates the (re)production of widespread Islamophobia that penetrates the social fabric and reinforces a popular image of Muslims as folk devils of late modernity. Those Muslims who exhibit popularly understood signifiers of their identity (e.g.: skin colour, beard, hijab) risk becoming an easy, immediate target for state discrimination and social prejudice. After exploring how this vicious cycle is produced and reproduced at both the macro-(state) level and the meso/micro (community and individual) level, some tentative recommendations will be provided. These recommendations advocate for: preventative measures that are grounded on bottom-up approaches and that are able to empower Muslim communities; the promotion of a better, more nuanced understanding of Islam within broader society; and a reflection on the philosophical ideas of difference and diversity as they relate to the coexistence of pluralistic, multi-ethnic communities within post-modern, global societies.

T1  - The Suburban Idea and Its Enemies
AN  - 1494299690; 201403376
AB  - Late in the twentieth century public opinion began to turn against the Australian suburb, as its enemies began to outnumber its friends. For more than 150 years, Australia was itself a mental suburb of England, taking many of its ideas ready-made from the world's metropolis, London. This article identifies the main ideological strands of the suburban idea as it first appeared in England-Evangelicalism, Romanticism, Sanitarianism, and Class Prejudice-and examines how they were reproduced, with occasional variations, in the colonial city. Critics of the suburban idea, it is argued, shared many of the tacit assumptions of its friends, differing only in the value they assigned to each component. Anti-suburbanism, even in its contemporary forms, continues to reproduce many features of its nineteenth-century antecedents. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AN  - 1448995187; 201344930
AB  - This paper will discuss continuing police reform and gender issues and how the organizational culture can be moved from misogynist to inclusive. In addition, it will discuss how the community policing philosophy has caused special populations, (gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender), who under the professional model were often marginalized, can be dealt with in a manner devoid of bias or prejudice. The role of police women in the twenty-first century will also be discussed in relation to the feminist writers' perspective as the police accept that their role has a duty of care and is not solely about crime fighting.

T1  - Counter-prejudicial training reduces activation of biased associations and enhances response monitoring
AN  - 1448995286; 201342662
AB  - Although implicitly measured bias was once assumed to be highly stable, subsequent research has shown that it is, in fact, malleable. One technique for altering implicit bias is through counter-prejudicial training. At least two broad mechanisms may drive this effect. First, training people to respond in counter-prejudicial ways may diminish the extent to which biased associations are activated in memory. Second, training may strengthen processes that reduce the influence of biased associations on responses. Participants received either counter-prejudicial, pro-prejudicial, or no training and then completed an implicit measure of bias. Application of the quadruple process model revealed support for both mechanisms: Counter-prejudicial training produced less activation of biased associations as well as enhanced detection of appropriate responses compared with pro-prejudicial or no training. Implications for the development of bias-reduction training are discussed. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Intercultural non-conscious influences: Prosocial effects of Buddhist priming on Westerners of Christian tradition
AN  - 1448991636; 201343011
AB  - Prosocial concepts and behavior are often found to be activated when participants are primed with concepts of their own religious cultural tradition. We investigated whether similar effects can be found when people (Westerners of Christian tradition) are primed with concepts of a different from their own religious cultural tradition (Buddhist and Islamic). Participants (104 young Belgian adults) were randomly assigned to three conditions. They were supraliminally primed with either Buddhist or Islamic images; or they were not primed (control condition). Priming Buddhism increased prosocial intentions (spontaneous sharing of hypothetical gains), and decreased, among participants highly valuing universalism, implicit prejudice toward an ethnic outgroup. Priming Islam had no effect on prosociality or prejudice. The findings suggest that concepts from one religious and cultural context are transposable, under some conditions, to another religious and cultural context and can influence even implicit social cognition.

T1  - Forging links with the self to combat implicit bias
AN  - 1429628016; 201335593
AB  - Two experiments examined whether Whites' implicit biases toward Blacks could be reduced by conditioning links between Blacks and the self. Via a computer-mediated experience, White participants were assigned to the same (minimal) group as several Black individuals and practiced classifying photographs as "MY GROUP" or "OTHER GROUP." Subsequent performance on implicit prejudice and stereotyping measures was compared to a control condition and another condition involving extensive counterstereotype conditioning. Across experiments, the link to self strategy significantly reduced implicit prejudice, relative to the control condition, and to the same extent as the counterstereotype conditioning condition. Process dissociation analyses revealed that these effects corresponded with a reduction in the automatic activation of biased associations. Counterstereotype conditioning also reduced implicit stereotyping, but the link-to-self strategy did not. These findings extend prior work on the reduction of implicit biases and highlight the importance of comparing implicit bias strategies across different types of bias measures.

T1  - The Place of Liberal Education in Contemporary Higher Education
AN  - 1438560761; 201341236
AB  - Inasmuch as an education seeks to lead a human being to some desired end, it aims to be formative. To say that every education seeks to form a human being in light of some designated end or telos is to say that one can receive an education in many different things or many different ends. This point is sharpened -- and made more problematic -- when we think about the fundamental end of all of the various kinds of education. Here, the opening of Augustine's short work On Christian Doctrine is instructive. Like Plato's Socrates does in the first book of the Republic, Augustine begins this work by noting that ultimately education requires human beings to think about the question of how they should live. At its peak, human education is inextricably caught up with our desire to answer the question what kind of human being do we really want to be. Taking responsibility (or "ownership" to use the wince-inducing jargon of contemporary Educational Schools) for this kind of education is a daunting task, both for students and for teachers. For it requires us to think courageously and seriously about a wide range of important -- and by no means easy -- historical, moral, political, philosophical, and theological questions. The sophistic alternatives to such education either set such weighty questions aside or dogmatically assume that these questions have already been definitively asked and answered. Such alternatives reduce all aspects of human education to forms of methodological training. In the names of expediency or ideological certainty, they all but ensure that we will remain enslaved to the particular prejudices of our particular caves. As Max Weber, the founder of modern sociology, made clear in his "Science as a Vocation" lecture nearly a century ago, if education is understood simply as the acquisition of a specific set of methodological skills, it fatalistically resigns itself to forming only "specialists without spirit or vision and voluptuaries without heart." Liberal education refuses to accept such radical lowering of the educational horizon. It understands that specialized forms of educations, in the final analysis, must be tied to the overarching concerns of human beings' most fundamental education. It understands that to the extent that education is a kind of specialization, it must eventually specialize in the end and perfection of human beings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Modifying perceived variability: four laboratory and field experiments show the effectiveness of a ready-to-be-used prejudice intervention
AN  - 1433108845
AB  - We examined whether increasing individuals' perceived variability of an out-group reduces prejudice and discrimination toward members of this group. In a series of four laboratory and field experiments, we attracted participants' attention to the heterogeneity of members of an out-group (or not), and then measured their attitudes or behaviors. Perceived variability was manipulated by portraying the out-group members as having diverse socio-demographic characteristics and different personality traits and preferences. Prejudice and discrimination were measured in terms of self-reported prejudice, stereotyping, in-group bias, social distance, and willingness to do something for the minority group under consideration. In all experiments, perceived variability decreased prejudice and discrimination.

AN  - 1417524164; 201331761
AB  - In this review, we highlight the importance of understanding diversity ideologies, or people's beliefs and practices regarding diversity, for social psychological research on intergroup relations. This review focuses on two diversity ideologies, colorblindness and multiculturalism, and their impact on core issues related to intergroup conflict, such as stereotypes, prejudice, attitudes toward inequality, interracial interactions, and disparate outcomes between minority and majority group members. We close by highlighting some of the areas in which future research has the potential to be especially illuminating. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Why does ingroup essentialism increase prejudice against minority members?
AN  - 1364702309; 201323253
AB  - A study with British participants (N = 90) tested a potential mediator of the effect of essentialist beliefs about the national ingroup on prejudice against immigrants. Essentialist beliefs were defined as beliefs in genetic determinism, a basic assumption that group membership is "written in the blood" and that the groups' boundaries and characteristics are determined by genetic and/or biological factors. Essentialist beliefs were expected to play an important role in the formation of prejudice. They were predicted to be associated with a reduction in the perceived possibility of immigrants' adopting the mainstream culture. Further, it was expected that essentialist beliefs would be positively associated with perceptions of intergroup threat, which in turn would be associated with a stronger demand for immigrants adopting the mainstream culture. Taken together, essentialist beliefs were predicted to be associated with a greater discrepancy between the demand for and perceived feasibility of culture adoption. This discrepancy was hypothesized to mediate the effect of essentialist beliefs on prejudice against immigrants. Structural equation modeling analysis and mediation analysis supported the hypotheses, showing that essentialism attributed to the national ingroup results in people demanding something seemingly impossible from immigrants, and that this situation in which immigrants have little chance of fulfilling majority members' expectations results in prejudice against them. Thus, results show that perceptions of the ingroup are associated with attitudes to the outgroup, and they outline an explanatory mechanism for the positive correlation between essentialism and prejudice which has been found in previous research. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Looking for a Specificity of Rural Youth. The Polish Case
AN  - 1547308521
AB  - In social consciousness a view is embedded that our rural and agrarian areas are our weakness which limits our development potential and social change. Whatever the reasons (mostly historical) for this view, the divide into rural and urban areas, Poland A and Poland B, is frequently referred to and just as frequently exaggerated, supporting thus various stereotypes and prejudices.1 Do they also concern the young generation?              Rural areas in Poland are subject to dynamic transformation. The image of rural areas and its reception across society is changing positively. The favourable balance between migration and a growing interest among young people in the countryside as a future place of residence can be used as an example. However, this does not mean that the problem of rural areas and regional differences in Poland has been resolved. Neither do the changes happen as rapidly as could have been expected, nor do they happen in parallel in terms of geography and social structure. Not all of them are positive. The large number of small farms (although land concentration was expected in agriculture) is disturbing. The succession to economically weak farmsteads (which shows that in the face of no employment and non-agricultural life prospects an economically non-viable farm seems - from an individual perspective - the best possible solution). This phenomenon gives rise to many questions. Here, we only want to discuss the questions concerning the young generation - whether their aspirations and life goals, educational decisions, places of residence can be conducive to change (inside and outside rural areas) or rather impede them?

T1  - Mental simulation and sexual prejudice reduction: the debiasing role of counterfactual thinking
AN  - 1433107792
AB  - Reducing prejudice is a critical research agenda, and never before has counterfactual priming been evaluated as a potential prejudice-reduction strategy. In the present experiment, participants were randomly assigned to imagine a pleasant interaction with a homosexual man and then think counterfactually about how an incident of sexual discrimination against him might not have occurred (experimental condition) or to imagine a nature scene (control condition). Results demonstrated a significant reduction in sexual prejudice from baseline levels in the counterfactual simulation group. Importantly, whereas intergroup anxiety and motivation to control prejudice were not predictive factors, number of counterfactual thoughts generated independently predicted variance in prejudice reduction. Mechanisms for, and implications of, prejudice-reduction strategies including counterfactual thinking are discussed.

T1  - The veil and Muslim women's identity: Cultural pressures and resistance to stereotyping
AN  - 1347782550; 201318572
AB  - This study compares Muslim women's views on wearing the veil in a Muslim majority society, Indonesia, with the Muslim minority in India. In-depth interviews reveal significant differences between the two: Majority women talk in terms of convenience, fashion, and modesty with little reference to religion as their reasons for veiling. The responses of Muslim minority women are diverse: their account of veiling stretches from religiously inspired arguments through to reasons of convenience, and to opposition against stereotypes and discrimination. Most minority women see the veil as a way of affirming their cultural identity. We argue that religious minorities are forced into constructing their cultural identity in ways that exaggerate their group belonging and difference from broader society. This may be motivated either by falling back on religious resources or by using ethnic markers to overtly oppose endemic prejudice. No such identity issue exists for the Muslim majority women. This contradicts the dominant view in non-Muslim countries in the West, where the female scarf is primarily considered a symbol of religious fundamentalism and patriarchal oppression.

T1  - Immigrant and Native Romani Women in Spain: Building Alliances and Developing Shared Strategies
AN  - 2076975944
AB  - Romani women, both immigrant and native, face a greater risk of social exclusion because of the prejudices that mainstream society has about the Roma, and especially because they are women and some of them immigrants as well. This paper analyses how Romani immigrant and native women are building pan-ethnic identities, sharing alliances and developing common strategies in Spain. Previous studies on Romani women have tended to see them as passive and not active agents. Thus, very few have focused on the specific case of Romani immigrant women and on their modes of incorporation in their new contexts of reception. Drawing on data from two qualitative studies of Roma immigrant women and Gitanas in Spain, the authors demonstrate how everyday-life interactions and shared interests at informal and formal encounters lead to building solidarity alliances and sharing transnational narratives, thus overcoming subgroup ethnic boundaries and stereotypes. The analysis is carried out from the 'other women' approach, taking into account the voices of all types of Romani women, illiterate and literate, in the whole research process.

AN  - 1433107812
AB  - Expressions of prejudice were compared between Asian American and Black, Hispanic, Jewish, and White respondents to social distance and stereotype items on 5 recent nationwide public opinion surveys. There was much prejudice toward Asian Americans. Their prejudice was greatest toward Blacks and Hispanics and least toward Jews and Whites. Among Asian American subgroups, prejudice toward Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites was greatest by Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans; and least by Filipino Americans and Asian Indian Americans. Suggestions are made for further research.

T1  - The Unequal Weight of Discrimination: Gender, Body Size, and Income Inequality
AN  - 1266145420; 201301343
AB  - At present, most work examining the well-documented relationship between social inequality and body size treats fatness as an effect, caused either by some factor that determines weight and social class simultaneously, or by social class itself. However, the relationship between weight and social inequality is more complex than these explanations suggest. Recent studies by John Cawley (2004) and Charles Baum and William Ford (2004) suggest that fatness is often a contributor to inequality, not merely an effect. This article examines the causes of income inequalities between obese and nonobese workers, focusing on how gender interacts with body size to determine the size and duration of those inequalities. Drawing on data from the 1997-2008 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), I introduce a positive test for discrimination, which provides a methodological advantage over previous research in this area. I then pose two questions: first, is anti-obesity discrimination to blame for income inequalities between obese and nonobese workers? Second, do women and men's experiences of those inequalities differ? The results indicate that very obese men do face one form of discrimination -- statistical discrimination -- but that they' can overcome initial disadvantages with time. In contrast, obese women's income disadvantages persist over time, suggesting the presence of prejudicial discrimination. In combination with previous studies illustrating how fat women are disadvantaged in educational attainment and marriage outcomes -- two important means of accessing economic resources -- this research shows one mechanism by which weight, particularly in combination with gender, is a major vector of U.S. inequality.

T1  - The personalization model revisited: An experimental investigation of the role of five personalization-based strategies on prejudice reduction
AN  - 1125220067; 201240269
AB  - In this paper, we report findings from a series of experimental studies investigating the role of five personalization-based strategies (individuation, self-disclosure, decategorization, self-other comparison, and empathy) on prejudice reduction. As anticipated, participants who were in the self-disclosure or individuation conditions developed more favorable attitudes towards other out-group members (Study 1). In Study 2, decategorization or self-other comparison allowed group members to discover similarities between the self and members of the out-group, thereby reducing negative out-group memory. Interestingly, when we explored the processes underlying the generalization of prejudice reduction to the out-group (Study 3), we found that the affective component of personalization (i.e., empathy) emerged as a more robust predictor of prejudice reduction than self-other comparison and decategorization. In conclusion, these studies provide the first empirical evidence of the effects of the five components of personalization in reducing prejudice across different contexts and different experimental paradigms.

T1  - Gender threats and men's antigay behaviors: The harmful effects of asserting heterosexuality
AN  - 1125220050; 201240264
AB  - Whereas recent work on gender role violations suggests that asserting their heterosexuality may diminish the harmful effects of gender threats (versus gender affirmations) on men's antigay reactions, predictions derived from social identity theory suggest that asserting heterosexuality can exacerbate the negative effects of a gender threat on antigay reactions. Two studies tested these competing hypotheses. In Study 1, gender threatened versus affirmed men sent more intense noise blasts at a gay partner, but only if they asserted their heterosexuality. In Study 2, men high in sexual prejudice who underwent a gender threat sat farther from a gay confederate than gender affirmed men, but only if they asserted heterosexuality. Discussion considers the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, and highlights directions for future research.

T1  - The Missing Quadrants of Antidiscrimination: Going Beyond the "Prejudice Polygraph"
AN  - 1125223735; 201242149
AB  - Behavioral realists urge the law to respond to new scientific discoveries about the reality of contemporary discrimination. But in thinking about how the law might respond, it is easy to frame the question as: When should evidence from scientific instruments, such as the Implicit Association Test, be admissible in a discrimination lawsuit. In other words, should we admit into evidence the results of some "Prejudice Polygraph"? But this framing, which focuses on specific facts, found ex post is too narrow and obscures a much broader range of potential legal responses. Indeed, by considering both specific and general facts, as well as both ex post and ex ante time orientations, four separate quadrants of analysis emerge. Psychologists, legal scholars, and policymakers should not miss these other quadrants of antidiscrimination. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Speaking of Privilege: Family Therapy Educators' Journeys toward Awareness and Compassionate Action
AN  - 1125223690; 201242481
AB  - This study explores how family therapy educators from privileged social locations understand issues of privilege and the process by which they integrate their personal and professional journeys to create and model equity in family therapy training and professional development. These educators developed awareness about issues of privilege and oppression and owned their privilege. Increased awareness involved personal struggles with guilt and managing internalized voices of prejudice that are constantly reinforced in society. These educators adopted a stance of action and accountability for equity. We hypothesize that the process leading to owning one's privilege involves the ability to be compassionate for others' suffering and one's own limitations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intercultural Effectiveness, Authoritarianism, and Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1433107102
AB  - This study examined the extent to which intercultural effectiveness dimensions (cultural empathy, open-mindedness, social initiative, emotional stability, flexibility) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) predicted the ethnic prejudice of 166 Australian respondents toward Indigenous Australians. Intercultural effectiveness was assessed on the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire, and RWA was assessed on the RWA scale, whereas ethnic prejudice was measured on the Modern Racism Scale. The results revealed that intercultural effectiveness (open-mindedness, flexibility, cultural empathy) was inversely related to ethnic prejudice, with open-mindedness being the main predictor. Intercultural effectiveness was also inversely related to RWA, the latter being directly related to ethnic prejudice. The implications of these findings for the potential role of intercultural effectiveness in combating ethnic prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Implicit and explicit emotional reactions to witnessing prejudice
AN  - 1023027217; 201223703
AB  - The present study examined how individual differences in motivation to respond without prejudice predict self-reported negative affect and physiological responses to the prejudicial acts of others. One hundred and one White participants were paired with a Black "partner" and together they watched two White men on film having either a pro- or antidiversity discussion. The higher participants were on internal motivation to respond without prejudice, the greater their self-reported negative affect and the more they exhibited distress-related physiological responses during the antidiversity discussion. In contrast, during the prodiversity discussion participants lower in internal motivation to respond without prejudice showed greater physiological distress, but did not self-report more negative affect. These results suggest that only those who have internalized egalitarian goals exhibit the negative emotional responses likely to promote opposition to expressions of intergroup bias; those who lack these goals might instead react against efforts to promote diversity.

T1  - A Philosophical Investigation: Interrogating Practices and Beliefs about Disability
AN  - 1322723394; 201310706
AB  - Sometimes beliefs that are shared are treated as if they are knowledge in spite of a lack of evidence or even in the face of evidence to the contrary. Beliefs informed by prejudices and ignorance about people with disabilities are often treated as certain and reinforced by social practices. In this paper, I distinguish between knowledge claims and beliefs that are treated as if they are true. I use Wittgenstein's account of the connection between epistemic and other social practices in On Certainty to consider how it is possible to change beliefs about disability. I draw on Naomi Scheman's "Forms of life: Mapping the Rough Ground" to consider political applications of Wittgenstein's thought. I use a Wittgensteinian framework to critique Peter Singer's claims regarding the lives of disabilities in Practical Ethics. I draw attention to the ways in which unjustified beliefs about disability can inform and be reified through social practices. Likewise, changes in social practices can dislodge common ableist beliefs about disability. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Not all prejudices are experienced equally: Comparing experiences of racism and sexism in female minorities
AN  - 1023028898; 201223700
AB  - Research exploring the perspectives of stigmatized people has examined general processes related to experiencing prejudice. Past work, however, has invoked the assumption that prejudices against different group memberships are experienced in a similar manner. Across three studies we directly compare experiences of racism and sexism among female minorities and show, in contrast, that people respond to different forms of prejudice in distinct ways. In Study 1 we examined the attributions invoked by Asian women to explain prejudice and discovered that participants made stronger internal attributions to explain racism than sexism. In Study 2 we investigated emotional reactions to prejudice and found that Asian women report experiencing more depression following a race-based rejection than a gender-based rejection. In Study 3 we observed that Asian women reported perceiving more racism than sexism in their environments. Implications for advancing theories of prejudice experiences are discussed.

T1  - Polyculturalism and openness about criticizing one's culture: Implications for sexual prejudice
AN  - 1023028857; 201223702
AB  - Abundant research on the relationship between ideologies and sexual prejudice has not focused on intergroup ideologies such as colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism. In three studies with racially and ethnically diverse college and community samples, endorsement of polyculturalism-an ideology focusing on the interactions, influences, and connections among racial and ethnic groups-was associated with lower sexual prejudice (as measured by affective prejudice toward gay men and lesbians, traditional heterosexism, denial of discrimination against homosexuals, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians). Polyculturalism's relationship with lower sexual prejudice was mediated by greater openness to criticizing elements of one's culture that marginalize some groups. Polyculturalism accounted for unique variance in sexual prejudice even when controlling for colorblindness, multiculturalism, social dominance orientation, ethnic identity, conservatism, as well as race and gender. Colorblindness and multiculturalism were not consistently related to lower sexual prejudice. Future work on intergroup ideologies and sexual prejudice is discussed.

T1  - Do you believe in atheists? Distrust is central to anti-atheist prejudice
AN  - 964187083; 201208910
AB  - Recent polls indicate that atheists are among the least liked people in areas with religious majorities (i.e., in most of the world). The sociofunctional approach to prejudice, combined with a cultural evolutionary theory of religion's effects on cooperation, suggest that anti-atheist prejudice is particularly motivated by distrust. Consistent with this theoretical framework, a broad sample of American adults revealed that distrust characterized anti-atheist prejudice but not anti-gay prejudice (Study 1). In subsequent studies, distrust of atheists generalized even to participants from more liberal, secular populations. A description of a criminally untrustworthy individual was seen as comparably representative of atheists and rapists but not representative of Christians, Muslims, Jewish people, feminists, or homosexuals (Studies 2-4). In addition, results were consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between belief in God and atheist distrust was fully mediated by the belief that people behave better if they feel that God is watching them (Study 4). In implicit measures, participants strongly associated atheists with distrust, and belief in God was more strongly associated with implicit distrust of atheists than with implicit dislike of atheists (Study 5). Finally, atheists were systematically socially excluded only in high-trust domains; belief in God, but not authoritarianism, predicted this discriminatory decision-making against atheists in high trust domains (Study 6). These 6 studies are the first to systematically explore the social psychological underpinnings of anti-atheist prejudice, and converge to indicate the centrality of distrust in this phenomenon.

AB  - Recovering Lombroso's Jewish identity is important for understanding the context in which he lived and worked. Italian statehood and positivist science had particular meaning relative to Jewish emancipation. Lombroso turned his back on Judaism and Jewish tradition, but interacted over the years with a circle of Jewish colleagues. Salvatore Ottolenghi, Pauline Tarnowsky, Helen Zimmern, Max Nordau and Jean Finot influenced his professional life in more than one way, as did members of his family, such as David Levi. Lombroso contributed to the defence of Jews from the surge of anti-Semitism in the late nineteenth century and he even managed a measure of critical analysis in his discussion of Jews and crime. Although he failed to overcome the prejudices and misconceptions at the centre of his outlook, the Lombroso who engaged 'the Jewish question' emerges as a more complicated and conflicted character than the Lombroso associated with 'the criminal man'.

T1  - Sexism and Gender Inequality Across 57 Societies
AN  - 1910814779
AB  - Theory predicts that individuals' sexism serves to exacerbate inequality in their society's gender hierarchy. Past research, however, has provided only correlational evidence to support this hypothesis. In this study, I analyzed a large longitudinal data set that included representative data from 57 societies. Multilevel modeling showed that sexism directly predicted increases in gender inequality. This study provides the first evidence that sexist ideologies can create gender inequality within societies, and this finding suggests that sexism not only legitimizes the societal status quo, but also actively enhances the severity of the gender hierarchy. Three potential mechanisms for this effect are discussed briefly.

T1  - Contact and knowledge as predictors of attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities
AN  - 907925886; 201124581
AB  - Understanding attitudes that may lead to barriers to equality can help enhance social inclusion and quality of life for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The current study examined multidimensional attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities. We expected that those with more knowledge and greater quantity and quality of contact with people with intellectual disabilities would have more positive attitudes toward this social group. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that greater knowledge and quantity of contact were unrelated to attitudes. Greater quality of contact, however, was associated with more positive attitudes. These findings add support to previous findings that positive experiences may lead to less intergroup anxiety, less hostility, and less avoidance of outgroups.

T1  - Police Responses to Diversity: A Social Representational Study of Rural British Policing in a Changing Representational Context
AN  - 914766464; 201200111
AB  - In the first decade of the 21st century, British policing faced two new challenges in how it responded to social diversity: As well as instituting reforms in response to a highly publicized report describing the British police as 'institutionally racist' (Macpherson, 1999), they faced challenges associated with rapid increases in numbers of immigrants into the UK. Studying social representations at such times of change allows access into processes, themes and value systems that may otherwise remain hidden. This paper uses social representations theory to explore interview accounts provided by regular police officers of interactions with members of minority groups. Empirically, we focus on an area of diversity policing that has received relatively little previous attention: Police work in a rural context that has recently played host to large numbers of migrant workers. Our analysis shows that interviews operate as a site of resistance in which respondents attempt to rework hegemonic representations of the police as prejudiced and to re-present themselves and their work as able to respond appropriately to diversity. Fairness as a defining characteristic of good police practice is a central representational theme that links identity construction processes to police work with minority groups. Recent immigrant groups are represented as both needing and deserving help to assimilate into British culture: Their lack of acculturation and language difficulties provide additional challenges to police work and to how this is judged as 'fair'. We discuss the broader origins and implications of police officers' understandings of fairness and the use of social representations theory to study representational fields within organizational settings.

T1  - Gender and Trade Union Development: A Situational Analysis of Jamaica
AN  - 914768023; 201201308
AB  - This paper is an examination of the gender relations that exist between men and women in the Jamaican labour movement. Women within Jamaican trade unions, despite their contribution to the movement's development, are continuously exempted from positions of leadership because of socio-cultural and institutional factors that exist to protect male hegemony within the labour movement. The paper presents a case study with background information to assess the gender structure of trade unions under the Jamaica Confederation of the Trade Unions (JCTU). This helps us to better understand the relationship between gender and leadership in trade union organisations. This study adds to the available literature on the issue. It provides an analytical framework to critically examine the leadership structure of Jamaican union organizations and areas for further research on women's issues in the labour movement. The research reveals that the trade union's culture, which encourages patriarchy, has compromised its ability to counter institutional prejudices that have subjugated women at all levels within the labour movement.

T1  - Balkan Diversity Under Two Contradictory Philosophies Of Ruling: Ottoman And Communist
AN  - 914766590; 201200584
AB  - The Balkan Peninsula is both, a mosaic of diverse nations, religious groups, cultures and ethnicities speaking different languages, and a puzzle of confusing complexity, depending on one's philosophic perspective. Due to the nationalistic behavior of their post communist politicians and the militant dictatorial communist regime that lasted fifty over years in the area, these nations, are in urgent need of a new epistemic approach, free of any prejudice, regarding multiculturalism, multiethnic frameworks and general diversity. As a person who was born and lived in a Balkan country for a long time, I made myself familiar with every social group in the Balkans. I believe that these nations are very much committed to freedom, peace and nonviolent reforms. I also believe that they can achieve this within short period of time. All they need is a context within which education, based on contemporary democratic standards is made possible. What I mean by democratic standards is that education ought to be on "cultural neutrality", meaning one takes on a value-free attitude about any culture, including one's own. They are in need of a philosophy of education that will make clear the importance and benefits of mutual respect, recognition and the value of living in a multicultural and multiethnic society. These are the problems that we are going to discuss in this paper within the context of an analysis of the fate of these nations under two contradictory philosophic rules: the Ottoman Empire and the Communist.

T1  - The role of need for closure in essentialist entitativity beliefs and prejudice: An epistemic needs approach to racial categorization
AN  - 875714638; 201115260
AB  - The present research investigates how people's general epistemic motives may inspire essentialist beliefs about racial groups and racism. In three studies, we focus particularly on essentialist entitativity (EE, referring to beliefs about the uniformity, informativeness, and inherent core of racial groups), probing into its relationships with epistemic need for closure (NFC) and prejudice. In Study I, we develop an EE scale, empirically distinguish it from the naturalness component of essentialism and non-EE beliefs, and establish its predictive utility for explaining racial prejudice. Study 2 provides experimental evidence for the causal effect of NFC on EE beliefs. Study 3 demonstrates in three different samples that EE beliefs mediate the relationship between dispositional NFC and racial prejudice. It is argued that EE beliefs about racial groups are an expression of motivated social cognition, serving people's seizing needs for quick and easy social judgment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Divine Boundaries: How Religion Shapes Citizens' Attitudes Toward Immigrants
AN  - 1928625142
AB  - How does religion affect one's attitudes toward immigrants? Scholars have shown that members of minor religious groups are less anti-immigrant than members of majority affiliations and that Evangelical Protestants are particularly hostile. Other scholars have demonstrated that increased religiosity reduces immigrant animus. Here, we argue that religion affects immigration attitudes via a distinct religiously informed interpretation of America's national identity, which we call Christian nationalism. Christian nationalists believe that America has a divinely inspired mission and link its success to God's favor. Using social identity complexity theory, we argue that citizens who ascribe to this worldview should be least tolerant of those they perceive as symbolic threats to American national identity. We assess this claim using the 2006 Pew Immigration Attitudes Survey and the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey. Christian nationalism is a robust determinant of immigrant animus, whereas religious affiliation only affects immigrant animus when Christian nationalism is excluded.

T1  - From Prejudice to Discrimination: The Legitimizing Role of Perceived Threat in Discrimination against Immigrants
AN  - 856403328; 201106809
AB  - This research analyses the mediational role of threat perception in the relationship between prejudice and discrimination (opposition to immigration and opposition to naturalization of immigrants). In the first study, using representative samples in 21 European countries (N=36566) from European Social Survey (2002), we showed that the relationship between prejudice and opposition to immigration was more strongly mediated by realistic than by symbolic threat perceptions. In Study 2, using representative samples in two countries with different traditions of immigration (Switzerland, N=940; Portugal, N=1514), we showed that realistic threat more strongly mediated the relationship between prejudice and opposition to immigration, while only symbolic threat perception mediated the link between prejudice and opposition to naturalization. The theoretical implications of considering threat perceptions as factors that legitimize discrimination are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Who Has Religious Prejudice? Differing Sources Of Anti-Religious Animosity In The United States
AN  - 852899636; 201104746
AB  - Research indicates that older, less educated, politically conservative, and highly religious individuals are disproportionately likely to exhibit animosity because of race, sex, and sexuality. But little work explores animosity towards traditionally oriented social groups, such as religious conservatives. Theories about the unique characteristics of those possessing animosity predicts little animosity from progressives against fundamentalists while the theory of ethnocentrism predicts that progressives possess animosity towards fundamentalists as a social out-group. I use the National Elections Survey to document the degree of animosity a variety of religious groups face and who is likely to exhibit that animosity. In particular I investigate whether animosity towards conservative social groups comes from similar sources as animosity towards progressive social groups. Animosity towards atheists is higher than towards other religious groups, but the level of animosity towards fundamentalists is not trivial. Regression analysis indicates that political progressiveness and educational attainment, two factors predicting tolerance toward progressive religious groups, is positively correlated with animosity towards fundamentalists. Animosity towards religious conservatives may manifest itself differently than animosity towards progressive social groups due to contrasting characteristics of those possessing it.

T1  - Educating jurors: technology, the Internet and the jury system
AN  - 887500737; 201119137
AB  - This paper explores two ways in which the Internet and technology impact upon the jury trial. The first issue concerns jurors' improper use of the Internet to conduct research into the case they are hearing and the improper use of social networking websites. It is important to minimise the prejudicial effect that the introduction of extraneous material might have on the legitimacy of the verdict and the integrity of the jury system in the Internet age. This paper argues that more needs to be done to educate jurors about their role and the importance of abiding by judicial directions. The second issue concerns the positive impact that the use of technology may have in court as a tool to aid jury comprehension. Further research is required into measures which may be taken in order to accommodate the increase in use of technology and the Internet within today's jury system. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Motivational Processes Underlying Both Prejudice and Helping
AN  - 1928179756
AB  - Examined at the behavioral level, prejudice and helping appear as qualitatively different and perhaps mutually incompatible social behaviors. As a result, the literatures on prejudice and helping evolved largely independent of each other. When they are examined at the process level, however, underlying similarities appear. Furthermore, when anomalies are examined within each of these two separate literatures, similarities become more apparent. Finally, the personality dimension of agreeableness is systematically related to both prejudice and helping. The authors propose that many forms of prejudice and helping are expressions of underlying processes of self-regulation and social accommodation. After discussing several other social-cognitive approaches to self-correction, the authors offer a novel opponent process model of motivation that integrates the apparently exclusive processes of prejudice and helping into a single system.

T1  - Speaking With a Nonnative Accent: Perceptions of Bias, Communication Difficulties, and Belonging in the United States
AN  - 743065601; 201042833
AB  - Whereas past research on nonnative accents has focused on the attitudes and perceptions of listeners, the current research explores the experiences of speakers with nonnative accents. Two studies investigated the role of nonnative accents and their strength in perceptions of stigmatization and discrimination, problems in communication, and feelings of social belonging. Study 1 demonstrated that individuals with nonnative accents experienced two different, but related facets of stigmatization: expectations of stigmatization and problems in communication. Study 2 extended this research by examining the effects of the experience of stigma and communication problems associated with nonnative accents on social belonging in the United States The results showed that speaking with a nonnative accent, but not a regional native accent, was significantly associated with feeling less belonging, and this difference was mediated by perceived problems in communicating.

T1  - But I'm No Bigot: How Prejudiced White Americans Maintain Unprejudiced Self-Images
AN  - 1866473421
AB  - Four experiments investigate a modern paradox: White Americans harbor racial prejudice, but view themselves as unprejudiced. We hypothesized that social representations of prejudice available in American culture lead many Whites to conclude that they are relatively unprejudiced. In Experiment 1, participants primed with the bigot stereotype viewed themselves as less prejudiced. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants exposed to media representations of racists viewed themselves as less prejudiced. In Experiment 4, participants sought exposure to media representations of prejudice after a threat to their unprejudiced self-image. These experiments suggest that representations of prejudice in American culture lead prejudiced individuals to view themselves as unprejudiced, and the effect of these representations on people's unprejudiced self-images can be passive or intentional.

T1  - Development of Heterosexuals into Sexual-Minority Allies: A Qualitative Exploration
AN  - 743046355; 201029479
AB  - Heterosexually identified individuals can serve a crucial role as allies in eliminating sexual prejudice and the resulting policies that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. However, few studies have systematically examined the development of heterosexual allies. Consensual qualitative research methods (Hill et al., The Counseling Psychologist, 25, 517--572, 1997) were used to analyze individual interviews conducted with a community sample of 12 heterosexually identified participants who demonstrated ally commitment through some form of LGBT activism. Findings revealed six domains that best described the development of these heterosexual allies. Participants described early role models, an evolving recognition and understanding of privilege and oppression, and conflict between an awareness of sexual prejudice and deeply held values of justice and equality. Participants also described barriers to LGBT activism and the rewards of ally work. The authors discuss implications for heterosexual ally development and, ultimately, for social justice and equality. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Salient egalitarian norms moderate activation of out-group approach and avoidance
AN  - 60351596; 201017263
AB  - Recent research suggests that interaction-appropriate behavior may be automatically triggered by exposure to an out-group cue. Two experiments investigated the role of prejudice and salient egalitarian norms in determining the activation of two fundamental behavioral responses: approach and avoidance. The activation of approach and avoidance was investigated as a function of negative attitudes towards homosexuals (Experiment 1) and African-Caribbeans (Experiment 2). Results indicated that avoidance was automatically activated in response to out-group labels among participants with prejudiced attitudes (Experiments 1 and 2) whereas approach was less activated among prejudiced participants (Experiment 2). The former effect, however, was significantly diminished when egalitarian norms have been made temporarily salient. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]
