T1  - Is classroom political discussion able to reduce anti‐immigrant attitudes in adolescents? Testing the effect of frequency, length, and topic of classroom political discussions on anti‐immigrant attitudes
AN  - 2648546627
AB  - Anti‐immigrant attitudes are associated with many social problems and reduction of negative attitudes toward immigrants is one of many actions which can assist in preventing these problems, promote better relations within society, and subsequently, create a better quality of life. School is one of the environments that provide opportunity to reduce anti‐immigrant attitudes by implementing curriculums that require teachers to encourage discussions on the issue of immigrants and immigration. Previous research has shown that political discussions have positive effect on development of anti‐immigrant attitudes. However, there has been little research on classroom political discussions. Using Czech High School Survey panel data (N = 902; 53 classrooms) that include information from adolescents and their civics teachers, this study examines the role of classroom political discussions on the development of adolescents’ anti‐immigrant attitudes. The results show that adolescents experiencing classroom political discussions more often have lower levels of anti‐immigrant attitudes than adolescents that are exposed to discussions less frequently. Furthermore, adolescents from classrooms that discussed immigration during their civics classes also report less negative anti‐immigrant attitudes. Additionally, moderation analyses reveal that more frequent political discussions reduce anti‐immigrant attitudes for those who experienced on average longer political discussions and those that discussed immigration during their civics classes. These findings support the argument for enforcing school discussions on various political topics because as results of this article suggest, classroom discussions have positive impact on how adolescents view immigrants if discussed frequently and thoroughly and may in turn reduce the negative consequences associated with anti‐immigrant attitudes.

T1  - An overstated welcome: Brexit and intentionally masked anti-immigrant sentiment in the UK
AN  - 2640197282
AB  - Research and evidence suggest that the expression of targeted intolerance increasingly manifests in subtle ways. Innovative work on colour-blind racism and unconscious bias underlines the unacknowledged ways that prejudicial attitudes are perpetuated/emerge without being overtly expressed. Building upon this work, we identify an additional dimension of intolerance defined by the intentional masking of anti-immigrant sentiment directed at immigrant groups defined by nation, race and religion. Using two survey experiments – conducted before and after the Brexit vote in the UK – we reveal that individuals mask intolerance strategically and that these strategies shift depending on the normative context. In particular, Muslim immigrants, who experienced little protection from overtly expressed intolerance before the Brexit referendum, confront a post-Brexit landscape in which intolerance is significantly overstated. The root of this emergent masking of intolerance is attributable to the Brexit campaign that simultaneously normalized AND stigmatized anti-immigrant sentiment. We conclude that our understanding of emergence and perpetuation of intolerance needs to account for the strategic and intentional disclosure of intolerance.

T1  - Shared education as a contact-based intervention to improve intergroup relations among adolescents in postconflict Northern Ireland
AN  - 2623904744
AB  - Past research has shown that intergroup contact can be a promising intervention to improve intergroup relations and that contact-based interventions might be most effective during adolescence. In postconflict Northern Ireland, widespread residential segregation and a largely separate school system limit opportunities for intergroup contact between adolescents from the Catholic and Protestant communities. We evaluated whether a large-scale intervention to facilitate intergroup contact between students attending separate schools (the 'Shared Education' program) improves a range of outcomes relevant for intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. We conducted a 5-wave longitudinal, quasi-experimental study that followed a large sample of school students (N = 5,159, Mage = 12.4, age range: 10–14 years; 2,988 girls, 2,044 boys) from 56 predominantly Catholic or Protestant schools from sixth to tenth grade. We compared the developmental trajectories of students who, in 9th (14–15 years) and 10th (15–16 years) grade, shared some classes with students from the other community, as part of the program, to students who did not. We found that participating in shared classes had a medium-size, positive effect on the amount of intergroup contact students had outside of class, and small, positive effects on students' outgroup attitudes, outgroup trust, and intergroup empathy (but not on their intergroup anxiety, future contact intentions, deprovincialization, or multicultural beliefs). Our findings show that a school-based program of shared education can provide a viable and effective intervention to facilitate intergroup contact, improve intergroup relations, and foster social integration among adolescents at a large scale in a postconflict society.

T1  - A Phenomenological Approach to Understanding Sexual Minority College Students in South Korea
AN  - 2579224858
AB  - We used a phenomenological approach to explore 12 sexual minority Korean college students’ coming out experiences. Emergent themes from in‐depth interviews included (a) expression of universal needs, (b) awareness of sociocultural violence, (c) coping strategies, and (d) cocreating an inclusive culture. These four themes characterize interactions of sociocultural factors, such as gender norms, sexual prejudice, and education with sexual identity development. Findings provide an understanding of the importance of developing effective and empowering strategies for counseling.Doce estudiantes universitarios de minorías sexuales fueron entrevistados en Corea. El análisis de los datos indicó que cuatro temas caracterizan la complejidad de las interacciones de factores socioculturales, como las normas de género, la socialización, la cultura y los prejuicios religiosos o sexuales con el desarrollo de la identidad sexual de los estudiantes universitarios. Los temas incluyeron (a) la expresión de las necesidades universales, (b) estar consciente de la violencia sociocultural, (c) las estrategias de afrontamiento y (d) la cocreación de una cultura inclusiva. Los resultados proporcionan una comprensión de la importancia de desarrollar estrategias efectivas, de empoderamiento e interconexión para la autoconexión y la sociedad coreana.

T1  - Cognitive and neural bases of decision-making causing civilian casualties during intergroup conflict
AN  - 2574932303
AB  - Civilian casualties occur during military attacks. Such ‘collateral damage’ is prohibited by international laws but increases with substantial consequences when intergroup conflict escalates. Here, we investigate cognitive and neural bases of decision-making processes resulting in civilian harm, using a task that simulates punishment decision-making during intergroup conflict. We test two groups of Chinese participants in a laboratory setting, and members of two ethnic groups (Jewish and Palestinian) in Israel. The results dissociate two psychological constructs, harm preference and harm avoidance, which respectively characterize punishment decision-making related to outgroup combatants and outgroup noncombatants during intergroup conflict. In particular, individuals show decreased avoidance of harming outgroup noncombatants when conflict escalates. Brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) reveals that decreased harm avoidance is predicted by inhibition of the left middle frontal activity during selection of punishment decisions. Our findings provide insight into the cognitive and neural bases of decision-making involving civilian harm during intergroup conflict.During intergroup conflict, decision-makers must often consider whether their actions will harm noncombatant members of the outgroup. Here, Han et al. examine cognitive and neural processes during ‘collateral damage’ scenarios, revealing decreased avoidance of harm to outgroup civilians when conflict escalates.

T1  - The Trump Effect: An Experimental Investigation of the Emboldening Effect of Racially Inflammatory Elite Communication
AN  - 2543259531
AB  - This article explores the effect of explicitly racial and inflammatory speech by political elites on mass citizens in a societal context where equality norms are widespread and generally heeded yet a subset of citizens nonetheless possesses deeply ingrained racial prejudices. The authors argue that such speech should have an ‘emboldening effect’ among the prejudiced, particularly where it is not clearly and strongly condemned by other elite political actors. To test this argument, the study focuses on the case of the Trump campaign for president in the United States, and utilizes a survey experiment embedded within an online panel study. The results demonstrate that in the absence of prejudiced elite speech, prejudiced citizens constrain the expression of their prejudice. However, in the presence of prejudiced elite speech – particularly when it is tacitly condoned by other elites – the study finds that the prejudiced are emboldened to both express and act upon their prejudices.

T1  - German desire for historical closure indirectly affects Israelis' intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2610171787
AB  - Research indicates that the memory of collective historical trauma may fuel current intergroup conflicts. In the present research, we examined in two experiments whether perpetrator desire for historical closure influences victim group attitudes in a current, seemingly unrelated, intergroup conflict. In Study 1 (N = 122), participants texted with a German confederate who either expressed responsibility, a desire for historical closure (Schlussstrich), or discussed a non‐Holocaust related topic. In Study 2 (N = 115), participants conversed with a German confederate who either acknowledged collective responsibility or expressed a desire for closure. In both studies, attitudes towards the confederate, Germany, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict were measured. Results indicated that historical closure directly increased negative evaluations of the German confederate, and indirectly influenced attitudes towards Germany, and support for peacemaking with the Palestinians via confederate evaluations. The discussion focuses on perpetrator group influences on the relationship between historical collective trauma and current intergroup relations.

T1  - The Intergenerational Reproduction of Multiethnic Residential Integration
AN  - 2529608729
AB  - The long run viability of stable multiethnic residential integration is perennially in question. This study compares the intergenerational reproduction of racially segregated residential contexts to the reproduction of multiethnic contexts to provide new insight into the social processes that influence residential integration. The data for this study come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the U.S. Census. Conditional logit models analyze patterns of residential reproduction and mobility for white and black families across a comprehensive typology of racially segregated and integrated neighborhoods. The results provide some support for the premise of a “diversity effect,” that children raised in integrated settings are more likely to attain diverse neighborhood environments in adulthood. The results also demonstrate a far stronger propensity to reproduce predominantly white and predominantly black neighborhood contexts than multiethnic contexts. The comparative ease through which racially segregated contexts are reproduced presents a challenge to the future growth and stability of multiethnic residential integration. The implications for theories of spatial incorporation that frame debates about race and ethnic relations are discussed.

T1  - How Often Have You Felt Disadvantaged? Explaining Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 2534814128
AB  - Based on longitudinal data from Germany, we analyze how perceptions of discrimination change once migrants’ integration evolves. Individuals who identify more strongly with the host country, speak the language, have native friends, and are adequately employed report less discrimination overall. However, group-specific analyses reveal that German-born Turks feel more rather than less discriminated against after their language skills and their identification increase. For this group, we find evidence for the “integration paradox”, i.e., the finding that better educated migrants have more rather than less negative attitudes about the host society. Results suggest that attributional processes rather than rising exposure to discrimination might be the main mechanism linking integration to higher levels of perceived discrimination. Obviously, discrimination does not disappear for groups facing salient ethnic boundaries and is met with growing awareness and sensitivity among individuals that have become more similar to the majority of members. This, in turn, by no means implies that perceived discrimination is detached from reality.

T1  - <i>Beyond</i> direct contact: The theoretical and societal relevance of indirect contact for improving intergroup relations
AN  - 2509237062
AB  - Today, physical and psychological barriers can reduce opportunities for the type of direct face‐to‐face intergroup contact first identified by Gordon Allport. Consequently, social psychological researchers have identified, developed and tested a burgeoning array of different forms of indirect contact, including, extended contact, Electronic‐ or E‐contact, imagined contact, vicarious contact and parasocial contact. In addition to providing a critical review of each of these forms, we argue that indirect contact is more than just a simple “replacement” for direct contact, but instead has the potential to improve intergroup relations for both minority and majority members in its own right. Relatedly, we acknowledge that indirect contact occurs within specific normative contexts embodied in legislation, institutions, and media and political contents. In fact, we recognize that indirect contact requires an integrative understanding of the role of intergroup norms and affective processes in order to effectively achieve public policy objectives to optimize effects on prejudice reduction.

T1  - I (dis)like the way you (dis)like them: The role of extended contact on social distance and attitudes towards the ingroup
AN  - 2474519535
AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants’ positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis.

T1  - Narratives of cooperative ecological science: The case of Israel and Jordan
AN  - 2453785702
AB  - As ecosystems do not follow human-made borders, cross-border environmental cooperation can be highly effective, perhaps even necessary, for both scientific insight and conservation efforts. Several environmental cooperation initiatives between Israel and Jordan emerged since the peace treaty of 1994. These initiatives had the explicit double goal of peacebuilding and enhancing regional environmental protection. However, as political relations between Israel and Jordan have been unstable and often tense during this period, cooperation toward these goals has often proved challenging. The current study investigates one such attempt at regional scientific environmental cooperation, specifically, cooperation between Jordanian and Israeli long-term socioecological research centers. Eleven in-depth interviews with Israeli and Jordanian scientists, who constitute all the participating scientists in this initiative, were conducted in order to identify the benefits and challenges of their cross-border collaboration. A thematic analysis of the interview contents was then performed to compare the results with models and theories pertaining to intergroup relations from the field of social psychology, theories that are particularly relevant to this case study because they see collaboration toward a common goal as especially productive for decreasing intergroup prejudice and hostility. Specifically, Allport's (1954) "contact theory", and its derivatives in this context, were discussed, which asserts that personal contact between members of different groups leads to less intergroup prejudice and decreases intergroup hostility. Other social psychologists have developed Allport's work and argue that de-categorization (seeing people as individuals rather than groups) and recategorization (perceiving people from both groups as belonging to the same metagroup) are 2 additional important processes that are necessary to reduce intergroup tensions and that find support in the current investigation. The study concludes by proposing a model that describes group-identity factors, as well as other factors, contributing to the success and failure of cross-border scientific environmental initiatives in areas of regional conflict.

T1  - The impact of feminist stereotypes and sexual identity on feminist self-identification and collective action
AN  - 2391194156
AB  - The present study sought to examine the role of sexual identity and exposure to stereotypes of feminism on women’s self-identification as a feminist, endorsement of feminist attitudes, and intention to engage in collective action. Participants (N = 312; all women) disclosed their sexual identity as either heterosexual or non-heterosexual (sexual minority) and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: exposure to positive stereotypes of feminists, to negative stereotypes of feminists, control condition (no exposure to stereotypes). Results showed stark differences between heterosexual and sexual minority women, with sexual minority women scoring significantly higher on self-identification as feminist, feminist attitudes, and collective action intentions. Exposure to positive stereotypes of feminists increased feminist self-identification regardless of sexual identity. Exposure to negative stereotypes reduced self-identification with feminism, and lower identification mediated the path between negative stereotyping and collective action. Implications of these findings for the advancement of women’s rights movements are discussed.

T1  - Positive intergroup contact decreases the likelihood that prejudicial attitudes become avoidant behavioral tendencies
AN  - 2384449672
AB  - We investigated whether existing intergroup contact experiences moderated the associations between prejudicial attitudes and behavioral tendencies towards outgroups across five studies in Turkey (total N = 1,281). Findings showed that among Turks who reported higher levels of cross‐group friendship quantity (Study 1) and greater positive (but not negative) contact (Study 2) with Kurds, prejudicial attitudes did not predict negative outgroup behavioral tendencies. Confirming these studies, Study 3 indicated that the association between homophobic attitudes and outgroup avoidance/approach tendencies was weaker among individuals who reported more LGBTI friends. Study 4 replicated the latter finding among children using Syrians as the target outgroup. Study 5 further showed that the buffering role of intergroup contact occurred only among participants who held less certain attitudes towards Syrian refugees. Findings provide insights into how existing contact experiences shape the relationship between negative attitudes towards outgroups and relevant behavioral intentions.

T1  - Children's understanding of ethnic group symbols: Piloting an instrument in the Republic of North Macedonia
AN  - 2387487588
AB  - Assessing children's awareness of ethnic identity and group boundaries is important in conflict-affected societies. For example, in the Republic of North Macedonia (RNM), tense interethnic relations remain and can be seen in the largely separate living patterns, particularly in schools. This brief report analyses data from 194 children (57.7% female, 42.3% male; 45.9% Macedonian, 54.1% Albanian) in primary school. A series of one-sample t tests, with Bonferroni correction, demonstrate the viability of a new quantitative tool for measuring children's awareness of symbols relevant to interethnic relations in RNM. The findings indicate that primary school-age children can sort both ingroup and outgroup symbols with the hypothesized ethnic group. Moreover, ethnic awareness is present among the earliest school grades and increases with age. This approach may be used in future research and adapted in other conflict-affected settings to better understand the foundations of children's interethnic attitudes and behaviors.

T1  - Do Latinos still support immigrant rights activism? Examining Latino attitudes a decade after the 2006 protest wave
AN  - 2377706263
AB  - The historic and primarily Latino 2006 immigrant rights protest wave occurred in response to proposed federal anti-immigrant legislation (H.R. 4437). Research on the unprecedented series of demonstrations suggests that the draconian and racialized nature of the bill helps explain why it incited large-scale collective action. Utilising a new survey with a considerable oversample of Latino respondents, the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), this paper investigates the role that collective identities, racialisation, and social networks play in Latino support for contemporary immigrant rights activism. To do so, we incorporate measures such as linked fate, perceptions of anti-immigrant sentiments, knowing undocumented people, and concerns about immigration enforcement policies. The results of our analysis indicate that some of the same factors that influenced Latino engagement in the 2006 mobilisations, such as identity and racialisation, concerns over enforcement, and social networks, continue to impact Latino support for contentious politics on behalf of the foreign-born. We also find evidence that political party and past protest activity, play a significant role in explaining levels of support for activism. Our results have important implications for understanding how anti-immigrant policies and racialized nativism influence Latino support for contentious politics.

T1  - Parental competitive victimhood and interethnic discrimination among their children: The mediating role of ethnic socialization and symbolic threat to the in‐group
AN  - 2331728867
AB  - Links between competitive victimhood and discrimination are well documented. However, the mechanisms how victimhood beliefs remain relevant for decades and how conflict survivors can shape attitudes and behaviours of the post‐conflict generations are little understood. Following the Transgenerational Transmission Hypothesis and the Integrated Threat Theory, we propose that the link between parental competitive victimhood and discrimination among their children is mediated through family ethnic socialization and symbolic threat to the in‐group. Participants were families that included youth (N = 227) and their parents (172 mothers, 150 fathers) in Vukovar, Croatia. A multiple group, chain mediation model was conducted with parental competitive victimhood as the predictor; youth ethnic socialization and symbolic threat as sequential mediators; and youth tendency to discriminate against the outgroup and perceived ethnic in‐group discrimination as outcomes. The findings revealed significant indirect effects of the competitive victimhood on both outcomes, via the proposed mediators. The only difference in the model between majority Croats and minority Serbs was the path from symbolic threat to tendency to discriminate, which was positive and significant for both groups, but stronger among Croats. The findings imply that interventions in post‐conflict settings need to address family ethnic socialization processes in addition to directly working with youth.

T1  - Mistaken Identities: The Media and Parental Ethno-Religious Socialization in a Midwestern Sikh Community
AN  - 2328400508
AB  - The role of the media in constructing the stereotypical portrayal of Muslims and the effects of that image on Muslim communities in the United States have been well reported (Abbas 2004).

[...]the portrayal of Muslims in popular media has intensified stereotypical images of several other ethno-religious groups in the United States, among them Sikhs (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kromidas 2004; Kumar 2016).

Since boys and men are more vulnerable to bullying and discrimination due to their outward identity markers, the focus of this study was ethno-religious socialization of boys. 1.1.

According to the American Sikh Organization, this number could, in fact, be as large as 500,000 (Pew Forum 2012).

[...]of the ensuing problem of misidentification, Sikh communities have found support in collective practices that serve as antidotes to negative stereotypes (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kurien 2014).

T1  - Ethnic inequality, cultural distance, and social integration: evidence from a native-settler conflict in the Philippines
AN  - 2232409845
AB  - A key debate in studies of native-migrant relations relates to the barriers to integration created by ethno-cultural differences and socio-economic disadvantage. How do changes in socio-economic inequality between ethnic groups affect interethnic ties in a divided society? I investigate this question by analysing the effect of ethnic inequality on the evolution of cross-ethnic marriages in a society fractured by conflict between natives and settlers. I find the effect is contingent on the ethnic group. Certain groups intermarry more in response to reductions in socio-economic disadvantage; others, however, remain indifferent. I suggest the difference relates to cultural distance. Specifically, I point to differences between groups in the power of the norms and sanctions regulating members' social interactions outside of the group. These 'closure' norms interpose an ethno-cultural distance. I establish these findings with field interviews and census data on over six million marriages in Mindanao, an ethnically diverse region in the southern Philippines and location of an insurgency waged by rebels, drawn from the native Muslim Moro population, resentful of the influx of Christian settlers. I find Moro intermarriage unresponsive to socio-economic equalisation and suggest the strength of their ethno-cultural norms, derived from their ethno-religious identification, accounts for their distinctive response.

T1  - Ethnic Origins and Religious Transformations in the Afro-Colombian Muslim Community of Buenaventura
AN  - 2249649515
AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse the origins and transformations of a Muslim community in western Colombia. The history of this small religious group of Afro-Colombians is presented over a period divided into four phases. This division is based on four dominant interpretations of Islamic doctrines adopted by the majority of the group over a period of time. These changes were not only due to religious motivations but also due to changes in the social milieu and the need for taking advantage of emerging opportunities. The religious conversion of Afro-Colombians to Islam took place within the complex socio-political context of the Colombian conflict which began in mid-1960s and is still ongoing. The adoption of this new religious perspective did not evolve in an isolated manner, rather, it transformed the identity of the community by strengthening the value of ethnic differences in a place of segregation. In this context, this paper analyses the role of religion as an important element in the construction of ethnic identity. It is also important to recognize that this cultural negotiation happens at the margins of the dominant society, which views Afro-Colombian minorities negatively or simply ignores their presence.

T1  - Religion, Political Power, and the ‘Sectarian Surge’: Middle Eastern Identity Politics in Comparative Perspective
AN  - 2207839116
AB  - Are countries in the Middle East characterized by comparatively distinctive, domestic‐level attributes that justify the recent years’ intensification of identity conflict in the region? The article presents descriptive statistics showing, first, that the Middle East is the only region in the world where religious (including sectarian) affiliation is the predominant identity marker determining group membership and, second, that people in the Middle East, on average, are twice as likely as people in other developing regions to belong to identity groups excluded from legitimate political representation. The article discusses these empirical trends based on the literature on ethnicity (defined broadly to include language, ‘race’, religion, and other cultural attributes) and ethnic conflict. The discussion suggests that the comparatively high level of identity‐based political inequality in the region provides a better explanation for the intensity of the conflict than does the predominance of religious identity divides.

T1  - Ethnic identity and race: the "double absence" and its legacy across generations among Australians of Southern Italian origin. Operationalizing institutional positionality.
AN  - 2183932687
AB  - The paper provides a discussion on the concept of "double absence" and its legacy among participants originating from Calabria, Italy. It illustrates the impact of such an embodied affective state in light of race-ethnic relations perceived intergenerationally. While the first generation of participants manifest a condition of feeling "absent", the second generation present a condition of "liminality", as a result of a socialization process between "the world" of their immigrant parents and the Australian one. The third generation, due to a perceived positive evaluation about their ethnic background, manifests its ethnicity proudly. A pivotal role is played by the amount of cultural capital accumulated by the participants, dynamics of assimilation and the exogenous pressures the participants perceived from the "common sense" of the dominant society, as Gramsci terms it. Individuals' ethnic identity appears to be shaped by their institutional positionality, which is their ethnic perception of "being in the world".

T1  - Is racism the new sectarianism? Negativity towards immigrants and ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland from 2004 to 2015
AN  - 2103357901
AB  - Negativity towards ethnic minorities is a serious problem in Northern Ireland. Its history of the Troubles around religious identities makes Northern Ireland a special case in Europe. This paper examines negativity towards Muslims, Eastern Europeans and immigrants in Northern Ireland using data from the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey and the British Social Attitudes Survey. The results from regressions show that anti-immigrant negativity is no more prevalent in Northern Ireland than elsewhere in the UK. However, levels of negativity towards Muslims and Eastern Europeans are significantly higher than in Great Britain and have increased in recent years, particularly among young adults aged 18-24 years, although older cohorts are more intolerant on average. Our regression analyses found strong positive relationships between anti-immigrant negativity, sectarianism and perceived neighbourhood segregation. Higher education, contacts with minority members and (religiously) mixed schooling are negatively related to negativity towards immigrants.

T1  - Public health as an agent of internal colonialism in interwar Czechoslovakia: shaping the discourse about the nation's children
AN  - 2081349434
AB  - Shmidt's text discusses the specifics of internal colonialism in the discourses and practices of the dominant group (Czechs) concerning Slovaks and Rusyns, ethnic groups from the peripheral, eastern areas of interwar Czechoslovakia. By targeting the reproductive patterns of these groups, seen as undesirable by the authorities, internal colonialism shaped the discourse about children by consistently opposing the normalized childhood inside the nation to the supposedly abnormal child development outside the civilizing process. Shmidt focuses on three interwar projects aimed at introducing new public health practices as an 'infrastructure of dependence' with regard to the peripheral groups. Being directly supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, these projects contributed to building the new Czechoslovak nation and securing its international legitimacy.

T1  - Exploring Factors Influencing Childhood Obesity Prevention Among Migrant Communities in Victoria, Australia: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 2065271986
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous obesity prevention initiatives in developed countries including Australia, rising childhood obesity levels have been found among migrant communities which contribute to widening obesity-related disparities in these countries. We sought to understand the factors influencing the participation of migrant communities in childhood obesity prevention initiatives. We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews among 48 migrant parents from African, Middle Eastern, Indian and Vietnamese origins living in disadvantaged areas of Victoria, Australia to explore their views on childhood obesity and its prevention. Thematic analysis showed low obesity literacy among migrant communities, cultural influences negatively impacting their healthy lifestyle behaviours and cultural, family-level and community-level barriers impacting their participation in childhood obesity prevention initiatives. There is an urgent need to improve obesity literacy among migrant communities using bicultural workers in order to improve their responsiveness to childhood obesity prevention initiatives. Health interventionists are urged to incorporate culturally-mediated influences in the design of obesity prevention programs to achieve energy balance and maintain healthy weight among migrants. Such culturally appropriate approaches have the potential of reducing the widening ethnic-related obesity disparities in Australia.

T1  - Secondary transfer effect among children: The role of social dominance orientation and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2064683830
AB  - Research has provided evidence that the effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction are not limited to the outgroup one has contact with (primary outgroup). Rather, they extend to secondary outgroups uninvolved in the contact situation (secondary transfer effect; Pettigrew, 2009, Social Psychology, 40, 55). We aimed to provide the first empirical evidence for the emergence of the secondary transfer effect among children. Majority (Italian) and minority (with an immigrant background) elementary schoolchildren were administered a questionnaire including measures of contact with the primary outgroup (minority children for the majority, majority children for the minority), prejudice towards the primary outgroup and towards a dissimilar secondary outgroup (disabled children), and social dominance orientation. Results revealed that among the majority group, contact with the primary outgroup had indirect associations with reduced prejudice towards the secondary outgroup. Specifically, we found evidence for sequential mediation by social dominance orientation and prejudice towards the primary outgroup. No secondary transfer effects emerged among minority group members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings, arguing for the importance of identifying the core processes driving the secondary transfer effect.

T1  - Representations of Interpersonal Interaction and Race/Ethnicity: An Examination of Prime-Time Network Television Programs
AN  - 2034231261
AB  - Racial and ethnic relations in America are a form of social interaction about which changing perceptions could have important consequences. Current research examining the nature of discrete social interaction situations in entertainment content on television is lacking. This study was conducted with the objective of obtaining an updated account of the state of interpersonal interaction portrayals between characters of different racial/ethnic backgrounds in popular prime time programs on broadcast television. Specifically, we analyzed prime-time television program content on 4 major U.S. broadcast networks. Findings are interpreted via a media priming framework.

T1  - Conditional Families and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Youth Homelessness: Gender, Sexuality, Family Instability, and Rejection
AN  - 2018570578
AB  - Existing research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth homelessness identifies family rejection as a main pathway into homelessness for the youth. This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the conditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality. This rejection generated strained familial ties within families wherein the ties were already fragile. Likewise, the author shows how being gender expansive marked many youth's experiences of familial abuse and strain. This study proposes the concept of conditional families to capture the social processes of how poverty and family instability shape experiences of gender, sexuality, and rejection for some LGBTQ youth.

T1  - Reducing the gap between leaders and voters? Elite polarization, outbidding competition, and the rise of secessionism in Catalonia
AN  - 1934044633
AB  - The ethnic outbidding thesis explains party polarization as a consequence of political changes amongst voters. We argued instead that party elites' extreme position on the national identity cleavage can help polarizing strategies to prevail over moderate strategies in a context of increasing political uncertainty, without previous voters' polarization. We test successfully this hypothesis in Catalonia by analysing the polarization of political parties and people's demands for self-government in Catalonia since the early 2000s. We also find that the result of this outbidding pattern of competition was a reduction in the gap between elites' and voters' views on national identity. The analysis employs a set of unique data on party elites and activists' national identity, from several surveys conducted on the delegates at party conferences of the main Catalan parties between 1996 and 2012. Our data provide empirical support for the argument that ethnic polarization is mainly an elite-driven process.

T1  - Boundary shifts and vote alignment in Catalonia
AN  - 1900462106
AB  - This paper analyses the dynamics between ethnic boundaries and electoral alignment in the context of western minority nationalisms by focusing on the Catalan case. In particular, the research explores the changes in boundary shifts at the electoral level, whether they affect differently pro-sovereignty and pro-union parties, and to what extent changes have reinforced the ethnic alignment of vote. Methodologically, the analysis is based on observational data from the elections of 2010 and 2012, which allows control over some of the traditional limits of opinion studies. The results suggest that ethnicity is a dynamic factor that has gained relevance for both sub-state and state-wide parties, and that processes of boundary contraction are not necessarily associated with electoral failure.

T1  - “I’m not gonna be another statistic”: The imagined futures of former foster youth
AN  - 1874568921
AB  - This article reports results from a qualitative study of former foster youth attending a 4-year university, focusing on the process by which these students construct and communicate imagined futures. Drawing on 30 in-depth interviews and sixteen months of participant observation at an on-campus support program, this study empirically illustrates how aspirations can be constructed through a complex process that involves individual biography, cultural notions of morality, and imagination. I argue that analysis of former foster youths’ imagined futures reveals how ambitious educational and professional aspirations serve as moral assertions of identity that separate this group from the negative stereotypes they feel have been projected onto them. Finally, I show how support programs for marginalized populations are critical not just for the resources they provide, but also for their role in expanding worldviews.

T1  - The Impact of Adolescents' Classroom and Neighborhood Ethnic Diversity on Same- and Cross-Ethnic Friendships Within Classrooms
AN  - 1871510067
AB  - This study examines how classroom and neighborhood ethnic diversity affect adolescents' tendency to form same- versus cross-ethnic friendships when they enter middle school. Hypotheses are derived from exposure, conflict, and constrict theory. Hypotheses are tested among 911 middle school students (43 classrooms, nine schools) in the Netherlands. Multilevel (p2) social network analyses show that students were more likely to engage in same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friendships. In line with conflict theory, greater classroom and neighborhood diversity were related to stronger tendencies to choose same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friends, among both ethnic majority and minority students. Diversity did not hamper reciprocity, as students in more ethnically diverse classrooms were even more likely to reciprocate friendships.

T1  - Identifying With a Stereotype: The Divergent Effects of Exposure to Homosexual Television Characters
AN  - 1904238337
AB  - Scholars examining homosexual television characters have typically come to one of two conclusions: either exposure to homosexual characters can lead to increased acceptance, or homosexual characters serve to reaffirm negative stereotypes. We seek to bridge these two bodies of research by introducing the concept of stereotyped identification-the idea that cognitively and emotionally identifying with fictional characters can increase acceptance of minorities, while reinforcing implicit stereotypes about how they look, act, and talk. Results from our national survey (N = 972) offer support for this hypothesis.

T1  - Francophone Intergroup Attitudes and Readiness for Interprovincial Migration in Canada
AN  - 1897660702
AB  - Though existing research helps account for readiness of migrants to move internationally, few social psychological studies have focused on readiness of native born citizens to move internally across regions of their own country. Francophones residing in Canada's bilingual belt comprised of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario rated their readiness to move internally to a French and English province compared to their readiness to migrate to the United States. Questionnaires were completed in French by three groups of undergraduates: Francophone Quebecers (n = 204), Acadians in New Brunswick (n = 227), and Franco-Ontarians (n = 227). Though readiness to emigrate to a French or English province was low across all groups, Franco-Ontarians were more willing to migrate out of Province and to the US than both Acadians and Francophone Quebecers. Predictors of readiness to migrate to Acadia (New Brunswick) or Quebec were: seeking better career prospects, perceptions that Francophones contribute to linguistic vitality, avoidance of linguistic tensions, and endorsement of integration-transformation toward Francophone migrants. Predictors of readiness to move to an English majority Province were: seeking better career prospects, English language use, and acceptance of Anglo-Canadians as migrants to own province. Predictors of readiness for emigration to the United States were very similar to those for internal migration to an English majority Province, confirming that factors accounting for internal and international migration share much in common. Results are discussed using ethnolinguistic vitality and the Interactive Acculturation Model with implications for harmony and social cohesion between Francophone and Anglophone communities within Canada's "Bilingual Belt". Alternate abstract:Cette recherche porte sur les intentions de migration interprovinciale d'étudiants universitaires francophones originaires du Nouveau-Brunswick (Acadiens : N = 227), du Québec (N = 204) et de l'Ontario (N = 227). Ces répondants francophones ont rempli des questionnaires en français comprenant une série d'échelles, de type Likert, qui ont servi à mesurer leur désir de migration interne vers une province francophone ou anglophone comparé au désir d'émigration vers les États-Unis. Les résultats démontrent que bien que la volonté d'émigrer vers une autre province canadienne ou aux États-Unis était faible chez les Acadiens et les Québécois, elle était plus soutenue chez les Franco-Ontariens dont l'identité bilingue était plus forte que celle des Acadiens et Québécois. Les prédicteurs du désir de migrer vers le Québec et l'Acadie au Nouveau-Brunswick étaient surtout pour s'assurer d'une meilleure carrière professionnelle, pour délaisser les tensions linguistiques dans la province d'origine et l'endossement de l'orientation d'acculturation intégrationniste-transformatlon à l'égard des migrants francophones. Les prédicteurs du désir de migrer vers les provinces anglophones et les États-Unis étaient semblables : pour s'assurer d'une meilleure carrière professionnelle, l'usage soutenu de l'anglais dans la vie quotidienne, et l'acceptation des migrants anglophones dans la province d'origine des répondants. La vitalité ethnolinguistique et le modèle d'acculturation interactif contribuent à l'explication de ces résultats ayant des implications pour l'harmonie et la cohésion sociale des communautés francophones et anglophones de la « zone bilingue du Canada ».

T1  - Emotions of the weak: violence and ethnic boundaries among Coptic Christians in Egypt
AN  - 1843959357
AB  - This article offers a theoretical framework to understand Muslim-Christian relations in contemporary Egypt. I argue that the interdependence of power relations, emotions, and symbolic boundaries are the key to understanding minority emotions as a political product and a boundary marker. Particular emotions of Christian minorities invoked during interactions and non-interactions with Muslim neighbours reveal the distance between the two groups, while cultivating cohesion among Christians. Data collected from participant observation in public spaces of a religiously tolerant neighbourhood in Cairo and in-depth interviews with 27 Coptic Christians show that indirect violence and daily microaggressions, triggered by the power disparity, unfold internalized fear and 'righteous indignation', negative feelings including anger and irritation against unjust treatment. Findings also discuss Coptic strategies to dismiss negative emotions. The interdependent framework, which has been largely understudied, expands our scope of understanding how power relates to minority emotions and symbolic boundaries between ethnic and religious groups.

T1  - Kirkuk conflict in its ethnic/political media: the Turkmen newspaper Alqal'a as a model
AN  - 1798374801
AB  - This article explores the Kirkuk conflict through the Turkmens' newspaper Alqal'a. Using agenda-setting and framing/priming for theoretical background and qualitative content analysis as a method, two macro-themes, related to the conflict, are found to be fundamental therein. These two main themes are: (1) exclusion and (2) self-confirmation. The two macro-themes overarch several micro- or sub-themes and are closely related to each other. They are set to inform the readers about what to think and how to think about the conflict. While 'exclusion' constitutes the cause, 'self-confirmation' is the latter's effect.

T1  - 'No more Turkish music!' The acculturation strategies of teachers and ethnic minority students in Flemish schools
AN  - 1792708778
AB  - While considerable research has focused on the process and factors affecting acculturation, there is little research that investigates how members of minority and majority groups define acculturation in educational settings. Ethnographic research and qualitative interviews in three secondary schools in Flanders (Belgium) show that teachers and ethnic minority students have different ideas and expectancies regarding the concept 'integration', which appears to affect student-teacher relationship. Berry et al.'s [1989. "Acculturation Attitudes in Plural Societies." Applied Psychology: An International Review 3 (2): 185-206. doi:10.1111/j.1464-0597.1989.tb01208.x.] acculturation orientations are used as a theoretical template to analyse teachers' and ethnic minority students' discourses about acculturation. Analyses reveal that students of immigrant descent perceive acculturation mainly in terms of the establishment of intergroup contact. In contrast, teachers find it harder to disconnect cultural maintenance from contact and participation. By suggesting some form of cultural adoption, teachers hope to socialise their ethnic minority students into the culture of the dominant ethnic group and prepare them for their future. These distinct interpretations of 'integration' in everyday life (which actually refers to acculturation) often leads to misunderstandings between ethnic minority students and their teachers, even to conflict, as many students feel that their cultural background is disparaged and not fully valued in school.

AN  - 2539303784
AB  - Im Seen but Seldom Heard-Projekt, in der performativen Sozialwissenschaft (PSS) angesiedelt, wurde performative Dichtung genutzt zum Nachvollzug der Erfahrungen junger Menschen mit körperlichen Beeinträchtigungen. Zwei Dichter, eine Gruppe Jugendlicher und Wissenschaftler/innen aus den Sozial- sowie Medien- und Kommunikationswissenschaften suchten in der gemeinsamen Arbeit nach einem besseren Verstehen von Identität, Stereotypen, Stigma und Repräsentation. In diesem Beitrag geben wir einen Überblick über die Projektarbeit und zeigen, wie PSS angewendet werden kann, um sonst schwer zugängliche Stimmen hörbar zu machen. Wir veranschaulichen dies an zwei Gedichten, die Einblick in das Leben mit körperlichen Beeinträchtigungen gewähren und die den Jugendlichen halfen, das eigene Verständnis von Behinderung und Diskriminierung zu reflektieren.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602118Alternate abstract:The Seen but Seldom Heard project was a performative social science (PSS) project which used performance poetry to illuminate the experiences of young people with physical impairments.

In this article, we will present an overview of the project and consider how PSS offers a method to engage seldom heard voices, and illustrate this through two poems which shed light on the lived experience of disability. The article will consider the impact of these poems as PSS, and how this method allows the audience to develop a deeper understanding of the "lived" experience of disability and to reflect upon their own understandings of disability and discrimination.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602118Alternate abstract:El proyecto "Visto pero rara vez oído" [Seen but Seldom Heard] fue un proyecto de ciencia social performativa (CSP) que utilizó la poesía performativa para clarificar las experiencias de jóvenes con impedimentos físicos.

T1  - Ethnic belonging of the children born out of rape in postconflict Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda
AN  - 1787949562
AB  - Sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war in ethnic conflicts, and forced impregnations have been central to this strategy. Scholars however disagree on whether the cultural assimilation to the maternal group influences these children's identities, or whether they are perceived as belonging to the enemy group (Carpenter; Nikolic-Ristanovic). Drawing on preliminary qualitative findings collected in 2013 in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina, this paper analyses the ethnic identification imposed by the enemy group, the mothers and their community on the children born out of rape. It first explores how the mothers' ethnic identities are often subordinated to their fathers' ethnic background, and how this then justifies their social exclusion from their maternal ethnic group. This paper suggests that sexual violence is extremely effective in ensuring the continuation of the ethnic conflict in the aftermath of the violence by attacking the children's senses of belonging.

T1  - News as a Cultural Mirror: Historically Black Newspapers Reflecting Public Views of Loving v. Virginia (1967)
AN  - 1748050440
AB  - This study examined seven historically Black newspapers' coverage of the landmark Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia (1967), which overturned anti-miscegenation laws that prevented non-White individuals from marrying White individuals. A content analysis of frames and source usage within 31 news stories about the case indicated that about half of the stories (N = 14) advocated for the Lovings and a small number (N = 1) advocated for the State of Virginia; the remaining stories were either informational (N = 7) or objectivist (N = 9). Because the media is said to be a cultural mirror of public opinion, the results of this study may indicate the public's views on the issue of intermarriage laws. This study's findings also showed that historically Black newspapers agreed with their mainstream counterparts more than they disagreed.

T1  - Graduation at age 50 +: Contested efforts to construct "third age" identities and negotiate cultural age stereotypes
AN  - 1735732793
AB  - The cultural and social contexts of aging have changed a great deal during the last two decades and aging experiences have become more differentiated. However, pervasive age stereotypes still exist that limit the agency and self-perception of older people, and part of the experience of new aging is to actively combat such negative stereotypes. The purpose of this study is to explore how lifelong learning and a degree attainment in midlife become embedded into new aging practices. The study will focus on a specific group of aging workers who attained a Master's degree from Finnish universities in their fifties. In order to better understand the aging experiences of these older graduates, this study seeks to address how they construct the meaning of aging in relation to their own educational and professional status. The data consist of 14 life-history interviews, which were analyzed as narrative identity performances. Differentiating oneself from the stereotype of physical and mental decline and positioning oneself in a favorable way in inter-generational relations were common ways of approaching aging. Age-negotiation and ambivalence about aging were expressed by structuring narratives around clear oppositions and contradictions. University studies at age 50 + became a talking point in countering cultural age-stereotypes, because it showed that aging workers could still accomplish significant goals and "renew" oneself intellectually. University studies also enabled collaboration with the younger generation and the breaking of narrow age boundaries.

T1  - Can Moro and Filipino coexist?
AN  - 1784139424
AB  - On 25 January 2015, the Special Action Force (SAF) of the Philippine National Police was surrounded and attacked by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), resulting in the casualty of 49 policemen. According to a report, the Philippine SAF received information that the Muslim terrorist Zulkifli Abdhir, alias Marwan, was hiding in a remote village in the Maguindanao province. The Philippine SAF without informing the central authorities and without adequate preparations hurriedly took action. In the serious gun battle that ensued, Zulkifli was killed. Zulkifli was an Islamic terrorist from Malaysia who had planned many large-scale terrorist attacks in the region, including the 2002 bombings in Bali. He was also included in the US top 'terrorists' list.

T1  - History as a Resource: Effects of Narrative Constructions of Group History on Intellectual Performance
AN  - 1735658461; 201536776
AB  - Two studies examined the effects of exposure to historical narratives about group resilience on the intellectual performance of two groups negatively stereotyped for their abilities in academic domains: African Americans in verbal ability, and women in mathematics. In both studies, participants who were exposed to a narrative about their group's historical resilience in the domain of the stereotype performed better on an intellectual test as their group identification increased. In the control condition, performance was negatively related to group identification. These findings suggest that history of marginalized groups can act as a resource for current challenges depending on how it is narrated, and that history curriculum can be designed to enhance these effects in order to improve the educational performance of disadvantaged group members. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Power in History: Contrasting Theoretical Approaches to Intergroup Dialogue
AN  - 1735658394; 201536789
AB  - Groups in conflict routinely use historical narrative to compete for status in intergroup encounters. This study examines power dynamics in conversations about history facilitated according to distinct social psychological theories. Israeli and Palestinian youth participating in an existing intergroup contact program were randomly assigned to either a (1) coexistence condition consistent with a prejudice reduction model in which the goal was to foster the construction of a common in-group identity, or (2) a confrontational condition consistent with a collective action model in which the goal was to raise awareness about identities and empower the low-status group. Dialogue facilitated in the coexistence condition reproduced power asymmetries, with a pattern of Jewish Israeli dominance. Dialogue facilitated in the confrontational condition suggested a pattern of Palestinian dominance, consistent with a collective action model. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical approaches to intergroup contact and dialogue about history among groups in intractable conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious Claims during the War and Post-War Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 1796341144
AB  - During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1991-1995), politicized and ethicized religion became a powerful tool for mobilization against ethnic enemies'. Yet many scholars who have worked on the armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina do not consider it a religious conflict. However, the collapse of religious and ethnic identities and the involvement of religious institutions and their leaders throughout the war turned various sites -- including religious ones -- into targets of actual and symbolic violence. In the post-conflict period, faith-based identities were nationalized in such a way that simply reduced them to ethnicities, thus (post-) conflict social reconstruction continues to depend on (non-) intervention of key actors, including clergy and religious leaders. Bosnia and Herzegovina is faced with a diverse set of issues, but the underlying paradox is that the institutional framework established through the Dayton Peace Accords favors the political options that are the least supportive of its implementation. The design of its political institutions does not encourage cross-ethnic cooperation; rather, it institutionalizes ethnic discrimination. In the face of failures, limits, and retrenchments of Bosnian political institutions (state), some sort of organised actors should fill the gap. In this paper, I examine these persisting tensions by focusing on the role of organized religion during the war and aftermath of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina

T1  - Legitimating Contexts, Immigrant Power, and Exclusionary Actions
AN  - 1777916726
AB  - In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused on anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. Extending political opportunity theory, they also claim that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. They test these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at immigrants in over 50 US metropolitan areas. In support of the legitimating contexts model, they find that low levels of demographic and political threat -- when immigrants enjoy less power -- alone and coupled with a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.

T1  - Ethnic Boundaries in Core Discussion Networks: A Multilevel Social Network Study of Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands
AN  - 1680154361; 201514090
AB  - This study examines ethnic segregation of core discussion networks in the Netherlands. The analysis is based on Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, a large-scale survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 that contains an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco, the two largest non-western immigrant groups in Holland. Results show that among Turks and Moroccans, more than 75% of the confidants are co-ethnic multilevel logistic models of these ego networks which suggest that ethnic closure in core discussion networks of Turks and Moroccans is stronger among women, foreign-born immigrants, those who live in immigrant concentration areas and those who are culturally more dissimilar to the Dutch to (i.e., who speak Dutch less well, who more strongly participate in Muslim practices and who identify stronger with their ethnic group). Results further suggest that the socio-economic gradient in ethnic boundaries is due to both cultural and economic homophily. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Stereotypes as Stumbling-Blocks: How Coping With Stereotype Threat Affects Life Outcomes for People With Physical Disabilities
AN  - 1708527322; 201528681
AB  - Stereotype threat, the concern about being judged in light of negative stereotypes, causes underperformance in evaluative situations. However, less is known about how coping with stereotypes can aggravate underperformance over time. We propose a model in which ongoing stereotype threat experiences threaten a person's sense of self-integrity, which in turn prompts defensive avoidance of stereotype-relevant situations, impeding growth, achievement, and well-being. We test this model in an important but understudied population: the physically disabled. In Study 1, blind adults reporting higher levels of stereotype threat reported lower self-integrity and well-being and were more likely to be unemployed and to report avoiding stereotype-threatening situations. In Study 2's field experiment, blind students in a compensatory skill-training program made more progress if they had completed a values-affirmation, an exercise that bolsters self-integrity. The findings suggest that stereotype threat poses a chronic threat to self-integrity and undermines life outcomes for people with disabilities.

T1  - Ethnic Identification and Its Consequences for Measuring Inequality in Mexico
AN  - 1650145323; 201502299
AB  - This article examines ethnic boundary crossing and its effects on estimates of ethnic disparities in children's outcomes in the context of Mexico, a country with the largest indigenous population in the Western hemisphere. The boundary that separates the indigenous and non-indigenous population is extremely fluid, as it is based on characteristics that can easily change within a generation, such as language use, cultural practices, and a subjective sense of belonging. Using data from the Mexican Census, I examine the ethnic classification of children of indigenous parents. I find that movement across the ethnic boundary depends on which of the two criteria currently recognized by the Mexican Census is used. Children of indigenous parents are much less likely to be classified as indigenous according to language proficiency, especially when their parents have higher levels of education. By contrast, when proxy self-identification is used as a criterion, children of indigenous parents are more likely to be classified as indigenous, and greater parental education results in higher odds that children will be classified as indigenous. The shift in children's indigenous classification with parental education strongly affects estimates of educational disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous children.

T1  - Improving Intergroup Attitudes through Televised Vicarious Intergroup Contact: Social Cognitive Processing of Ingroup and Outgroup Information
AN  - 1738477514; 201538487
AB  - In an experiment, participants exposed to depictions of an intergroup interaction between a border patrolling U.S. citizen and an illegal immigrant demonstrated changed attitudes toward illegal immigrants depending on the valence of the portrayal. Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U.S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Neighbourhood Ethnic Diversity and Orientations Toward Muslims in Britain: The Role of Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1667949669; 201509526
AB  - A persistent theme in the British and international debates about immigration and diversity is the controversial claim that living in diverse areas has negative consequences for intergroup attitudes and community relations. In the present paper we test this claim by investigating the impact of neighbourhood diversity and self-reported intergroup contact on orientations (outgroup attitudes and social distance) toward one religious outgroup: Muslims. Respondents were both White British majority (N=867) and non-Muslim ethnic minority (N=567) residents of neighbourhoods in England which varied in their proportion of ethnic minority residents. We tested both direct and indirect (via intergroup contact) effects of diversity on outgroup orientations toward Muslims. Results show that individuals living in more ethnically diverse areas-regardless of whether they are White British members of the majority or non-Muslim members of ethnic minorities-have more positive contact with Muslims, with positive consequences for intergroup relations with Muslims.

T1  - Out-group trust and conflict understandings: The perspective of Turks and Kurds in Turkey
AN  - 1559007779; 201432078
AB  - Conflict reconciliation is difficult in the absence of out-group trust. The current study is concerned with the prolonged Turkish-Kurdish conflict in Turkey and examines out-group trust among both ethnic Kurds and ethnic Turks, in relation to perceptions and interpretations of the conflict (i.e. conflict frames, attributions of responsibility, and justified in-group violence), and to their ethnic and national identification. The results indicate that, across groups, participants had lower out-group trust when they agreed more that the conflict was between ethnic Turks and Kurds, when they blamed the other ethnic group more, and when they considered the in-group violence more justified. In addition, for the Kurds, higher national identification, stronger endorsement of the terrorism frame, higher responsibility attribution to the PKK and lower attributed responsibility to foreign powers were associated with higher trust of the Turks. In contrast, for the Turks, higher national identification and lower attributed responsibility to foreign powers were associated with lower trust of the Kurds. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - You don't have to be well-educated to be an aversive racist, but it helps
AN  - 1559007306; 201431982
AB  - People with higher levels of formal education report less prejudice in survey research. Here we present novel evidence on the nature of educational differences in anti-Black attitudes among Whites. We replicate the education effect on explicit self-report measures of anti-Black attitudes, but we find that education is much less related to implicit measures of anti-Black attitudes. Implicit measures differ from explicit measures in that they do not allow respondents to control the measurement outcome; they therefore measure more spontaneous aspects of attitudes. These results shed new light on intergroup attitudes of the higher educated. Higher educated people are more likely to be aversive racists, that is, to score low on explicit, but not implicit measures of prejudice. Given the differential relation of explicit versus implicit measures to behavior, they have wide-ranging implications for the kind of intergroup behavior and discrimination we can expect from less and more highly educated people.

T1  - How the religious context affects the relationship between religiosity and attitudes towards immigration
AN  - 1559007136; 201431928
AB  - This article approaches two shortcomings in previous research on religiosity and prejudice: (1) the lack of cross-country comparative studies; and (2) a failure to consider any moderating effects of religious contexts. We examine whether the relationship between religiosity and anti-immigration attitudes varies depending on religious contexts in Europe, and we find two things. First, strongly religious people are on average less likely to oppose immigration than non-religious people. Second, different religious contexts moderate the religiosity-attitude relationship in that religious people in Protestant countries and in countries with a low proportion of majority adherents are more tolerant than religious people in Catholic countries and in religiously homogenous countries. State policies also matter in that religious people are more negative where the government favours the majority religion. This calls into question the taken-for-granted understanding of religiosity and out-group attitudes found in the USA. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity everywhere and nowhere: a critical approach towards parsing ethnic and non-ethnic processes
AN  - 1551001625; 201429040
AB  - This article has two parts. First, it presents Andreas Wimmer's framework for comparative ethnic boundary making as a way of disentangling ethnic and non-ethnic processes. Wimmer's framework helps avoid the persistent tendency among researchers to attribute ethnic causes to ethnic patterns of inequality. Second, it focuses on how these insights can be applied to the US case, a nation that arguably pays a lot of attention to ethnicity and where ethnic cultures are often seen as the driver of differences in educational success and mobility between ethnic groups. The article sheds light on how this understanding can be complicated through existing and further research along Wimmerian lines. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Anglo-Australian and non-Anglophone middle classes: 'foreign accent' and social inclusion
AN  - 1667951749; 201509462
AB  - In this paper, the authors focus specifically on the perceptions and implications of 'foreign accent' in the interaction between two groups of middle-class Australians: non-Anglophone immigrants and Anglo-Australians. 'Non-Anglophone immigrants' are defined as those who arrived in Australia as adults, grew up speaking a language other than English. 'Anglo-Australians' are defined as people born in Australia who grew up in families/households where only English was spoken. Through a survey of a targeted sample of respondents, the two groups were asked about their intergroup communication, wider interaction and mutual perceptions. The findings indicate high levels of agreement between the two groups that Anglophone/non-Anglophone communication is minimally hindered by comprehension problems due to foreign-accented speech and cultural differences. Although the positive picture that emerges may reflect specific experiences and attitudes of middle-class professionals and may not be generalisable, increased contact of the 'multicultural middle class' with its Anglo-Australian counterpart is likely to be a factor in dissociating foreign accent and negative stereotyping.

T1  - Inter-ethnic processes in post-Soviet space: theoretical background
AN  - 1512219146; 201408923
AB  - This introductory article of a special issue outlines the general theoretical background, formulates principles for a continuum of hot and cold ethnicities, gives a brief characterisation of the interethnic developments after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and provides an overview of the papers. This collection of contributions deals with a variety of case studies with a particular focus on the strength of members' emotional attachment to their group. Such a division of ethnicities can be categorised into two prototypes: 'hot' and 'cold'. A 'hot' ethnic group is one whose members have a high emotional attachment to their group. 'Cold' ethnic groups are those whose members' emotional attachment to the groups is low, absent or latent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexual Men's Confrontation of Sexual Prejudice: The Role of Precarious Manhood
AN  - 1477375849
AB  - Prejudice and discrimination are unfortunate common realities for sexual minorities yet people rarely confront such behavior (Dickter  2012 ). This is especially problematic because confronting prejudice is one of the most effective weapons against it (e.g., Czopp and Monteith  2003 ). The present study explores whether men who perceive manhood to be an impermanent state easily taken away by engaging in gender role violations (i.e., precarious manhood; Vandello et al.  2008 ) are less likely to react negatively to sexually prejudiced interaction partners and therefore less likely to confront sexual prejudice. In addition, we tested whether non-confrontation serves to affirm meta-perceptions of heterosexuality. To test this hypothesis, 88 heterosexual, young adult males, drawn from the undergraduate population of a university in the northeastern U.S., were randomly assigned to either pair with a confederate who expressed blatant sexual prejudice or no blatant prejudice toward a gay applicant in a hiring discussion. Consistent with predictions, precarious manhood predicted lower rates of confronting sexual prejudice, and less negative responses to their interaction partner, while confronting prejudice was associated with believing one would be viewed as gay regardless of individual differences in precarious manhood.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Understanding and Responding to Homophobia and Bullying: Contrasting Staff and Young People's Views within Community Settings in England
AN  - 1441794847
AB  - Schools have been called the last bastion of homophobia; by comparison, little research has been carried out on this subject in youth services. This article reports on qualitative findings from a recent mixed methods study of barriers and facilitators to schools and youth services addressing issues about (homo)sexuality, homophobia and transphobia in one English region. The research sought to more fully understand the contexts in which young people experience and manage their identities and/or the prejudices they may face. Findings are based on 146 self-completion survey responses from young people and qualitative data drawn from 74 participants involved in in-depth methods (interviews and discussion groups) in nine different settings. This included teachers, youth service workers and young people (aged 11-20) who self-identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual, or heterosexual. The study adds to existing literature by taking a broader view of the social contexts in which young people learn about, make sense of, and practice, identities. In doing so, it suggests ways in which sociological perspectives can add to and expand the current (often psychology-based) body of work on bullying. The article documents six key themes emerging from the data: curriculum inclusion/exclusion; understandings of homophobia and bullying; experiences and impacts of bullying and homophobia; professional responses and support services; issues underlying professional practice; implications for identity management. Drawing on these findings and supporting evidence, the article concludes with a critique of the limiting constraints of individualised anti-bullying discourses, and argues that these risk minimising understandings of the complex social contexts for homophobia and transphobia.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Double Consciousness: Postsecondary Experiences of African American Males with Disabilities
AN  - 1541997950; 201426843
AB  - The purpose of this study was to present the academic experiences and perspectives of undergraduate African American male students labeled with disabilities. This study was intended to investigate an underexplored area that crosses the boundaries of ethnicity, disability, and postsecondary education. The students' reflections offer three key findings: (a) a disability label often leads to lower expectations and negative academic stereotypes; (b) students actively develop counternarratives, to thwart the internalization of negative stereotypes; and (c) attendance at a historically Black university can assist students in the development of a self-identity that counters ideologies of African American as intellectually inferiority.

T1  - Ethnic Politics in Ranked and Unranked Systems: An Exploratory Analysis
AN  - 1512218132; 201408801
AB  - This article explores how ethnic politics may operate differently in societies with 'ranked' versus 'unranked' ethnic systems, where ethnicity and class correlate closely versus very little. It focuses on two hypotheses suggested, but not tested, in Donald Horowitz's Ethnic Groups in Conflict. Their plausibility is explored in seven brief case studies of electoral politics in South America and Southern Africa. The analysis suggests that theories of ethnic politics that fail to take class into account are problematic for the study of ranked societies in particular. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Music as a weapon of ethnopolitical violence and conflict: processes of ethnic separation during and after the break-up of Yugoslavia
AN  - 1494751508; 201401977
AB  - Using illustrations from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their aftermath, Baker argues that understanding popular music and public discourses about it can help to understand the dynamics of ethnopolitical conflict. Studies of war and conflict have approached music as political communication, as an object of securitization, as a means of violence and as a symbol of ethnic difference, while international law in the context of another case of collective violence, Rwanda, has even begun to question whether performing or broadcasting certain music could constitute incitement to genocide. Drawing on poststructuralist perspectives on the media and ethnicization in conflicts, Baker explores and interrogates the discourse of popular music as a weapon of war that was in use during and after the violent break-up of Yugoslavia. Music during the Yugoslav wars was used as a tool of humiliation and violence in prison camps, and to provoke fear of the ethnic Other in line with a strategy of ethnic cleansing; it was also conceptualized as a morale-booster for the troops of one's own side. A discourse of music as a weapon of war was also in use and persisted after the war, when its referent was shifted to associate music-as-a-weapon not to the brave and defiant ingroup so much as the aggressive Other. This was then turned against a wider range of signifiers than those who had directly supported the Other's troops and had the effect of perpetuating ethnic separation and obstructing the reformation of a (post-)Yugoslav cultural space. Despite evidence that music did serve as an instrument of violence in the Yugoslav wars (and the precedent of the Bikindi indictment in Rwanda), Baker concludes that music should be integrated into understandings of ethnopolitical conflict not through a framework of incitement and complicity but with respect for the significance of music in the everyday.

T1  - The Ethnic Dimensions of Suburbanisation in Estonia
AN  - 1364702611; 201323597
AB  - Large-scale suburbanisation is a relatively recent phenomenon in East Central Europe and is responsible for major socio-spatial changes in metropolitan areas. Little is known about the ethnic dimensions of suburbanisation, despite the existence of often sizeable Russian minority populations in some member-states of the former Soviet Union. We use individual-level Estonian census data from the year 2000 in order to investigate the ethnic dimensions of suburbanisation. The results show that ethnic minorities have a considerably lower probability of suburbanising compared to the majority population, and minorities are less likely to move to rural municipalities-the main sites of suburban change-in the suburban ring of cities.

T1  - Working Twice as Hard to Get Half as Far: Race, Work Ethic, and America's Deserving Poor
AN  - 1364704803; 201323369
AB  - Attitudes toward racialized and redistributive policies like welfare are often thought of as a function of both principled ideological positions and the underlying racial attitudes a person holds. Look at racial resentment as one explanation, while Sniderman and his colleagues look to principled conservatism and authoritarianism as viable alternatives, claiming that racial resentment is merely proxying a legitimate race-neutral commitment to equality of opportunity. This article engages this debate through an experimental design which tests whether "hard work" is rewarded in a color-blind manner. The experimental design also affords scholars the opportunity to separate the effects of the two components of racial resentment: principled values and racial animus. The results show that American norms and implicit racism serve to uniquely privilege whites in a variety of ways. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Practitioner and Client Explanations for Disparities in Health Care Use Between Migrant and Non-migrant Groups in Sweden: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 1478096510; 22323124
AB  - To investigate variations in explanations given for disparities in health care use between migrant and non-migrant groups, by clients and care providers in Sweden. Qualitative evidence collected during in-depth interviews with five 'migrant' health service clients and five physicians. The interview data generated three categories which were perceived by respondents to produce ethnic differences in health service use: "Communication issues", "Cultural differences in approaches to medical consultations" and "Effects of perceptions of inequalities in care quality and discrimination". Explanations for disparities in health care use in Sweden can be categorized into those reflecting social/structural conditions and the presence/absence of power and those using cultural/behavioural explanations. The negative perceptions of 'migrant' clients held by some Swedish physicians place the onus for addressing their poor health with the clients themselves and risks perpetuating their health disadvantage. The power disparity between doctors and 'migrant' patients encourages a sense of powerlessness and mistreatment among patients. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Exclusive Nature of Quebec's Contemporary Nationalism: The Pitfalls of Civic Nationalism
AN  - 1728662003; 201535199
AB  - With reason, Quebec contemporary nationalism can be defined as a form of civic nationalism. This type of collective identification can be defined as being inclusive for every citizen notwithstanding their ethno-cultural origins. However, the Quebec case tends to illustrate that the discourse surrounding civic nationalism can be as exclusive as ethnic nationalism. This is largely due to the fact that Quebecers' collective identity is defined around specific political values that are not and cannot by nature be shared by every Quebec citizen. This is what this text will show and it will focus on the reasons that explain such a situation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Struggling Insecurity: Ahmadiyya Community in Bangladesh
AN  - 1448995700; 201342862
AB  - Human security is a fundamental approach, which focuses on ensuring security for the individual in respect of socio-economic status, creed and ethnic background. Religious difference serves as a source of potential conflict in every heterogeneous society that violates human security and human rights. The study examined how religious identity jeopardised human security and human rights in relation to the Ahmadiyya community in Bangladesh. A qualitative method was applied to collect data using in-depth interviews, case studies, informal group discussions and participant observations. The study revealed that Ahmadiyya could hardly escape from vicious attacks and harassments because of their religious identity. The study also found that the prevailing state of insecurity violated the human rights of the community with regard to different social aspects. Under harsh circumstances, many Ahmadiyya left their residences to save their lives from aggressive persecutions from anti-Ahmadiyya sections. Thus, the violent experiences of the Ahmadiyya discouraged them from contributing to socio-economic growth of the nation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The politics of fear: what does it mean to those who are otherized and feared?
AN  - 1315602779; 201307445
AB  - Islamophobia has, of late, created a tendency to conflate all Muslims as belonging to a single nation of Islam that does not recognize and respect boundaries imposed by western geopolitics. This has been done by some to create and by others to generate a sense of exclusive unity that would separate all Muslims and make them into 'others' within western societies. It is the contention of this paper that such calls both embody and ignore the diversities of Islam as understood and practised by its adherents. Furthermore by 'otherizing' the entire community of Muslims in the West, the singular label of 'Islamism' marginalizes and may even silence the vibrant contestations among Muslims about their faith and its teachings; these include questions posed by women who may be described as feminists. The attributes of Islamism, ascribed to the faith by public, the media and politicians in the West and adopted by some Muslims primarily as a politically unifying force, are very different from the fluidity and flexibility that has been a historic part of lived Islam. Many Muslims may well aspire to belong to the umma: people of Islam conceptualized as crossing ethnic, racial, geographical and political boundaries. But Muslims in general and Muslim women in particular do not wish to do so at the expense of being otherized and conforming to the negative stereotypes ascribed to them that mask their fluid identities and, in the case of 'white' women, their close ties with their kinship networks. The multiplicity of Muslim's identities sits more easily within the permeable unbounded umma applicable to the global as well as the local without necessarily always privileging one or other identity.

T1  - Social Engagement and Immigration Attitudes: Panel Survey Evidence from Germany
AN  - 1283643136; 201303315
AB  - This article asks how social engagement influences individuals' immigration concerns. Rates of volunteering, churchgoing, socializing, and helping others are used to predict anti-immigration sentiments. Panel survey data from Germany makes a dynamic "conditional change" modeling strategy possible; lagged immigration views are included in models to reveal the predictors of over time developments. The most robust findings signal that frequent church attendance reduces immigration concerns; routinely helping others enhances them. And in both instances, these relationships are conditioned by the presence of immigrants in the residential area. Overall, the results position social participation in certain activities as important factors that shape people's views on immigration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Speaking of Privilege: Family Therapy Educators' Journeys toward Awareness and Compassionate Action
AN  - 1285243508; 22690858
AB  - This study explores how family therapy educators from privileged social locations understand issues of privilege and the process by which they integrate their personal and professional journeys to create and model equity in family therapy training and professional development. These educators developed awareness about issues of privilege and oppression and owned their privilege. Increased awareness involved personal struggles with guilt and managing internalized voices of prejudice that are constantly reinforced in society. These educators adopted a stance of action and accountability for equity. We hypothesize that the process leading to owning one's privilege involves the ability to be compassionate for others' suffering and one's own limitations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Age and the Cost of Being Uyghurs in Urumchi
AN  - 1125219288; 201240536
AB  - This article asks: is the cost of being Uyghurs higher for young Uyghurs than for old Uyghurs in Urumchi? I address this question with data from a survey of 2,947 people conducted in Urumchi in 2005. The cost of being Uyghurs refers to the extent of economic inequality in the earnings of Han Chinese and Uyghurs. I develop three hypotheses on the effect of age on earnings differentials between Han Chinese and Uyghurs. Data analyses show that although young Uyghurs are better educated and earn more than old Uyghurs, they are more likely than old Uyghurs to suffer from being Uyghurs in Urumchi. This finding has policy implications for the reduction of ethnic disparity in Xinjiang. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discrimination, Family Relationships, and Major Depression Among Asian Americans
AN  - 1010078718; 22083344
AB  - Depression represents a growing concern among Asian Americans. This study examined whether discrimination and family dynamics are associated with depression in this population. Weighted logistic regressions using nationally representative data on Asian American adults (N = 2095) were used to examine associations between discrimination, negative interactions with relatives, family support, and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD). Discrimination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.67, 2.71) and negative interactions with relatives (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.58) were positively associated with MDD. Family support was associated with lower MDD (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.89), and buffered lower levels of discrimination. Results suggest that discrimination may have negative mental health implications, and also point to the importance of family relationships for depression among Asian Americans. Findings suggest that providers may consider stress experienced at multiple ecological levels to address Asian American mental health needs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnic concentration in the neighbourhood and majority and minority language: A study of first and second-generation immigrants
AN  - 1429630099; 201335858
AB  - Ethnic residential concentration is often found to hamper immigrants' majority language proficiency. However, there are still several gaps in our understanding of the relationship between ethnic concentration and ethnic minorities' language practices. This study examines the extent to which ethnic concentration also constrains immigrants' majority language use, whether contact with natives and co-ethnics mediates these relationships, and whether ethnic concentration relates to second-generation minorities' minority language proficiency. Structural equation models on data for people of Turkish and Moroccan origin living in the Netherlands (N = 2163) showed that ethnic concentration is indirectly related to weaker majority language proficiency and less majority language use through contact with natives and co-ethnics. For second-generation minorities, ethnic concentration is related to better minority language proficiency. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Self-Construal and the Intra- and Interethnic Social Interactions of Ethnic Minorities
AN  - 1030869182; 201227815
AB  - This study examined relationships between self-construal and the quality of daily interactions of three ethnic minority groups in Europe: ethnic Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands and Chechens in Poland. They described the social interactions they had for 2 weeks and they completed measures of independent and interdependent self-construal. We expected that, regardless of whether individuals' self-construals match with prevailing construals in the host society, interdependent self-construal would be positively related to the quality of intra- and interethnic contact. The results largely confirmed this expectation. Across the two samples, participants who were higher in interdependent self-construal had more positive (and less negative) interactions than participants who were lower in interdependent self-construal. Some of these relationships varied as a function of whether or not a majority group member was present, however. Persons with a more interdependent construal of self felt more liked, respected, accepted, and free to express opinion during interactions in which a majority group member was present, whereas no such relationships were found for intra-ethnic interactions. There were very few relationships between independent self-construal and the quality of either intra- or interethnic contact. The results suggest that for the quality of ethnic minorities' daily interactions, their interpersonal orientation is more important than a match between their orientation and the dominant orientation of the majority culture.

T1  - The Experience of Being Stopped: Young Immigrants, Social Exclusion and Strategies
AN  - 1023027187; 201225947
AB  - The purpose of the present article was to investigate social psychological processes leading to complex patterns of inclusion and exclusion. Following Sarah Ahmed's theory of the phenomenology of 'being stopped', we explored Young adults' experiences of coming to or living in Sweden. The empirical material used consists of four strategically selected case studies. Living in the new Europe can be described as an experience of having to constantly deal with patterns of exclusion/inclusion. These patterns of exclusion/inclusion vary over time. They create new social bonds, strategies used to cope with prejudices and discrimination, and new identities. The four cases illustrated more or less successful attempts to deal with exclusion. Discrimination and the feeling of being different clearly affected Young people's self-esteem and life plans. Lack of integration is not only related to ethnicity and language, but also to connectedness to social and institutional structures.

T1  - THE HIGH SEX RATIO IN CHINA: WHAT DO THE CHINESE THINK?
AN  - 906369133; 22220305
AB  - Summary              High sex ratios are well documented in many Asian countries, including China. This study was conducted in three Chinese provinces to explore awareness of the high sex ratios and its effects. Questionnaires were completed by 7435 respondents; 46% were urban and 53% were female. Sixty-four per cent were aware of the high sex ratio, and the majority were able to identify a range of consequences both for society and for unmarried men. These high levels of awareness of the negative impacts of high sex ratios should ultimately help to reduce the sex ratio at birth. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Joseph Kasa-Vubu, ABAKO, and Performances of Kongo Nationalism in the Independence of Congo
AN  - 1018342124; 201212839
AB  - When most people think about the Belgian Congo and its path to independence on June 30, 1960, the figure that most frequently comes to mind is that of Patrice Lumumba and his strategy of uniting people across different ethnic groups. While Lumumba's contributions have been well documented and recognized, this essay argues that the Kongo ethnic association-turned-political party, ABAKO (Association des BaKongo), and its leader Joseph Kasa-Vubu, were the driving force behind the independence movement in colonial Belgian Congo. ABAKO, however, used a completely different approach that successfully privileged ethnic nationalism, demonstrating that ideas of ethnic identity were often more important than a burgeoning national identity. Through the application of a performative analysis to three key events-the ABAKO countermanifesto of 1956; the Leopoldville rebellion of January, 1959; and the civil disobedience campaign advocating for an autonomous Kongo state in mid-1959-the author shows that members of ABAKO and its leadership effectively used performances of ethnic and territorial nationalism to greatly impact and lead the movement for Congolese independence.

T1  - Dimensions of collectivism: occupation, community and the increasing role of memory and personal dynamics in the debate
AN  - 1910529513
AB  - This essay argues that the notion of there being a decline in collectivism does not adequately engage with a whole new set of initiatives within labour process theory on collectivism in its various forms. These debates demonstrate how diverse social influences and experiences, and the memory of previous experiences and collective endeavours, are essential features that must be acknowledged in terms of their implications. There are series of interventions on occupational identity, the everyday lives of workers, gender and ethnic relations and the experience of work that nourish our understanding of collectivism as a more complex and broader concept. Furthermore, how features and relations are mobilized, linked and developed is becoming a vital feature of how collectivism should be understood. It is argued that the nature of these relations needs to be a greater focus of the debate if we are to develop a more dynamic view of collectivism, and a more relevant one.

AB  - An ethnic polarization index is a measure of the extent to which individuals in a population are distributed across different ethnic groups. The objective of this article is to develop some characterizations of the Reynal-Querol (RQ) index of ethnic polarization using alternative sets of independent axioms. A generalized form of RQ is also characterized. Some implications of the axioms are investigated as well. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Identity and Academic Success among Underrepresented Ethnic Minorities: An Interdisciplinary Review and Integration
AN  - 1037878648; 201232917
AB  - A growing body of literature provides insight into the ingredients for academic success for underrepresented ethnic minority students at all points of the academic pipeline. Theory and research in developmental and social psychology, education, and sociology all point to the important role of identity for students' academic success. The purpose of this article is to review some of the major findings across these social science disciplines to identify points of synergy that can inform effective policy recommendations. The review is structured around three points of convergence across disciplines: (1) prejudice and stereotype threat; (2) the role of social support; and (3) the availability of options for identity development. Reviewing these three topics sheds light on how the relation between identity and academic success must be understood on individual, relational, and institutional levels of analysis.

T1  - Post-colonial states, ethnic minorities and separatist conflicts: case studies from Southeast and South Asia
AN  - 1010631886; 201210545
AB  - Post-colonial states in the Asian region have frequently been subject to political tensions derived from their multi-ethnic make-up and, what some have argued to be, the failure of states to adequately represent the interests of their ethnic minorities. This article will look at examples of where states in Asia have failed to adequately represent or otherwise incorporate their ethnic minorities as full and equal citizens. It also considers the range of responses to such perceived or actual state failure in adequately incorporating all citizens, including inter-ethnic and racial violence and separatist conflict. The article will conclude by considering conceptual and actual models of state organization intended to resolve racial and ethnic tensions in the Asian region. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 907928044; 201124685
AB  - This article addresses the reasons for the nonresolution of the Cyprus problem and for its legendary intractability. It starts by highlighting three distinct features of the Cyprus problem followed by a historical account, with emphasis on attempts at a settlement. The third and fourth parts examine the window of opportunity of 1999-2004 (Cyprus's European Union accession process and the Annan Plan) and the reasons for its spectacular failure, and the more recent negotiation (2008-10) that was initially promising but is now hanging from a thread. The last part focuses on nine reasons for the impasse that has made the Cyprus conflict impervious to reunification and resolution. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Boundaries of ethnic identity in Central Asia: titular and Russian perceptions of ethnic commonalities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
AN  - 870433160; 201114264
AB  - Using data from nationally representative public opinion surveys done in 2005 in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the authors focus on the titular groups as well as the Russians in both countries and provide assessments of their perceived ethnic commonalities with one another and with various other ethnic groups, including Uzbeks and Jews in each country. The results indicate that there are hierarchies of intergroup differentiations that help to delineate the boundaries of ethnic identities in both countries. Multivariate analyses show the systematic effects of regional variables in shaping these ethnic boundaries. The basic topographies of the boundaries are consistent with the effects of social identification processes and the relative power and social standings of the different target ethnic groups across the regions. Our results lend clear support to the ethnic boundaries paradigm by underscoring that ethnic boundaries can be independent of objective commonalities and can vary according to contexts.

T1  - Conviviality and Conflict: Pluralism, Resilience and Hope in Inner-City Birmingham
AN  - 870433244; 201114280
AB  - This paper examines the lived realities of ethnic pluralism, social marginalisation and activism in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham, UK, which external media representations have tended to depict as lacking 'community cohesion' and fostering 'parallel lives'. Drawing on qualitative interviews with local residents and entrepreneurs conducted over a three-year period, we challenge such representations and a defining characteristic of currently dominant integration discourses: their tendency to ascribe 'community cohesion' or its absence as absolute properties to localities. Contrary to such reifying classifications, our interview data reveal considerably more complex social realities defined by a series of ambivalences. The first ambivalence is between undeniable local conflicts and, simultaneously, the everyday 'conviviality' of boundary-crossings and inter-ethnic solidarities. Second, the local economy is shown to enable both cohesion and ethnic exclusion. Finally, local politics and religious practice also display contradictory tendencies towards boundary maintenance on the one hand, and new inclusive alliances on the other. The emerging picture of Alum Rock not only challenges rigid taxonomies implied by 'community cohesion' discourses but also poses important questions about inter- and intra-ethnic networks, religiously underpinned social capital, the locally 'embedded' market, perceptions of social change, and an ideologically heterogeneous local civil society.

T1  - Protesting While Black?: The Differential Policing of American Activism, 1960 to 1990
AN  - 1883392301
AB  - How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time. In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white protest events to be policed. While there is support for a "Protesting While Black" phenomenon, it is not invariant across the entire period of inquiry.

T1  - Reassessing the Impact of Hispanic Stereotypes on White Americans' Immigration Preferences
AN  - 818800043; 201072239
AB  - Objectives. There is disagreement in the literature on immigration attitudes regarding the relative importance of ethnic stereotypes and more general cultural and economic concerns about increasing immigration in the formation of those attitudes. We argue that the impact of stereotypes relative to these other factors may have been underestimated for a variety of reasons. Methods. impact of stereotypes on immigration preferences in data from the Multi-Ethnic Module of the 2000 General Social Survey. Because the dependent variables analyzed herein are ordinal, we estimate ordered logistic regressions that correct for diagnosed hetereoskedacticity. Results. Statistical analyses confirm that negative stereotypes are a significantly larger predictor of ethnicity-specific immigration preferences relative to general attitudes about immigration. Intervening variables analyses also suggest that the impact of stereotypes has been underestimated relative to cultural and economic anxieties because these variables significantly mediate its observed impact. Conclusions. results suggest that ethnic stereotypes are significantly more important in determining immigration preferences among Americans than has been reported in previous research.

T1  - Theorizing identity: beyond the 'us' and 'them' dichotomy
AN  - 754039062; 201049831
AB  - Yuval-Davis discusses three interconnected questions relating to identity. She first examines whether and in what ways the notion of identity should be theorized, on the one hand, and empirically researched, on the other, focusing on the opposing views of Stuart Hall and Robin Williams. She then examines the contested question of what is identity, positioning it in relation to notions of belonging and the politics of belonging, and in relation to several influential schools of thought, especially those that construct identity as a mode of narrative, as a mode of performativity or as a dialogical practice. Her third interrelated question concerns the boundaries of identity and the relationship between self and non-self. She explores both social psychological and psychoanalytical approaches to that question, and deals with questions such as reflexivity, identifications and forced identities. The last part of the article explores several types of relationships between self and non-self, such as: 'me' and 'us'; 'me/us' and 'them'; 'me' and other 'others'; 'me' and the transversal 'us/them'. Yuval-Davis's basic argument here is that dichotomous notions of identity and difference, when theorizing boundaries of individual and collective identities, are more misleading than explanatory.

T1  - The Role of National Identity Representation in the Relation between In-Group Identification and Out-Group Derogation: Ethnic versus Civic Representation
AN  - 754040739; 201049632
AB  - Two studies investigated whether the content of in-group identity affects the relation between in-group identification and ethnic prejudice. The first study among university students, tested whether national identity representations (i.e., ethnic vs. civic) moderate or mediate the relation between Flemish in-group identification and ethnic prejudice. A moderation hypothesis is supported when those higher in identification who subscribe to a more ethnic representation display higher ethnic prejudice levels than those higher in identification who subscribe to a more civic representation. A mediation hypothesis is supported when those higher in identification tend towards one specific representation, which in turn, should predict ethnic prejudice. Results supported a mediation hypothesis and showed that the more respondents identified with the Flemish in-group, the more ethnic their identity representation, and the more they were inclined to display ethnic prejudice. The second study tested this mediation from a longitudinal perspective in a two-wave study among high school students. In-group identification at Time 1 predicted over-time changes in identity representation, which in turn, predicted changes in ethnic prejudice. In addition to this, changes in identity representation were predicted by initial ethnic prejudice levels. The implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic diversity and statistics in East Asia: 'foreign brides' surveys in Taiwan and South Korea
AN  - 743065749; 201043197
AB  - East Asian nations have become increasingly diverse in their ethnic composition since the 1990s. A large proportion of recent immigrants consists of women from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, who migrated following their marriage to male citizens from South Korea and Taiwan. To study this new group of foreign residents, the governments of both Taiwan and South Korea have conducted national surveys since 2000. This paper conducts a content analysis of the questions of these surveys to elaborate a criticism of the ethnic statistics produced from them. These surveys provide relevant information on this group of new residents, but they also have the potential to reinforce existing negative stereotypes due to prior assumptions that shaped the content of questionnaires. The analysis reveals that the production of statistics on migrants is influenced by three ideologies: assimilation, patriarchy and nationalism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Health Competence As Predictor of Access to Care Among Latinos in Baltimore
AN  - 199566986; 18060500
AB  - The goal of this study is to identify the underlying structure of Health Competence and its value as a predictor of access to care among the Latino population in Baltimore, Maryland. Data on a cross-sectional urban probability sample were collected from 330 foreign-born Latino men and women aged 21-75 years residing in Baltimore at the time of the survey. Principal components analysis yielded a two-component solution: the first component comprised "factors enabling" access to care; the second, "perceived barriers". When testing the predictive power of the Health Competence construct using model building and the log likelihood criteria the "enabling factors" added significantly (P < .005) to the power of the socio-demographic variables to predict access to care, making it an important tool for programs aiming to improve US Latinos' health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceiving Racism in Ambiguous Situations: Who Relies on Easy-to-Use Information?
AN  - 741063903; 20575334
AB  - In situations that are ambiguous with regard to the presence of discrimination, how do people arrive at their conclusions that discrimination has (or has not) taken place? This question was examined from a motivated social cognition perspective via the interaction of two factors: the prototype effect-the notion that ambiguously discriminatory behavior is more likely to be perceived as discriminatory when the executor is prototypical and the need for cognitive closure-the tendency to jump hastily to and seize on an answer. Results provided replicating evidence of the prototype effect among European American participants but not among African American participants. Specifically, European Americans were likely to perceive ambiguously racist behavior enacted by a prototypical executor (i.e., a White person) as more discriminatory than the same behavior exhibited by a non-prototypical executor (i.e., a Black person). African American participants, on the other hand, showed no reliance on this simple cognitive heuristic. Furthermore, results showed that European Americans with a higher need for cognitive closure were more likely to rely on the easy-to-use information offered by prototypes. These findings are discussed from a motivated social cognition perspective. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO MASS MEDIA CAMPAIGNS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ON LEVELS AND TRENDS OF HIV-RELATED STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION IN NIGERIA: TOOLS FOR ENHANCING EFFECTIVE HIV PREVENTION PROGRAMMES
AN  - 203900188; 20018118
AB  - People living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHAs) often face stigma and discrimination, especially in developing countries. HIV-related stigma is expressed through social ostracism, personal rejection, direct and indirect discrimination, and denial from families and friends. Consequently, it is associated with reduced adoption of preventive and care behaviours, including condom use, seeking for HIV test and care-seeking behaviour subsequent to diagnosis. Ignorance about the epidemiology of the disease on modes of transmission and prevention aggravates HIV-related stigma in Nigeria. Behaviour change communication activities through mass media have been shown to be an effective approach in improving people's knowledge about the disease. This paper monitors trends in the level of accepting attitudes towards PLWHAs in Nigeria between 2003 and 2007. It also evaluates the impact of exposure to mass media and social support on the levels of accepting attitudes towards PLWHAs. A significant and positive trend was evident between 2003 and 2007 (p<0.0001). Furthermore, exposure to mass media communications on HIV and AIDS issues and social support were significantly related to the reduced stigma and discrimination against PLWHAs (p<0.0001).

T1  - Two Separate Worlds: Students of Color at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 1928245370
AB  - In this study, 21 African American, Asian American, and Latino students were interviewed in order to ascertain the nature of their experience as students of color on a small, predominantly White university campus in the northeastern United States. The data revealed awareness as the overarching theme in the phenomenon, in that awareness (or lack of it) produced "two separate worlds": one for the White majority and another for students of color. The data also revealed a divergence in the phenomenon in that a small group of the youngest participants with the lightest skin color felt very much a part of the same world as their White counterparts. Cultural identity development theory is discussed as a possible explanation for the divergence in that it is linked to awareness and inherently incorporates relevant sociopolitical issues such as race, color, prejudice, and discrimination.

T1  - Appalachian Identity And Policy Opinions
AN  - 964197335; 201207411
AB  - Many of the people who live in Appalachia do not identify with the region. In this paper, we use a unique survey instrument to investigate the types of people who are more likely to identify with Appalachia as well as the consequences of this identification for policy opinions. Our findings show that Appalachian identifiers are older, tend to have spent a larger percentage of their life in the region, and are more highly educated than non-identifiers. We also demonstrate that Appalachian identity is strongly related to opinions on growth and development policies. These findings should be of interest to students of Appalachian culture and politics as well as those interested in regional identity more generally. In a February 13, 2009 FOX News program, conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly blasted the "culture of poverty" and "culture of ignorance" in Appalachia. He complained that Appalachian culture "harms the children almost beyond repair" and argued that the "parents are screwed up. . .kids get married at 16 and 17. . .their parents are drunks. . .there is a lot of meth. . .there is a lot of irresponsibility." This rant is yet another example of the ways in which popular culture stereotypes the people of Appalachia. Fortunately, the scholarly community has provided a number of thoughtful challenges to these negative stereotypes. As an example, the edited volume, Back Talk From Appalachia: Confronting Stereotypes, showcases the work of academics, activists, writers, and storytellers as they demonstrate the rich cultural heritage of the region (Billings, Norman, and Ledford 1999). Missing from the literature, however, is a large-scale effort to investigate Appalachian identity. Given the overwhelmingly negative portrayals of Appalachia in popular culture, it makes sense that some Appalachians may shun their Appalachian identity while others view themselves as part of an important and oft-maligned in-group. In addition, there is very little known about whether migrants to the region identify with Appalachia. It is also likely that the choice of whether to identify with Appalachia will structure broader world views and policy opinions. In this study, we investigate who is more likely to identify with Appalachia as well as the policy consequences of Appalachian regional identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Conflicts in the Former Yugoslavia As a Consequence of Nation-State Building
AN  - 754043509; 201053281
AB  - This paper deals primarily with exploring the connection between the creation of nation states, on the one hand, and, on the other, ethnic cleansing and violence in the former Yugoslavia. It argues that the process of creation of nation states in the former Yugoslavia was an inevitable political process, whereas the ethnic strife, violence and genocide were not a "natural" part of that process. Ethnic intolerance did not increase before the war, but it did dramatically increase during the conflict and this increase provides counter-evidence to theories about ethnic hatred. It was certain political elites who provoked ethnic cleansing, primarily by the manipulation of public images, in order to win or keep power. This argument uses instrumentalism as the theory of ethnic conflicts, but other ethnicity theories are briefly introduced in the first part of the paper as well. The argumentation in the second part is based on an analysis of the creation of nation states and the appearance of nationalism in the Western Balkans. It explains the inescapability of the disintegration of socialist federations and the creation of independent states and through empirical research shows that ethnic hate was not dominant, whereas nationalism was extremely strong and finally became the main alternative to evanescent socialism.

T1  - Blurred Borders For Some But Not "Others": Racialization, 'Flexible Ethnicity' Gender, And Third-Generation Mexican American Identity
AN  - 743046073; 201031843
AB  - How are the lives of middle-class third-generation Mexican Americans both racialized and gendered? Third-generation Mexican Americans in California experience a racialization process continuum that extends from "flexible ethnicity," the ability to be considered an "insider" in different racial/ethnic communities, to racialization as nonwhite that is enforced through the deployment of negative stereotypes. Using interview data, the author finds that women are afforded more "flexible ethnicity" than men. Accordingly, men are more rigorously racialized than women. Women are racialized through exoticization, whereas men are racialized as threats to safety. Lighter-skinned individuals escaped consistent racialization. These findings have consequences for the incorporation possibilities of later-generation Mexican Americans, as women and light-skinned (often multiracial) individuals are more frequently granted "flexible ethnicity" and less strongly racialized than men and dark-skinned (often monoracial) individuals. Even among the structurally assimilated, contemporary racial and gender hierarchies limit the voluntary quality of ethnicity among third-generation Mexican Americans.

T1  - Intra-ethnic fissures in ethnic movements: the rise of Mohajir identity politics in post-1971 Pakistan
AN  - 743042715; 201026657
AB  - The article charts the rise of Mohajir identity politics in Pakistan since 1971. Most accounts of Mohajir identity politics have focused mainly on one actor, that is, the Mohajir (now Muttahida) Qaumi Movement and their politics and secondly, have remained silent on intra-ethnic fissures within the Mohajir community. The present article builds on and criticises such accounts for their partiality and presents a more nuanced understanding of politics within the Mohajir community. On the theoretical plane, it criticises modernist and primordialist accounts of ethnicity and nationalism, both of which portray a homogenous picture of ethnic groups as based on unity and shared aims. It is shown that unity and shared aims are at best, a chimera, and that intra-ethnic fissure is as important to understand as is inter-ethnic conflict when it comes to analysing ethnic movements.
