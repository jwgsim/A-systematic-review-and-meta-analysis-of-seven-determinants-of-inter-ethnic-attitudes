T1  - The impact of intergroup contact on attitudes towards immigrants: a case study of Australia
AN  - 2696429407
AB  - As global efforts to address COVID-19 become more urgent, the public discourse on attitudes towards immigrants has also become more polarized. In such a heightened social and political context, we study the impact of intergroup contact in political jurisdictions with different shares of minority populations. Drawing on data from the Australian Election Study and the Census, we find that less intergroup contact with neighbours from minority birthplace, language and citizenship backgrounds is correlated with higher anti-immigrant sentiments. These results have significant implications for immigrant-receiving countries with existing legislation and policies that direct immigrants to move to areas of lower population density, lower presence of immigrants, and less previous exposure to international migration. The evidence presented in this study suggests that without sufficient political and policy sensitization to the issues for immigrants living in these areas, there could be detrimental social and political impacts to both immigrants and society more generally.

T1  - Women's labor force participation in insurgency and ethno-religious conflict: the cases of Aceh and Ambon
AN  - 2692483188
AB  - This article explores changes in patterns of labor participation in two types of conflict settings in Indonesia: the insurgency in Aceh and the ethno-religious conflict in Ambon, Maluku. It brings into view interactions between gender on the one hand, and religion, age, social class, and ethnicity on the other, while also taking into consideration regional economies. I show how intersectional dynamics set in motion by different types of conflict create different patterns of labor force participation. Women increased their economic activity in both conflicts but became breadwinners only in a few specific contexts. Moreover, their increased economic activity was sometimes experienced as hardship and sometimes as empowerment. After the conflict, many women in Aceh returned to the domestic sphere in the name of Sharia law, whereas many in Ambon remained economically active. I argue that different types of conflict in different economic contexts and the associated differences in the relationships between gender, religion, age, social class, and ethnicity help to explain this variation in outcomes.

T1  - “All the nightmare images of ethnic conflict in the twentieth century are here”: Erroneous statistical proofs and the search for ethnic violence in revolutionary Ireland, 1917–1923
AN  - 2632054289
AB  - In the 1990s, Canadian historian Peter Hart claimed tens of thousands of native southern Irish Protestants experienced something akin to “ethnic cleansing” at the hands of the IRA in the early 1920s. Hart's research revised the “Irish nationalist revolution” (ca. 1917–1923) as an essentially ethnic conflict, and this article re‐examines his evidence and methodology. Exaggerating the number of forced migrations, Hart's analysis rests on erroneous statistical proofs which he supported with a gross evidence selection bias. To better understand Hart's revision, his work is compared with Michael A. Bellesiles' Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture (2000), which also exhibited similar but also very different statistical errors. A central argument in this article is that erroneous statistical proofs are best understood as social constructs, where they articulate the prejudices of their host academies. Greater awareness of this problem is needed if it is to be avoided in the future.

T1  - DIFFERENTIATED CITIZENSHIP: The Everyday Politics of the Urban Poor in Kathmandu, Nepal
AN  - 2589901947
AB  - This article explores the everyday politics through which citizenship is negotiated by diverse residents, analysing the case of Bansighat, an informal settlement in Kathmandu, Nepal. It focuses on both the collective tactics of the Nepali women's federation of the urban poor—Nepal Mahila Ekata Samaj—as well as the quotidian practices of diverse residents around water and sanitation. This analysis reveals the variegated politics through which citizenship plays out—reflecting complex interactions between wider processes of urban transformation in Kathmandu, localized socio‐spatial conditions of Bansighat and long‐standing social relations in Nepali society. The empirical findings help to make more explicit the politics through which some residents are able to capitalize and transform diverse tenure and infrastructural practices into a broader sense of legitimacy or belonging in the city, while simultaneously engendering exclusions for others. This article accordingly reflects on how broader class and ethnic power relations play out through everyday citizenship negotiations, generating differentiated experiences of citizenship for diverse individuals.

T1  - Immigrants, voter sentiment, and local public goods: The case of museums
AN  - 2587998969
AB  - We present a model where museum commitment to immigrant integration is conditioned by the possible negative reactions of native visitors and patrons. We then exploit the rich information provided by the 2015 Italian museum census to investigate the factors associated with a higher probability of museums developing promotion programmes targeting an immigrant audience, with a special focus on the size of immigrant communities and the importance of anti‐immigrant sentiment in the local context. We proxy the latter with the municipal vote shares of parties with an anti‐immigrant agenda in the 2013 national elections. Our evidence shows that the vote share of Lega Nord has a significantly negative and sizable estimated coefficient. Conversely, we find no positive association with the overall share of immigrants—only the size of specific minorities at the local level increases the likelihood that a museum engages immigrants. We control for a number of context variables and specific museum characteristics, some of which (age of establishment, type of collection) show a positive association with museum commitment to immigrant integration.

T1  - Networking in contexts: qualitative social network analysis' insights into migration processes
AN  - 2543735996
AB  - How do migrants network in different contexts? I address this question by using qualitative social network analysis and explore the relationship between shared contexts and individuals' possibilities for interaction as well as (un)intentional network (re)creation. I observe how migrants form ties and draw boundaries in two contexts: (1) institutional and (2) migrant community. I draw on qualitative data from a study of Ukrainian migrants' social networks in Warsaw, Poland. I find that the structural opportunities that facilitate relationships with Poles differ between those Ukrainian migrants who arrived around or after the year 2014 and those who migrated earlier. The relations between Ukrainians are characterized by class divisions, which they interpret via ‘language/ethnic’ differences, reinforced by the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. However, these symbolic boundaries do not translate into rigid network boundaries.

T1  - Person-Message Fit: Racial Identification Moderates the Benefits of Multicultural and Colorblind Diversity Approaches
AN  - 2524148120
AB  - Although diversity approaches attempt to foster inclusion, one size may not fit all. In five studies, African Americans (N = 1,316), who varied in strength of racial identification, contemplated interviewing at a company with a multicultural or colorblind approach. Participants in the multicultural condition anticipated pressure to be prototypical group members relative to colorblind and control conditions. Only weakly identified participants reacted to this pressure, experiencing more anxiety and inauthenticity in the multicultural relative to colorblind (not control) company. Strongly identified participants experienced less anxiety and inauthenticity in the multicultural relative to colorblind and control companies. Inauthenticity among weakly identified participants was apparent in self-descriptions and linked with worse hiring outcomes in multicultural relative to colorblind and control contexts. Despite predictions, there were no self-stereotyping effects. Diversity approaches that make some group members more comfortable may prove simultaneously constraining for others, highlighting the complexity in how diversity approaches affect individuals.

T1  - An intersection of East Asian welfare and immigration regimes: The social rights of low‐skilled labour migrants in Japan and Korea
AN  - 2509232809
AB  - Over the last two decades East Asian countries have demonstrated the simultaneous developments of state welfare provision, immigration control and immigrant integration policy. Despite significant growth in related interest and research, studies on immigrants and their social inclusion are still relatively scarce, especially in terms of the intersection of East Asian welfare and immigration regimes. This study thus examined and compared, from a historical perspective, the development of welfare and immigration regimes and their impact on the social rights of low‐skilled labour migrants in Japan and South Korea. These two countries have taken somewhat divergent paths, which has resulted in the persistent ethnic differentiation of low‐skilled labour migrants in Japan and their ethnically hierarchical inclusion in Korea. This article argues that the two policy legacies of East Asian welfare and immigration regimes, namely, productivism and ethnic nationalism, still significantly matter in policy making related to low‐skilled labour migrants.

T1  - Identity, the politics of policing, and limits to legitimacy in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2492472524
AB  - This paper draws connections between the lived experiences of community-based stakeholders in the Northern Ireland peace process and dominant discourses and practices of political leaders to identify (de)legitimation processes and the concomitant reproduction of ethnopolitical identities. Findings reveal ontological planes animated by narratives about the so-called political policing of public disorder and disputes over the past which align the identities of otherwise quite different and conflicted intra-ethnic constituencies. Policing processes which become disputed, due to their historically central role in constituting and reflecting the contested logic of the state provide events or social and organizational ‘fields’ in which opportunistic actors can effectively reconstruct ethnopolitical boundaries, in ways which provide both rational (for political and organizational leaders) outcomes, and, inexplicable phenomenological or cultural ends of ‘groupness’. The implications of such processes on intercommunal and internecine conflict are discussed.

La metodología desarrollada es de carácter mixto, utilizando el análisis del discurso y el de contenido como técnicas de investigación. El análisis de datos se realiza con el software ATLAS.ti. Los resultados principales reflejan que las atribuciones estereotipadas de la comunidad gitana, como un exogrupo con bajo estatus social, precario, conflictivo, delincuencial y peligroso, se han intensificado en el contexto del COVID-19. Por otra parte, se han evidenciado nuevas atribuciones que representan a la comunidad gitana como "transmisores del COVID-19", reforzando una imagen como población que atenta contra la salud pública del país. Se concluye alertando que las representaciones sociales de la comunidad gitana en la prensa española favorecen la (re)producción de escenarios de conflictividad, estigmatización y rechazo.Alternate abstract:During the State of Alarm in Spain, the Council for the Elimination of Racial or Ethnic Discrimination expressed its concern about the numerous cases of discrimination, rejection and hatred that have occurred against the Gypsy Community. This work has as main objective to know the media treatment used to give coverage to the press news that link the COVID-19 with the Gypsy Community in Spain. The methodology developed is of a mixed nature, using discourse analysis and content analysis as research techniques. The data analysis is carried out with the software ATLAS.ti. The main results reflect that the stereotyped attributes of the Gypsy Community, as an exogroup with low social status, precarious, conflictive, criminal and dangerous, have been intensified in the context of the COVID-19. On the other hand, new attributions have become evident that represent the Gypsy Community as "transmitters of the COVID-19", reinforcing an image as a population that threatens the public health of the country. It concludes by warning that the social representations of the Gypsy Community in the Spanish press favour the (re)production of scenarios of conflict, stigmatization and rejection.

T1  - Ethnic Boundaries and Class Consciousness within Malaysian Employment Sector
AN  - 2575932704
AB  - Artikel ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji kepentingan etnik dalam sektor pekerjaan di Malaysia dan pertindihannya dengan kelas sosial. Penekanan ini penting kerana penumpuan etnik dalam sektor pekerjaan masih berlaku, walaupun terdapat perubahan dalam struktur ekonomi pasca-kemerdekaan Malaysia. Kajian ini berdasarkan lima puluh lima temubual secara mendalam yang telah dijalankan bersama responden berbangsa Melayu dan Cina yang menetap di Pulau Pinang, Malaysia dan Glasgow, United Kingdom. Data yang diperolehi telah dianalisis melalui analisis tematik, manakala perbincangan adalah berdasarkan teori pasca-kolonialisme dan konstruktivisme. Hasil kajian menunjukkan terdapat hubungan dialektikal antara etnik dan kesedaran tentang kelas dalam pemahaman responden terhadap pengasingan tenaga kerja berdasarkan etnik di Malaysia pada masa kini. Biroaksi etnik atas-ke-bawah dan sempadan budaya seharian menekankan kepentingan etnik dan hubungan antara etnik dalam sektor pekerjaan di Malaysia. Manakala modal sosial didapati menekankan hubungan kelas individu dan intra-etnik dalam sektor ini.Alternate abstract:This article seeks to investigate the importance of ethnicity in the Malaysian employment sector and its intersection with social class. This emphasis is important due to the changes in Malaysia's post-independence economic structures and the 'unchangeable' nature of ethnic concentration in the country's new employment sectors. The study is based on fifty-five indepth interviews conducted among the Malay and Chinese Malaysian ethnic groups residing in Penang, Malaysia and Glasgow, United Kingdom. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and discussions were based on the post-colonialism theory and constructivism. The results suggested that there was a dialectical relationship between ethnicity and class awareness in the respondents' understanding of the present-day Malaysian ethnic segregations of labour. Top-down ethnic bureaucratisation and everyday cultural boundaries emphasise the significance of ethnicity and inter-ethnic group relations in the Malaysian employment sector. On the other hand, social capital was found to address individual and intra-ethnic class relations in this sector.

T1  - Опыт 1990-х гг. и управление культурным многообразием
TT  - 1990s' Experience and Cultural Diversity Management
AN  - 2571136383
AB  - В статье обсуждаются уроки, которые государство и общество могли вынести из институциональных противоречий и насильственных конфликтов, пережитых Россией в 1990-е гг. Анализируются процессы этнической мобилизации в национальных республиках и пути выхода из конфликтных ситуаций. На конкретных материалах показано, что важнейшим уроком стало умение находить компромиссные, диалоговые способы снятия противоречий в сфере языка, экологии, запросов на участие в использовании местных природных ресурсов, повышении самостоятельности в экономике, развитии культуры. Большинство противоречий последнего десятилетия XX в. ограничивалось институциональной сферой, нарушением Конституции и федеральных законов. При этом этнический национализм элит в российских республиках был разным. Анализируя дискурс и законодательные практики Башкортостана, Северной Осетии – Алании, Татарстана, Саха (Якутии) и Тувы, автор показывает, что о разделенном суверенитете (не сецессии) речь тогда шла лишь в Татарстане, причем в нем, как в Якутии и Башкирии, преобладал экономический и культурный национализм, в Северной Осетии – Алании – защитный, в Туве – культурный. Компромиссные решения, принятые в 1990-е гг., оказались временными. По мере усиления легитимной власти в Центре они переставали действовать. Признание законной монополии силы со стороны государства является условием недопущения эскалации насильственных конфликтов. Защита общества основывается на верховенстве закона, но за соблюдением закона необходим контроль и со стороны государства, и со стороны общества. В заключительной части статьи обсуждается опыт управления культурным многообразием при регулировании межэтнических отношений в России 2010-х гг. Опираясь на результаты общероссийских и республиканских исследований, автор показывает, что этническая идентичность россиян остается очень устойчивой, причем у большинства населения она не конфронтирует с общероссийской идентичностью, а совмещается с ней. Это позволяет сделать вывод: представление о народе как согражданстве, направленное на консолидацию социальных, пространственных и этнокультурных сообществ, реализующих свои интересы в экономике, политике и культуре, способствует обеспечению солидарности в стране.Alternate abstract:The article analyses the lessons that the state and society could learn from the institutional contradictions and violent conflicts that were overcome in Russia in the 1990s. Ethnic mobilization and ways of getting out of conflict situations are analysed. Based on specific materials, it is shown that the most important lesson was the ability to find compromise, dialogue ways to remove contradictions in the field of language, ecology, requests for participation in the use of local natural resources, increasing independence in the economy, and developing culture. Most of the controversy was related to the institutional sphere, violation of the constitution and federal laws. The author shows that the regulation of such conflicts in multi-component federations is facilitated by the understanding that the ethnic nationalism of elites in the republics is different. On the example of the analysis of the discourse and legislative practice of Bashkortostan, North Ossetia–Alania, Tatarstan and Tuva, it is shown that divided sovereignty (not secession) was discussed in Tatarstan, but in it, as in Sakha and Bashkortostan, economic and cultural nationalism, defensive in North Ossetia– Alania, mainly cultural in Tuva. Accordingly, the agreements between the government of the Russian Federation and the government of the republics differed. Compromise solutions were temporary and as soon as a strong legitimate government was formed in the Centre, they ceased to operate, this is also one of the lessons of the 1990s. Interethnic contradictions within the republics were also achieved by compromise solutions. However, the problem of ensuring equal opportunities in the labour and political spheres still remains. The lesson in preventing the escalation of power conflicts was the recognition of the legitimate monopoly of power on the part of the state. The protection of society is based on the rule of law, but compliance with the law needs control from both the state and society. The final part of the article is devoted to the regulation of interethnic relations in the second decade of the 2000s. The author supports the idea of calling this process the management of cultural diversity, since the term nation-building used earlier contains a double understanding of the nation, both ethnocultural and civil. The cited research results in the country and the republics show that ethnic identity remains very stable. But nowhere does it appear as a confrontational all-Russian identity, but is combined with it among the majority of the population. It can be assumed that the idea of the people as co-citizenship, aimed at consolidating social, spatial and ethnocultural communities, realizing their interests in the economy, politics, culture, contributes to the provision of solidarity in the country.

T1  - Linguistic (il)legitimacy in Migration Encounters
AN  - 2544519088
AB  - Linguistic differences between groups of co-ethnic and/or co-national migrants in diasporic contexts can become grounds for constructing and displaying identities that distinguish (groups of) migrants on the basis of differences in the sociohistorical circumstances of migration (provenance, time of migration) and/or social factors such as class, socioeconomic status, or level of education. In this article, I explore how language became a source of ideological conflict between Greek Cypriot and Greek migrants in the context of a complementary school in north London. Analysing a set of semi-structured interviews with teachers, which were undertaken in 2018 as part of an ethnographically oriented project on language ideologies in Greek complementary schools, I show that Greek pupils and parents, who had migrated to the UK after 2010 pushed by the government-debt crisis in Greece, positioned themselves as linguistic authorities and developed discourses that delegitimised the multilingual and multidialectal practices of Greek Cypriot migrants. Their interventions centred around the use of Cypriot Greek and English features, drawn from the linguistic resources that did not conform with the expectations that “new” Greek migrants held about complementary schools and which were based on strictly monolingual and monodialectal language ideologies. To these, teachers responded with counter-discourses that re-valued contested practices as products of different linguistic repertoires that were shaped by different life courses and trajectories of linguistic resources acquisition.

T1  - Ethnic Conflict and the Politics of Spoils in Nigeria
AN  - 2468581166
AB  - The paper attempts to discuss the nexus between spoils politics and escalating ethnic conflict in Nigeria that has seen some communities like the Fulani herdsmen, a large semi-nomadic community found in large parts of Nigeria, especially its central and southern regions, slaughter their countrymen with impunity. It is not a debate on the recent spate of violent clashes that have reportedly been triggered by the herdsmen. It is at its core an exploration of the ethnic issues that are prevalent in Nigeria overlapping with political, economic and religious tensions causing undercurrents of distrust and suspicion in the country. The paper argues that due to the zero sum nature of local politics, the violence that has been unleashed can be seen as a kind of premeditated strategy being followed by the federal government given its complete inaction in the face of the massacres and land grabs that have occurred. The brutal intimidation faced by sections of Nigeria’s population and the inability of the state to stem it has prevented the country’s citizens from resisting the ongoing conflict and strife.

T1  - Exclusion of Muslims in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. A Comparative Analysis of Anti-Muslim Attitudes in France, Norway, Poland and Czech Republic
AN  - 2490719002
AB  - There are worrying signs of rising intolerance towards Muslim immigrants in the majority of European societies. We use data from the 2014/2015 wave of European Social Survey to analyse negative attitudes toward Muslim immigrants in France, Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic. Results of the analyses reveal that both levels and determinants of the anti-Muslim attitudes vary greatly. The levels are highest in Czech Republic and Poland, the two countries that have a very low Muslim population. Nevertheless, contact with immigrants reduces hostility toward Muslims also in these two countries. We find that theoretical approaches commonly used in studies of anti-immigrant attitudes are better suited to explain negative attitudes in Western European than in Eastern European countries. We argue that future research on hostility toward immigrants in Europe should focus more on Eastern European countries, as attitudes toward immigrants in several of these are worryingly negative.

Religiosity, conceived as strength of religious attachment, has received comparatively little treatment. We investigate religiosity via electoral, household, and attitudinal surveys, distinguishing the effects of “behaving” and “believing.” The association between religiosity and EU Referendum vote choice and position is identified before and after inclusion of values, attitudinal, and civic engagement measures. Consistent with established findings, in socio‐structural models Anglicans are more likely to support Brexit than religious Nones. More frequent church attendance is associated with being more pro‐Remain. The Anglican effect is primarily mediated by anti‐immigrant attitudes, authoritarianism, and salience of ethnic identity, suggesting a Christian nationalist aspect to Leave support. The attendance effect is mediated by warmer attitudes toward immigrants, and social capital. Notably, those exhibiting stronger orthodox belief tend to feature a stronger attachment to “Leave,” with this partly mediated by authoritarianism. To evaluate the net effect of religion on civic life, we should pay more attention to the cultural content of religious beliefs, and how they structure other values and attitudes.

T1  - Contextualizing acculturative stress among Latino immigrants in the United States: a systematic review
AN  - 2428367448
AB  - Purpose: This systematic review of the literature informed of (a) the relationship between acculturation and acculturative stress, (b) examined the determinants of acculturative stress among Latino immigrants in the U.S., and (c) provided a conceptual framework that can be used to specify the interactive effect of various factors on acculturative stress.Methods: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this review synthesized the results of thirty studies published between 2000 and 2015 that investigated the influence of several socio-demographic and cultural contexts on acculturative stress among Latino immigrants categorized using Family Stress Management (FSM) theory as a framework.Results: Studied highlighted several protectors from and risks to acculturative stress. Historical context protective factors included having a choice over the decision to migrate and social support; risks included discrimination, family left abroad, and fear of deportation. Economic context protective factors included higher income. The development context protective factors included English skills, years in the U.S., and being married; risks included being female. Cultural context protective factors included being culturally competent and acculturation; risks included family-cultural conflict and ethnic enclave pressures. Internal context protectors included post-immigration religious coping, church attendance, and family values.Implications: The results highlighted incorporating cultural aspects (i.e. family values and social support) in mental health practice with Latino immigrants. A less stressful integration experience can be achieved if age-related stressors and experiences of discrimination are acknowledged and the need for social support and harmonious family dynamics was prioritized in service plans.

T1  - CITY OF BLACK GOLD: OIL, ETHNICITY, AND THE MAKING OF MODERN KIRKUK
AN  - 2476863372
AB  - Stanford University Press, 2019 (xviii + 204 pages, bibliography, index, illustrations, map) $26.00 (paper) When the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk became a flashpoint in the 2017 Iraqi-Kurdish conflict, many in the Western foreign policy establishment claimed that history was repeating itself.

[...]Kirkuki cultural works that foregrounded oil in a field of urban modernity and civic identity ironically ended up providing traction for exclusivist ethno-national claims to the city.

The analysis of this process in an urban setting of oil production positions the book in a new literature on Gulf cities that have long been understood only according to rentier-state political models.

T1  - Authoritarian Neoliberalism, Radical Conservatism and Social Policy within the European Union: Croatia, Hungary and Poland
AN  - 2371529055
AB  - Exploring political and social policy developments in Croatia, Hungary and Poland, three EU member states, this article addresses the hegemonic position of authoritarianism, populism, conservatism and neoliberalism, albeit articulated differently in each state. All three countries are marked by modes of governmentality that combine heteronormative familialism, repatriarchialization, nationalism, ethnicized demographic renewal and anti‐immigrant sentiments. In each, a kind of layered social divestment is occurring, delivering a radical new vision of social reproduction and fundamental differentiations in terms of access to social citizenship between those seen as ‘deserving’ of support and those who are not, who are increasingly subjected to disciplinary measures. Although the degree of welfare retrenchment varies across the cases, the radical nature of restructuring, breaking down traditional notions of left and right on welfare, is suggestive of longer‐term restructurings not reliant on individual politicians or parties.

T1  - Deciphering the notion of a raceless nation: Racial harmony and discrimination in Puerto Rican society
AN  - 2358997426
AB  - This article critiques the idea of Puerto Rico as a raceless nation by tracing its sources and looking at the discourses of intellectual and political elites during the “nation-building” process in the first half of the twentieth century, discourses in which race was generally either distorted or overlooked. I first analyze three incidents in which black Puerto Ricans were denied entrance to elite social clubs in San Juan because of their race. These events suggest that the racelessness idea was intertwined with actual discriminatory practices and a broad structural racism. Second, I examine the role of academic and cultural institutions such as the University of Puerto Rico, the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña, and the División de Educación para la Comunidad in promoting the notion of racelessness. That can be seen as part of a broad denial of racial discrimination in the attempt to forge Puerto Rico as a white nation.

T1  - What factors explain anti-Muslim prejudice? An assessment of the effects of Muslim population size, institutional characteristics and immigration-related media claims
AN  - 2376776840
AB  - What factors explain majority members’ anti-Muslim prejudice? This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members’ negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration – our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies.

T1  - Is it really about values? Civic nationalism and migrant integration
AN  - 2358709974
AB  - Migrant integration is a pressing policy concern, and the perception that newcomers are not integrating has led to a growing backlash against migration. One outcome is ‘civic integration’ policies, according to which the most important mechanisms of integration are language training, employment counselling, and especially the inculcation of liberal-democratic values. Few authors, however, have addressed the fact that these policies are essentially civic nationalist ideology applied to migrants, and represent the most recent chapter in a long-standing debate over the relationship between majorities and minorities that focused on intra-state nationalist conflict during the 1990s. Civic integration policies reflect the self-representation of majorities, and are both politically and ontologically problematic. First, in many cases they seem best understood as a kind of symbolic politics that is more about who gets in than how they are integrated. Second, civic nationalism is based on a theory of nations and nationalism that treats these as solely ideological phenomena, and ignores the social bases of integration. ‘Shared values’ are a product of that process, not a mechanism for its achievement.

T1  - Peri-conflict peace: brokerage, development and illiberal ceasefires in Myanmar’s borderlands
AN  - 2355998448
AB  - Successive Myanmar governments have enlisted illiberal means in attempts to end the world’s oldest civil wars. Since the 1990s, state-led attempts at peace-building have offered ethnic armed groups limited political autonomy or institutional recognition. Many of the 1990s ceasefire agreements, and the new wave agreed since the transition to partial civilian rule in 2011, have instead sought to erode insurgent legitimacy and control over local populations through encroachment of state-led development initiatives and elite resource extraction rackets into restive regions. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted during periods of ceasefire in Kachin (1994–2011) and Karen States (2012–2019), this article explores how illiberal peace-building has inflamed tensions between ‘insurgent social order’ and the central state over who and how development is brokered and delivered. While illiberal peace sustains economic and political activity, attempts by the central state to cut insurgent social order out from the mediation and regulation of public goods can provoke intense grassroots conflict within insurgent groups and with the state. Violence looms as a proximate possibility in these contexts despite elite ceasefire, creating what we term ‘peri-conflict’ peace.

AB  - This article presents the social, economic, and political factors that contribute to the ongoing urbanization of the Nenets indigenous communities (“communities-in-transition”) in the Nenets Autonomous Region. Focusing on the preconditions for “indigenous flight” from traditional rural settlements to urban areas, the article analyzes key indicators—demographics, language proficiency, education level, and occupational sector, as well as social cohesion, interethnic relations, and political inclusion in the larger urban context—to describe the adaptation and integration processes of these new city dwellers. Based on the fieldwork in the region, the article also presents individual life strategies and career choices of indigenous youth and describes the role of gender in indigenous urbanization.

T1  - The Bolsonaro Election, Antiblackness, and Changing Race Relations in Brazil
AN  - 2358551820
AB  - We apply the concept of antiblackness and a Deleuzian approach to sociopolitical events to analyze Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 election in Brazil. Historically, Brazilians turned from overt expressions of antiblackness to subtler forms of racial prejudice, what Sérgio Buarque de Holanda (1956) called the “cordial man” who practiced a “gentlemanly” form of white supremacy. Recently, however, cordial racism has eroded in favor of more virulent and explosive manifestations of antiblackness that fueled the sociopolitical climate that enabled Bolsonaro's rise to power. We examine the antiblack backlash against race‐conscious laws and policies implemented during the Workers’ Party era (2002–16), showing a gradual shift toward more overt expressions of antiblackness that Bolsonaro wielded to political effect in his 2018 campaign.

T1  - Sikh Diaspora Nationalism in Canada
AN  - 2340239063
AB  - A collective memory of the pre‐colonial, colonial and post‐colonial periods in India underpins Sikh identity and mobilization for peaceful protest as well as militant activity. Developing within a dominant Hindu socio‐political milieu, Sikh nationalism of the twentieth and twenty‐first centuries can be viewed as reactive as much as it remained primordial and ethno‐religious in nature. Sikh nationalism among the diaspora Sikh community in Canada, which portrays a distinctive Sikh ethnic and national identity, as well as the accompanying call by many activists for the creation of an independent Sikh state (Khalistan) in India, saw a marked increase from the 1980s. Sikh diaspora nationalism in Canada has also nurtured a remarkable political and social mobilization for greater community awareness and political participation. An examination of Sikh diaspora nationalism reveals that ‘civic’ and ‘ethnic’ nationalism have become intertwined, existing in parallel. Canadian multiculturalism helped both to sustain the movement and to tame the associated militancy, opening up space for debate and accommodation. Canadian Sikhs have demonstrated remarkable economic and political success in creating a vibrant community in Canada, which is often overlooked by the mainstream media.

T1  - Political violence and insurgencies in the Middle East: Social movements, diffusion of armed conflicts, and proxy wars
AN  - 2324863880
AB  - Political violence is a key theme in understanding the historical and contemporary Middle East characterized by different religious, social, and political revolts. It is thus salient to analyze why political violence emerges, how it is diffused, and why it takes different configurations during insurgencies. In order to study these questions, this article establishes three analytical frameworks: interdependency among violence and social movements, diffusion of violence, and proxy warfare. First, I argue that political violence and mobilization are interdependent processes which are shaped by personal, local, and historical dynamics. Secondly, violence is more likely to spread among the societies displaying similar political, religious, or ethnic characteristics, in particular, if there are individuals and militant organizations who take it as a model in order to affect the conflict. Finally, this violence, which depends on local and regional factors, often intersects with global politics and its path is altered as a result.

T1  - Virgins, Terrorists, and Ten Children: Immigrants' Humorous Play with Ethnic Stereotypes in Bonding with Danes in the Workplace
AN  - 2312132983
AB  - Drawing on fieldwork in a multi‐ethnic workplace (an industrial kitchen in Denmark), this article explores immigrants' self‐directed ethnic humor in collegial relationships with Danes as it spontaneously develops and plays out in everyday work settings. Approaching ethnic humor from a symbolic interactionist perspective rather than adopting the dominant conflict approach, this article emphasizes the bonding functions of ethnic humor. The article argues that immigrants' engagement in playful behavior with ethnic stereotypes in interactions with Danes is a form of “impression management” in which they defuse ethnic stereotypes and dissociate themselves from them by building joking relationships in the workplace with Danes.

T1  - Creating ‘international communities’ in southern Spain: Self-segregation and ‘institutional whiteness’ in Swedish lifestyle migration
AN  - 2293678674
AB  - This article examines intra-European relations in narratives of Swedish lifestyle migrants living permanently or part-time on the Spanish Sun Coast. It pays particular attention to the complexities of Swedish migrants’ cultural identities and patterns of self-segregation in the Spanish society by investigating the following questions: How do boundaries of social networks that Swedish lifestyle migrants participate in, or interrelate, with a sense of ‘likeness’? In what ways are the formation of these ‘international’ networks mediated through ideas of cultural similarity and parallel difference, and how do such notions both override and uphold boundaries tied to social, cultural and racial divisions? It is argued that the formation of so-called ‘international communities’ on the Spanish Sun Coast tend to cluster mainly north-western European lifestyle migrants, which calls for an analysis of ‘orientations’ towards a certain ‘likeness’, and the function of these spaces and communities as spaces of ‘institutional whiteness’ that work as a ‘meeting point’ where some bodies tend to feel comfortable as they already belong here. The social and cultural boundaries that surround these communities destabilises the idea of a common, culturally homogeneous European identity and display intra-European racial divisions mediated through discourses of cultural differences. What appears is a south–north divide built upon a deep Swedish postcolonial identification with Anglo Saxon and north-western European countries and cultures, and a parallel dis-identification with (the former colonial powers in) southern Europe.

T1  - Writing Against Integration: Danish Imaginaries of Culture, Race and Belonging
AN  - 2268640581
AB  - The article addresses some of the problems related to the concept of integration, which has been used (and abused) in Denmark since the 1990s to discuss socio-economic, cultural and religious challenges related to the everyday life of ethnic minorities. The concept of integration is not innocent but promotes both a specific conceptualisation of Danish society and a problematisation of immigrant minorities and their relationship to the indigenous majority. Based on the ethnographic studies conducted in Denmark in recent decades, the article attempts to disentangle the dominant social imaginary by outlining three scenarios: 'welfare reciprocity', 'host and guests' and 'the Danes as an indigenous people'. These scenarios consolidate an asymmetrical relationship between majorities and minorities because they simultaneously cast integration as desirable and impossible. Finally, inspired by Lila Abu-Lughod's seminal article 'writing against culture', the article suggests strategies of 'writing against integration' in order to regain the critical potential of academic analysis.

T1  - Class, race - and place: immigrants' self-perceptions on inclusion, belonging and opportunities in Stockholm and Barcelona
AN  - 2264599657
AB  - Based on eighty-one in-depth interviews with immigrants and stakeholders performed in Stockholm and Barcelona, this article examines whether the relationship to place can mitigate the negative effects of rejection that racialized immigrants and minorities perceive from the ethnic majority society. The immigrant respondents' perceptions and lived experiences of exclusion and discrimination lend support to the argument that it is necessary to link race and class in order to understand the particular "immigrant disadvantage," but also reflect how attachment to the city or neighbourhood where they live can contribute to a sense of belonging: the respondents overall feel more included in Barcelona, where every day interethnic contacts are more frequent than in Stockholm.

AB  - Ramstedt focuses on the progress of democracy in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi's) election was seen by many international observers, scholars, journalists, and politicians as the very sign of Indonesia's successful transition from Suharto's autocratic, centralist, and brutally repressive "New Order" regime to a decentralised participatory democracy, in which "pluralism and respect of diversity" can co-exist with Islam and "the existential threat mandated through the perceived connection between religion and ethnicity, which is an underlying cause of ethno-cultural conflict, can be set aside." It was Jokowi's persona just as much as his political programme that was providing for such hope and enthusiasm.

T1  - <i>Leitkultur</i> debates as civic integration in North-Western Europe: The nationalism of ‘values’ and ‘good citizenship’
AN  - 2262647160
AB  - Political responses to ethno-religious diversity often include the idea of a common culture or (core) values, e.g., the German Leitkultur and comparable concepts in Denmark and the Netherlands. These intellectual debates underlie and inform different types of civic integration policies. Their structure demonstrates the discursive connection between the ostensibly liberal and universal components of the latter – which are often heralded as signs of waning nationalism – with strong emphases on identity and cultural identity. Hence, each debate concerns (1) forms of societal integration, oriented towards (2) forms of civicness, which are nonetheless (3) also cultural, and (4) national. Within this common structure, variation exists as to what should be ‘common,’ what it takes to share it, and the very point of doing so. Advocacy of Leitkultur as so many attempts to civilise newcomers – or exclude those who are unamenable to such efforts – reflects the continuing core of nationalistic ambition despite novel semantic content. This ambition, which equivocates between dubious ‘manifest’ functions – educating minorities, reminding majorities of forgotten heritage – fails also to serve ‘latent’ functions of trust and solidarity building.

T1  - Reactionary Tribalism Redux: Right-Wing Populism and De-Democratization
AN  - 2558593126
AB  - This article addresses the question of whether the social impacts, especially increased socioeconomic inequality, and formalization of democracy generated by the neoliberal economization of politics is an important albeit not singular driver of resurgent ethnocracial populism and illiberal democracy.

T1  - Black South Africans' Attitudes toward African Immigrants between 2008 and 2016
AN  - 2244088440
AB  - Instead of the term "xenophobia," the dislike of immigrants, the term "Afrophobia" is increasingly being used to describe black South Africans' hatred of the African other. This study analyzed nine rounds of the South African Social Attitudes Survey (2008-2016) in order to assess the evidence for Afrophobia among black South Africans. The evidence of Afrophobia among black South Africans is unconvincing. Black South Africans evinced different attitudes toward different groups of foreigners. Instead of simplistic explanations for anti-immigrant sentiment, there is a need for a more detailed and nuanced analysis of why some immigrant groups are more disliked than others.

T1  - Uyghur Graduates' Ethnicity in their Dislocated Life Experience: Employment Expectations, Choices and Obstacles
AN  - 2185590483
AB  - This article is a case study that examines the contradictory implications of the dislocated educational policy for ethnic minority students from Xinjiang. The qualitative data is drawn from a longitudinal research project from 2010 to 2013 in China and Australia. The informants are a group of soon-to-be Uyghur university graduates from the Xinjiang Interior Class. The article explores their perceptions of employment, including expectations, choices of career planning and obstacles in job-seeking. The analytical concepts of "everyday life" (Karner, 2007) and "dislocated context" (Oommen, 1996) inform the theoretical perspective for exploring the Uyghur graduates' ethnicity in their dislocated life experience. The article argues that the Uyghur graduates' perceptions of employment manifest in conjunction with their de-ethnicisation and re-ethnicisation (Gill, 2000). Graduates are keen to forgo ethnic boundaries and actively seek quality employment opportunities in society, but they also activate their ethnic consciousness, and quietly resist everyday inequalities when faced with disadvantages in the job market.

T1  - Mapping Racial and Ethnic Studies in Canada: Retrospective and Prospective Views of Canadian Ethnic Studies Chairs
AN  - 2303166242
AB  - Canada has always been diverse with respect to 'race' and ethnicity. In 1901, only three decades after Confederation, the English and French comprised 57% and 31% of the Canadian population respectively (Coats 1931, 134). Thus, 12% of Canada's population were non-French and non-British with the majority being other Europeans such as German, Dutch, Scandinavian, Russian, and many others. However, quite significantly, 25% of the non-French and non-British were racialized minorities and these included First Nations, Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks. Thus, the claims and discourse of many publications in recent decades of "the changing face of Canada" are based on an imagined early Canada being white, and English and French (deux nations). The early scholarship on Canada's already established racial and ethnic diversity essentially had a static conceptualization of ethnicity (Burnet 1976) and this was exemplified in the work of Hughes (1943) and Porter (1965, 1975). Jean Burnet's critique fostered in a more dynamic notion of ethnicity and conceptualized it in terms of social relations. In a special issue of the journal Sociological Focus, which examined studies in Canada, Burnet (1976) examined, through this dynamic lens, the policy of multiculturalism within a bilingual framework. It should be noted that this special issue also featured many other prominent sociologists who examined topics related to immigration, race and ethnicity and these included Crysdale (1976), Clairmont and Wien (1976) and Richmond (1976). That same year Palmer (1976), who was one of the early editors of Canadian Ethnic Studies, provided a comparative analysis of immigration and ethnicity in Canada and the United States. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, college and university courses on 'race' and ethnicity were standard fare with many of the popular textbooks being used with titles such as: Identities: The Impact of Ethnicity on Canadian Society (Isajiw 1977); Minority Canadians: Ethnic Groups (Krauter and Davis 1978); The Canadian Ethnic Mosaic: A Quest for Identity (Driedger 1978); Ethnicity in Canada: Theoretical Perspectives (Anderson and Frideres 1981); and Racial Minorities in Multicultural Canada (Li and Bolaria 1983). After this the floodgates were opened and the substantive area of ethnic studies started to flourish in Canada with a generation of scholars, most of whom were American- and British-trained, coming to Canada to study 'race', ethnicity, and immigration and to train a new generation of Canadian students. At the same time, the journal Canadian Ethnic Studies/Études éthniques au Canada was born in 1968, followed very shortly by the establishment of the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association/ Société canadienne d'études éthniques. In the following decades of the '80s, '90s, and 2000s, the literature in these areas exploded as scholars wrote about immigration, different ethnic/racial groups and the dynamics of their experiences in Canadian society. Over the past several decades, there has been a continual literature that examines race and ethnicity in Canada from a more general and critical perspective, and recently these include the summarizing work of Henry and Tator (2010), Hier and Bolaria (2012), Satzewich and Liodakis (2013) and Fleras (2017). Last year, in the fall of 2018, the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association held its 25th conference in Banff, Alberta with the theme of Immigration, Ethnic Mobilities, and Diasporic Communities in a Transnational World.

T1  - United States: Racial Resentment, Negative Partisanship, and Polarization in Trump’s America
AN  - 2159538432
AB  - Growing racial, ideological, and cultural polarization within the American electorate contributed to the shocking victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Using data from American National Election Studies surveys, we show that Trump’s unusually explicit appeals to racial and ethnic resentment attracted strong support from white working-class voters while repelling many college-educated whites along with the overwhelming majority of nonwhite voters. However, Trump’s campaign exploited divisions that have been growing within the electorate for decades because of demographic and cultural changes in American society. The 2016 presidential campaign also reinforced another longstanding trend in American electoral politics: the rise of negative partisanship, that is voting based on hostility toward the opposing party and its leaders. We conclude with a discussion of the consequences of deepening partisan and affective polarization for American democracy and the perceptions by both experts and the public of an erosion in its quality.

T1  - The Russian elite's imperial nationalism and the Russian society: The emergence of a grand consensus
AN  - 2148532634
AB  - This article uses various Russian elite and mass survey data to explain, from a post‐structuralist perspective, the ongoing confrontation between Russia and the West. It argues that the Russian elite, in the wake of the 2013–2014 Ukrainian crisis, opted for imperial nationalism, different from either ethnic or civic varieties of nationalism, because it best suited its goals. Imperial identification eases ethnic tension within Russia and rallies the nation around its government in the face of perceived external threats. This choice finds an enthusiastic support at the mass level, contributing to rising happiness in spite of economic hardship due to rising national pride. The article also briefly discusses some implications of this momentous shift in identity politics.

T1  - Muslims in Sri Lankan language politics: A study of Tamil- and English-medium education
AN  - 2092683666
AB  - Sri Lanka is a conflict-ridden postcolonial nation-state that was ravaged by a civil war. Largely excluded from mainstream representations of the ethnic conflict, Muslims constitute the country’s second largest minority group. In contrast to Sinhalas and Tamils, they define their ethnic identities on the basis of religion rather than language. In this article, I draw on research at a multilingual government school to explore how Muslim teachers and students made sense of Tamil- and English-medium education in relation to ethnic, religious, and class differences. I investigate how Tamil-medium Muslim teachers responded to critiques of their speech by asserting that their heterogeneous linguistic practices were inextricably connected to their distinct ethno-religious identities. Muslim students’ lack of fit with the ethnolinguistic affiliations presupposed by the school enabled them to embrace English-medium education. However, the English bilingual program complicated Muslims’ narratives of identity by underscoring the relevance of English to class dispositions. I argue that English impacts the fraught relations of Tamil and Sinhala to ethnopolitical identities and mediates everyday social relations.

T1  - Environment, Urbanization, and Public Health: The Bubonic Plague Epidemic of 1912 in San Juan, Puerto Rico
AN  - 2150384919
AB  - In this article I focus on the nexus of urbanization, the environment and public health that was exposed by the 1912 bubonic plague epidemic in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I utilize the concept of "urban health penalty," developed by demographic historians of the industrial revolution in Europe, to account for the declining health of the working class in cities. While in Europe poor health among the urban poor was associated with industrialization, I argue that in San Juan chaotic, unplanned urbanization reflected the effects of colonialism. I further examine how the epidemic exacerbated the class and racial divisions that contributed to the disastrous living conditions, and speculate as to whether the environmental neglect of the neighborhood by authorities was due to the fact that it was home to many poor people of African descent. I also highlight the varying understandings of the causes and appropriate responses to plague.Alternate abstract:En este artículo me centro en el nexo de la urbanización, el medio ambiente y la salud pública que fue expuesto por la epidemia de peste bubónica de 1912 en San Juan, Puerto Rico. Utilizo el concepto de "urban health penalty" desarrollado por los historiadores demográficos de la revolución industrial en Europa, para explicar la disminución de la salud de la clase trabajadora en las ciudades. Mientras que en Europa la mala salud de los pobres urbanos estaba asociada con la industrialización, sostengo que en San Juan la urbanización caótica y no planeada reflejaba los efectos del colonialismo. Examino además cómo la epidemia exacerbó las divisiones de clase y raza que contribuyeron a las desastrosas condiciones de vida y pregunto si la negligencia ambiental del vecindario por parte de las autoridades se debía al hecho de que era el hogar de muchos pobres de ascendencia africana. También resalto los diversos entendimientos de las causas y las respuestas apropiadas a la peste.

T1  - Culture, ethnicity and territoriality: a cultural history of imagined land in Manipur, 1950s-1990s
AN  - 2016548499
AB  - Creative literature and audio-visuals provide alternative sources to archival documents for understanding the cultural history of land. This paper is a small beginning in using creative sources in different languages of Manipur. My analysis suggests that the association between land and ethnicity is a recent phenomenon. In the late 1950s and the 1960s, creative artists represented land as aesthetic symbol for universal emotions. In the 1970s, land was de-linked from political imagination and appeared in the form of leikai (residential address). The 1980s registered the emergence of complex social forces such as ethnic nationalism and a romanticised folk culture. The most remarkable development was the exclusive use of land as a symbol of discrete identities and ethnic homelands. Whereas the ethnic gulf widened between the meiteis of the valley and the tribals of the hill areas, the struggle between the hill tribes intensified in the 1990s.

T1  - Curricular Alienation
AN  - 2024710660
AB  - The stories found in history textbooks are profound statements about how nations see themselves. Textbooks that exclude certain groups alienate these children, leading to educational disengagement. The Netherlands is known internationally for its tolerance and multiculturalism, particularly toward immigrants, and sees these elements as critical to their national identity. However, historical and contemporary policies and social attitudes toward immigrants reveal levels of racism and xenophobia not unlike their European peers. This article examines how immigrants, multiculturalism, and tolerance are represented in all Dutch primary school history textbooks published between 1980 and 2011. I find textbooks depict immigrant groups as culturally different outsiders from underdeveloped, poor, and violent nations who cause problems for the Dutch society that benevolently allows them entry. Textbooks fail to meaningfully address discrimination in the Netherlands, suggesting that immigrants’ failure to integrate is due to cultural differences, which will alienate immigrant students encountering these texts and white students from immigrant peers. Findings are of relevance to all nations with student immigrant populations, particularly those experiencing increasing anti-immigrant sentiment or the rise of far right politicians.

T1  - 'Am I sexually abused?' Consent in a coach-athlete lesbian relationship
AN  - 2015500878
AB  - Elite-athlete Karin was 17 years old when the considerably older team coach Selma became her girlfriend. Responding to calls to prevent harm and sexual abuse in sport, this study represents Karin's story, investigates how she makes sense of her coach-athlete sexual relationship, and analyses what can be learnt about consent. Although sexual consent is often the defining criterion of sexual abuse, consent is rarely explicitly defined or its social implications examined. Moreover, there are no studies on coach-athlete lesbian or gay relationships despite sexual minority vulnerability. The interview with Karin was analysed using narrative case study methods; represented as a short story and discussed in reference to sexual consent theory. The analysis outlines contextual factors conditioning the negotiation of consent and problematises heteronormative, gendered perpetrator and victim stereotypes. Secrecy, alienation and isolation is recognised, extending into additional vulnerability inflicted on socially problematic and atypical coach-athlete relationships. In conclusion, social implications of consent are more complex than yes/no to sex or inherent incapability to consent. Consent is multi-layered, alternately absent and present; an ongoing process that includes compromises, contradictions and (re)negotiations influenced by structure and agency. Further research examining a diversity of sexual experiences among majorities and minorities is proposed.

T1  - Ethnicity and Multi-party Democracy: The Nigerian Experience
AN  - 2110458815
AB  - Nigeria’s fame and strength derives from its pluralist nature as it has a population of over 140 million and over 370 ethnic groups with diverse cultures, among other features. These portray the beauty of the country to the outside world and successive Nigerian governments have not ceased to preach the nation’s desire to forge unity in diversity. However, the reality on ground is that ethnic consciousness, chauvinism, ethnic factionalisation and divisive politics have overshadowed the desire for nationhood to the detriment of the corporate existence of the country coupled with the adoption of multi-party democratic practice which has tended to deepen the polarisation. Several crises following from the above include: insecurity of lives and property, corruption, tribalism and nepotism, political and constitutional instabilities, ethnic and religious crises, violent competition for state power and public offices. These issues have impacted negatively on the country’s development process. This paper argues that Nigeria’s quest for development is tied solidly to a responsible and committed political leadership that would effectively manage the problems posed by ethnicity and promote genuine democracy. Thus, the paper calls for greater national consideration above parochial ethnic and party affiliations.

T1  - Agitations and Intergroup Relations in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria
AN  - 2063387954
AB  - This paper proffers answers to questions that concern the changing contexts and results of agitations, and how resource-oriented agitations in the Niger Delta influence inter-group relations in the country in relationship to its impact on conflict transformation and nationbuilding efforts. This also paper maintains that the agitations by various ethnic groups in the Niger Delta, despite the responses of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the grievances of the region are usually fuelled by the quest for power symmetry, and therefore, there is need for an indigenous, organic, and long-term sustainable nonviolent process of conflict transformation and peace building aimed at a constructive holistic change.

T1  - Constructive Resistance in Northern Kurdistan: Exploring the Peace, Development and Resistance Nexus
AN  - 1969025453
AB  - Cultural and linguistic repression of Kurdish ethnic identity rests at the heart of the conflict between the Turkish state and the Kurdish movement in Turkey's Kurdish region, also known as Northern Kurdistan. Inspired by Peet and Hartwick's conceptualisation of alternative development, combined with Gandhi's idea of the constructive programme and Galtung's conceptualisation of positive peace, this article investigates intersections between peace, development and resistance. The discussion is informed and developed by illuminating two empirical cases of what will be argued should be seen as 'constructive resistance' conducted by the Kurdish movement. Both cases seek to undermine repressive Turkish assimilation policies. This article shows how social movements, through constructive resistance practices, can be understood as central actors in processes of social and political transformation, termed 'self-organised development'.

T1  - The White Working Class and Voter Turnout in U.S. Presidential Elections, 2004 to 2016
AN  - 2023435352
AB  - Through an analysis of the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 Current Population Surveys as well as the 2004 through 2016 General Social Surveys, this article investigates class differences and patterns of voter turnout for the last four U.S. presidential elections. After developing some support for the claim that a surge of white, working-class voters emerged in competitive states in 2016, a portrait of class differences on political matters among white, non-Hispanic, eligible voters between 2004 and 2016 is offered to assess the electoral consequences of this surge. These latter results are consistent with the claim that racial prejudice, anti-immigrant sentiment, concerns about economic security, and frustration with government responsiveness may have led many white, working-class voters to support an outsider candidate who campaigned on these themes. However, these same results give no support to the related claim that the white working class changed its positions on these matters in response to the 2016 primary election campaign or in the months just before the general election.

T1  - Adjusting to Immigrants in Two Midwestern Communities: Same Outcome, Different Process
AN  - 1981716368
AB  - Objective
This article examines the distinct processes of accommodation to immigrants in two similar small towns in Iowa. Ethnic conflict and contact theories predict that the processes would be similar in these towns, but their experiences demonstrate otherwise.
Methods
The study traces the histories of these towns and uses surveys, focus groups, and interviews to detail the process of accommodation in these communities.
Results
In both towns, white/Anglo residents came to accommodate their new neighbors and accept immigrants as full members of their communities, but the processes were unique in each place. In one community, earlier exposure to a small group of Laotian refugees gave residents and officials valuable experience with diversity. Further, this town was pushed toward acceptance when an outside group spread falsehoods.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that adjusting to ethnic diversity is a long-term process that is unique to a community's experience with diversity.

T1  - Creating inclusive identity narratives through participatory action research
AN  - 1960283128
AB  - This paper describes the process and outcomes of Voices, a participatory action research project aimed to disrupt divisive ethnic identity narratives among youth living amidst protracted ethnic conflict. The project took place in the Garo Hills region of Northeast India, a site of protracted ethnic conflict. Moving away from crisis-based approaches, this paper explores the conflict transformative potential of participatory action research, specifically its effectiveness in facilitating civic engagement across ethnic lines. The findings indicate that young people's involvement in the project afforded them an opportunity to engage with local community concerns outside of polarized ethnic identity narratives. This involvement facilitated three critical outcomes: engagement in social critique, reconfiguration of a more inclusive researcher identity, and adoption of a language of possibility. Based on these findings, it is argued that opportunities for critical community engagement could interrupt divisive ethnic identity narratives and provide turning points for youth to reimagine inclusive social identities.

AB  - Human rights, ethnic conflict, democratization, colonialism, and development--many upper-level political science courses contain content that is understood differently across cultural contexts. Equipping students to appreciate diverse perspectives on these issues is a challenge that requires creative pedagogical strategies, regardless of whether all students come from the same region of the United States or the class has more than half international students. Professors in both environments have the complex task of guiding students to navigate disparate viewpoints. This article demonstrates the pedagogical potential of an integrated approach to student-led class modules based on a two-semester experiment using a Global Politics of Human Rights course at a small liberal arts college with a large population of international students. One section of the same course was taught in each semester with identical course material but with two different sets of student participants. After situating the challenges and the strategy within the growing literature on active learning, the article provides basic details of the pedagogical approach and three examples of the modules. It concludes with methods for assessing the effectiveness of student-led class modules.

T1  - The language of conflict: The relationship between linguistic vitality and conflict intensity
AN  - 1939388419
AB  - Intergroup conflicts represent a risk of social instability and even violence. Understanding the reasons that push group members to adopt a certain level of conflict intensity is of the utmost importance. In the hope of shedding new light into this phenomenon, this paper explores how ethnic conflict intensity may be influenced by linguistic vitality, the social health of a language. The paper presents a theoretical model in which low and high levels of linguistic vitality are presented as being linked to lower conflict intensity than moderate vitality levels. The results of multilevel modeling lend support to this hypothesis for language-based ethnic tensions in a general context and, more precisely, within countries.

T1  - Conceptualizing urban ontological security: ‘Being-in-the-city’ and its social and spatial dimensions
AN  - 1952105619
AB  - Urban security has become a central concern in cities around the world, specifically with the rise of ethnic, religious, race, and immigration conflict as well as terrorism. Here, Jabareen et al discuss the conceptualization of 'ontological security' by Laing (1969, 1973) and Giddens (1991, 1996) to conceptualize urban ontological security.

T1  - The "silver bullet" to good policing: a mirage: An analysis of the effects of political ideology and ethnic identity on procedural justice
AN  - 1948718225
AB  - Purpose 
Procedural justice (PJ) during police-citizen interactions has often been portrayed as a "silver bullet" to good policing, as it could function as a means to gain trust, voluntary obedience and public cooperation. PJ research is based on the assumption that there exists "true fairness." However, it is still unclear what people actually mean when they evaluate the police as "fair" in surveys. By focusing the analysis to underexplored aspects of PJ, namely, the identity and political antecedents of the attribution of procedural fairness, the authors highlight the social and ideological reasons that influence people's perceptions of police fairness. The paper aims to discuss these issues. 
Design/methodology/approach 
In order to explain the attribution of fairness of police, the study comprises a range of independent variables organized into five overarching domains: prior experience with police, victimization, socioeconomic status and (disadvantaged) context of residence, ethnicity and political attitudes and punitive values. The analysis is based on a representative sample of France, as well as a booster sample of a deprived, urban province (Seine-Saint-Denis) in order to better incorporate ethnic effects into the model (March 2011;n =1.498, 18+). 
Findings 
The present study finds support for the notion that aggressive policing policies (police-initiated contacts, e.g. identification checks, road stops) negatively impacts attributions of fairness to police. In addition, the findings show that attributions of fairness are not only interactional (i.e. related to what police do in any given situation) or related to individual cognitive phenomena, but for the most part pertain to broader social and political explanations. Political and ethnic cleavages are the key to understanding how police are judged by the public. The findings therefore question the nature of what is actually measured when fairness is attributed to police, finding that more punitive and conservative respondents tend to assess the police as fair. The authors find that the attribution of fairness seems to correspond to upholding the existing social order. 
Research limitations/implications 
This study has limitations inherent to any cross-sectional survey and the findings pertain only to a single country (France). Furthermore, the authors did not analyze all possible confounding variables to perceived fairness. 
Social implications 
The findings pose a practical problem for police and government to implement, as the authors ultimately find that there is no single recipe, or "silver bullet," for being deemed fair across all social, ethnic and political groups - and, of course, the expectations of one group might conflict with those of another. 
Originality/value 
The study demonstrates that existing theory needs to better incorporate those explanations of fairness which extend beyond interactional processes with police, and refer instead to the social and political cleavages in society.

T1  - Interpreting conflict and integration through the reciprocity lens: mobility and settlement in a historical perspective on the Sierra Leonean coast
AN  - 1924017126
AB  - In recent years, Sierra Leone has witnessed intense population movements. During the civil war (1991-2002), many populations fled the fighting zones of the interior to take refuge on the coast. Since the conflict ended, new populations have reached the coastal area with the hope of accessing economic opportunities in the fishing business. Mobility, along with changing sociopolitical and economic conditions, has generated conflict between immigrants and Sherbro populations, who consider themselves autochthonous and deny migrants the freedom to access political and land rights. The paper argues that present dynamics of conflicts are rooted in long-term patterns of settlement and relationships of reciprocity between groups. Relations between migrants and local populations are grounded in a sociocultural idiom that implies the institutionalization of practices of reciprocity between local inhabitants (hosts) and later settlers (strangers). The host/stranger reciprocity system is an emic model of cultural action embedded in historical and power relations between groups. It implies the progressive integration of strangers into the host society. This paper highlights how, in a situation of conflict, long-established social relationships between groups are reevaluated with reference to norms of integration and reciprocity. The paper draws on Sherbro oral traditions to show how social memories about interethnic relations are reframed with reference to values and expectations of reciprocity, in order to explain the recent conflict that opposes Sherbros to immigrants. Sherbros use oral traditions to interpret these tensions in a long-term perspective, thereby expressing their own view on settlement, conflict and integration.

T1  - Organizing the 'people's community': the NSDAP and the 'ethnic Germans' in Nazi-occupied territories
AN  - 1923054899
AB  - This article refers to recent scholarly debates on the term 'people's community' (Volksgemeinschaft), which throughout the Third Reich remained rather vague and encompassed often contradictory purposes. It deals with the relations between the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, NSDAP) and some of the 'ethnic German' (volksdeutsche) organizations to exemplify how German society should be transformed into a 'people's community' after 1933. Thus, it is necessary to analyse the 'people's community' not by asking whether or not its different purposes were realized, but by examining its functions in the Nazi regime. This functional analysis of the 'people's community' focuses on the NSDAP and its relations with 'ethnic German' organizations after 1933, primarily in Nazi-occupied territories during the Second World War. First, the article describes the NSDAP's efforts to align the 'Germans abroad' (Auslandsdeutsche) after the seizure of power and to organize the German Front (Deutsche Front) in the Saar territories in 1934/35-an experience serving as a blueprint for the relations between the NSDAP and 'ethnic German' organizations during the Second World War. Second, it evaluates the creation of the Ethnic German Community (Volksdeutsche Gemeinschaft) in the General Government and its efforts to organize 'ethnic Germans'. Third, it interprets the foundation of the German People's Community (Deutsche Volksgemeinschaft) in Lorraine and its ongoing attempts to establish a racial hierarchy of 'ethnic Germans' over the autochthonous French population. Fourth, it looks at the connection between the Germanization of Lower Styria and the launch of the Styrian Homeland Union (Steirischer Heimatbund) as an 'ethnic German' movement. The article argues that the NSDAP's operational routines regarding both the German population and the 'ethnic Germans' living in the occupied territories shaped the 'people's community'.

AN  - 1868553893
AB  - Second generation Filipino Americans (SGFAs) are more likely than other ethnic groups to be depressed and engage in risk behaviors. I discuss challenges SGFAs face with particular focus on the intersection of colonial mentality and intergenerational family conflict. In-depth interviews were conducted with thirty SGFAs. Narratives revealed evidence of both colonial debt, a form of colonial mentality or sense of gratitude for "civilizing" their indigenous culture, and family indebtedness to first generation parents. Combined with a strong inclination to assimilate, the weight of this indebtedness has had a detrimental effect on SGFAs emotional well being.

T1  - Human integration through Olympism education: a pragmatic engagement of youths in a war-torn society
AN  - 1805980418
AB  - This paper delineates the findings of a mixed methods study that investigated how Olympism education could strengthen competencies of human integration through delivery of physical, social, and critical literacy and conflict resolution literacy. The study introduced a curriculum model integrating Olympism values and conflict resolution strategies for the purpose of facilitating human integration. This integrated curriculum model was then tested among a group of young students who represent the two main ethnic groups Sinhalese and Tamils, in a war-torn society in Sri-Lanka. The intervention of this study provided pragmatic involvement for young students as the representatives of the next generation, in order to teach them the convergence and contradictions of perceptions of social reform ideals through sport. Results revealed that conflict resolution strategies combined with Olympism education integrated curriculum intervention significantly improved young students' conflict resolution competencies, regardless of their gender or ethnicity. This study demonstrated significant gains in the ability of young students to learn about human integration through learning about Olympism within sport and physical education lessons, in regards to effective conflict resolution.

T1  - Labour, gender and ethnicities in the 'heart of Manila'
AN  - 1798777163
AB  - Quiapo, the 'heart of Manila', like most cities in the developing world, responds to and negotiates with transnational processes in the way its inhabitants arrange local labour market conditions. Quiapo presents a unique case where the informal economy of pirated global media products is hinged on the complexities of gender relations, ethnic politics and even religion within Philippine society. Given the increase in unemployment, and thus the expansion of the informal economy, piracy has become a conduit for socio-economic changes intersecting with the culturally specific economy of Quiapo's social history. One of these changes is the gendered division of labour in two areas of Quiapo: Hidalgo and Carriedo. On the other hand, piracy reinforces deeply entrenched tensions characterised by religious and ethnic divides. Piracy in Quiapo, as a fascinating terrain of Manile...os' urban experience, has significant implications for the slow but complex transformations that equally refashion the global and the local.

T1  - Community planning and urban design in contested places. Some insights from Belfast
AN  - 2168913693
AB  - Although social conflict due to the presence of different groups divided by cultural, religious or ethnic issues plagues many contemporary cities, community and participatory planning methods still pay little attention to segregation in contested spaces as a specific matter of concern. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap through the development of a novel tool to be implemented during community planning processes in contested cities, particularly in (visual) mapping processes. The pilot area for developing the lexicon has been selected within the city of Belfast, which has been struggling for years with problems related to inter-religious sectarian conflicts. The material effects on the urban structure of the long process of defensive planning during the so-called Troubles and within the post-conflicts peace programmes have been investigated by analysing urban artefacts including edges, borders, barriers, doors, visual control points. The paper suggests that a simple, recognizable lexicon may contribute to honing community planning methods in contested places by integrating the traditional methodology of visual mapping with a tailored taxonomy of elements of urban conflict, which may be used at many stages of the planning process, including developing a visual map, design and planning, and developing and implementing an action plan.

T1  - Manhood Deprived and (Re)constructed during Conflicts and International Prosecutions: The Curious Case of the Prosecutor v. Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta et al.
AN  - 1790153203
AB  - Recent case law on sexual violence crimes heard before the ad hoc international criminal tribunals and courts, that interpret them in connection with ethnic conflict, raises the question of which acts can be defined as sexual violence. The International Criminal Court (ICC), in the situation of Kenya, does not regard acts of forced nudity, forcible circumcision and penile amputation as sexual violence when they are motivated by ethnic prejudice and intended to demonstrate the cultural superiority of one tribe over another. The Court argues that not every act of violence that targets parts of the body commonly associated with sexuality should be considered an act of sexual violence. This recent interpretation of what counts as sexual violence provides another example of the complicity of international criminal law institutions in the ongoing construction process of female subordination. The ICC, in the Kenya situation, implicitly confirms the mutilation of female agency by interpreting penile amputation as a kind of power game between males, and by instrumentalizing the male sexual organ as an indicator of masculinity and manhood.

T1  - Reflections on conducting research on the 'war on terror': religious identity, subjectivity and emotions
AN  - 2008945148
AB  - In recent years there has been an increase in literature which has explored the insider/outsider position through ethnic identities. However, there remains a neglect of religious identities, even though it could be argued that religious identities have become increasingly important through being prominent in international issues such as the 'war on terror' and the Middle East conflict. Through drawing on the concept of subjectivity, I reflect on research I conducted on the impact of the 'war on terror' on British Muslims. I explore the space between the insider/outsider position demonstrating how my various subjectivities - the 'non-Islamic appearance I', the 'Muslim I', the 'personal I', the 'exploring I', the 'Kashmiri I' or the 'Pakistani I', the 'status I' and the 'outsider I' - assisted in establishing trust, openness and commonality. I conclude by demonstrating how the 'emotional I' allowed me to manage my own emotions and participants emotions.

T1  - How ordinary people view Muslim group rights in Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany: significant 'gaps' between majorities and Muslims?
AN  - 2076967975
AB  - Taking four countries-Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany-with distinct state approaches and public debates over accommodating Muslims, we study the views of ordinary people from the majority and Muslim populations on Muslim group rights. We compare their responses to questions on mosque-building, teachers wearing religious symbols, and religious classes in schools, to determine whether there is a significant 'gap' between the majority and Muslim minorities. We find highly significant 'gaps' between the majorities and Muslims over Muslim group rights in all countries, with the majorities less supportive. Importantly, it is a shift by the majority population against Muslim group rights that produces this 'gap' as the question moves from provision for Christians to Muslims, while Muslims hold similar views over rights for Christians and their own religion. In Britain and Germany, the two countries where church/state relations privilege Christianity over other religions, majorities especially support Christian over Muslim group rights. The British findings are remarkable, because a country which substantially grants and has the most supportive public debate for Muslim group rights, produces the largest 'gaps' between its majority and Muslims. We think this is due to political context, where in contrast to the Netherlands, there is no outlet for political opposition to Muslim group rights.

T1  - Conflict & Community: Twin Tensions in Becoming a Multiethnic Congregation
AN  - 1768536683
AB  - This in-depth case study investigates the religious, ethnic, and social conflicts that exist between two groups co-located in the same congregation. A diocesan cost-based merger brought together two religio-ethnic communities that were formerly housed in separate parishes. One group already had their congregation in the existing building and is mostly composed of aging Polish immigrants. The second group had been in a building across town that was closed and moved, and its congregants are mostly younger, Spanish-speaking, Latino immigrants, predominantly from Mexico. The merger appears to have been unsuccessful, and the two groups remain divided, functioning as two congregations within the same building. Analyses focus on first demonstrating the intense group-to-group conflict and then explaining it through their respective interpretations. The two groups evidence distinct demographic, social class, values, norms, and traditions that inform their group-to-group conflict in shared community. The case illuminates larger issues of religio-ethnic conflict and provides rich data on the perceptions and stereotypes each group has of the other. Findings indicate twin tensions of community, with in-group solidarity experienced more intensely as each group expresses their out-group divisions, conflict, and hostilities. As the Impossible Triangle sculpture visualizes (Bess et al. 2002), this case highlights the ways in which community encloses those within its boundaries while leaving those outside its boundaries confused about socially acceptable norms. Theoretically, the case contributes to understandings of community and conflict generally, as well as the ways cultural and religious historical memories influence present-day interpretations.

T1  - (How) does positive and negative extended cross-group contact predict direct cross-group contact and intergroup attitudes?
AN  - 1735657053; 201536816
AB  - Knowing that fellow ingroup members have cross-group contact can affect how people think, feel, and behave towards an out-group. Previous research on extended contact focused almost exclusively on positive cross-group interactions, neglecting the fact that extended contact can also be negative. In this contribution, we introduce negative extended contact and investigate how both forms of extended contact predict direct cross-group contact and intergroup attitudes. In two cross-sectional studies (N1=286, N2=237), we found evidence that positive and negative extended contact uniquely predict intergroup attitudes, and that direct cross-group contact mediates this effect. In Study 2, we also provide initial evidence that extended contact might either prepare for or impair direct contact by changing ingroup norms and intergroup self-efficacy, which in turn influence feelings of intergroup anxiety.

T1  - Exiles in a Foreign Land
AN  - 1698544858
AB  - Despite documentation of intergroup conflict between African Americans and Irish immigrants during the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, few studies have comparatively considered the beneficence of religion as an adaptive, conciliatory mechanism for the two ethnic groups. Yet, literature supports the historic centrality of the Black Church for the former group and the indelible influence of Catholicism for the latter. This research examines common religious themes and organized efforts associated with these faith traditions for the two historically oppressed groups. Informed by Cultural Theory, this study compares and contrasts religious cultural dynamics to illumine adaptive features and activism. Exilic themes based on nationality, race, and/or ethnicity tied to biblical symbolism; social programs and self-help; as well as appropriation of Liberation Theology are common group patterns. Yet, findings also illustrate the inability of religion to foster substantial intergroup cooperation in light of other prevailing systemic forces.

T1  - Black and Brown Tumbling the Walls Together
AN  - 2017355033
AB  - During the 1960s, intersections emerged between Mexican American activists and African American activists that informed social and education-al reform efforts in the US. On behalf of their communities, Chicana/o and African American activists sought to break down the barriers to higher education that kept Mexican American and African American youth constituencies out. In this article, intersectoral refers to the points of contact and interactions where Mexican American and African American educational sectors came together to benefit their communities jointly or respectively. While studies of relations between African American and Mexican American communities often highlight conflict or collaboration as organizing principles, this article seeks to identify where organizing efforts and advocacy intersected between these constituencies but also where influences and ideologies conjoined their social critiques. This article provides an analysis of the interstitial moments of interethnic solidarities between African American and Chicana/o student and community activists in their efforts to establish cultural centers and ethnic studies programs at UCLA in 1968.

T1  - Statistically small effects of the Implicit Association Test can have societally large effects
AN  - 1673502854
AB  - Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and Banaji (2009; GPUB hereafter) reported an average predictive validity correlation of ... = .236 for Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures involving Black-White racial attitudes and stereotypes. Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, and Tetlock (2013; OMBJT) reported a lower aggregate figure for correlations involving IAT measures (... = .148). The difference between the estimates of the 2 reviews was due mostly to their use of different policies for including effect sizes. GPUB limited their study to findings that assessed theoretically expected attitude-behavior and stereotype-judgment correlations along with others that the authors expected to show positive correlations. OMBJT included a substantial minority of correlations for which there was no theoretical expectation of a predictive relationship. Regardless of inclusion policy, both meta-analyses estimated aggregate correlational effect sizes that were large enough to explain discriminatory impacts that are societally significant either because they can affect many people simultaneously or because they can repeatedly affect single persons.

T1  - Who is Less Welcome?: The Impact of Individuating Cues on Attitudes towards Immigrants
AN  - 2076969605
AB  - Based on a novel experimental design, the current study examines the impact of economic and cultural characteristics of potential immigrants on anti-immigrant sentiments. We investigate the extent to which individuating cues affect public support for individual immigrants in the USA and the Netherlands through a series of online survey experiments carried out by the YouGov online panel in 2010 and the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Panel in 2011. Our findings demonstrate that individual immigrants elicit different levels of public support for their temporary and permanent immigration applications, and that support depends overwhelmingly on educational and occupational credentials of potential immigrants. Other individual attributes, such as presence of family dependents, country of origin and skin complexion also affect acceptance rates, but to a much lesser extent.

T1  - The minority identity and the idea of the 'unity' of the nation: the case of Hungarian minorities from Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine
AN  - 1667949021; 201509831
AB  - A comparison analysis of the ethno-national identity of Hungarian minorities living in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine is performed in the paper, including the identifications to majority community and the relationship with Hungary, respectively. According to the empirical results in every country, the community with the pan-Hungarian ethnocultural nation, and the identification with actual Hungary, is less important than regional Hungarianness in the minority identity of Hungarian minority members from outside the borders of Hungary. The primary in-group is the self-minority community in every country. This may be empirically grasped both on the level of the perceptions of social distances and on stereotypes toward Hungarians from Hungary and toward majority populations (Romanians, Slovaks, etc.).

T1  - Deconstructing intergenerational politics between 'Young Turks' and 'Old Guards' in Africa: an exploration of the perceptions on leadership and governance in Kenya
AN  - 1667946841; 201511801
AB  - Arguably, political leadership in Africa has been characterized as an occupation of the old. This has spurred heightened intergenerational conflicts, which pre-existed the formation of independent nation states. Conflicts over power and leadership among young and older generations were evident, and still are, in many traditional African societies. Such relationships continue within contemporary social, economic and cultural contexts. Aside from ethnicity being at the heart of defining political developments in Kenya, the 'generation card' is often invoked in the unfolding of political reform and democratic space. This paper interrogates the emergent relationship between 'Young Turks' (those characterized as 'young', full of ideas and impatient for change) and 'Old Guards' (those believed to be unwilling to change and accept new ideas), and questions its relevance for social, political and economic policy. It reveals how public space in Kenyan polity has been controlled by its older generations, who maintain a firm grip on the country's resources. It concludes by calling for a meaningful intergenerational dialog, where both young and old share ideas on how best to proceed on Kenya's path to social, political and economic development.

T1  - Biology without Biologism: Social Theory in a Postgenomic Age
AN  - 1692287880; 201523116
AB  - The epistemology of the life sciences has significantly changed over the last two decades but many of these changes seem to remain unnoticed amongst sociologists: both the majority who reject biology and the few minorities who want to biologize social theory seem to share a common (biologistic) understanding of 'the biological' that appears increasingly out of date with recent advances in the biosciences. In the first part of this article I offer an overview of some contemporary importations of biological and neurobiological knowledge into the sociological field. In the second section I contrast this image of biological knowledge circulating in the social sciences with the more pluralist ways in which biology is theorized in many sectors of the life sciences. The 'postgenomic' view of biology emerging from this second section represents a challenge for the monolithic view of biology present amongst social theorists and a new opportunity of dialogue for social theorists interested in non-positivist ways of borrowing from the life sciences.

T1  - Asylum seekers and host country impacts: a case study of Sri Lanka
AN  - 2570341089
AB  - Across the continent, countries play host to many people from an assortment of ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds. However, increasing political, economic and social tensions worldwide have paralleled a global increase in the number of asylum seekers. With an increasing number of asylum seekers in a post-conflict context, Sri Lanka has increasingly been the subject of debate and speculation in recent months. Thus, the island nation provides a unique opportunity to explore the reasons that underlie the increase in individuals seeking asylum, and ensuing impacts these trends may bear on host nations. Interviews were conducted with several officials to identify reasons for this outflow of people and analyse policies currently in place to address the problem. A number of policy recommendations are provided to address the flow of asylum seekers from Sri Lanka.

T1  - 'Raits blong mere'?: Framing Human Rights and Gender Relations in Solomon Islands
AN  - 1650145641; 201505117
AB  - In Solomon Islands, the language of human rights has become central to national legislation, policy making and NGO activism, focusing in particular on women's rights and violence against women. This is partly the result of trying to deal with the aftermath of a devastating conflict (1998-2003), which was due to growing anxieties between Malaitans and Guadalcanal people with regard to development equity and cultural respect.[1] During the civil conflict, which is by Solomon Islanders commonly referred to as 'the ethnic tension,' Solomon Islands experienced increasing civil unrest and instability, leading to a breakdown in law and order and a failure of essential government services. Moreover, gender-based violence against women and girls seems to have increased, and has become entrenched.[2] In 2003, after the Solomon Islands government requested assistance, Australia intervened through the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which stopped most of the violence.

T1  - Interpreting Recent Developments in Myanmar as an Attempt to Establish Political Legitimacy
AN  - 2468684496
AB  - Myanmar is currently undergoing widespread changes that are transforming the country's political and socio-economic landscape. These changes include the newly promulgated Constitution that was ratified in 2008 and a national election held in November 2010. Additionally, by-elections in April 2012 saw the return to Parliament of the National League for Democracy and its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The reforms under the new Thein Sein-led government include a congenial working relationship with the political opposition, freeing political prisoners and the granting of amnesty to political exiles to encourage their return, the negotiation of ceasefire agreements with almost all of the ethnic insurgent armies, and the inauguration of the Myanmar Peace Centre as a vehicle for the resolution of domestic conflict. These and related reforms are designed to secure the government's internal and external political legitimacy which it has lacked since the fall of the previous socialist government in 1988.

T1  - National identification, perceived threat, and dehumanization as antecedents of negative attitudes toward immigrants in Australia and Canada
AN  - 1433108488
AB  - The interplay of nationalistic threat perceptions, dehumanizing beliefs and intergroup emotions, and anti-immigrant sentiment is analyzed in a cross-national context with Australian (N=124) and Canadian (N=126) samples. National identification was linked to negative attitudes toward immigrants indirectly, via perceptions of immigrants as being in threatening zero-sum relationships with citizens. In turn, perceived zero-sum threat was associated with dehumanizing beliefs and emotions about immigrants. Significant baseline differences in hostility were observed across the samples, but the relationships among the variables were not moderated by participants' nationality. The study contributes to the literature examining how negative emotions and attitudes may serve to legitimize intergroup competition.

T1  - Tribalism, Identity and Citizenship in Contemporary Qatar
AN  - 1761675446; 201603123
AB  - This article examines the resurgence of tribalism as a sociological component of contemporary Qatari society. Utilising an ethnographic, mixed-methods design, the article begins with a survey of the substantial scholarship concerning tribes in Arabia. That scholarship provides ideas and understandings that only partially explain the vitality of contemporary tribalism. The article then demonstrates tribalism's ongoing social importance by analysing data from a quantitative survey of 800 Qatari citizens. The article concludes with the ethnographically situated contention that tribalism functions as a mechanism for asserting social power in the contemporary Qatari state, and is therefore an emblematic component of Qatari citizenship. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Constrict in the School Context
AN  - 1545345039
AB  - Constrict theory states that, in the short run, ethnic diversity in any context lowers both the quantity and the quality of interpersonal contacts. We test this theory in the school context, expecting that ethnic school diversity yields fewer and lower quality friendships. Moreover, we investigate whether the associations hold when controlling for the school's socioeconomic situation, and whether the relations between ethnic school diversity and the social outcomes differ between natives and immigrants. Multilevel analyses on data from the Flemish Educational Assessment, consisting of 10,546 natives and 1,324 immigrants in 85 secondary schools, show that ethnic diversity yields fewer friendships and a lower attachment to friends. However, this appears to be due to the schools' socioeconomic composition. For immigrants, moreover, a higher ethnic diversity yields more friendships and a higher attachment to friends. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.                [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cultural Threat and Anti-immigrant Prejudice: The Case of Protestants in Northern Ireland
AN  - 964200522; 201207280
AB  - Cultural threat has emerged as a consistent predictor of anti-immigrant and anti-minority attitudes across many different national contexts. We examine this issue in the context of Northern Ireland using representative survey data, suggesting that Protestant and unionist communities experience a higher level of cultural threat than Catholic and nationalist communities on account of the 'parity of esteem' principle that has informed changes in the province since the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Our analyses confirm that, although there is evidence for some level of anti-immigrant sentiment across all groups, Protestants and unionists do indeed report relatively more negative attitudes towards a range of immigrant and ethnic target groups compared with Catholics, nationalists or respondents who do not identify with any political category. The analyses further suggest that their higher level of perceived cultural threat partially accounts for this difference. We argue that cultural threat can be interpreted as a response to changes in Northern Ireland that have challenged the dominant status enjoyed by Protestants and unionists in the past. More generally, we argue that a politicised characterisation of cultural threat needs to be elaborated through future work. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Supergrans and nanoflowers: reconstituting images of gender and race in the promotion of biotechnology and nanotechnology in Aotearoa New Zealand
AN  - 2525911126
AB  - This paper explores the use of communication strategies to promote the social acceptance of science. It considers how gender and ethnicity are being constructed in science promotion and marketing, and discusses the intersections of knowledge, colonization and commercialization in science discourses. We critically assess a series of advertisements, posters, and news media articles published in Aotearoa New Zealand during 2000–2009, a period of significant political controversy and conflict over public investment in science and technology. We highlight the representation of women, indigenous peoples and the natural world in communication strategies aimed at mitigating public concerns about controversial technologies such as genetic engineering (GE) and nanotechnology. Adopting a critical discourse approach, we consider both images and words as political text. We illustrate how gender, ethnicity and nature are appropriated, constituted and reconstituted in an attempt to collapse the divide between the powerful world of science and the realm of everyday life. These communication strategies contribute to and are constitutive of the social relations of technology. They draw on deeply rooted social archetypes to re-present a politically constructed image of science to defined audiences, notably to those with the most concerns about its potential effects. In a socio-political context characterized by continuing civic challenges to the representation and rationale of modern science, such strategies represent an increasingly influential dimension in the framing and governance of emerging technologies.

T1  - 'Native' Conversion to Islam in Southern Cote d'Ivoire: The Perils of Double Identity
AN  - 1283643257; 201305353
AB  - This article presents a synthetic, historical-cum-anthropological overview of the collective trajectory of Ivoirian converts to Islam from southern autochthonous lineages who can be referred to-albeit unsatisfyingly-as 'native' Muslims. It focuses on what is effectively an invisible and silent minority within southern native groups and the majority Dioula Muslim society alike: a community that has barely received any attention from social scientists despite the transformative impact of its slow but steady Islamization process. The study aims first at shedding light on salient socio-religious and political aspects of this group's development, from colonial to postcolonial times. Given that this plural group is situated at the crossroads of various ethnic, national, and religious controversies, having enflamed Cote d'Ivoire in olden days as much as in recent years, the article eventually makes use of this group's distinct prism to question the contested Ivoirian interface between Islam, ethnic geography, and nationalism at large, and attempt some nuanced answers.

T1  - 'They Eat Potatoes, I Eat Rice': Symbolic Boundary Making and Space in Neighbour Relations
AN  - 1926268282
AB  - This article examines 'neighbouring' as the setting in which cross-category relations develop and symbolic boundaries are constructed. The study is based on thirty in-depth interviews with residents living in a multi-ethnic and a mono-ethnic neighbourhood in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The findings challenge the hoped-for outcomes of social mixing in neighbourhoods, as well as the view that boundary making is something inherent to multi-ethnic neighbourhoods only. Neighbour relations are often setting-specific (relations are interchangeable, scripted and bounded, and passively maintained), which is relevant for understanding the spatiality of neighbouring and the limited exchange of personal information between neighbours. Because neighbouring involves the balancing of personal privacy and close spatial proximity, the exchange of personal information is limited, while spatial proximity ensures easy access to observable (through seeing, hearing and smelling) categorical markers that signify class, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc. In this way, neighbour interaction reconstructs symbolic boundaries rather than breaking them down.

T1  - How intergroup friendship works: A longitudinal study of friendship effects on outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1018342788; 201212797
AB  - Cross-sectional research has shown that frequency of self-disclosure to outgroup members mediates the positive relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. The current research investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and attitudes in more depth. New undergraduate students were asked to nominate an ingroup or outgroup friend and then report the intimacy of their disclosures to them, their anxiety and attitudes towards a series of social groups, in the first week of the semester and 6 weeks later. Intimacy of disclosure predicted more positive attitudes towards outgroups over time, but this association was only found among participants who nominated an outgroup friend. In the ingroup friend condition, a negative association was found. These associations were mediated by general intergroup anxiety. These relationships highlight the importance of integrating theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations when investigating intergroup contact. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Why Indian men rebel? Explaining armed rebellion in the northeastern states of India, 1970-2007
AN  - 914766371; 201200427
AB  - Armed conflicts have been a permanent feature of the northeastern region since Indian independence. Surprisingly, relentless conflicts in this remote region of India have received little attention in the literature. Although some studies on conflicts in India have made important contributions to understanding and analyzing the causes of conflicts in general, none of them has paid specific attention to the ongoing conflicts in the northeastern region of India. Relative deprivation and persistent economic and political discrimination are often identified as the major causes for armed rebellion in this region. I provide a first quantitative test of this argument, exploring whether deprivation and continual economic and political discrimination explain the probability of armed conflict incidence across nine northeastern states of India during the period 1970-2007. The main findings from probit estimations show that poverty (relative to the rest of the country) and economic and political discrimination explain conflict outbreaks, after controlling for income, population pressures, state capacity, ethnic affiliations, forest area, peace years, neighboring conflict incidence, and distance to New Delhi. The study also reports considerable support for the baseline results when controlling for potential reverse feedback effects using the generalized method of moments. These results are robust to alternative estimation techniques and sample size. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Next Year in Drohobych
AN  - 907929222; 201124848
AB  - In Israeli director Yael Bartana's 2007 film Mary Koszmary -- meaning "Bad Dreams" or "Nightmares" -- a young Polish politician delivers a resounding speech to an empty, crumbling, communist-era Stadion Dziesiciolecia in Warsaw. The speech, he says, is an appeal: "This is a call. . . . It is an appeal for life. We want three million Jews to return to Poland, to live with us again. We need you! Please come back!" This article considers the powerful and perhaps disturbing premise of these lines and explores their possible meanings in a contemporary Polish context. What can it mean for Poles and Polish culture to need Jews -- and in particular, to need those Jews who can never return? The complex phenomenon of Jewish memory in Poland and Eastern Europe cannot be contained within specific, present-day borders -- whether of geography or of academic discipline: similar dynamics to those Bartana has identified in Poland exist throughout the region. Thus, against the background of Bartana's film, the article considers the growing phenomenon and importance of local Jewish festivals in Poland and present-day Ukraine, focusing in detail on two specific festivals: the annual festival "Encounters with Jewish Culture," held in Chmielnik, Poland, and the biannual Bruno Schulz Festival in Drohobych, Ukraine. The analysis explores ways that the memory of Polish Jews -- and more specifically the figure of the absent Polish Jew -- can function as a central element in the construction of new, communal Polish and Ukrainian narratives since the fall of Communism.

T1  - Peacebuilding through Dialogue and Education: Lessons from the Gulen Movement
AN  - 1933933667
AB  - In the plural composition of today's world, conflicts have caused considerable turmoil and challenges to social cohesiveness and peaceful co-existence. The response to pluralism harbours potential problems on a national and international scale. Yet the nature and causes of conflicts are remarkably different. Conflicts can be generally characterised as local, with a relatively large number of internal factors, while being more global because they are shaped by transnational and international factors. Thus the recent conflicts that developed between the Egyptian and Libyan peoples and their unwanted regimes and the violence in Bosnia are different from, for example, the Turkish-Armenian tension or the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Other examples are the international conflicts caused by the controversial depiction of the prophet Mohammed in cartoons that originated in Denmark, the riots that emerged spontaneously in the banlieux of French cities, and the fear that followed the bombings on the transport system in London in July 2005. The conflict of cultures, mores, ideologies and identities often results in maladjustments and social disorder and unrest. These conflicts evoke responses both inside and outside the Muslim world in order to maintain social cohesion among societies globally. There is a clear differentiation regarding the Islamic approaches to conflict resolution, which can be generally divided into radical and liberal approaches. These voices of Islam, from liberal to radical, have been institutionalised in various countries. These Islamic and ethnic minority groups provide social and religious services that respond to the changing needs and concerns of Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide.

T1  - Bringing together acculturation theory and intergroup contact theory: Predictors of Flemings' expectations of Turks' acculturation behavior
AN  - 1417523620; 201332249
AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moiese, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

T1  - 'You Have Car Insurance, We Have Tribes': Negotiating Everyday Life in Basra and the Re-emergence of Tribalism
AN  - 925712500; 201204469
AB  - This article explores the ways in which Basrans make their way in the world and examines how they negotiate certain situations that they encounter. One important means by which problems are dealt with in Basra is through recourse to one's tribe to mediate and resolve issues and sometimes even to protect an individual or family. I turn to ethnographic instances to highlight both the importance and capriciousness of tribes with respect to extending help when it is required. I then aim to show why tribalism has re-emerged within Iraq as a potent social and political force by reference to the shifting historical situation of the last 50 years.

T1  - Attenuated Sovereignty: An Immodest Proposal for Addressing Ethnic Diversity
AN  - 925713129; 201205264
AB  - The conventional sovereignty that has prevailed for the past several centuries restricts the options open to ethnic minorities in multiethnic populations that are subject to a single sovereign authority. Minorities will either trend toward integration with majority populations or else the direction of change will be toward separation and the establishment of new, smaller sovereign states. There are serious problems with both options. The present proposal is for a form of diluted or "attenuated" sovereignty whereby, in its most basic form, a particular ethnic minority would be afforded limited sovereignty in a specified area within an existing sovereign state's overall territory. An attenuated-sovereignty government established in the specified area would be answerable to -- and have authority over -- only those persons of the designated ethnic minority who have opted to affiliate themselves with it. Distinctive to this proposal, all other persons, irrespective of their ethnicity, could remain in the delimited area and remain subject to the pre-existing, conventionally sovereign authority. This proposal includes various strategies to make attenuated sovereignty a practical, workable option. The notion of attenuated sovereignty is not as fantastical as it may seem at first glance. Re this assertion, the conventionally sovereign state is everywhere at bay. Its best days are behind it. Under the circumstances, in some situations, attenuated sovereignty could prove advantageous to both ethnic minorities and majority populations willing to accommodate them in the creative manner here proposed.

T1  - Symbolism and values: Rationality and irrationality of culture
AN  - 902079669; 201122353
AB  - Values tend to be taken for granted by communitarian politicians and religiously thinking people as well as by various sociologists, that is insofar as certain aspects of social life underscore the belief in the importance of values. However, other social phenomena, particularly ethnic and religious conflicts, seem more affected by the symbolism of culture than by values. This article attempts to trace the logic of symbolism and values in various cultural settings. It contends that these core components of culture are of much consequence but may be problematic as well, due to their ambivalence and conflation. It concludes that symbolism and values may invert their inherent nature of reason and affect, rationality and irrationality. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Religious Roots of Irish Nationalism
AN  - 887499216; 201119099
AB  - The intensity of conflict in the Middle East tends to overshadow other instances where ethno-national conflict has a religious base. The author draws attention to one of them: Ireland. He considers the link between religion and nationalism in Ireland from three perspectives. The first is the significance of religion as an "ethnic marker": as an indicator of geopolitical (and therefore ethnic) origin rather than of belief system. The second is the role of religious belief, and its potential to accentuate differences between communities. The third is the impact of social organization: the tendency of faith groups towards separate but internally integrated organization, and therefore towards the promotion of group solidarity. The author concludes by exploring the implications of this link between religion and nationalism following the partition of the island.

T1  - Poverty, inequality and ethnic minorities in Vietnam
AN  - 887498824; 201119806
AB  - The present study examines how and why ethnic minorities are poorer than ethnic majorities in Vietnam using the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey data for 2002 and 2004. First, the analysis confirms that households belonging to the ethnic minority groups are not only poorer but also more vulnerable to various shocks than those in the ethnic majority groups, namely the Kinh and the Chinese. Second, household composition (e.g., dependency burden), education, land holding and location are important determinants of expenditure and poverty, whilst there is some diversity among different ethnic groups. Finally, the decomposition analyses reveal that the ethnic minorities are poorer not necessarily because they have more disadvantaged household characteristics (e.g., educational attainment or location), but, more importantly, because the returns to the characteristics are much lower for ethnic minorities than for the majorities. Government policies to reduce structural differences between ethnic majorities and minorities are imperative to address the disparities in returns to endowments between them.

T1  - Generational Change and Ethnicity among 1980s-born Taiwanese
AN  - 1030866032; 201228963
AB  - This paper aims to show that Taiwanese born in the 1980s constitute a "post-reform" generation whose perception of cultural difference and ethnicity may challenge the efficiency of the "four major ethnic groups" categorization as an analytical framework for research on Taiwanese youth's identity, political behaviour and social interactions. Using quantitative data from a questionnaire distributed in 15 universities nationwide in 2010 and qualitative data from interviews, this paper first focuses on the attitudes of Taiwanese born in the 1980s toward what are generally considered the three core elements of ethnic group-making in a Chinese socio-cultural context: patrilineality, locality and language. Then it shows that the combined effects of democratization, Taiwanization and contacts with mainland China have decisively impregnated their life experiences and influenced their perceptions of cultural difference. Consequently, the different aspects/ factors that contributed to the formation and the deepening of ethnic boundaries and ethnic conflict up until the 1990s are not effective anymore, nor are they significant for Taiwanese in their twenties. This process is transforming ethnicity rather than erasing it. Thus "having an ethnic identity" is still considered important by a majority, but its meaning and salience have changed, leading to the necessity to redefine, a process that could be undertaken using the concept of "symbolic ethnicity".

T1  - Do Grievances Matter in Ethnic Conflict? An Experimental Approach
AN  - 1030864778; 201230147
AB  - In this article, we examine the relative deprivation argument, which, drawing on the frustration-aggression hypothesis, proposes that members of aggravated ethnic collectivities are more likely to engage in protest compared with less-frustrated groups. We examine the arguments presented by the grievance literature using experimental analysis, a potentially powerful, yet rarely employed methodology for the study of ethnic conflict. This methodology enables us to consider not only the grievance hypothesis itself, but its theoretical underpinning: the frustration-aggression thesis. The experimental scenarios are based on college rivalries depicted as analogous to interethnic relations. Employing college rivalries in the experimental design can help us understand the basic foundations behind ethnic strife. The experimental findings support the contention that higher levels of frustration and relative deprivation (grievance) increase the probability that groups will resort to noninstitutional means to achieve their political goals.

T1  - Burying Indigeneity: The Spatial Construction of Reality and Aboriginal Australia
AN  - 1928292001
AB  - In this article we argue that spatial distance and historic socio-ethnic boundaries play a critical role in determining the relative priority given to groups that are marginally placed. These priorities are materialized through law. We utilize theories that understand 'reality' as something socially constructed: our impressions of the structure of everyday life are mediated in large part by our primary social group interactions. We profile the spatial distribution and relative segregation of Indigenous Australians, from urban to remote regional contexts. Our data highlights how even a predominantly urban Indigenous population remains out of the sight and mind of social and political actors due to its small numerical size and perceived social difference. We move to explain public policy formulation in terms of orientations that are influenced by the spatiality of social affiliations. We suggest that the spatially-bounded patterning of black and white lives supports the continued burial of Indigenous life. The socio-spatial construction of Indigenous life for white and other Australians has enabled both aggressive and neglectful policy instruments in which Aboriginal life appears as something that is politically, legally and spatially marginal.

AN  - 1928282198
AB  - From the perspective of segmented assimilation in the United States, a key question is whether the children of immigrant workers in European societies will experience socio-economic inclusion ("assimilation") or exclusion ("segmentation"). This study focuses on the Turkish second generation in European cities as a critical case of ethnic segmentation. In particular, the analysis examines the role of urban contexts as moderators of "ethnic penalties" on socio-economic attainment. Using Census data, the authors find large net ethnic penalties for the Turkish second generation in the urban area of Brussels, where they make up the bottom end of the ethnic hierarchy. In comparison to the second generation living outside the urban area, however, they are more often in paid work, less rarely self-employed, and less totally excluded from high-end jobs. Our comparative findings run counter to common negative portrayals of post-industrial urban economies as a mobility trap for the children of immigrants. Instead, they suggest an upside to differential ethnic boundary dynamics in urban economic centers versus their national peripheries. To conclude, the authors discuss comparative implications for the fortunes of the second generation in European urban economies.

T1  - Socio-demographic Determinants of Economic Growth: Age-Structure, Preindustrial Heritage and Sociolinguistic Integration
AN  - 763599880
AB  - This study establishes a socio-demographic theory of international development derived from selected classical and contemporary sociological theories. Four hypotheses are tested: (1. population growth's effect on development depends on age-structure; (2. historic population density (used here as an indicator of preindustrial social complexity) boosts contemporary economic performance; (3. ethnic polarization impairs economic growth; and (4. a nation's degree of sociolinguistic integration positively influences economic performance. Investigating annual changes in real gross domestic product per capita from 1970 to 2000, our pooled time-series analyses of 101 developed and developing countries generally support these hypotheses net of common alternative explanations, suggesting that the etiology of economic growth could benefit from the reintroduction of classic and contemporary sociological theories.

T1  - Constitutional Reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina: A Few Comments, Reflections and Recommendations
AN  - 754042481; 201054443
AB  - Fifteen years after the signing of the Dayton Agreement that ended the war there is a broad agreement that a substantial constitutional reform is needed in Bosnia-Herzegovina to enable further democratization in the country and its Euro-Atlantic integration, and this is also the central hypothesis of this article. Although it discusses the Butmir (political) process as the broader political context, it focuses on the preconditions, concepts, principles, nature, contents, goals, actors and process of constitutional reform. Reflecting theoretical discourses and concepts (particularly consociationalism, which was used in the drafting of the Dayton Constitution and is involved in the current constitutional debate in Bosnia-Herzegovina), and based on my extensive research in the country and region, the preferred concepts, key strategies and a possible model of the constitutional reforms are elaborated that can contribute to the realization of the main goals. These main goals can be summarized as ensuring peace and stability, promoting democracy and the process of democratization and institution building as well as economic and social development that can contribute to a better life of every individual and distinct community. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predicting Abolition: A Cross-National Survival Analysis of the Social and Political Determinants of Death Penalty Statutes
AN  - 60340064; 201020992
AB  - Cross-national research on the determinants of criminal penalties has generally recognized that the amount of crime is an insufficient explanation for the use of punishment. Some research supports conflict explanations, reporting that economic inequality and the presence of ethnic minorities threatens elites who respond by advocating increased punishments largely aimed at minority groups. Other research reports that democratized nations in which citizens enjoy many civil liberties have lower levels of punishment. This study uses event history and logistic analyses to identify the social and political factors that shape the existence of the death penalty in 92 nations over a 23-year period. The results largely support conflict explanations for the existence of this punishment by finding that nations with high-income inequality and large ethnic minority populations have the lowest likelihood of abolition.

T1  - The Xinjiang Class: Education, Integration, and the Uyghurs
AN  - 215230422
AB  - In 2000, the Chinese Communist Party established the Xinjiang Class (Xinjiang neidi gaozhong ban), a program that funds middle school-aged students from Xinjiang, mostly ethnic Uyghur, to attend school in predominately Han populated cities located throughout eastern China. This paper examines the efficacy of the Xinjiang Class in promoting ethnic unity and Chinese nationalism. By examining the extent to which Uyghur students participating in the Xinjiang Class interact with Han students; speak Chinese outside of the classroom; and by considering if these Uyghur students are returning to Xinjiang, I argue that many Uyghurs are resisting integration, and the Xinjiang Class is largely failing to promote ethnic unity between Han and Uyghurs. Conversely, this program has even strengthened some Uyghur students' sense of ethnic identity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
