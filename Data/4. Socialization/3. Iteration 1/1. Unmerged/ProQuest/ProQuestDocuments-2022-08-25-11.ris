T1  - The role of optimal conditions and intergroup contact in promoting positive intergroup relations in and out of the workplace: A study with ethnic majority and minority workers: GPIR
AN  - 2704210428
AB  - A field study was conducted with majority and minority group members to test whether the effects of optimal contact conditions and of intergroup contact generalize across situations, and extend to the support of intergroup equality in terms of agreement with social policies benefitting the minority group. Participants were 163 Italian and 129 immigrant workers in three corporate organizations. Results from structural equation modelling analyses revealed that, for the majority group, positive contact stemming from optimal contact conditions was indirectly associated, via reduction in negative stereotypes, with more positive behavior that generalized across situations. For both majority and minority groups, positive contact stemming from optimal contact conditions was associated with less negative stereotypes, and in turn with greater support for social policies favoring the minority. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, also in relation to the significance of the present results for research investigating the relation between intergroup contact and social change.

T1  - Distinguishing solidarity from identity in studies of nationhood: An alternative to the civic–ethnic dichotomy?
AN  - 2672162132
AB  - This article argues for an analytic distinction between questions of collective identity and questions of solidarity in studies of nationhood. Whereas the former inquiry centres on group classifications and commonalities, the latter examines cooperation and patterns of interaction among group members. Although theoretical discussion of national solidarity is sparse, three central approaches in the field can be highlighted: understanding solidarity as a byproduct of identity, as a relationship between strangers and as an extension of sociability. The distinction between solidarity and identity bears on the much‐disputed dichotomy between ethnic and civic nationalism. Civic nationalism has been widely criticized for failing to account for group boundaries and shared culture. Yet its emphasis on patterns of interaction and cooperation should not be neglected either. Instead of addressing the civic–ethnic dichotomy as two types of national identity, one could benefit from differentiating between epistemological questions about (ethnic‐national) identity and those about (civic‐national) solidarity.

T1  - Comparing relations of ethnic-racial public regard, centrality, and intergroup contact attitudes among ethno-racially diverse adolescents: GPIR
AN  - 2669413197
AB  - The current cross-sectional study examined how adolescents’ appraisal of how positively others viewed their ethnic-racial group (i.e., public regard) and how integral their ethnic-racial background was to their self-concept (i.e., centrality) related to their intergroup contact approach and avoidance attitudes. Participants were Black, Latinx, and White high school students (N = 2,609; Mage = 16.39, SD = 1.16; 52% female) from the U.S. Southwest and Midwest. Utilizing multigroup structural equation modeling, results indicated that across all ethnic-racial backgrounds, and regardless of geographical context, public regard was positively associated with approach attitudes. Conversely, findings for avoidance attitudes varied by ethnic-racial background. Specifically, public regard was negatively associated with avoidance attitudes for White adolescents, whereas this relation was null for Black and Latinx adolescents. Additionally, although centrality was positively associated with avoidance attitudes among all adolescents, the relation was stronger among White adolescents than among Black and Latinx adolescents.

T1  - ‘Chinese privilege’ as shortcut in Singapore: a rejoinder
AN  - 2667088361
AB  - We disagree with Humairah Zainal and Walid Jumblatt Abdullah that Chinese privilege exists in Singapore politics and that it is perpetuated by the political hegemony of the long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP). Consequentially, we disagree that ‘Chinese privilege’ is thus a useful concept for understanding politics in Singapore. Our rejoinder argues that ‘Chinese privilege’ is under-specified and decontextualized by the authors, used uncritically as a shortcut for the consequences of the long-ruling party’s political hegemony for ethnic relations, and is therefore a polarizing distraction to the critical analysis required to advance anti-racism discourse and understanding in Singapore. We show that the authors have mistook incumbent political privilege for Chinese privilege. We argue that ethnic majority and minority Members of Parliament from both governing and opposition parties have had to simultaneously serve as community leaders and transcend ethnic affiliations to represent national interests.

T1  - Does Respect Foster Tolerance? (Re)analyzing and Synthesizing Data From a Large Research Project Using Meta-Analytic Techniques
AN  - 2666836775
AB  - Our own prior research has demonstrated that respect for disapproved others predicts and might foster tolerance toward them. This means that without giving up their disapproval of others’ way of life, people can tolerate others when they respect them as equals (outgroup respect–tolerance hypothesis). Still, there was considerable variation in the study features. Moreover, the studies are part of a larger research project that affords many additional tests of our hypothesis. To achieve integration along with a more robust understanding of the relation between respect and tolerance, we (re)analyzed all existing data from this project, and we synthesized the results with the help of meta-analytic techniques. The average standardized regression coefficient, which describes the relationship between respect and tolerance, was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 0.34]). In addition to this overall confirmation of our hypothesis, the size of this coefficient varied with a number of variables. It was larger for numerical majorities than for minorities, smaller for high-status than for low-status groups, and larger for religious than for life-style groups. These findings should inspire further theory development and spur growth in the social-psychological literature on tolerance.

T1  - Stereotypes of nihilists are overwhelmingly negative
AN  - 2653931485
AB  - Existential nihilism is on the rise in modern societies, but no previous work has investigated the social psychology of seeing no meaning in life. In the current research, five studies (N = 1,634) show that targets’ existential nihilist beliefs elicit a range of negative stereotypes about personality traits, commonly valued social traits, and targets’ ability to perform basic adaptive social tasks. Results demonstrate that these negative stereotypes are mediated by belief that the target is depressed more than the belief the target is non-religious or that the target does not plan for the future. Unlike atheists, who are seen as competent, no positive stereotypes emerged for nihilists, suggesting both future research and interventions aimed at updating false beliefs about nihilists.

T1  - Urban/Rural Digital Divide Exists in Older Adults: Does It Vary by Racial/Ethnic Groups?
AN  - 2653219974
AB  - Despite the overall increase in older adults’ internet use, the digital divide within older Americans remains substantial, particularly for those in rural areas and with racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. The current study examines how one’s residential area and racial/ethnicity relate to internet access, both singularly and in concert. Data were from the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. The sample consisted of 17,372 Americans aged 50 and above. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the direct effects of residence and race/ethnicity and their interaction effects on internet use. The odds of internet use were significantly lower for older adults living in suburban and rural residences as well as for Black and Hispanic individuals. Furthermore, rural living reduced the probability of using the internet more for Blacks than Whites. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to narrow the digital divide, with particular attention required for older Blacks in rural communities.

T1  - Does Foreign Development Aid Trigger Ethnic War in Developing States?
AN  - 2571589894
AB  - Can foreign aid trigger ethnic war? The quantitative conflict literature has produced mixed findings on the effect of foreign aid on civil war in developing states. One reason for the mixed results is that a subset of civil wars, ethnic wars, are more likely than other kinds of civil wars to be triggered by foreign aid. This is because large amounts of foreign aid can cause the state to become a prize worth fighting over, mobilizing ethnic identity and group-related rebellion. This article investigates this question by testing the separate impacts of total, bilateral, and multilateral aid given by state and nonstate actors on the onset of ethnic war, using a cross-national time-series dataset of 147 countries from 1961 to 2008. The findings show a very strong association of foreign aid with ethnic war, whether measured as total aid, bilateral aid, or multilateral aid.

T1  - Adolescent development of interethnic attitudes following a social intervention to increase intergroup contact: The moderating role of affective forecasting
AN  - 2570234864
AB  - This longitudinal, quasi-experimental field study investigated affective forecasting as a moderator of positive intergroup contact effects among adolescents. We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (Mage = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents' positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger.

T1  - The Making of the Italian American Colonizer
AN  - 2518866210
AB  - This essay investigates how the Fascist war in Ethiopia influenced the racial representation and self-perception of Italian immigrants living in the United States. In particular, it analyzes how the regime exported new narratives depicting the migrant as a colonizer and how these stories informed the way in which Italian Americans perceived their ethnic and racial identity. Because the regime identified Italian emigrants as members of a superior race, news about the Italo-Ethiopian war had a strong impact on their relationship with African Americans, who conceived of Ethiopia as a symbol of Pan-African independence and thus regarded the conflict as a race war. By showing how colonialism and its propaganda may influence not only colonized peoples but also subaltern groups and communities living in geographically distant areas, the present essay hopes to contribute to the postcolonial discourse with an innovative perspective.

T1  - The last acceptable prejudice in Europe? Anti-Gypsyism as the obstacle to Roma inclusion: GPIR
AN  - 2513520464
AB  - National and European policies aim to facilitate the integration of Roma people into mainstream society. Yet, Europe’s largest ethnic group continues to be severely discriminated. Although prejudice has been identified to be at the core of this failure, social psychological research on anti-Gypsyism remains scarce. We conducted a study in six countries using student and community samples (N = 2,089; Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Norway, Italy, Spain) to understand how anti-Gypsyism among majority-group members predicts unfavorable acculturation preferences toward Roma people. Openly negative stereotypes predicted acculturation preferences strongly across the countries. However, stereotypes about the Roma receiving undeserved benefits were also relevant to some degree in East-Central Europe, implying that intergroup relations are framed there as realistic conflict. Stereotypes about traditional Roma culture did not play a central role in acculturation preferences. Our findings highlighted that anti-Gypsyism may be an impediment to integration efforts, and efforts should be context-specific rather than pan-national.

T1  - Close or Distant Past? The Role of Temporal Distance in Responses to Intergroup Violence From Victim and Perpetrator Perspectives
AN  - 2500887464
AB  - In two different intergroup contexts, three studies investigated the role of temporal distance in responses to intergroup violence from both victim and perpetrator perspectives. In the context of the conflict between Serbs and Bosniaks, Study 1 showed that whereas increased subjective temporal distance predicted less support for justice-restoring efforts and less outgroup empathy among the perpetrator group (Serbs), it predicted more conciliatory, pro-outgroup attitudes among the victim group (Bosniaks). Furthermore, Bosniaks perceived the war as temporally closer than did Serbs. In the context of the U.S.–Iran conflict, Study 2 provided a partial conceptual replication of Study 1 and demonstrated that ingroup glorification motivated more temporal distancing among perpetrators and less temporal distancing among victims. Study 3 further established the causal effects of temporal distance on intergroup outcomes, and that these effects were moderated by glorification. Implications for post-conflict peacebuilding are discussed.

T1  - Supporting immigrant cultural rights: The roles of deprovincialization and identity continuity
AN  - 2466764764
AB  - This research examines the role of deprovincialization, conceptualized in terms of a nuanced perspective on one’s in‐group culture, for majority members’ support for immigrants’ cultural practices and expressive rights. In three studies using data from samples drawn from nationally representative panels in the Netherlands (additionally analyzed in an internal meta‐analysis of N = 1,791), it was found that deprovincialization is a unique and robust predictor of support for immigrant rights, above and beyond prejudicial feelings, political orientation, level of education, gender, age, and religious affiliation. Furthermore, deprovincialization was found to be independent of national identification, which in previous research has been used as a proxy for deprovincialization. Additionally and in trying to conceptually replicate the pattern of findings (Studies 2 and 3), two different measures of perceived concern about the continuity of the in‐group culture and identity were found to weaken the deprovincialization‐support association. The findings go beyond existing research by focusing on the cultural openness understanding of deprovincialization and demonstrating the robust importance of how majority members understand their in‐group for their support of immigrants’ practices and rights.

T1  - They Blush Because They Understand: The Performative Power of Women's Rhetorical Humor in Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, and Emma: WL
AN  - 2581865719
AB  - In this paper, I perform a comparative analysis of women's humorous speech across three of Jane Austen's novels using speech-act theory. With this analysis, I seek to understand how women in Austen use humor to effect change amid rigid societal constraints. I begin with Pride and Prejudice, where subversive humor abounds, before turning to Mansfield Park and Emma, where humor is much less likely to subvert hierarchies or patriarchal norms. I suggest that comparing women's humorous speech acts across these novels illuminates the conditions of possibility for subversive humor. Accordingly, I offer the following criteria for subversive speech: (1) Does the speech act conform to dominant cultural norms or patriarchy, and (2) does the speech act achieve a specific perlocution-that is, is the character's motivation is realized? Applying these criteria across these three novels, I argue that the degree to which Austen's characters themselves analyze and understand the entire speech situation determines whether their humorous speech acts are ultimately subversive.

T1  - Could a rising robot workforce make humans less prejudiced?
AN  - 2453786249
AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5–6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.

T1  - Do they want contact with us? The role of intergroup contact meta‐perceptions on positive contact and attitudes
AN  - 2440857680
AB  - This research examined the role of contact meta‐perceptions on positive intergroup contact and outgroup attitudes. Specifically, perceptions of the ingroup's and outgroup's desire for intergroup contact were simultaneously tested as predictors of intergroup contact and outgroup attitudes. Three correlational studies were conducted in three distinct contexts, international students' view of British students, general public views of people with schizophrenia, and both Muslims' and non‐Muslims' views of one another. Among these three intergroup relationships, the role of outgroup contact meta‐perceptions was consistently highlighted as predictor of intergroup contact. In stark contrast, ingroup contact meta‐perceptions did not emerge as a significant predictor of contact. Intergroup contact then predicted outgroup attitudes (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and stereotyping (Studies 2 and 3) via reduced anxiety (Studies 2 and 3). The results demonstrate the importance of explicitly highlighting outgroups' openness for intergroup interactions and are discussed in the context of intergroup relations literature.

T1  - Aversive Response Towards Culture Fusion Is Moderated by the Source of Foreign Cultural Inflow
AN  - 2429063111
AB  - Culture fusion reflects blending of elements from distinct cultures that produces a novel, hybrid cultural representation. Prior research among participants in the USA revealed that fusion of cultural elements from the USA and China could be perceived as contamination of one’s local culture and evokes disgust. It remains unknown whether this aversion to culture fusion generalizes to other samples and is contingent on perceivers’ attitudes toward the source of the foreign culture. Here, we tested these questions across two studies. Participants were exposed to different patterns of culture mixing of their own local culture and two foreign cultures (one relatively favored and one relatively disfavored). Across both studies (Singaporean participants in Study 1 and Hong Kong participants in Study 2), the results replicated prior findings suggesting that culture fusion elicits stronger negative evaluations (e.g., disgust, discomfort) compared to other patterns of culture mixing (i.e., presentation of local and foreign elements side-by-side). Importantly, a Mixing Type × Foreign Source interaction emerged, such that participants in both studies reacted more negatively to culture mixing involving a less favored (China) than a more favored (USA) culture, with negative reactions especially pronounced toward culture fusion. This aversive response was moderated by patriotism in Singapore but not in Hong Kong. These findings demonstrate that response to culture mixing depends on intergroup attitudes toward foreign cultures, and culture fusion is especially aversive when involving cultural inflows from a disfavored out-group. The contribution of geopolitical differences between Singapore and Hong Kong on these findings are also considered.

T1  - Infectious Disease Prevalence, Not Race Exposure, Predicts Both Implicit and Explicit Racial Prejudice Across the United States
AN  - 2385919782
AB  - What factors increase racial prejudice? Across the United States, increased exposure to Black Americans has been hypothesized to increase White Americans’ prejudicial attitudes toward Black Americans. Here we test an alternative explanation: People living in regions with higher infectious disease rates have a greater tendency to avoid out-groups because such avoidance reduces their perceived likelihood of contracting illnesses. Consistent with this parasite-stress hypothesis, we show that both White and Black individuals (N > 77,000) living in U.S. states in which disease rates are higher display increased implicit (automatic) and explicit (conscious) racial prejudice. These results survived the inclusion of several individual- and state-level controls previously used to explain variability in prejudice. Furthermore, showing disease-related primes to White individuals with strong germ aversion increased their explicit, but not implicit, anti-Black/pro-White prejudice. Domestic out-groups, not just foreigners, may therefore experience increased overt forms of prejudice when disease rates are high.

T1  - Forms of Blended Bicultural Identity: Identity Conflict and Harmony in Culturally Diverse Mauritius
AN  - 2380017011
AB  - This study used a person-centered approach to distinguish groups of bicultural (national and ethnocultural) individuals in culturally diverse Mauritius. We focused on experiences of harmony or conflict among blended bicultural individuals and used representative data from the three numerically largest ethnocultural groups (Hindus, Creoles, and Muslims; Ntotal = 1,768). Cluster analyses indicated three groups of individuals with different identity profiles: conflicted blends (50%), harmonious blends (41%), and low blends (9%). Conflicted compared with harmonious blends were more concerned about keeping their ethnic group distinct and about the societal recognition of cultural diversity. In addition, higher social distance vis-à-vis outgroups was found among conflicted blends compared with harmonious blends. The findings for the three identity profiles are discussed in relation to existing theories on bicultural identity, Mauritius’ approach to ethnocultural diversity, and the country’s three main ethnocultural groups.

T1  - “It’s not something I can shake”: The Effect of Racial Stereotypes, Beauty Standards, and Sexual Racism on Interracial Attraction
AN  - 2278322600
AB  - Sexual racism, a form of prejudice enacted in sexual or romantic settings, is a complex phenomenon that can interact with racial stereotypes and media representations of beauty to affect interracial attraction. Research suggests that racialized beauty standards and racial stereotypes can perpetuate broader racist tendencies in social interactions. This study aims to develop a critical understanding of how undergraduate students conceptualize the intersection of race and sexuality, and how racial identity shapes their sexual and romantic experiences. Using a qualitative methodology of survey analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the attitudes and behaviors of students at a large public university in California, and focuses on the thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained during eighteen student interviews. This research identifies three significant themes: (1) the impact of racial stereotypes on interracial attraction, (2) the media’s tendency to perpetuate Whiteness as a standard of beauty, and (3) the harmful consequences of sexual racism on students’ self-esteem and self-worth. Findings suggest that racial stereotypes, beauty standards, and sexual racism are prevalent among this student community and have harmful consequences for students of color, including decreased self-esteem, sexual repercussions, and internalized racism.

T1  - AGGRESSIVE AND AVOIDANT ACTION TENDENCIES TOWARDS OUT-GROUPS: THE DISTINCT ROLES OF IN-GROUP ATTACHMENT VS. GLORIFICATION AND COGNITIVE VS. AFFECTIVE AMBIVALENCE
AN  - 2452117890
AB  - The current work argues that expressing out-group ambivalence based on cognitive information is a strategy to justify one's prejudice, which may ultimately "cover" the discriminatory nature of out-group-directed negative action tendencies, depending on individuals' in-group 'attachment' and 'glorification' levels. As expected, after expressing prejudice in a normative context inducing prejudice suppression (a) high-glorification participants were more prone to out-group-directed aggression, and (b) high-attachment participants were more prone to out-group-directed avoidance, when such action tendencies were self-reported after the expression of ambivalent beliefs but not emotions concerning the out-group.

T1  - Contact Capacity and Its Effect on Intergroup Relations
AN  - 2337005748
AB  - Although intergroup contact is an effective means to improve intergroup attitudes, it does not always have a positive impact on them. This study introduces contact capacity as a factor that may impede intergroup contact. Longitudinal social network data (N = 6,600; Mage = 14.87 years) was collected in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and used to accurately calculate participants’ out-group, in-group, and total contact. Multilevel models (L1: students, L2: school classes) showed that the total amount of contact at Wave 1 negatively predicts individuals’ out-group friends at Wave 2 while controlling for out-group attitudes, existing out-group friendships and sociodemographic variables. An additional robustness check showed that this effect holds true for future in-group friendships. The study highlights the importance of contact capacity for whether people engage in intergroup contact and the contribution of social network analysis to contact research.

T1  - Racialized perceptions of the police: Measuring the dimensions of juveniles’ perceptions of the police
TT  - Racialized perceptions of the police
AN  - 2193210304
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine differences in latent structures/dimensions in public perceptions of the police by race/ethnicity and level of identification with a given race/ethnic group.Design/methodology/approachTo identify differences in dimensions of juveniles’ perceptions of the police by the sub-samples, factor analyses were conducted utilizing data from the Gang Resistance Education and Training program evaluation.FindingsThe results show that minority juveniles have a relatively fragmented dimensional structure for the construct of perceptions of the police, while white juveniles have a unidimensional structure. Furthermore, moderate within-group differences in structures were found among African–American juveniles.Research limitations/implicationsThe results of the current study call for further examination of racial invariant assumptions in criminology. Since individual dimensions constituting perceptions of the police vary by race/ethnicity, those dimensions may potentially have unique associations with endogenous variables (e.g. criminality and cooperation with the police) according to individuals’ racial/ethnic membership.Practical implicationsPolice should clearly understand individuals’ dimensions constituting perceptions of the police and should identify dimensions that greatly impact precursors to compliance and cooperation with police such as perceived police legitimacy or perceived risk of sanction.Originality/valueIndividuals’ dimensions constituting perceptions of the police have significant implications on the construction of measures and their associations with other variables; however, racial differences in these dimensions have not been explored since Sullivan et al.’s (1987) research about three decades ago. In addition, the current study examined within-race differences in the dimensions constituting perceptions of the police.

T1  - Identity Inclusiveness and Centrality: Investigating Identity Correlates of Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration Policies
AN  - 2151163732
AB  - Social psychology highlights ingroup identity as an important determinant of intergroup attitudes and relations; however, research has demonstrated that its effects can be positive, negative, or nonexistent depending on how such identity is conceptualized. This research explores how national identity inclusiveness (Study 1) and centrality (Study 2) are associated with immigration related attitudes in school and countrywide settings, respectively. Study 1 showed that teachers’ inclusive (i.e., overlapping) identities regarding their immigrant students related to positive attitudes toward these students, but not to attitudes about immigrants in general or immigration policy preferences. Study 2 found that national identity centrality was related to negative attitudes toward the social impact of immigrants, and to higher support for policies inhibiting the social inclusion of immigrants in the receiving community. Combined, these studies highlight the importance of considering different conceptualizations of ingroup identity in identifying relations to immigration‐based attitudes. Moreover, the studies highlight the value of promoting inclusive identities when aiming to improve attitudes toward immigrants. We conclude by discussing a new approach for promoting inclusive identities by framing immigrants as indispensable to the receiving community.

T1  - Racial/Ethnic Discrimination and Well-Being During Adolescence: A Meta-Analytic Review
AN  - 2126908876
AB  - This meta-analytic study systematically investigates the relations between perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and socioemotional distress, academics, and risky health behaviors during adolescence, and potential variation in these relations. The study included 214 peer-reviewed articles, theses, and dissertations, with 489 unique effect sizes on 91,338 unique adolescents. Random-effects meta-analyses across 11 separate indicators of well-being identified significant detrimental effects. Greater perceptions of racial/ethnic discrimination were linked to more depressive and internalizing symptoms; greater psychological distress; poorer self-esteem; lower academic achievement and engagement; less academic motivation; greater engagement in externalizing behaviors, risky sexual behaviors, and substance use; and more associations with deviant peers. Metaregression and subgroup analyses indicated differences by race/ethnicity, Gender × Race/Ethnicity interactions, developmental stage, timing of retrospective measurement of discrimination, and country. Overall, this study highlights the pernicious effects of racial/ethnic discrimination for adolescents across developmental domains and suggests who is potentially at greater risk.

T1  - Cracking the Racial Code: Black Threat, White Rights and the Lexicon of American Politics
AN  - 2153659646
AB  - Racially coded language that appeals to racial bias without open bigotry has a long history in the politics of the United States. Politicians intentionally activate the latent racial biases of both racial conservatives and center‐left liberals without explicitly talking about race. Conservative positions on significant policy areas have shifted over time on the basis of coded racial appeals. Fundamental rights are coded as white rights. Government actions to aid the poor or reduce discrimination are coded as black threats. The racial dimension explains the changing positions of American conservatism on gun rights, crime and mass incarceration, immigration, the welfare state, federalism, and economic policy. White racial identity, mobilized by coded political talk, restrains the potential for cross‐racial coalitions and perpetuates the political repression of nonwhite Americans.

T1  - Children’s Helping Behavior in an Ethnic Intergroup Context: Evidence for Outgroup Helping
AN  - 2089727195
AB  - Two studies examined when and why children (10 –13 years) help ethnic in-group and out-group peers. In Study 1 (n 163) children could help an out-group or in-group peer with a word-guessing game by entering codes into a computer. While children evaluated the out-group more negatively than the in-group, they helped out-group peers more than in-group peers. Study 2 (n 117) conceptually replicated the findings of Study 1. Additionally the results suggest that when children endorsed the stereotype that the out-group is “less smart,” this increased their intention to help out-group peers and it decreased their intention to enter codes for in-group peers. The results suggest that the specific content of a negative stereotype can guide helping responses toward out-group and in-group members.

T1  - 'Policing the poor' and 'poor policing' in a global city
AN  - 2025298640
AB  - Singapore's soft authoritarian style of governance provides for interesting analysis of its state-society, interethnic, and intra-ethnic relations, which adds to the literature on policing deviant behavior in liberal democracies. The notion of 'policing the poor' emerges, and this seems to be the premise adopted not only by the Singapore state but also by the poor themselves. This concept of 'policing the poor' exists in tension with the idea of 'poor policing' as the underprivileged too devise strategies to enact structures of social control in their everyday lives.

T1  - Teacher-child relationships in the context of poverty: the role of frequent school mobility
AN  - 2012857618
AB  - Children's relationships with their teachers are critical for classroom-based learning, but children growing up in poverty may be at risk for lower-quality relationships with teachers. Little is known about how changing schools, one poverty-related risk, affects teacher-child relationships. Using growth curve models that control for a host of other poverty-related risks, this study explores the association between children changing schools frequently (defined as three or more school moves) between preschool and third grade and the quality of their relationships with their teachers over these five years in a low-income, ethnic-minority sample. Children who frequently moved schools were reported to be less close to their teachers in third grade and experienced steeper declines in closeness than children who did not change schools frequently. Moreover, the effects of frequent school mobility at third grade were robust to other poverty-related risks, including residential mobility, parental education risk, family income, and single-parent households. Changing schools was unrelated to children's conflict with teachers. We discuss these findings in the context of policies that support students' transitions when changing schools.

T1  - Agency versus structure in reconciliation
AN  - 1993976077
AB  - Reconciliation theories, discourses and practices prioritize agency over structure. They suggest that inter-group conflicts involving deep cleavages such as ethnicity, race and religion can be resolved by processes involving inter-personal contacts, and achieving a desired end-state of shared values, narratives and identity. Contact between group members under optimal conditions of parity and trust is viewed as the critical tool for change. By problematizing conflictual identities and social relations as agential and inter-personal, conflicts are decontextualized from their structural environment. Structural segregation provides us with a bridging concept between the agency factors, structural dynamics of conflict, and the obstacles to post-conflict reconciliation. The case of Northern Ireland, often elevated to the status of a model for conflict resolution, is analysed to show how structural segregation is the critical barrier to the optimal group interactions envisaged by agential reconciliation, as it sustains low inter-group trust and political polarization.

T1  - Sexual Prejudice in Portugal: Results from the First Wave European Study on Heterosexual’s Attitudes Toward Same-Gender Marriage and Parenting
AN  - 1992789076
AB  - The objective of this study was to document the prevalence and evolution of sexual prejudice toward gay men and lesbian, same-gender marriage, and same-gender parenting among a large sample of Portuguese young adults. The sample consisted of 704 self-identified heterosexual individuals (24% men and 76% women), aged between 18 and 30 years (M = 22; SD = 3), who participated in an online survey. ANOVA results revealed that women were less sexually prejudiced, were less likely to endorse social etiological beliefs of homosexuality, and were more supportive of same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting than were men. Further mediation analysis revealed that the effects of gender, religiosity, importance of religious beliefs, and political leaning on the support for same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting were partially mediated by etiological beliefs and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The complexity of attitudes toward same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting was highlighted, indicating how attitudes toward gay men and lesbians and the belief that homosexuality is controllable impact on the support for same-gender parented families. These results are important to inform affirmative polities designed to correct inequalities and recognize same-gender families.

T1  - Ethnogenesis and Social Difference in the Andean Late Intermediate Period (AD 1100-1450): A Bioarchaeological Study of Cranial Modification in the Colca Valley, Peru
AN  - 2001355612
AB  - It has long been recognized that the Inka incorporated diverse peoples into their empire, but how these ethnic groups developed historically during the political upheaval of the preceding Late Intermediate Period (LIP; AD 1100-1450) is only now receiving commensurate attention. This study explores how changes in cranial modification, a correlate of embodied identity in the Andes, made possible new forms of political solidarity and social inequality in the late prehispanic Colca Valley. Bioarchaeological and radiometric data reveal a sharp rise in modification prevalence, from 39.2% (N = 97) during the early LIP (AD 1150-1300) to 73.7% (N = 114) during the late LIP (AD 1300-1450). Greater standardization of head-shaping practices echoes broader patterns of identity formation across the south-central highlands and may have provided a symbolic basis for the cooperation of elite groups during an era of intensive conflict. However, additional lines of archaeological and bioarchaeological data suggest that the formation of a more encompassing identity did not homogenize lived experiences. The symbolic boundaries enacted by head shaping intersected other forms of collective identity and likely contributed to growing social inequality prior to the period of Inka imperial expansion.

T1  - The Signaling Effect of Pro se Status
AN  - 1962133973
AB  - When claimants press their claims without counsel, they fail at virtually every stage of civil litigation and overwhelmingly fail to obtain meaningful access to justice. This research program harnesses psychological science to experimentally test a novel hypothesis: mainly, a claimant's pro se status itself sends a signal that biases decision making about the claimant and her claim. We conducted social psychological experiments with the public (N=157), law students (N=198), and employment discrimination lawyers (N=39), holding the quality and merit of a Title VII sex discrimination case constant. In so doing, we examined whether a claimant's pro se status itself shapes stereotypes held about the claimant and biases decision making about settlement awards. These experiments reveal that pro se status influences stereotypes of claimants and settlement awards received. Moreover, the signaling effect of pro se status is exacerbated by socialization in the legal profession. Among law-trained individuals (i.e., law students and lawyers), a claimant's pro se status generates negative stereotypes about the claimant and these negative stereotypes explain the adverse effect of pro se status on decision making about settlement awards.

T1  - Intergroup Contact as a Predictor of Violent and Nonviolent Collective Action: Evidence From Syrian Refugees and Lebanese Nationals
AN  - 1961008037
AB  - Recent research has shown that positive intergroup contact can undermine social change efforts among disadvantaged group members. We extend past this finding by investigating how frequent positive contact relates to both violent and nonviolent collective action, among both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, over and above outgroup attitudes. We examined these links in a survey of Lebanese nationals (advantaged group) and Syrian refugees (disadvantaged group) in the context of a severe economic crisis affecting both groups. We replicated previous research showing that contact predicts outgroup attitudes positively and more strongly among advantaged than among disadvantaged group members. Of importance, we also found evidence suggesting that the relationship between positive contact and collective action may depend on group status and on collective action type. Frequent positive contact reduced nonviolent collective action tendencies among disadvantaged group members but not among advantaged group members. However, more positive frequent contact was linked to lower violence support among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members. These results help shed new light on the potential benefits and limits of intergroup contact as a social change tool. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07260-001]

T1  - Intergroup Contact and the Potential for Post-Conflict Reconciliation: Studies in Northern Ireland and South Africa
AN  - 1961000947
AB  - With surveys of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, and Whites and Blacks in South Africa, this research examines how both contact quality and exposure to intergroup conflict predict attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors relevant to intergroup reconciliation. Across both studies, contact of higher quality predicted more positive intergroup attitudes, trust, more positive perceptions of outgroup intentions in working toward peace, and greater engagement in reconciliation efforts. These effects were observed when controlling for exposure to conflict-related violence in one's neighborhood growing up, and the extent to which one has personally suffered due to the conflict. Implications of these findings for future work on intergroup contact and reconciliation efforts are discussed. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07261-001]

T1  - Opposition to Irish Travellers' halting sites in the Republic of Ireland: Realistic group conflict or symbolic politics?
AN  - 1920187801
AB  - Widely reviled by even well-educated citizens of the Republic of Ireland, Travellers rank at the very bottom of today's multiracial Irish society according to most any attitudinal measure. This research note uses multivariate ordinary least-squares regression of the 2007 Irish National Election Study to test two prominent explanations of such prejudice. Overall, data analysis confirms the theories of realistic group conflict and symbolic politics about equally. In particular, unemployment, occupation, and perceptions of crime support the first interpretation, while results for conservatism and multiculturalism lend credence to the second.

T1  - The interplay between objective and subjective ethno-cultural diversity in predicting intergroup relations
AN  - 2076973498
AB  - This nation-wide probability sample survey study among Finnish majority group members (N = 335) focused on the interactive effects of objective and subjective ethno-cultural diversity on three indicators of intergroup relations: outgroup attitudes, perceived group and personal discrimination, and outgroup trust. Complementing previous research that has mostly examined a linear relationship between cultural diversity and intergroup relations, special attention was given to moderate diversity contexts, which are claimed to pose different challenges to intergroup dynamics than high- and low-diversity contexts. It was hypothesised that majority group members who live in contexts characterised by moderate levels of objective diversity but subjectively perceive high levels of diversity will report more negative outgroup attitudes, lower levels of outgroup trust and higher levels of discrimination, as compared to those living in low- or high-diversity contexts. The hypothesis was confirmed for perceived group discrimination and outgroup trust. The results highlight the need to acknowledge possible non-linear relationships between diversity and intergroup relations.

T1  - 'There is no racism here': public discourses on racism, immigrants and integration in Denmark
AN  - 1862142742
AB  - Jensen, Weibel and Vitus's article critically discusses contemporary Danish policies aimed at the elimination of ethnoracial discrimination, drawing on policy analyses and qualitative interviews with local and national authorities in Denmark. It illustrates how questions of discrimination and racism are marginalized and de-legitimized within the dominant integration discourse, resulting in the marginalization of anti-racism in policymaking. The side-stepping of racism is being naturalized in public policies through strategies of denial and by addressing discrimination as a product of ignorance and individual prejudice rather than as embedded in social structures. The authors examine how immigration, integration and (anti-)racism as concepts and phenomena are understood and addressed in Danish public policies and discourses. Despite denials of racism in Denmark, Jensen, Weibel and Vitus show that, based on re-definitions of identities and relations, it continues to exist and is evident in public debates and policies on immigration and integration.

T1  - Supporting the democratic political organisation of Muslim immigrants: the perspective of Muslims in the Netherlands and Germany
AN  - 2076977383
AB  - Using data from three survey studies, this paper examines the support for the democratic political organisation of Muslims among Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and Germany (Study 3). Using a social psychological perspective, support is examined in relation to religious group identification, Muslim linked fate, perceived discrimination, fundamentalist religious belief, and host national identification. The findings in all three studies show support for the political organisation of Muslims. Furthermore, higher religious group identification and higher linked fate were associated with stronger support. More discrimination and more fundamentalist beliefs were also associated with stronger support, and part of these associations was mediated by linked fate. National identification was not associated with support for the political organisation of Muslims.

T1  - Improving Intergroup Relations with Extended Contact among Young Children: Mediation by Intergroup Empathy and Moderation by Direct Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1855255832
AB  - A correlational study investigated extended contact as a strategy to improve outgroup attitudes and stereotyping and to prepare children for future contact. Additional aims were to investigate when and why the effects of extended contact occur. In particular, intergroup empathy was tested as a mediator and direct contact (i.e. cross-group friendship) as a moderator of extended contact. Participants were Italian and immigrant elementary school children. Results showed that extended contact was associated with improved intergroup empathy, which, in turn, was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, stereotypes and behavioural intentions. These effects were significant only among participants with a low or moderate level of direct contact. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Longitudinal Associations Between Parental Monitoring Discrepancy and Delinquency: An Application of the Latent Congruency Model
AN  - 1837165092
AB  - Studies have shown that discrepancies (relative concordance or discordance) between parent and adolescent ratings are predictive of problem behaviors; monitoring, in particular, has been consistently linked to them. The current study tested whether discrepancies in perceptions of maternal monitoring, rated by mothers and youth at age 12, foretold delinquency (rule breaking) at age 15, and whether parental closeness and conflict predicted higher discrepancies, and indirectly, higher delinquency. The final study sample used the NICHD longitudinal dataset with N = 966 youth (50.1 % female) and their mothers (80.1 % European American, 12.9 % African American, 7 % other ethnicity). The analytic approach consisted of an extension and application of the Latent Congruency Model (LCM) to estimate monitoring discrepancies as well as age 15 delinquency scores. Findings showed that age 12 monitoring discrepancy was predictive of age 15 delinquency for both boys and girls based on youth reports, but not for maternal reports. Age 11 closeness predicted age 12 monitoring discrepancy, which served as a mediator for its effect on age 15 adolescent-reported delinquency. Thus, based on the rigorous LCM analytic approach which seeks to minimize the effects by competing explanations and to maximize precision in providing robust estimates, rates of perceived discordance in parenting behaviors during early adolescence matter in understanding variability in adolescent delinquency during middle adolescence.

T1  - Ethnic minorities and brothers in arms: competition and homophily in the military
AN  - 1827655778
AB  - Although the solidarity of brothers in arms is an important feature of the military, when it comes to ethnic minorities there is a pivotal paradox. On the one hand the military aims at drawing boundaries between soldiers and civilians by blurring existing ethnic and racial divisions inside the military. On the other hand the military is a highly national institution which prides itself on conservative values. Can these contradictions work? And how soldiers understand them? This paper examines the construction of ethnic boundaries in inter-group relations by focusing on the tension between ethnic hierarchy and competition versus homophily - the preference for maintaining ties with persons who are similar. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews with Dutch soldiers before and during deployment in Bosnia and Kosovo I ask when each strategy is put into work and why.

T1  - Impact of Interviews on Heterosexual Students' Expressions of Cultural Competency
AN  - 1847465532
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the effects of a cultural competency intervention on dental pre-doctoral students' attitudes toward individuals of a different sexual orientation. 22 heterosexual students interviewed gay or lesbian individuals and wrote reflective text. Results illustrated that participants found that their interviewees had "surprisingly similar" beliefs and values - especially in the areas of religion and family. Because of their "similar values," these students expressed respect toward their interviewees who were "so different" than themselves. This conclusion of "sameness" forced them to see homosexuals as people, rather than a stigmatized invisible outgroup, mitigating sexual prejudice.

T1  - Submission from the IRR to the Labour Party Inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, including Islamophobia
AN  - 1830031340
AB  - Following a number of accusations of anti-Semitism against British Labour Party activists, including former London mayor Ken Livingstone, an inquiry into racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia was instituted by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in May 2016 - to be chaired by Shami Chakrabarti (former director of Liberty). This article consists of the submission to the inquiry from the Institute of Race Relations which suggests the parameters within which recent accusations of anti-Semitism should be analysed: the personalising of racism in society at large and the gradual blurring of the line between what incites hatred and what merely gives offence. While racism is offensive, not everything which gives offence is per se racist. The challenge for the Labour Party is to strike the correct balance between education against prejudice, protection from racial hatred and freedom of speech. The IRR believes that the Party would be in danger of losing that balance if it were to adopt the proposition (recently advocated by Eric Pickles, former secretary of state for communities and local government) to extend the definition of anti-Semitism to include particular types of criticism of the state of Israel.

T1  - Friends or Foes: The Impact of Political Ideology and Immigrant Friends on Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
AN  - 1868554422
AB  - In recent years, an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment has been witnessed in the United States, particularly from politically conservative groups. According to intergroup contact theory, increased contact between in-group and out-group members, especially cross-group friendships, has been found to reduce intergroup prejudice. This study analyzed nationally representative U.S.-based data (n = 1,000) from the Transatlantic Trends Survey, 2013 to examine if having immigrant friends interacted with political ideology, such that having immigrant friends weakened the association between conservative ideology and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings revealed that immigrant friends and political ideology each had a significant but opposite main effect on anti-immigrant sentiment, but that having immigrant friends did not moderate or buffer the effects of political ideology on anti-immigrant sentiment. Thus, aligning with a conservative political ideology is associated with anti-immigrant sentiment irrespective of having immigrant friends. Strategies to increase intergroup contact and promote cross-group friendships are made and directions for future research are offered.

T1  - Multiracial people and their partners in Britain: Extending the link between intermarriage and integration?
AN  - 1802365701
AB  - There are now a growing number of studies on intermarriage in Western multi-ethnic societies, especially in countries with post-colonial migrants (and their descendants). Intermarriage is of great interest to analysts because a group's tendency to partner across ethnic boundaries is a key indicator of the social distance between groups in a multi-ethnic society. However, theorizing on intermarriage is typically premised upon the union (usually) of a White and non-White individual. We know little, therefore, about what happens the next generation down: the unions of multiracial people, who are the children of intermarried couples. With whom do multiracial people partner? Furthermore, are multiracial individuals who are partnered with White people different in their outlooks, identifications, and socialization of their children, from those who have ethnic minority partners? I draw upon some findings from a Leverhulme-funded research project on multiracial people and their experiences as parents in Britain.

T1  - Dual Consciousness, Social Mobility, and the Experiences of Middle-Income African Americans in the Post-Civil Rights Era
AN  - 1929870116
AB  - This article examines how African Americans who grew up in middle-income households during the modern post-Civil Rights Era conceptualize their opportunities to get ahead and how they explain downward mobility. Drawing upon 70 in-depth interviews with African American men and women, it identifies a dual consciousness that shapes respondents' understandings of who gets ahead and why. While the majority of respondents believe that African Americans face persistent structural inequality, they also believe that members of their group are responsible for their own outcomes. They emphasize the importance of employing individualistic mobility strategies for advancement. They also draw upon broad definitions of success to support an understanding that everyone can achieve some level of success if they work hard enough. When assessing their own mobility trajectories and the mobility trajectories of others they know, respondents tend to attribute individual-level factors to movement up and down the socioeconomic ladder.

T1  - Sexual democracy, cultural alterity and the politics of everyday life in Amsterdam
AN  - 1786264689
AB  - Cultural and religious alterity, associated with postcolonial and labour migrants and their descendants, has become a matter of growing contention across Europe. Various scholars have discussed the situation in the Netherlands as exemplary of European anxieties about national cohesion and cultural homogeneity in which culturalized and racialized conceptions of the nation and its Others are central. Mepschen examines how these public discourses and politics are played out in the context of a pluri-ethnic, working-class neighbourhood in Amsterdam New West. Taking an ethnographic approach, he points to the ways in which 'white' Dutch citizens-imagined and construed as autochthonous, literally 'born from the Earth itself'-come to recognize themselves in, identify with and appropriate the images and rhetorics that circulate within culturalist, autochthonic symbolic economies. Following up on his previous work, Mepschen focuses here on the role played by discourses surrounding sexual liberty and LGBTIQ rights in these dynamics. Continuing with an ethnographic approach, he foregrounds the complex interplay of religion, secularism and sexuality in the 'making' and 'doing' of autochthony in an everyday, local context, a complexity that is lost in much of the existing analyses of Dutch multiculturalism.

T1  - Opportunity Costs and Latinas' Family Formation Attitudes
AN  - 1785500848
AB  - Cultural ideals and acculturation influence Latinas' fertility-related attitudes and family size preferences within the context of the U.S. social and economic structure. In this context, there may be "costs" associated with enacting preferences favoring family building over other opportunities or demands. This article draws on data collected from focus groups conducted with college-educated Latinas in the Bronx, New York (n = 16) to demonstrate a conflict between cultural values and opportunity costs. The voices of these women not only echo an awareness of opportunity costs associated with childbearing (especially at a young age or having many children) but also acknowledge the influences of culture on the attitudes and behaviors of Latinas. In this conflict, ethnic identities are challenged and signs of internalized racism emerge.

T1  - Brief report: Ethnic identity and aggression in adolescence: A longitudinal perspective
AN  - 1768627119
AB  - Ethnic identity has been found to relate to many positive psychological outcomes, such as self-esteem and well-being, but little has been said about negative social outcomes such as aggression, nor have these relations been tested across time. The current study examined the concurrent and longitudinal relations between ethnic identity and peer nominated aggression at two time points with a two-year interval (8th and 10th grades) in a sample of 125 Israeli adolescents with an immigration background (56.8% girls). As hypothesized, ethnic identity related negatively to aggression at both T1 and T2. In addition, ethnic identity predicted a relative decrease in future aggression. Given these findings, the article suggests the importance of strengthening ethnic identity through interventions and educational programs.

T1  - Ethnic Identity and Language Variations of the Russian Germans in the Kirov Region
AN  - 2188110955
AB  - Currently, the process of globalization, intense intercultural contacts, changes in social structure, and internationalization of higher education influence inter-ethnic relations, ethnic identity, as well as language changes. These processes can be observed among the Russian-Germans living in the territory of the Kirov region. Their investigation started in 1999 and is currently going on. The relevance of the study is due to the significance of the linguistic interaction at the present stage of the German language development in Russia, where for decades the German language has been developing and changing in linguistic enclaves environment. In this regard, this paper aims to explore ethnic and linguistic identity of German bilinguals living in the environment of a foreign language, different dialect, or different confession in isolation from the main ethnic array. The leading methods in the study were socio-differentiated analysis, as well as comparative and statistical methods used while correlating the dialect systems under review to other German dialectal systems, literary German language, as well as with the Russian language. In the study, we came to the conclusion that the priority layer in the structure of the ethnic identity of Russian Germans in the Kirov region includes the following distinctive features: common territory, language, religion, family life, folklore, crafts, norms of behavior, common historical destiny and common psychological makeup. The language of the German ethnic minority, who live in the territory of the Kirov region, is unique and peculiar. It is characterized, above all, by mixed dialects in a foreign language environment and by a variety of their existing forms of. The paper is of practical value to scholars dealing with the German island dialects.

T1  - Beyond the Flesh: Contemporary Representations of the Black Female Body in Afro-Brazilian Literature: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1822653060
AB  - This essay takes an intersectional and transnational approach to analyze how selected poetic texts by contemporary Afro-Brazilian writers Conceiçâo Evaristo, Esmeralda Ribeiro Cristiane Sobral, Miriam Alves, and Elisa Lucinda (re)design portrayals of Afro-descendant/black female bodies. As cultural artifacts, I argue that these poetic/political constructs give evidence of Afro-Brazilian female bodies as historical: on one hand, they represent the embodiment of "otherness" as they historically differ from the standards of(white) "normalcy;" on the other hand, they carry both the silenced histories of racial and sexual exploitation and the appeal of hyper-sexualized and exoticized stereotypes. I am also interested in discussing how these writings/writers articulate notions and images connected to discourses of mestiçagem in order to rewrite black women's bodies into new historical perspectives; how they question long-established national narratives of racial harmony; and how they build dialogues with a more diasporic understanding of black women's cultural and political networking across the Americas. Finally, this essay explores the ways in which contemporary Afro-Brazilian literature opens to the reaffirmation of black female subjectivities from multiple cultural perspectives and identities.

T1  - Testing the Relationship between Nationalism and Racism: Greek-Cypriot Students' National/Ethnic Identities and Attitudes to Ethnic Out-groups
AN  - 2076972544
AB  - This article builds on a growing body of research that shows an intrinsic but complex relationship between the concepts and the ideologies of nationalism and racism. In doing so, it investigates how different, meaningful national and ethnic in-group identifications of a dominant national/ethnic group (Greek-Cypriots) within a given national context (Cyprus) influence their perceptions of different, meaningful ethnic and racial minority out-groups. Logistic regression analysis of quantitative survey data with secondary school children (N = 738) in Cyprus shows that the relationship between national/ethnic in-group identifications and out-group perceptions varies according to the social and political relationships between particular national/ethnic in- and out-groups. The findings show that future research on the relationship between nationalism and racism should consider the overlap between and context specific nature of national and ethnic in-group identification processes and the historical, political relationships between different in- and out-groups.

T1  - Nazl(dotless i)'s photographic games: Said and art history in a contrapuntal mode
AN  - 1680152833; 201514052
AB  - Through a focus on photographic portraits commissioned in the late nineteenth century by the Ottoman-Egyptian Princess Nazl(dotless i) Han(dotless i)m, Roberts analyses the ways they tested Ottoman and western conventions. An examination of Nazl(dotless i)'s strategic engagement with photography in this period positions her within the often-separated domains of Egyptian nationalism, Ottoman political reform, western Orientalist art and a proto-feminist moment of Egyptian women's history. One of the striking things about the Nazl(dotless i) portraits is their transgressive inventiveness. This is transgression as Edward Said defines it, with an emphasis on crossing boundaries, testing and challenging limits, and cutting across expectations. Nazl(dotless i)'s inventiveness is apparent through her canny experimentation with the codes of portrait photography and the ways she deploys her portraits as tokens of exchange within her culture and with her European interlocutors. Roberts argues that Nazl(dotless i) Han(dotless i)m's use of photography operates in a contrapuntal mode in the Saidean sense of a simultaneity of voices that sound against, as well as with, each other. Over the last three decades Said's writings have provided a crucial methodological framework for the critique of western Orientalist visual culture. Recently art historians have repositioned this corpus of western imagery in relation to art by practitioners from the region and addressed cultural exchanges. Said's seminal text Orientalism has been pivotal within these debates. Yet it is not so much this landmark book, but rather Said's writings on music, in which we can find an alternative approach to cross-cultural exchange. By transposing this model into the domain of art history, Roberts engages with his notion of reading contrapuntally. Said was interested in the broader applicability of this term, although its potential as an interpretive model for the visual arts remains unexamined. Through this case study of Nazl(dotless i) Han(dotless i)m's photographs, Roberts reassesses the value of Said's writings on music for understanding nineteenth-century visual culture.

T1  - Symbolic Racism and Emotional Responses to the 2012 Presidential Candidates
AN  - 1708527405; 201528667
AB  - Racial attitudes toward African American candidates are partially explained by symbolic racism, which has replaced overt racism in responses to these candidates. However, as typically operationalized, symbolic racism as applied to candidate assessments fails to account for the emotions generated by a political campaign. Symbolic racism's effects are moderated when emotional responses to Barack Obama are included in a candidate evaluation model, while emotions remain an important predictor. While symbolic racism and negative emotions lower evaluations, the presence of the positive emotions generated by the 2012 campaign counteracted both. Inclusion of both symbolic racism and emotion is necessary to understand perceptions of Obama as a black presidential candidate. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racism: Less is More
AN  - 1667951018; 201509511
AB  - Racism has been in sharp decline in recent decades yet the word, as accusation, is used more than ever. The word/idea needs to be more restrictively defined and kept for when it is really needed. When almost everyone is a racist, no one is. To this end we need to distinguish more clearly between the greater comfort people often feel among familiar people and places and active hostility towards outsider ethnic groups. We also need a more discriminating language to describe the spectrum of discrimination. Prejudice, clannishness-even in some instances discrimination itself-should be regarded as sentiments and behaviours that are distinct from proper racism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity and Personal Contacts at Work and at School in the Netherlands: a Comparison of Natives and Ethnic Minorities
AN  - 1542002349; 201426895
AB  - We examined to what extent ethnic diversity in neighborhoods and municipalities in the Netherlands is related to personal contacts at work and at school with the ethnic in- and out-groups, among the native majority as well as ethnic minorities. Constrict theory, ethnic competition theory, and contact theory are used to derive hypotheses. A unique Dutch dataset with an oversampling of two large minority groups is analyzed with three-level multilevel regression models. The results indicate that ethnic diversity at the municipality level is negatively related to personal contacts with native colleagues and schoolmates, but positively related to personal contacts with colleagues and schoolmates from other ethnic groups. Ethnic diversity at the neighborhood level is not related to personal contacts at work and at school. This applies equally to native respondents and Turks and Moroccans, rejecting Putnam's hunkering down hypothesis and ethnic competition theory. Instead, ethnic diversity increases meeting opportunities with ethnic minorities while decreasing meeting opportunities with the native majority. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic boundary making as strategic action: reply to my critics
AN  - 1551001597; 201429149
AB  - I am grateful to the five distinguished colleagues who took the time to read the book carefully and to offer insightful criticism and comments. Most of the points aim at definitional problems or matters of theoretical architecture. Perhaps I should therefore state at the outset of this reply that the book was written in the hope of going beyond discussing the abstract and general matters that have preoccupied the field in the past and of moving towards an empirically oriented, comparative analysis of the variety of forms under which the ethnic phenomenon appears. I am relieved to note that all five reviewers agree that the book has made some progress towards achieving this goal. Of course I will engage my critics on the terrain that they choose, not only as a matter of conversational politeness, but because they indeed raise important and interesting issues, even though many relate only tangentially, as Brubaker notes, to the main themes and ambitions of the book. I will group similar comments together and respond as succinctly as possible. In the final section, remaining points raised by individual reviewers will be addressed in a more cursory way.

T1  - Skin-Color Prejudice and Within-Group Racial Discrimination: Historical and Current Impact on Latino/a Populations
AN  - 1520343162; 201412972
AB  - The psychological literature on colorism, a form of within-group racial discrimination, is sparse. In an effort to contribute to this understudied area and highlight its significance, a concise and selective review of the history of colorism in Latin America is provided. Specifically, three historical eras (i.e., conquest, colonization, and post-colonization) are summarized. In each era, the establishment of racial and ethnic stratification and its consequences for Latino/as of indigenous and African descent are discussed. Connections between today's color-blind racial attitudes and mestizaje, or the mixing of races, is underscored to demonstrate how these strategies have been used, historically and today, to deny and minimize skin-color privilege. The article culminates with questions to help readers reflect and engage in dialogue about colorism as a prelude to recommendations for stimulating future research on this significant yet neglected topic.

T1  - Arab-American male identity negotiations: caught in the crossroads of ethnicity, religion, nationality and current contexts
AN  - 1551001293; 201429223
AB  - We examine how the identities of male adolescents of Arab descent (ArD) relate to their current physical and phenomenological contexts and to the negative fallout from recent ethnicity-related political events. Seventy-seven ArD adolescents in seven United States middle schools with varying proportions of ArD students participated in focus-group interviews. Qualitative analysis provides evidence that adolescents' social identities depended on complex combinations of personal, situational, and contextual factors. Findings extend Spencer's PVEST theory, demonstrating that the salience of adolescents' national, pan-Arab, hyphenated Arab-American, or assimilated American identity stems from phenomenological experiences within their current context and from the cognitive processes and associated affects of their prior experiences in other proximal and distal contexts.

T1  - Attitudes towards Muslim Immigrants: Evidence from Survey Experiments across Four Countries
AN  - 1520341357; 201413510
AB  - There has been much negative focus on Muslims in public debates in the West and it is a matter of great interest to examine whether Muslims are particularly exposed to prejudice and hostility. Since it is known that immigrants tend to be exposed to prejudice, and practically all Muslims living in Western countries are either immigrants or are of immigrant origin, it is useful to analyse whether Muslims are viewed more negatively than immigrants in general. Using data from survey experiments conducted in Norway, Sweden, the USA and the United Kingdom in 2009, we find that Muslim immigrants were not more negatively viewed than immigrants in general. In the two countries that have experienced large-scale attacks by Islamic extremists, the USA and the United Kingdom, the expressed levels of anti-Muslim attitudes were actually lower than the levels of general anti-immigrant attitudes. We find that individual traits that influence general xenophobia also influence anti-Muslim attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Major Determinants of Uyghur Ethnic Consciousness in Urumchi
AN  - 1504422080; 201405555
AB  - Rising Uyghur ethnic consciousness in the post-1978 era is believed to cause tense Uyghur-Han relations and conflicts in Xinjiang. There are different accounts linking rising Uyghur consciousness with variables such as Han migration into Xinjiang, ethnic inequalities, Uyghur language, and Islamic religiosity. Yet there is no concrete effort to summarize, elaborate, and verify these accounts. Nor is there a quantitative study of the levels of Uyghur ethnic consciousness in Xinjiang. Using data from a survey (N = 799) conducted in Urumchi in 2007, this paper shows a high level of ethnic consciousness among Uyghurs. It also shows that Uyghur consciousness is based more on cultural and psychological properties than on instrumental sentiments. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women's achievement and persistence in engineering
AN  - 1680152015; 201517734
AB  - Women almost always comprise a minority in engineering programs and a smaller percentage of women pursue engineering than other science and technology majors. The culture of engineering departments and negative stereotypes of women's engineering and mathematical ability have been identified as factors that inhibit women's entry into engineering and cause them to leave the major. Even for women who stay, stereotype threat or the anxiety of confirming a negative stereotype can decrease academic performance. To more fully understand this dynamic, we examined four factors associated with stereotype threat (engineering identification, gender identification, gender stereotype endorsement, and engineering ability perceptions) to determine how they impacted women's achievement and persistence in engineering at the end of their first year of an engineering program. Participants included 363 first-year general engineering students from a large public university. Students completed a questionnaire near the end of their first year. Results indicated that there were differences between men and women for gender stereotype endorsement and engineering ability perceptions, with men more likely to hold negative stereotypes of women's engineering abilities and women more likely to report higher perceptions of their engineering abilities. Engineering identification was a significant predictor of persistence in engineering, and engineering ability perceptions were significant predictors of achievement; the relationships were stronger for women than men. The fact that neither gender identification nor gender stereotype endorsement were related to achievement or persistence in engineering indicated that they were less important factors for first-year women engineering students than engineering identification and engineering ability perceptions.

T1  - Prejudice toward American Muslims: An Integrated Threat Analysis
AN  - 1718067858; 201530688
AB  - This study explores prejudice toward American Muslims. Prejudice is conceptualized using Stephan and Stephan's integrated threat theory (ITT). ITT identifies four kinds of threat that can lead to prejudice: realistic threats, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety. Data were gathered in the United States (N = 281) among self-identified Christians. Findings confirm: 1) a positive correlation between real and symbolic threats, and stereotypes, 2) increased contact with an immigrant group, in this case Muslims, is negatively correlated with perceptions of real and symbolic threat, and 3) levels of prejudice differ based on level of education. Theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between prejudice, interpersonal contact/communication, and education are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - European social cohesions
AN  - 1448996722; 201342797
AB  - Contemporary public debates on social cohesion in Europe at both the European Union (EU) and member-state level tend to reduce the topic to the 'problem' of immigration by third-country nationals, and the integration of these immigrants and their descendants into European national societies. These debates often emphasize a culturalist perspective on the social cohesion of national societies based on core national cultures, identities and histories that pre-date the mass immigration of non-EU/European Economic Area immigrants, with social cohesion depending on their identifiable assimilation to this core set of values, beliefs and behaviours. This culture-based perspective on social cohesion has become an integral component of the neoliberal reorganization of the interventionist state in Europe that both punishes the native poor and coerces the immigrant third-country national as it frees markets and restructures the European welfare state. Yet, an examination of European social cohesion policies across seven policy domains suggests that the problem of social cohesion has little to do either with the issue of immigration or of immigrant and ethnic minority integration. However, it does have a lot to do with increasing inequalities and insecurities in European societies that result from neoliberal political economic policies. Drawing on Emile Durkheim's seminal discussion of social cohesion that includes structural and cultural dimensions, Boucher analyses the seven policy domains of European social cohesions within a functionalist framework that highlights inconsistencies, policy gaps and internal tensions between the domains. His analysis suggests the need for a more coherent, integrated and multilevel governance policy framework based on social justice, socio-economic equality and cultural diversity to achieve the elusive goal of social cohesion in Europe.

T1  - Measuring Sexual Prejudice Against Gay Men and Lesbian Women: Development of the Sexual Prejudice Scale (SPS)
AN  - 1567046573; 201435084
AB  - The presence of bias against gay men and lesbian women remains an ongoing issue, and accurate measurement is essential to targeted intervention. A validation study of a new instrument, the Sexual Prejudice Scale, is reported. Students (N = 851) from 4 different universities participated in this study. An exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted, and results of these analyses indicated a 3-factor solution (affective -- valuation, stereotyping, and social equality beliefs) for each of the sex-specific scales. Evidence of validity and the results of the reliability analysis are reported. Implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Transnational Activism in Ethnic Diasporas: Insights from Cuban Exiles, American Jews and Irish Americans
AN  - 1417525112; 201331937
AB  - The actions of ethnic advocacy groups have an indisputable impact on political change in their ancestral homelands. Many observers attribute the United States' continued efforts to isolate Castro's Cuba, its on/off involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and its engagement and disengagement in the conflict in Northern Ireland to the influence of their efforts. Whether their actions take the form of lobbying, remittance-sending or acts of violence, diaspora groups' efforts to create change may determine the success of homeland opposition movements and efforts to resolve internal conflicts. This article surveys the activities of 30 political organisations in American Cuban, Irish and Jewish communities, examining the multiple ways in which these groups attempt to make change in Cuba, Northern Ireland and Israel respectively. In what ways do non-partisan, partisan and radical ethnic organisations attempt to make political change in their homelands? Why do these groups choose particular means for exerting influence-such as lobbying, working with homeland opposition movements or appealing to international organisations? These community dynamics are best understood by looking at each group's ability to find allies within the American and homeland governments, the ideology it espouses and its financial resources.

T1  - Racial Threat and White Opposition to Bilingual Education in Texas
AN  - 1417525056; 201331938
AB  - This study examines local contextual conditions that influence opposition to bilingual education among non-Hispanic Whites, net of individual-level characteristics. Data from the Texas Poll (N = 615) are used in conjunction with U.S. Census data to test five competing hypotheses using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models. Our results support a "racial threat" hypothesis, suggesting that increasing opposition to bilingual education among Whites corresponds to changes in the Hispanic population. We find opposition to bilingual education among non-Hispanic Whites to be most pronounced in areas with substantial growth in an already sizeable Hispanic population, and least pronounced in areas of high growth rates and historically low proportions of Hispanics. Importantly, our results highlight the relevance of the interaction between minority group size and minority growth rates in generating majority opposition to bilingual education programs in the United States.

T1  - Migrants in the Russian Labor Market
AN  - 1531933819; 201423235
AB  - Migration processes in Russia in the past two decades have been contradictory. Until the mid-1990s, it was largely forced migration of Russians from the former Soviet republics provoked by an explosion of ethnic separatism, armed conflicts, political instability and the collapse of social and economic institutions. In 1992-2004, 6.9 million people moved to Russia from the CIS and Baltic countries, with migration growth accounting for 4.6 million, which is substantially more than in the preceding decade. However, beginning from the second half of the 1990s, the flow of forced migration slowed down, giving way to economic migration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Division Among Diasporic Nigerians: A Systemic Dilemma
AN  - 1429629517; 201335749
AB  - In my childhood, it was quite noticeable that distinctions between Yoruba, Edo, Ibo, and Hausa were minimal. At independence in the early 1960's, Nigeria's population stood at fifty-six million, compared to about 152 million today. Between 1960 and 2008, Nigeria, a multi-ethnic and multireligious nation with considerable development potential, fell into the ethnic clashes over distribution of scarce resources among competitive interest groups. Nigeria cultural divisions are very complicated phenomena. This essay reviews the degree of normlessness, alienation, powerlessness and cultural estrangement among diasporic Nigerians and how social dynamics, such as differentiated ideology and social distance, have affected the participation of ethnic minorities within their Nigerian counterparts. In addition, to a great extent, the cultural division faced by the diasporic Nigerians gradually increased bias among ethnic groups often against their own group interest.

T1  - Who is bullying whom in ethnically diverse primary schools? Exploring links between bullying, ethnicity, and ethnic diversity in Dutch primary schools
AN  - 1364703679; 201324234
AB  - This study investigated associations between ethnicity, ethnic diversity, and bullying among 739 pupils enrolled in their last year of primary school. Hypotheses derived from social misfit and inter-ethnic relations theories were tested using the multilevel p2 model. Our key findings were: (1) inter- and intra-ethnic bullying are just as common in ethnically heterogeneous as in homogeneous classes; (2) pupils belonging to the Turkish and Moroccan minority groups bully significantly more than native Dutch (in particular according to victims); the chance to be victimized does not depend on the ethnic background of the pupil; (3) the prevalence of inter- and intra-ethnic bullying depends on the level of ethnic diversity in the class; inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic bullying increase with increasing levels of ethnic diversity.

T1  - Explanations for racial disadvantage and racial advantage: beliefs about both sides of inequality in America
AN  - 1315601155; 201307526
AB  - Attitudes about racial inequality in the United States are often viewed through the lenses of discrimination and disadvantage. However, as whiteness studies suggest, systems of racial inequality produce both disadvantage and advantage. National surveys have documented explanations for African American disadvantage but have not collected data on explanations for white advantage. African American disadvantage and white advantage are two sides of the same coin -- racial inequality. To understand attitudes about racial inequality, we need to know Americans' beliefs about both sides of the racialized system. This research uses national survey data to examine explanations for both sides of racial inequality and identifies which factors are believed to be most important in explaining white advantage, finding that racial attitudes are complex and are dependent upon the specific situation and context. This research will provide a valuable contribution to both whiteness studies and race relations research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Traditional prejudice remains outside of the WEIRD world
AN  - 1417525111; 201331837
AB  - Dixon et al. accurately describe subtle mechanisms of discrimination that inhibit minorities' collective action in modern democratic societies. This commentary suggests that in contemporary non-Western societies, where ethnic conflicts are more violent, traditional overt forms of prejudice still exist and predict discrimination of ethnic and racial minorities. Thus, prejudice reduction models should and do improve intergroup relations in such contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - US host nationals' attitudes toward Japanese: the role of communication and relational solidarity in the intergroup contact hypothesis
AN  - 1373428425; 201328620
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis and intergroup contact theory, the authors examined US Americans' (N = 403) communication experiences and relational solidarity with their most frequent Japanese contact and associations with their attitudes toward Japanese as a cultural group. Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) results showed that both communication frequency and quality had an indirect effect through relational solidarity on affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitudes, demonstrating the critical mediating role of relational solidarity. Results also revealed that communication quality was positively and directly associated with the attitudinal measures. Implications of the findings are discussed with respect to prior literature on relational communication in intergroup and intercultural contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When peace prevails on Kasih Hill: the Protestant church and the politics of adat in Minahasa
AN  - 1551001851; 201429121
AB  - Proliferating conflicts in the Moluccas, Kalimantan, and Central Sulawesi marked an increasing interest in ethnic politics in post-1998 Indonesia. At the same time, the establishment of the National Adat Alliance (AMAN) in 2003 ushered in a new era of ethnic awareness among the customary law (adat) communities in Indonesia. In order to resolve the religious and ethnic conflicts as well as communal tensions, the central government enacted a Joint Decree that stipulated the creation of the Forum for Religious Harmony (FKUB). In North Sulawesi, however, neither the Protestant Church (GMIM) nor the Minahasan adat community has strongly supported the FKUB. On the one hand, the GMIM wanted to have a conflict resolution and conflict prevention strategy that appeared less 'religious' and in so doing the GMIM decided to work closely with a social network called JAJAK. On the other hand, the adat community perceived the proliferating conflicts as detrimental to their struggle for an ethnic recognition. Forging an alliance with the GMIM was impossible due to the history of violent relationship between the church and the adat leaders. The adat activists eventually created the Minahasan Adat Council (MAM). This essay argues that ethnic politics in post-1998 North Sulawesi have been confronted with strong resistance from religious authorities; however, at the same time, religion was able to capitalize on an emerging interest in ethnic movements on the national level.

T1  - Ethnic heterogeneity in the activity and structure of a Black street gang
AN  - 1448995888; 201344904
AB  - Despite acknowledgment of 'hybrid' street gangs in the literature, there is little systematic research into ethnic heterogeneity within gangs. This research aims at moving beyond the broad categorization of the Black street gang. For this purpose, we examine an all-Black London-based gang in detail, using fieldwork and police arrest data, and investigate the role of ethnic heterogeneity for the workings of the gang. Our findings suggest that ethnic heterogeneity within this gang is crucial for its criminal operation. Although there is no evidence for ethnicity-related specialization of crime, the structural co-offending pattern of the gang's activities is dominated by ethnicity. Ethnicity matters for who offends with whom. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Explaining Attitudes Towards Immigration Policies in European Countries: The Role of Human Values
AN  - 1347781745; 201318706
AB  - European societies have been experiencing increasing rates of immigration in recent decades. At the same time one can observe a substantial rise in anti-foreigner sentiments. In this study we investigate the effect of human values on attitudes towards immigration. We hypothesise that self-transcendent individuals are more supportive of, and conservative individuals are more adverse to, immigration. We do not expect large differences in the effect of values across contexts. To explain cross-country and cross-time differences we use group threat theory, according to which larger inflows of immigration combined with challenging economic conditions impose a threat on the host society, resulting in more negative attitudes towards immigration. To test our hypotheses we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-03, 2004-05 and 2006-07) and multilevel analysis. Prior to the interpretation of the results, we guarantee that the concepts display measurement invariance across countries and over time. Our results largely confirm our hypotheses regarding the role that values play in the explanation of anti-immigration attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Paradoxical Multiculturalism in South Korea
AN  - 1081862893; 201235397
AB  - The article discusses the development of multiculturalism in South Korea. The article argues that as South Korea imports multicultural approaches from overseas, the implementation of policies is cultivating unintended consequences that often run counter to the original intentions. The continuing assumptions and reinforced divisions between Koreans and "foreigners" remain in much of the literature and policy making on multiculturalism in South Korea. There have been critical assessments of multiculturalism from South Korean academics. However, the underlying paradox of South Korea's multiculturalism is the continued and reinforced real and perceived belief in an exclusive racial and ethnic nationalism. The article outlines developments where this problematic is being addressed and challenged from civil society movements. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effects of Intergroup Contact: A Cross-National Comparison in Europe
AN  - 952891986
AB  - This article examines so-called secondary transfer effects of intergroup contact, a phenomenon whereby positive intergroup contact experiences can influence attitudes not only toward encountered (primary) outgroups but also toward other (secondary) outgroups that were not initially involved in the intergroup encounter. The current study relies on a unique cross-sectional sample of the general population drawn from eight European countries (N = 7, 042) to examine the relationship between intergroup contact with immigrants and attitudes toward primary (immigrants) and secondary (homosexuals and Jews) outgroups. Results showed that intergroup contact was not only directly related with primary outgroup attitudes but also indirectly associated with secondary outgroup attitudes, via attitude generalization. These relationships occurred primarily for individuals low in social dominance orientation. Findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding secondary transfer effects of contact as well as the role of social dominance orientation as a moderator of such effects.

T1  - Conditioned emotional responses in racial prejudice
AN  - 1037875458; 201231032
AB  - This study pursues a learning theory understanding of adverse race-elicited emotion and racially discriminatory behaviour. Multimodal classical conditioning argues that emotional reactions to neutral stimuli are built from aversive, appetitive and neutral experiences involving those stimuli in direct, observational and/or verbal modes. Modern two-factor theory argues that once adverse emotions are established, avoidance is likely to develop. Participants rated their frequency of aversive, appetitive and neutral experiences with racially different others; the degree of fear, anxiety and anger they typically feel in inter-racial situations; and the frequency with which they avoid/approach such situations. Results indicated that direct, observational and verbal aversive contacts were associated with more fear, anxiety and anger. Neutral contacts in all modes were associated with less fear and observational neutral contacts were associated with less anger. Direct avoidance was predicted by fear and anxiety. The value of using this approach to understand adverse race-elicited emotion is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assessing LGBTQ Campus Climate and Creating Change
AN  - 964197936; 201207523
AB  - We report the findings of a climate study of a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. This climate assessment was comprehensive in content (heterosexual and cisgender individuals' attitudes, and LGBTQ individuals' experiences), participants (faculty, staff, and students), and methodology (qualitative and quantitative). We found low levels of sexual prejudice and generally positive perceptions of the campus, but positive attitudes were more strongly endorsed by heterosexual and cisgender than LGBTQ participants. We consider the impact of these perceptions on LGBTQ students' co-curricular involvement and discuss the institutional changes that are underway as a result of our study.

T1  - "My Life was Filled with Constant Anxiety": Anti-Immigrant Discrimination, Undocumented Status, and Their Mental Health Implications for Brazilian Immigrants
AN  - 1081862941; 201235269
AB  - Immigration reform and the various costs associated with undocumented immigration have been in national headlines in the past few years. The growth of Latinos as the US' largest ethno-racial minority has sparked debates about the "browning" of the United States and led to an increase in anti-immigrant discrimination. While some researchers have documented the effects of racial discrimination on the mental health of ethno-racial minorities in the United States, less has explored how anti-immigrant discrimination and undocumented status influence the mental and psychological well-being of Latino immigrants, more specifically Brazilian immigrants, in the United States. Relying on data from in-depth interviews conducted with 49 Brazilian return migrants who immigrated to the United States and subsequently returned to Brazil, this paper will examine how their experiences living as racialized and primarily undocumented immigrants in the United States influenced their mental health. Specifically, I demonstrate that respondents experienced ethno-racial and anti-immigrant discrimination and endured various challenges that had negative implications for their mental health. This paper will also discuss additional factors that researchers should take into account when examining immigrants' mental health and the challenges immigrants encounter in a racialized society with increasing anti-immigrant sentiment.

T1  - National attachments, economic competition, and social exclusion of non-ethnic migrants in Israel: a mixed-methods approach
AN  - 1081862402; 201234792
AB  - This paper provides a specific example of how mixed-methods can be used as a useful research design in the study of ethnic exclusionism. Specifically, we investigate the ways in which conceptions of national identity and nationalism and perceptions of socio-economic threat explain exclusionary attitudes of the majority group (Jews) towards labor migrants in Israel. We show how the implementation of the mixed-method approach to the study of discriminatory attitudes towards migrants not only provided evidence for convergence, but also improved our understanding of the complex nature of ethnic relations in modern societies.

T1  - Fitting In but Getting Fat: Identity Threat and Dietary Choices Among U.S. Immigrant Groups
AN  - 1347780817; 201318752
AB  - In two experiments, we tested the hypothesis that pressure felt by U.S. immigrant groups to prove they belong in America causes them to consume more prototypically American, and consequently less healthy, foods. Asian Americans were three times more likely to report a prototypically American food as their favorite after being asked whether they spoke English than when they had not been asked; in contrast, questioning the English abilities of White Americans had no effect on their reports (Experiment 1). Also, Asian Americans ordered and ate dishes that were more American and contained an average of 182 additional calories and 12 extra grams of fat when their American identity was directly challenged than when their American identity was not challenged (Experiment 2). Identity-based psychological processes may help explain why the diets of U.S. immigrant groups tend to decline in nutritional value with longer residence in the United States and over generations.

T1  - "Tightening the Shackles": The Continued Invisibility of Liverpool's British African Caribbean Teachers
AN  - 964195750; 201207402
AB  - This article reports on the researchers' findings 20 years after Lord Gifford's inquiry into race relations in the city after the 1980s Toxteth riots. Gifford reported on the prevalence of racial attitudes, racial abuse, and racial violence directed against the Black citizens of Liverpool. The authors' research focused on education and specifically the low percentage of Black teachers compared to the whole teaching workforce and the percentage Black population in the city. Accessing complete Black teaching data proved difficult and unearthed issues within policy and priority in the city authorities and led the researchers to begin to gather data to explore teacher training, entries and completions, and the lack of status of the Black teachers as measured through representation in senior leadership positions in schools.

T1  - Broker Fixed: The Racialized Social Structure and the Subjugation of Indigenous Populations in the Andes
AN  - 881468359; 201116454
AB  - Responding to calls to return racial analysis to indigenous Latin America, this article moves beyond the prejudicial attitudes of dominant groups to specify how native subordination gets perpetuated as a normal outcome of the organization of society. I argue that a naturalized system of indirect rule racially subordinates native populations through creating the position of mestizo 'authoritarian intermediary'. Natives must depend on these cultural brokers for their personhood, while maintaining this privileged position requires facilitating indigenous exploitation. Institutional structures combine with cultural practices to generate a vicious cycle in which increased village intermediary success increases native marginalization. This racialized social structure explains my ethnographic findings that indigenous villagers continued to support the same coterie of mestizos despite their regular and sometimes extreme acts of peculation. My findings about the primacy of race suggest new directions for research into indigenous studies, ethnic mobilizations, and the global dimensions of racial domination.

Method. We rely on a telephone survey of 428 registered voters collected in the aftermath of the protests in Jena, Louisiana. Results. Public reactions were heavily filtered by race and associated with measures of racial resentment. African Americans followed news about the protests more closely, believed race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute, and believed the decision to prosecute was the wrong decision. Racially conservative white respondents were less likely to believe race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute and were more likely to believe that the decision to prosecute was the right decision. Consistent with theories of agenda setting and framing, attentiveness to the news influenced perceptions regarding the importance of race in the decision to prosecute but not whether the decision was the right decision. Conclusions. At least within the context of the Deep South, race and racial attitudes continue to be an important predictor of public reactions to racially charged events. Attentiveness to the news influenced the lens through which events were interpreted, but not perceptions of whether the outcome was the right decision. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The dilemmas of pro-development actors: viewing state-ethnic minority relations and intra-ethnic dynamics through contentious development projects
AN  - 862596024; 201109683
AB  - Studies of ethnic minority peoples in Asia have long focussed on the relations between ethnic minority communities and the modern state and on the role of development in shaping these relations. This paper is concerned with how ethnic minorities respond to the state-led development. While there are numerous studies focussing on the collective agency of ethnic minorities opposing development projects, few studies consider the agency of pro-development actors. Pro-development actors are usually dismissed as co-opted, manipulated, inauthentic, or elite-driven, yet they can offer crucial insights into understanding state-ethnic minority relations and particularly intra-ethnic minority relations. This paper concentrates on pro-dam actors from the Lepcha minority in the Indian state of Sikkim to make four interlinked arguments. First, examining pro-development actors breaks the homogenous view of state-ethnic minority relations and shifts the focus to intra-ethnic relationships. Second, collective agency of ethnic minorities is not fixed in a particular relationship with the state nor does it have a particular position on development. Third, the long-term experience of development is vital in understanding how ethnic minorities manoeuvre and alter their position on contentious projects. Lastly, analysis of pro-development actors creates major dilemmas for researchers which are not easily overcome. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Interstate Conflict and Ethnicity
AN  - 902079519; 201122258
AB  - This study explores a new facet of how the ethnic composition of states and the power of ethnic kin affect dyadic interstate conflict. Here, emphasis is placed on dyads containing ethnically diverse states with dominant ethnic groups. States with dominant ethnic groups but still significant ethnic minorities are expected to be more prone to international ethnic conflict than states without one of these two characteristics. Variation in ethnic composition is captured by a new measure. Looking at large-N panel data, it is found that dyads composed of ethnically diverse states with dominant ethnic groups are the most likely to engage in interstate ethnic conflict in which force has been used. Additionally, the power of a cross-border ethnic kin minority, as expressed in its share of the host state's population or its settlement patterns, also increases the likelihood of dyadic interstate ethnic conflict. Variables capturing ethnic dimensions have the strongest effect on interstate ethnic conflict compared to other traditional variables like regime similarity, capability and proximity.

T1  - Constructing truths in a culture of disbelief: Understanding asylum screening from within
AN  - 881465634; 201116402
AB  - While a multitude of immigration officers enforce the numerous laws and policies regulating the arrival of asylum seekers, their work is often hidden from the public eye and ignored by academic debate, leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Is the migration debate blinded by bureaucracy or oblivious to the complexity of the asylum screening process? This article originates from an ethnographic study, which included over 80 interviews, six months of participant observation and four years of familiarization with the main actors, framed by a triangulation scheme that allowed in-depth exploration of the field from within. The study's conclusions expose how identifying immigration officers' subculture is key to understanding asylum controls and to reach beyond the legal shield and the rhetorical concepts of political debate. Based on this empirical research, this article exposes how officers' criteria for screening individuals are not derived from regulations or laws but their own categorizations, rules and values derived from ambiguous stereotypes nurtured by officers' experiences and social prejudices.

T1  - Prejudice against Muslims: anxiety as a mediator between intergroup contact and attitudes, perceived group variability and behavioural intentions
AN  - 856403312; 201106889
AB  - Numerous studies have reported an increase in prejudice against Muslims in recent years. Less research has investigated how this increase might be stemmed and relations between non-Muslims and Muslims improved. In this article, we address prejudice against Muslims from the perspective of intergroup contact theory. We conducted two cross-sectional studies to examine the relationship between non-Muslim students' experiences of contact with Muslims and their intergroup anxiety, outgroup attitudes, perceptions of outgroup variability and intergroup behavioural intentions. Study 1 (N=58) showed that frequent high-quality contact with Muslims predicted more positive outgroup attitudes, more perceived outgroup variability and more positive behavioural intentions. These associations were mediated by intergroup anxiety. Study 2 (N=60) replicated these effects and additionally showed that anxiety mediates the influence of extended contact on the same outcome measures. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for strategies aimed at improving relations between non-Muslims and Muslims. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Multiculturalism in a selection of English and Spanish fiction and artworks
AN  - 1792351049
AB  - Discourses of cultural pluralism in literature, cinema and art today prove that inter-ethnic relations in Europe are moving towards, and in some spaces have already achieved, a spontaneous conviviality, in spite of the presence of racism and social injustice. Though the focus will be on the long-standing British multicultural experience, attention will also be paid to the case of Spain, a much younger country of migration. The specific histories of migration of these countries will also be tackled.

AB  - Juliet Hooker's Race and the Politics of Solidarity and Stanley R. Bailey's Legacies of Race both tackle the crucial question of what kinds of policies states with diverse populations and histories of social inequality should enact in the effort to move towards racial justice. Hooker bases her claims on a case study of multicultural reforms in Nicaragua. Bailey uses survey data to analyze racial attitudes and race-based policies in Brazil. Both Hooker and Bailey critique prior efforts to make generalizations about racial boundaries and multicultural politics on the basis of the U.S. case, and both contend that their arguments will apply beyond the particular case they analyze.

T1  - Foundations of anti-immigrant sentiment: The variable nature of perceived group threat across changing European societies, 2002-2006
AN  - 1928656185
AB  - In this article we examine how Europeans perceive the consequences of immigration. We draw upon group threat, conflict and boundary-making theories to differentiate between probable reasons of anti-immigrant sentiment. We hypothesize that perceived threats vary over time and across countries since their nature may shift according to changing economic and other conditions. Using data from three rounds and 24 countries of the European Social Survey, perceived threat is explained by socio-economic characteristics, political orientation and structural conditions. We then focus on more specific threats in economic and cultural terms and how they vary in their effects on negative attitudes toward immigration. Our findings support variable economic and cultural foundations of anti-immigrant sentiment exerting different influence associated with changing economic conditions. Implications of these findings for future policy and research are discussed in the light of the current economic crisis.

T1  - Unconscious Islamophobia
AN  - 845800234
AB  - Our historical relationship with Islam has accumulated a whole series of negative perceptions dominated by prejudices and stereotypes. We have internalized a reductionist and monolithic image of "us" and of "them" (the two "cultures"). It is as if these were closed universes in which millions of human beings are designated as "Western" or "Muslims" and represent alien and even antagonistic cultures. This concept of "cultures" in relations between the Muslim world and "us" is a product of a Western construct in which "Islam" and therefore all individuals within Islam are fictitiously represented, labelled ideologically as a dominant global force, in a way that portrays the behaviour and culture of that enormous mass of people as a uniform entity. They all are One, and the great variety of this immense geographical area is ignored. This One is perceived as alien, separate and with no values in common with us, inferior and dominated by fanaticism, fundamentalism and irrationality. The combination of hostility and reductionism that feeds this reconstructed vision of a threatening, backward and violent homus islamicus turns Muslims into people requiring therapeutic or punitive interventions. Overall, this illustrates that the problem of anti-Muslim behaviour, due to intolerance towards citizens who follow Islam, has grown in importance, and people must be made aware of its existence and the need to take measures and actions to contain and prevent it. However, defining Islamophobia requires its existence to be politically and socially acknowledged, and this is clearly not the case today. This debate is ongoing and rational and empirical criteria must be sought to define this phenomenon in accordance with international standards on racism and intolerance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racial Contact and Change in South Africa
AN  - 743066398; 201043235
AB  - We investigate the effects of sociopolitical change on intergroup contact and social distance attitudes in South Africa, and the effect of these variables on intergroup attitudes and racial policy attitudes. The data come from secondary analysis of surveys conducted between 1991 and 2005, as well as a dedicated survey conducted in 2006. The results reveal widespread racial isolation among Black people; ambivalent attitudes to racial integration among Whites, who support integration in principle but are opposed to it personally; and contrasting outcomes of contact for Blacks and Whites. Increased intergroup contact was associated with reduced stereotyping and increased support for transformation policies among Whites but was associated with increased opposition to transformation policies among Blacks. Contrary to the predictions of contact theory, attitudes of Blacks and Whites toward Coloured and Indian compatriots were generally more negative in provinces with high levels of intergroup contact between these groups.

T1  - Racial Disparities in Hate Crime Reporting
AN  - 287961140; 20565008
AB  - This study examines the influence of the victim's race in reporting hate crimes to the police. Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) concentrated incident-level files (1992-2005) were used to (a) analyze how the victim's race influences the likelihood of reporting and (b) explore differences between reporting racial hate crimes and non-racial hate crimes. Controlling for other demographic and incident characteristics, the results indicate that minority victimizations are less likely to be reported for both racial and non-racial hate crimes; however, the magnitude of this effect was greater for racial hate crimes. Failure to report to the police has serious consequences for the victim and the criminal justice system. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnos, race and nation: Werner Sombart, the Jews and classical German sociology
AN  - 743065752; 201043201
AB  - Bodemann addresses the problem of how classical German sociology in the early twentieth century dealt with the question of the Other, as well as with the questions of ethno-national solidarities and race. In contemporary debates the Jews constituted a central trope. Bodemann focuses in particular on Werner Sombart, one of the three central figures in sociology at the time, but he also looks at the early meetings of the German Sociological Society and writings by Georg Simmel, Max Weber and Ferdinand Tonnies. Despite the fact that, even in 1910, Germany was a multi-ethnic state replete with discussions of race and the role of the Jews in society--and in sharp contrast to early American sociology--German sociology (with the principal and important exception of Sombart, and some minor reflections by Weber, Simmel and Tonnies) took little interest in the social positioning of Jews and the disputes on antisemitism, and even the classics were concerned with these issues mostly in relation to contemporary race theories. This lack of interest, Bodemann argues, left sociology theoretically unprepared for the nationalist frenzy that was about to be unleashed with the outbreak of the First World War, or for the intensifying antisemitism and the rise of fascism that followed it. Adapted from the source document.
