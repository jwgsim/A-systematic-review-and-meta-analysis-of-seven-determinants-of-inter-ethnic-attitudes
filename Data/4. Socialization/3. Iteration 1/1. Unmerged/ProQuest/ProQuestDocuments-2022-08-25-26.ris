T1  - Timerendering: reflections on chronopolitical praxis in Bolivia
AN  - 2699595060
AB  - This article uses reflections on chronopolitical praxis during the period 2006‐19 in Bolivia in order to make a more general contribution to the anthropology of time and temporalities. The article proposes the theoretical concept of ‘timerendering’ in order to examine the ways in which time emerged as a pervasive register that mediated and also deepened political, social, and ethnic conflict in Bolivia. After illustrating the mechanisms through which timerendering in Bolivia gave way to forms of allochronic denial that are described as ‘hypertemporal exclusion’, the article explains how and why the MAS government's timerendering strategies unravelled, which left it susceptible to the right‐wing coup of October/November 2019. The article concludes by narrating the endtimes of the Morales government in Bolivia, before considering what this moment and its afterlives have to say more generally about the anthropology of time as a disciplinary orientation.Alternate abstract:AbstraitRendre le temps : réflexions sur la pratique chronopolitique en BolivieRésuméÀ partir de réflexions sur la pratique chronopolitique en Bolivie de 2006 à 2019, le présent article apporte une contribution plus générale à l'anthropologie du temps et des temporalités. Il propose le concept théorique de « rendu du temps » pour examiner les manières dont le temps est apparu comme un registre omniprésent qui médie et approfondit le conflit politique, social et ethnique en Bolivie. Après avoir illustré les mécanismes par lesquels le rendu du temps a cédé la place, en Bolivie, à des formes de négation allochrone décrites comme une « exclusion hypertemporelle », l'auteur explique comment et pourquoi les stratégies de rendu du temps du gouvernement du MAS se sont délitées, laissant celui‐ci vulnérable au coup d’État de la droite en octobre‐novembre 2019. L'article se conclut par la narration des derniers temps du gouvernement Morales en Bolivie, avant d'examiner ce que ce moment et ses répercussions ont plus généralement à dire sur l'anthropologie du temps comme orientation disciplinaire.

T1  - Identity formation among mixed families in a conflictual society: The case of Jewish–Muslim families in Israel
AN  - 2698576932
AB  - Mixed families offer a unique opportunity to explore the interrelated aspects of identity such as religion, ethnicity, and nationalism. In Israel, intermarriages of Muslims and Jews are particularly interesting because the complex tensions between these identities are intertwined with the national conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. However, such mixed families have rarely been studied. The purpose of this study is to identify the ways in which mixed families construct their identities in the context of a conflictual society. It is based on ethnographic work conducted among 16 Jewish–Muslim families. Findings indicate two patterns of identity formation: single identity, in which one spouse transitions to the other spouse’s culture, and hybrid identity, in which each spouse takes part in the other’s religious and cultural practices. This article demonstrates how socioeconomic status affects the choices that mixed families make in the process of identity formation in the context of a conflictual society.

T1  - Predictors of out‐group empathy among majority and minority children in a conflict‐affected society
AN  - 2697332692
AB  - We examined the predictors of out‐group empathy in children growing up in a city devastated during the fall of the Former Yugoslavia. Children (N = 155; 76 male, 79 female) from both majority (64.5% Croatian) and minority (35.5% Serbian) ethnic groups, ranging from 6 to 11 years old (M = 8.77, SD = 1.15) participated. A multiple‐group path analysis in Mplus found that age, general empathy, quality contact and perceived intergroup conflict related to higher out‐group empathy. There were no significant links from gender, quantity contact or out‐group friends to out‐group empathy. The findings were consistent across majority and minority ethnic groups. Implications are discussed.

T1  - Dismantling Systems and Improving Contexts to Support the Development of BIPOC Youth
AN  - 2672688008
AB  - The issue's collection of 17 papers apply a wide range of developmental, contextual, intersectional, and critical perspectives (and their combinations) to promote understanding on how oppressive systems intersect and overlap in detrimental ways for BIPOC youth development. Innovative conceptual models and a variety of methodological techniques advance our understanding of the lived experiences of BIPOC youth who interact daily in contexts such as neighborhoods and educational settings in which racism and anti‐immigrant sentiment pervades. Together, the papers in this issue examine the systemic forces at the root of experiences of oppression and advance the field toward improving short and long‐term developmental outcomes for BIPOC adolescents.

T1  - Development of the Meanings Of The Hijab (MOTH) Scale
AN  - 2658474599
AB  - Previous research has examined the multiple meanings of hijab among Muslim women, but a quantitative scale to examine such meanings has yet to be developed. The present study was designed to develop and validate a new scale, Meanings Of The Hijab (MOTH), for measuring multiple meanings associated with wearing a headscarf for Muslim women living in countries where the majority of the population is non‐Muslim. The initial 64‐item scale was employed to 442 Canadian Muslim women, along with the Social Axiom Survey and the Cultural Identity Scale. An exploratory factor analysis led to the development of the MOTH scale with 35 items and five factors. The factors reflect meanings of the hijab in terms of: Expression of Faith Without Hijab, Expression of Modesty and Religiosity, Expression of Personal Identity, Challenges of Wearing Hijab, and Negative Symbolism of the Hijab in the West. The MOTH scale was found to have high internal validity and discriminant validity. In addition, convergent and discriminant validity of MOTH subscales were established by examining their relations with social axioms, ethnic identity, and national identity.

T1  - Federal and Political Party Reforms in Asia: Is There a New Model of Federal Democracy Emerging in Ethnically Diverse Countries in Asia?
AN  - 2637097362
AB  - How do ethnically divided countries create inclusive and stable democratic institutions? Why do some kinds of federalism fail while others evolve? Scholars looking for answers to these kinds of questions have tended to focus on the West. Yet there are important lessons arising from the substantial democratic and federal reforms that have taken place in Asia over the last few decades. These reforms signal a new model of federal democracy in Asia, comprising multilevel ethnoterritorial federalism, mixed-majoritarianism and a party system that includes both ethnic and multi-ethnic parties. This model has emerged as a response to ethnic conflict and secession risks and reflects the high diversity of clustered communities and cross-cutting cleavages. Despite its overarching majoritarianism, the federal model has led to highly fragmented party systems and coalition governments, with positive implications for democratic stability. Together, these features go some way towards blending otherwise conflicting consociational and centripetal paradigms.

T1  - Economic conditions and social cohesion: an analysis of French European Social Survey data
AN  - 2632516398
AB  - Concerns have been raised about weakening social cohesion in French society against the backdrop of economic slowdown over the last decade. To understand how economic conditions are associated with social cohesion, this study analyzes the correlations between individual and macroeconomic indicators and social cohesion attitudes as well as their cross-level interaction. The results from pooled OLS regressions with year fixed effects using French European Social Survey data (2008–2018) show that individual economic strain is associated with lower social trust and with higher egalitarian and anti-immigrant attitudes. Cross-level interaction results suggest that strained individuals can have stronger egalitarian and anti-immigrant propensities under a macroeconomic downturn. As a result, larger variations in public attitudes can occur, which could pose a risk to the value consensus and social order. The results of this study suggest potential negative consequences of micro- and macroeconomic hardship for various dimensions of social cohesion and suggest the need for a comprehensive policy strategy.

T1  - Navigating the ethnic boundary: From ‘in-between’ to plural ethnicities among Thai middle-class migrant women in Hong Kong
AN  - 2618459608
AB  - The article examines the self-ethnic identification of Thai middle-class migrant women in Hong Kong. It looks into how different generations of Thai middle-class migrant women identify themselves differently in the host community. Drawing on a one-year ethnographic study and interviews with 20 participants, we found that the process of self-ethnic identification evolves from in-between ethnicity for the older generation to plural ethnicities for the younger generation. The way they perceive themselves, as we argue, determines how they navigate the ethnic boundaries in the host community. The results suggest that the older generation oscillates between being Thai and Hong Konger whereas the younger generation go beyond the dual ethnic identification and in so doing, they disrupt, transgress, or even subvert the ethnic boundaries set between the Thai and the Hong Kong people in the era of globalization with increasing mobility and the use of information and communication technologies.

T1  - Jewish Tetouan: place, community, and ethnic boundaries from the Minutes Book of the community board, 1929-46
AN  - 2604657610
AB  - This article explores the limits, meaning, and practice of ‘Jewish Tetouan’ for its community members during the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco. The study shows how Jewish Tetouan constituted a set of social relationships and networks. The cultural content was not the most crucial element determining the community members’ interpretation of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. Rather, the limits of the community were primarily (re-)confirmed by interactions with several categories of ‘us’ (Sephardic Jews from Tetouan in Tetouan and abroad, other Sephardic Jews from the Spanish Protectorate and Tangier, Moroccan Jews, and other Jews) and several categories of ‘them’ (Spaniards, Muslim Moroccans, and Europeans).

T1  - Open grazing legislations and the protection of ethnic minority rights in Nigeria
AN  - 2601729606
AB  - The approach to curbing the conflict between the Fulani pastoralists and farmers in Nigeria assumed a new dimension with the adoption of open grazing prohibition and establishment of ranches legislations in some Nigerian States. The legislations have implications not only on the relationship between the conflicting parties but also the protection of human rights of the indigenous and ethnic minority population. This article examines some pertinent provisions of the legislations and their implications from human rights perspectives, particularly concerning the obligations to respect, protect and promote human rights of an indigenous and ethnic minority population. The article argues that the legislations not only shielded their vicious objective of identity destruction and forced cultural assimilation, but have also adopted an approach that is discriminatory, retrogressive and violent. The legislations undermine critical human rights norms that protect an indigenous and ethnic minority against marginalisation and identity destruction. The legislation will foment rather than curb the conflict. The article recommends a revision that takes into consideration the human rights obligations of Nigeria, the cultural dynamics, and the social and economic conditions of the affected group.

T1  - Revisiting White Labourism: New Debates on Working-Class Whiteness in Twentieth-Century Southern Africa
AN  - 2597429562
AB  - This article is a contribution to and reassessment of the debate about the concept of ‘white labourism’ hosted in this journal in 2010. White labourism is a concept formulated by Jonathan Hyslop to describe an ideology combining an anti-capitalist critique with racial segregation that he argued was dominant in a transnational white working class in the British Empire in the early twentieth century. The debate about this concept has focused on the appeal and extent of this ideology in South Africa during the early twentieth century. In light of recent scholarship on Southern Africa, we take a longer-term perspective to critically examine the concept and the debate. Specifically, we make three interventions into this debate: we consider the role of white workers outside British imperial networks; we examine how radical and revolutionary ideas disappeared from white-working class politics in the mid-twentieth century; and we reassess the connection between transnational flows of people and ideas. Racial divisions in the working class and labour movement in Southern Africa were persistent and enduring. We argue that racial segregation had an enduring appeal to white workers in Southern Africa, and the sources of this appeal were more varied and locally rooted than simply transnational migration to the region.

T1  - The Salience of Perceived Societal Conflict in Europe: A 27 Country Study on the Development of a Measure for Generalized Conflict Thinking
AN  - 2594369547
AB  - Over the last two decades, European countries have struggled with several crises (e.g., the Great Recession, the refugee crisis) which had a tremendous impact on (some) societies. Typically, these crises were accompanied by divisive public discourses that rely heavily on a sharp and moralistic us-them distinction. Especially extreme right- and left-wing parties have adopted such conflict discourses and have gained much electoral support. Against this background, this paper has two objectives. First, data from the European Quality of Life Survey from 2003 to 2016 in 27 countries are used to provide a comprehensive overview of the salience of perceived societal conflicts between seven pairs of groups between countries and across time. We find substantial differences between countries and longitudinal trend variation in the salience of perceived societal conflict. For example, in Eastern European countries more economic conflict is perceived, while in Western European countries people perceive more cultural conflict between different ethnic and religious groups. Second, multigroup confirmatory factor analyses reveal that specific perceptions of conflict are structured by an underlying general orientation, generalized conflict thinking: people’s tendency to perceive society through the lens of conflict regardless of the specificity of these groups. The measure for generalized conflict thinking is metric equivalent across a large sample of countries. This demonstrates that generalized conflict thinking can be used as a social indicator for comparative research. In the conclusion we elaborate on the implications of our findings and develop a research agenda regarding generalized conflict thinking.

T1  - Increasing mixed marriages without assimilation: a consequence of historical ethnic emigration in Romania
AN  - 2607919189
AB  - This paper analyzes some of the consequences ethnic emigration might have on the social boundaries between ethnic majorities and minorities. It focuses on a specific East-European context (Romania) and its historical national minority groups: Jewish, Germans, Hungarians and Roma. Two of these groups – Jewish and Germans – have had high levels of emigration over the past four decades. By comparing them with the other two groups, I suggest that this flight has been followed by an increasing percentage of mixed marriages, indicating a decreasing social boundary between the majority and minority groups. However, more children from mixed marriages identify with the minority group, showing that, despite higher intermarriage rates, assimilation is not to be expected. The influence of other factors (education, differential fertility, benefits offered by the motherland) is also discussed in order to understand these antithetical trends.

T1  - The policy lessons learned from the criminal justice system response to COVID‐19
AN  - 2618221074
AB  - The health crisis associated with COVID-19, its lockdowns, and reopenings came in the midst of America's reckoning with racial and social justice amid the George Floyd murder. These two events spotlighted the racial and ethnic disparities contained in the criminal justice and health systems (Binswanger et al., 2012; Novisky et al., 2021; Nowotny et al., 2021), which served to inflame many social ills and conflicts (that have been there for quite some time) that hinder how we go about securing public health and public safety. In this regard, the country's early inability to respond quickly and effectively to the public health (and simultaneously) racial and social justice crises originates from the same factors that have long prevented the country from dealing with public safety in a serious, fair, and transparent manner (e.g., racial and ethnic bias, class conflict, tribalism, materialism, etc.). Yet, the coupling of these two crises could also be a springboard for inspiring both a reimagining and a reshaping of the justice system to move toward being fairer and more just. In this regard, the novel coronavirus pandemic, its subsequent lockdowns and reopenings and the recent Delta-based resurgence have provided criminologists with a unique opportunity to study its effects on crime and policy responses. Since the onset of the novel coronavirus, criminologists have researched how the virus and its policy responses have affected crime and criminal justice, with the most significant findings indicating: (1) a steady increase in specific forms of violence, including primarily homicides/community gun violence (Rosenfeld & Lopez, 2021) and domestic violence (Piquero et al., 2021); (2) reductions or stability in virtually all property crimes, but the acceleration of certain types of offending, such as fraud and cybercrime, due in large part to increased reliance on the internet and related platforms (Kennedy et al., 2021; Payne, 2020); (3) the emergence of new crime types, such as public health violations for breaking COVID-19 safety protocols (Leal et al., 2021); (4) a reduction in prison and jail populations—especially in the first 6–9 months of the pandemic; (5) a rapid spread of viral infections in jails and prisons (Nowotny & Piquero, 2020); (6) a substantial increase in opioid use and fatalities (Hailey & Saitz, 2020); (6) the creation of gaps in the delivery of needed medical and mental health screening and treatment;1 and (7) an initial reduction in police stops, citations, and arrests—particularly in the first few months of the pandemic as many departments pulled back on patrol and limited contact with the public in large part due to viral spread, lockdowns—leading to fewer persons out in public, and a lack of protective equipment (cf. Lum et al., 2020a,b).These research efforts have been important in documenting changes in crime and the criminal justice response and have provided important baseline information to compare against as criminologists continue to track changes in crime in the COVID-19 era. Yet, one of the glaring omissions from the research accumulated thus far—and not necessarily the fault of criminologists per se—has been the lack of policy-relevant discussion surrounding the effects of all-things-COVID on the criminal justice system. This essay takes a step in that direction.In the sections that follow, I highlight what was the nonexistent policy playbook and initial response by the various actors of the criminal justice system and the subsequent policy decisions and lessons learned as the system navigated the viral outbreak in real time with little—or constantly changing guidance—from state and federal officials.

T1  - Immigrant and Refugee Youth Organizing in Solidarity With the Movement for Black Lives
AN  - 2561208625
AB  - In recent years, politically active Latinx and Asian American Pacific Islander youth have addressed anti-Black racism within their own immigrant and refugee communities, engaged in protests against police violence, and expressed support for #SAYHERNAME. Reflecting the broader patterns of a new political generation and of progressive social movement leadership, women and nonbinary youth have disproportionately committed to inclusive fights for racial justice. In this essay, through two biographical examples, we highlight the role of grassroots youth organizing groups in training their diverse young members to become effective allies, introducing them to intersectional frameworks that motivate solidarity across racial and ethnic boundaries.

T1  - A cross‐ethnoracial comparison of objective and subjective neighborhood predictors of early adolescents' prosocial behavior
AN  - 2555684080
AB  - Although the Family Stress Model (FSM) has been widely tested, expanded conceptualizations of stressors, intervening mechanisms, and developmental outcomes from this perspective is becoming increasingly common in order to better explain the adolescent adjustment. Additionally, though extant research analyzes the utility of the FSM in African American and European–American samples, little is known about the representativeness of the FSM in Latino/a samples, and cross‐ethnoracial comparisons are scarce. The present study addresses these gaps by conducting cross‐ethnic comparisons in a modified FSM between African American, European–American, and U.S. Latino/a ethnoracial adolescents. Findings revealed that perceived neighborhood safety was indirectly associated with youth prosocial behavior through parent mental health symptoms and family conflict for African Americans, U.S. Latino/as, and European–Americans. Objective neighborhood risk predicted parent mental health symptoms but was not indirectly associated with youths' prosocial behavior. Results generally suggest that the FSM may adequately represent family processes across ethnoracial groups. The usefulness and practical implications of the FSM are discussed.

T1  - Symposium on Barry Eidlin’s <i>Labor and the Class Idea in the United States and Canada</i>
AN  - 2557167549
AB  - Barry Eidlin’s book, Labor and the Class Idea in the United States and Canada (Cambridge University Press, 2018) explains why unions are weaker in the United States than they are in Canada, but have not always been that way. Indeed, unionization rates were virtually identical for much of the twentieth century, then diverged in the 1960s. Against dominant accounts focused on long-standing differences in political cultures and institutions, Eidlin argues that the divergence resulted from different ruling party responses to working class upsurge in both countries during the Great Depression and World War II. In Canada, an initially more hostile state response ended up embedding “the class idea”—the idea of class as a salient, legitimate political category—more deeply in policies, policies, and practices than in the United States, where class interests were reduced to “special interests.” In this symposium, three noted labor scholars engage critically with the book.

T1  - Academic parenthood: Navigating structure and culture in an elite occupation
AN  - 2549096362
AB  - Many contemporary workers struggle to manage paid work and family responsibilities, leading scholars to explore mechanisms contributing to conflict between these two domains. Such examinations often center on pinpointing specific factors that explain variation in work‐family conflict, but these studies have less to say about how some occupational contexts create overwhelming demands for workers. In this article, I advocate for an approach that details the cultural and structural components of specific occupations. Building on scholarship about demanding jobs, I use academic parenthood as an illustrative case to demonstrate how certain occupational contexts are organized in ways that introduce challenges for caregiving. I then analyze how culture and structure jointly influence family‐friendly policies in the university setting, along with comparative experiences across discipline, gender, and race/ethnicity. Next, I describe how academic parents in the face of constraints, make choices, show agency, and demonstrate resistance. I conclude by identifying promising areas for future research.

T1  - Comparative History of a Very High Standard, But It Is Still Tough to Make It Work
AN  - 2535009419
AB  - Barry Eidlin’s book, Labor and the Class Idea in the United States and Canada (Cambridge University Press, 2018) explains why unions are weaker in the United States than they are in Canada, but have not always been that way. Indeed, unionization rates were virtually identical for much of the twentieth century, then diverged in the 1960s. Against dominant accounts focused on long-standing differences in political cultures and institutions, Eidlin argues that the divergence resulted from different ruling party responses to working class upsurge in both countries during the Great Depression and World War II. In Canada, an initially more hostile state response ended up embedding “the class idea”—the idea of class as a salient, legitimate political category—more deeply in policies, policies, and practices than in the United States, where class interests were reduced to “special interests.” In this symposium, three noted labor scholars engage critically with the book. Cedric de Leon interrogates Eidlin’s account of the role of racial divisions in explaining divergence, noting “more persistence and convergence than there is rupture and divergence” between these two countries on this issue. Nelson Lichtenstein’s critique focuses on the exceptionally vociferous character of US employer hostility, which he argues that Eidlin downplays. And Judith Stepan-Norris notes the surprising lack of actual class actors in a book about class organization, while raising interpretive questions about the relation between labor and the Communist Party in both countries.

T1  - REONTOLOGIZATION OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY IN THE LIQUID AND GLOBAL WORLD
AN  - 2645536088
AB  - In this article, I intend to highlight the fact that the realities that are being recorded at the morphological level of contemporary societies (the phenomenon of migration, wars, the dynamics of mobility and communication, the economic pace, the health crisis generated by Covid-19) are bringing to the fore the redefinition of religious identity. What is undeniably clear is that Western societies have become an ethnic and religious mosaic, a diversity that requires specific regulations in terms of norms in order to avoid conflict. However, this ethno-religious diversity also calls for an interpretation of the relationship between identities. The aim of my analysis is to argue as to whether or not religious identity is an inflexible, immobile reality, static in its representativeness towards and in relation to other identities representing different religious cultures. In this respect, I will insist on the role that migration plays in the construction of religious identity. Is religious identity decomposing in the context of the liquid flow of global society? Are the boundaries of such an identity, as structures of individual, social, cultural validation, desubstantiated in the daily experience of religious diversity and in the dynamics of current societal transformations?Alternate abstract:Dans cet article, j'entends souligner le fait que les réalités qui s'enregistrent au niveau morphologique des sociétés contemporaines (le phénomène de migration, les guerres, les dynamiques de mobilité et de communication, le rythme économique, la crise sanitaire générée by Covid-19) mettent au premier plan la redéfinition de l'identité religieuse. Ce qui est indéniable, c'est que les sociétés occidentales sont devenues une mosaïque ethnique et religieuse, une diversité qui nécessite des régulations spécifiques en termes de normes afin d'éviter les conflits. Mais cette diversité ethno-religieuse appelle aussi une lecture des relations entre les identités. Le but de mon analyse est d'argumenter pour savoir si l'identité religieuse est ou non une réalité inflexible, immobile, statique dans sa représentativité envers et par rapport à d'autres identités représentant différentes cultures religieuses. A cet égard, j'insisterai sur le rôle que joue la migration dans la construction de l'identité religieuse. L'identité religieuse se décompose-t-elle dans le contexte du flux liquide de la société mondiale? Les frontières d'une telle identité, en tant que structures de validation individuelle, sociale, culturelle, sont-elles infondées dans l'expérience quotidienne de la diversité religieuse et dans la dynamique des transformations sociétales en cours?Alternate abstract:În acest articol îmi propun să evidenţiez faptul că realităţile care se înregistrează la nivelul morfologic al societăţilor contemporane (fenomenul migraţiei, războaiele, dinamica mobilităţii și comunicării, ritmul economic, criza de sănătate generată). de Covid-19) aduc în prim plan redefinirea identităţii religioase. Ceea ce este incontestabil clar este că societăţile occidentale au devenit un mozaic etnic și religios, o diversitate care necesită reglementări specifice în ceea ce privește normele pentru a evita conflictele. Cu toate acestea, această diversitate etno-religioasă necesită și o interpretare a relaţiei dintre identităţi. Scopul analizei mele este de a argumenta dacă identitatea religioasă este sau nu o realitate inflexibilă, imobilă, statică în reprezentativitatea ei faţă de și în relaţie cu alte identităţi care reprezintă diferite culturi religioase. În acest sens, voi insista asupra rolului pe care îl joacă migraţia în construirea identităţii religioase. Se descompune identitatea religioasă în contextul fluxului lichid al societăţii globale? Graniţele unei astfel de identităţi, ca structuri de validare individuală, socială, culturală, sunt desubstanţiate în experienţa zilnică a diversităţii religioase și în dinamica transformărilor societale actuale?

T1  - Ethnic emancipation and conflict escalation in Uganda
AN  - 2468554627
AB  - This article examines why the emancipation of ethnic groups has failed to address ethnic conflicts in Uganda. Successive Ugandan governments, especially the current regime of President Yoweri Museveni, have attempted to end the country’s history of ethnic strife by creating separate constituencies, separate districts and separate kingdoms for marginalised ethnic groups to free them from the domination of powerful ethnic groups. Focussing on the Rwenzori area of western Uganda where ethnic violence is severest, I show how the approach of ethnic emancipation reproduces ethnicity as the basis for political inclusion and escalates rather than abates ethnic contestations. This study should shed more light on the challenge of ethnic federalism in other countries like Ethiopia and Nigeria.

T1  - Is microaggression an oxymoron? A mixed methods study on attitudes toward racial microaggressions among United States university students
AN  - 2466255097
AB  - To best understand the possible negative health and social consequences associated with racial microaggression, in-depth understanding of how people judge these events is needed. People of Color (POC) and White participants (N = 64) were recruited for a mixed-methods study that incorporated quantitative attitude ratings and focus group interviews. Participants read and discussed their attitudes toward five vignettes that reflected microassault, microinsult, and microinvalidation scenarios. Semantic differential ratings showed that participants judged microassaults to be most unacceptable, followed by microinsults and then microinvalidations. Using a grounded theory approach, our qualitative analysis of interview data revealed five thematic categories. First, participants judged receivers’ psychological harm to be a critical consideration for their attitudes toward microaggression scenarios; they discussed factors associated with individual differences in appraisals, prior exposures to discrimination, and sensitivity to race. Second, participants were less consistent in their opinion about the role of the deliverers’ intent on their judgment of microaggressions; many considered microaggression events to be results of deliverers’ cultural ignorance and racial insensitivity. Third, our analysis revealed the central importance of contexts that shaped participants’ attitudes toward microaggression. Fourth, participants also discussed the notion that receivers of microaggression were racist for calling attention to race issues. Finally, POC participants tended to relate to the vignettes and use their lived experiences to contextualize their opinions about racial microaggression. The current results raise concerns regarding the conceptualization and utility of the word “microaggression,” especially within the broader contexts of racism and major discrimination. Other empirical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Opening the black box of contact: Unravelling the ways through which positive contact is imagined in a post‐conflict context
AN  - 2457211583
AB  - While there is growing support for the prejudice‐reduction effects of imagined contact, knowledge of the content of imagery in imagined contact studies remains scarce. This qualitative study aims to address this gap by unravelling the ways of imagining an intergroup encounter that is indeed positive. Our data consist of the imagined contact stories of 43 participants in two imagined contact studies conducted in Cyprus, a post‐conflict context characterised by low levels of contact because of long‐standing division across ethnic lines. Our analysis yielded four themes corresponding to four ways of construing positive contact: imagining a good Other, a similar Other, an inferior Other, as well as imagining successfully overcoming obstacles emerging before or during contact. While participants came up with ways to imagine positive contact that are consistent with intergroup contact literature (e.g., intergroup similarities, decategorisation), a closer look at the findings reveals that in composing a positive intergroup experience, participants made use of dysfunctional stereotypes and conflict‐perpetuating narratives whose objective is to protect their superior status and to ensure their safety during contact. The findings serve as a word of caution for imagined contact as a prejudice‐reduction intervention and they also attest to the importance of deeply knowing the psychological composition of the groups which (imagined) contact interventions typically aim to tackle.

T1  - Immigration, opportunity, and assimilation in a technology economy
AN  - 2471727804
AB  - We examine access to institutions and opportunity for entrepreneurs in a rising tech economy. A significant proportion of entrepreneurs and CEOs of tech firms in the American economy are either first- or second-generation immigrant minorities. Are these minority entrepreneurs assimilating into a rising economic elite? To what extent is the technology economy segmented by ethnic boundaries and sectors? On a range of empirical measures, including access to financial and social capital, firm performance, and normative beliefs on fairness and cooperation, we find second-generation immigrant minority tech entrepreneurs to be strikingly similar to their white counterparts. This study sheds new light on the institutional environment of a new regional technology economy, whereby barriers of entry are high in terms of human capital but economic competition is structurally and culturally open to immigrant minority entrepreneurs.

T1  - Housing the Unhomely: A Study of Srilankan Panchamar Fiction
AN  - 2444579943
AB  - The emergence of Tamil ethnic nationalism in Sri Lanka in the 1980s has brought about significant geopolitical and social changes in the island nation. The ethno-nationalist mobilizations by the Sinhalese and Tamils censored the caste system and considered it as a divisive force. Caste ceased to be a marker of identity in official documents. Nevertheless, Tamil society continued to be pivoted on caste norms and conventions. As a paradox, caste was removed from the public realm, but continued to dominate the lives of the people at the local and personal level. The caste ideologies of purity and pollution dominated the social fabric, resulting in the exploitation and discrimination of Panchamars, a community which occupied the lowest rungs of the caste order. Between the 1950s and 1980s there were significant voices of dissent against caste oppression suffered by the Panchamars. The advent of the Tamil ethnic nationalist movement muted the voices protesting against caste hierarchy. Nevertheless, there were several novels, short stories and poems written in Tamil by Panchamars, during the 1970s and 1980s, which contradicts the notion of equality and solidarity among Sri Lankan Tamils. This essay draws on Homi Bhabha’s theory of “Third space” and “unhomely” and analyses Panchamar literatures as “enunciations” of caste discrimination prevalent in Sri Lankan society. While Panchamar literatures function as a counter-discourse to the unified Tamil identity espoused by Tamil nationalists, it has not brought any major social transformation within the caste society of the Sri Lankan Tamils. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptualizations of habitus and field, this essay argues a compatible social field is necessary for the transformation of the third space to an emancipatory site, without which it will remain a mere reactionary space.

T1  - Belonging and boundaries in Little Guyana: Conflict, culture, and identity in Richmond Hill, New York
AN  - 2429521016
AB  - Research on the assimilation of contemporary second-generation Americans has shown that ethnic enclaves are saturated with several cultural, religious, and transnational amenities that facilitate the process of immigrant integration in the United States. Missing from this research is a discussion of how middle-class, second-generation Americans use urban enclaves as a means of remaining attached to their ethnic identities. One such group with members who has achieved middle-class status and remained culturally attached to their enclave is Indo-Guyanese Americans of Indian Caribbean descent. This ethnographic study examines the ways in which second-generation Indo-Guyanese Americans use familial, cultural, and religious interactions in Little Guyana to create a sense of belonging and community. As the descendants of re-migrants, their multiethnic identities are complicating their assimilation in American society. Their experiences with racialization and social exclusion from white, South Asian American, and non-co-ethnic circles have pushed them toward developing their multiethnic identity. I use the term ethnic restoration to discuss how second-generation Indo-Guyanese Americans are using transnational ethnic consumption, religious institutions, and co-ethnic interactions to validate their ethnic identities and resist racialization. Their engagement in ethno-religious institutions in Richmond Hill is central to this analysis, as they embrace their Indian Caribbean identities more intensely after experiencing racialization. The findings of this research point to the need to understand why middle-class second-generation Americans are ethnically attached to urban enclaves.

T1  - Policy Options and Approaches to Unity and Diversity in Education in the Post-Apartheid South Africa: A Critical Reflection
AN  - 2610964740
AB  - Many countries in the world have for a long time grappled with the problem of reconciling national unity with cultural diversity. This problem arises out of a multiplicity of situations: (1) continuing ethnic, linguistic or cultural minorities; (2) marked regional claims to autonomy or cultural identity; (3) the influx of migrants of heterogeneous cultural backgrounds; and (4) socio-economic conflicts arising out of unemployment or other socio-economic illness and differences of age-group, gender, race and class (Cross:1992). Another factor is what Halls describes as ‘gigantism’: Countries, like much modern architecture, suffer from ‘gigantism’: psychologically, ordinary people feel unable to identify with large entities, supranational or national. ‘Small’ is not only ‘beautiful’, but comprehensible (Halls, 1983). In many cases, these situations can lead to social conflict or cultural clashes between majority and minority groups, and the assertion by minorities of a will to preserve a separate cultural identity. Under apartheid, South African education was divided into 19 education departments, all of which were either racially or ethnically defined (Kallaway:1986). The post-apartheid government since 1994 has grappled with the challenge of national unity and diversity in education, for an educational policy aimed at bringing about national unity, democracy, non-racialism and non-sexism and capable of redressing the historical imbalances imposed by the apartheid system in South Africa? In the democratic dispensation, the development of a national education system necessitated fundamental change to existing educational policies and practices. The purpose of this article is to examine policy options to address the issues of national unity and cultural diversity in education in South Africa.

T1  - The religious field in a Russian Muslim village: A Bourdieusian perspective on Islam
AN  - 2429084405
AB  - Research on Islam in Russia has been growing in recent years. Despite the variety of perspectives adopted by scholars in the field, attention has focused mostly on responses to emerging globalised trends of Islamic orthodoxy in traditionally Muslim areas which had historically cultivated their own understandings of Islamic religious tradition strongly intertwined with local life. Most scholars of Russian Islam argue that the split among Russian Muslims between the followers of (global) ‘orthodoxy’ and (local) ‘traditions’ lies along generational lines. However, the sociological microdynamic of this process is still under-researched. This paper presents the results of an in-depth ethnographic study of a Muslim community in one of the Tatar villages of the multi-ethnic Volga region. It argues that the generational perspective is not sufficient to explain the split between ‘orthodox’ and ‘traditional’ Muslims. By employing Pierre Bourdieu’s approach to social reality and the religious field, the paper examines how a conflict arises on the base of competing discourses on Islamic norms and practices, but goes far beyond it, and concerns social, economic and symbolic spheres of the villagers’ lives. It shows that not only generational but also other social characteristics based on various forms of capital need to be taken into account to explain the split between orthodox-oriented Muslims and the followers of local Islam.

T1  - Anticipatory tribalism: accusatory politics in the ‘New Gambia’
AN  - 2437391639
AB  - This article examines the upsurge in denunciations of ‘tribalism’ in public debate during The Gambia's transition from the autocracy of Yahya Jammeh to the ‘New Gambia’ under President Adama Barrow. In these public debates, derogatory statements about particular ethnicities articulate fears of present or future alliances to monopolise political power. These fears are disproportionate to attempts of organised political mobilisation on ethnic grounds, which remain marginal. It is argued that accusatory politics are a salient, and neglected, feature of ethnic dynamics in contemporary Gambian – and African – politics. This politics of accusation involves the contestation and negotiation of moral legitimacy in the political sphere, in a manner challenging the separation of the moral and the political undergirding scholarly distinctions between ethnicity and tribalism.

T1  - Reading Aparicio in Latinx/a/o studies: Toward remembering and re-imagining our academic location
AN  - 2404836313
AB  - In her pivotal and highly influential 1999 article “Reading the ‘Latino’ in Latino Studies: Toward Re-Imagining Our Academic Location,” Frances Aparicio insists that there are multifaceted ways of experiencing latinidad. She offered “a reading of both latino and latinidad as terms that carry with them a diverse array of competing authenticities or paradigms of identity that, together, and in conflict with each other, constitute the heterogeneous experiences of various Latino national groups” (Aparicio 1999, p. 10). As a graduate student, I was struck by that particular sentence, which inspired my first scholarly publication in 2001, “Colao Subjectivities: PortoMex and MexiRican Perspectives on Language and Identity,” and has continued to shape my research. “Colao Subjectivities” came to life as a seminar paper for one of Frances’s courses, The Politics of Language and Cultural Identity (Fall 1999), where I first read “Reading the ‘Latino’ in Latino Studies.” Most readers can detect Frances’s imprint in the essay, as well as that of sociologist Felix Padilla, and of cultural theorist Chabram-Dernersesian (1994). Some may perceive hints of Mexican American/Chicana writer Sandra Cisneros. But few, if any, imagine that the conceptual framework of “colao subjectivities”—the negotiation of multiple national-origin identities within the formation, modification, and performance of latinidades—is most indebted to the work of Puerto Rican poet Tato Laviera, specifcally the poem titled “café” (1985). This kind of epistemological foundation is signature Aparicio teaching and mentoring, a cultivation of interdisciplinarity that, I think, is often overlooked in “Reading the ‘Latino’ in Latino Studies.” More than offering a capacious conceptualization of latinidad, Frances taught her students that there are heterogeneous ways of studying latinidades. Engaging competing scholarly paradigms, approaches, and orientations “together, and in conflict with each other,” is the promise of Latino studies as a “central site for interdisciplinary work, collective projects, and for reconceptualizing the relationship between community and the production of knowledge” (Aparicio 1999, p. 4). This essay, “Reading Aparicio in Latinx/a/o Studies,” is as much a partial flashback to my intellectual formation as a Latinx/a/o studies scholar of Chicago latinidades, mentored and guided by Frances Aparicio and the collective projects she has engaged, as it is also a flash-forward to the kind of scholarship she continues to inspire and encourage in her students-turned-colegas. Sandra Cisneros’s collection of prose vignettes, The House on Mango Street (1984), and Felix Padilla’s sociological study, Latino Ethnic Consciousness (1985), bookend this tribute piece. As points of reference, they serve to reflect Frances’s interdisciplinary teaching. She used these two important texts to “underline some of the factors that created heterogeneous ways of experiencing Latinidad” through “inter-Latino dynamics,” “social and cultural interaction,” and circumstances that prompted calculated “political alliances” (Aparicio 1999, p. 9). The essay’s core, however, takes ups Frances’s appeal to scholars of latinidades for more historical research on how “diverse Latino groups have constituted particular cultural productions” that came to be associated with one national identity or a narrow notion of latinidad to illuminate various forms of “inter-Latino and inter-racial transculturations” (Aparicio 1999, pp. 9–10). Through an analysis of a little-known journal project, ECOS, published out of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) in the 1980s, I show how we scholars of Latinx/a/o studies are still catching up to what earlier complex visions of latinidades evoked and expressed in cultural practice (Aparicio 1999, p. 5).

T1  - The Complexities of Culturally Responsive Organized Activities: Latino Parents’ and Adolescents’ Perspectives
AN  - 2389148507
AB  - Grounded in bioecological theories, this mixed-method article examines aspects of culturally responsive organized activities. Study 1 used path analysis to quantitatively test relations between ethnic cultural features of activities (ways of integrating ethnic culture) and concurrent experiences (N = 150 Latino adolescents). Findings were mixed, such that some features (e.g., teaching ethnic culture) predicted positive (e.g., increased autonomy) and negative (e.g., emotional) experiences. Study 2 disentangled the nuances of ethnic culture by qualitatively exploring perspectives on three features (N = 34 Mexican-origin adolescent-parent dyads): ethnic cultural content, same-ethnic leaders/peers, and Spanish language use. Thematic analysis revealed the complexities of ethnic culture. Some parents and adolescents wanted activities that represented mainstream American culture; others wanted Latino ethnic culture, but were unhappy with the ways it was integrated into activities. Parents and adolescents thought their ethnic culture was misrepresented (e.g., Cinco de Mayo was celebrated as Mexican Independence Day) or represented narrowly (e.g., La Bamba was the school band’s only Mexican song). Findings suggest that integrating ethnic cultural features is not an “all or nothing” decision, and how it is done matters considerably. Families’ perspectives and voice would help ensure ethnic culture is integrated in authentic, preferred ways.

T1  - Urban versus Rural Voters in Malaysia: More Similarities than Differences
AN  - 2394535701
AB  - In Malaysia, ethnicity is the primary social cleavage around which politics is articulated, organized and contested. Yet, extant scholarship also suggests urbanization as an important secondary cleavage driving political conflict. Urban voters are perceived to be more politically engaged and active, and politically more liberal, as compared to their rural counterparts. They are therefore more likely to vote for political parties opposed to the Barisan Nasional. But is there really an urban-rural dichotomy in Malaysia? This article contends that the existing literature regarding urbanization's effect on political attitudes and voting behaviour in Malaysia is fraught with theoretical, methodological and empirical challenges. Furthermore, survey data from three waves of the Asian Barometer suggests that differences with regards to political attitudes between urban and rural Malaysians diminish substantially or contradict theoretical expectations when other demographic variables are controlled for. These results suggest that scholars of Malaysian politics should be wary of findings that exaggerate urban-rural differences. Perpetuating the stereotype misleads future research, entrenches political polarization and deepens the potential for social conflict.

T1  - A call to action: mobilising local resources in Ethiopia for urban IDPs
AN  - 2410839488
AB  - In 2018, about 1,340 registered households and unregistered internally displaced persons (IDPs) fled ethnic conflict in the Somali region of Ethiopia to seek safety in Adama, the capital of the Oromia region, approximately 100km southeast of Addis Ababa. The IDPs, who were mainly ethnic Oromo, arrived in Adama over the course of several months. The sudden and huge influx of IDPs put immense pressure on the city's capacity to provide the necessary support. While most of the focus on internal displacement in Ethiopia remains on the Somali region, significant lessons can be learned from Adama's response. In the absence of large-scale international assistance, a little-known campaign to address the needs of IDPs led to a multi-level response from federal, regional and - in particular - local urban actors. Ultimately, under the auspices of the city administration, all 28 sectoral government bureaus, hundreds of private sector actors, IS kebeles (neighbourhood districts), 243 Idirs (community-based associations) and many local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals participated in supporting and settling the IDPs. This may be a unique instance of an entirety Ethiopian, collective and largely local effort to operate successfully at this scale and within such a short period of time.

T1  - Взаимоотношения родителей и взрослых детей: понятия для анализа
TT  - Relationship Between Parents and Adult Children: Concepts for Analysis
AN  - 2488069808
AB  - В статье поставлена задача систематизации понятийного аппарата для изучения взаимоотношений родителей и взрослых детей. Обосновывается актуальность предметной области, представлены определения и примеры верификации таких понятий, как уход, солидарность, конфликт, амбивалентность, отчуждение. При описании результатов эмпирических исследований подробно анализируются индикаторы межпоколенческой солидарности. На макроуровне показана зависимость отношений взрослых детей и родителей от культурных традиций, уровня модернизации различных стран, социального режима, городской/сельской местности. На микроуровне на результатах зарубежных и российских исследований демонстрируется зависимость этих отношений от пола, социального класса, этнической группы, брачного статуса детей и их родителей. Акцентируется целесообразность использования унифицированных индикаторов и показателей представленных понятий для обеспечения сопоставимости полученных эмпирических результатов с целью анализа как кратковременных, так и долговременных тенденций в отношениях взрослых детей и родителей в России. Практическая актуальность таких исследований обусловлена необходимостью прогноза роли семьи либо государственных или частных учреждений в уходе и поддержке пожилых людей.Alternate abstract:The relevance of studying the relationship between parents and adult children is due to a number of factors that since the beginning of the new century have significantly influenced intergenerational relations around the world. These are technological, economic, political, and demographic changes. The projected decrease in the income of the working middle generation with children, deurbanization, localization, and other circumstances in connection with the global crisis may also affect the dynamics of relations between adult children and parents, which may be the subject for special analysis. Changing the models of interaction between parents and adult children can become one of the adaptive strategies in Russia, where in comparison with other countries the quality of life of people in retirement age is the worst. The article sets the task of systematization of the conceptual apparatus for studying the relationship between parents and adult children. The relevance and scientific significance of the subject area are substantiated. Definitions and examples of verification of concepts care, solidarity, conflict, ambivalence and alienation are presented. When analyzing the results of empirical research using these concepts, the study of the components of solidarity is presented in greater detail. At the macro level, the relationship between adult children and parents depends on cultural traditions, level of modernization of various countries, social regime, and urban/rural areas. At the micro level, the results of foreign and Russian studies demonstrate the dependence of these relationships with gender, social class, ethnic group, marital status of children and their parents. The emphasis is made on the feasibility of using unified indicators and indices of the presented concepts to ensure comparability of the obtained empirical results in order to analyze both short-term and long-term trends. Practical relevance of such research in Russia is linked to the need to develop social support measures and forecast the role of family vs state/private institutions in the care and support of older people.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity, Segregation and Ethnocentric Trust in Africa
AN  - 2348203286
AB  - Ethnic diversity is generally associated with less social capital and lower levels of trust. However, most empirical evidence for this relationship is focused on generalized trust, rather than more theoretically appropriate measures of group-based trust. This article evaluates the relationship between ethnic diversity – at the national, regional and local levels – and the degree to which coethnics are trusted more than non-coethnics, a value referred to here as the ‘coethnic trust premium’. Using public opinion data from sixteen African countries, this study finds that citizens of ethnically diverse states express, on average, more ethnocentric trust. However, within countries, regional ethnic diversity is associated with less ethnocentric trust. This same negative pattern between diversity and ethnocentric trust appears across districts and enumeration areas within Malawi. The article then shows, consistent with these patterns, that diversity is only detrimental to intergroup trust at the national level when ethnic groups are spatially segregated. These results highlight the importance of the spatial distribution of ethnic groups on intergroup relations, and question the utility of micro-level studies of interethnic interactions for understanding macro-level group dynamics.

T1  - The impact of race relations on NFL attendance: An econometric analysis
AN  - 2344551098
AB  - Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts.

T1  - Gender Irrelevance: How Women and Men Rationalize Their Support for the Right
AN  - 2322319430
AB  - Right-wing groups have generally been considered gender-conservative or, in some instances, sexist. Given this background, it is a puzzle why young people, particularly women with relatively liberal gender attitudes, support these groups. This article tries to answer this question by comparing men’s and women’s justifications for participation in nativist and antimigration political groups. It develops the concept of gender irrelevance, defined as the processes and strategies through which members of these groups render male dominance and gender segregation trivial within their organizations; the sexist behaviors of some group members tolerable; and concerns about gender inequalities unimportant, secondary, and ultimately irrelevant in their decisions to support these groups. The article further illustrates the strategies of gender irrelevance, which include the misrepresentation, naturalization, individualization, and universalization of gender inequality and biases; the construction and deployment of the twin discourses of female privilege and male disadvantage; the tendency to compartmentalize gender biases; the argument of compromising gender; and criticism against an allegedly exaggerated, inconsistent, and double-standard feminism. The research concerns Hong Kong’s young and educated supporters of nativist and antimigration political groups. They are political minorities in relation to the omnipresent Chinese state but majorities at home in relation to mainland Chinese immigrants whom they construct as the other. We believe that the concept of gender irrelevance is applicable to other contexts and not merely to these young people in Hong Kong. It has the potential to help us understand the global rise of the Right.

T1  - Minority Ethnic, Race and Sect Relations in Pakistan:Hazara Residing in Quetta
AN  - 2475782701
AB  - This paper charts systematic persecution, ethnic profiling, target killing, kidnapping, harassment, racial discrimination and ghettoization, ethnic Hazara face in Quetta.The Hazara, a marginalized ethnicity severely discriminated, began migrating initially into British India, from Afghanistan, in 1890s. During 1962-63, the government of Pakistan granted ethnic Hazara citizenship rights. Constitutionally, they were to enjoy equal rights, might form political parties, to represent them in elected bodies of Balochistan and Pakistan. Previously, ethnic Hazara individuals rose to the positions of:Generals; rather, Chief of the Army Staff; and to Federal/ProvincialMinisters/Governors, in Pakistan. However, the Hazara began facing discrimination and ethnic, cultural as well as confessional (a majority of Hazara profess Shia sect of Islam) persecution, in Pakitan, in the last two deacades of the previous mellenium, at unofficial, and continue to face, both, at official and unofficial levels.
Since 2012, computerised National Identity Cards of ethnic Hazara in Quetta have been suspended/blocked, a step tentamount to denial of citizenship rights of Pakistan. A Sunni militant terrorist outfit, Lashkar-Jhangive, warned ethnic Hazara of turning Pakistan into their graveyard, in case, they did not leave this country. Following Iranian revolution enusuing Iran/Saudi (Shia-Sunni) conflict resulted into proxy war. Hazara leaders suspect, systematic persecution of Hazara, aims at, evicting them of expensive land they occupy in and around Quetta. They view ethnic profiling/cleansing not only as attempts to force Hazara sell their houses and businesses at throw away prices, suspecting their loyalities, and reversing 1962-63 official notification, that recognises the ethnic Hazara Pakistani citizens.

T1  - The Intersectional Dynamics of Political Violence and Gender in the Kurdish Conflict
AN  - 2340239227
AB  - What is the relationship between social, historical, and political dynamics and gender in the use of violence? This research uses the Kurdish conflict to examine this question. On the basis of empirical examples about Kurdish women, it focuses on ethnic identity, patriarchy, social class, generation, and politicization within their historical and spatial variations. It argues that gender dynamics do not operate alone but intersect in many ways with these dynamics to influence political violence. It concludes that the way these dynamics engage with each other depends on the subjectivation process taking place within a historically contingent horizon.

T1  - Three Dimensions of the Post-Soviet "Frozen" Conflicts
AN  - 2350124402
AB  - This article is devoted to the analysis of three dimensions of post-Soviet "frozen" conflicts-the internal, post-imperial/post-Soviet and international, the dialectics of the interconnection of these dimensions in the relations between Russia and EU/West and the prospects for the settlement of these conflicts. The emergence of new independent states as a result of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the USSR gave rise to the separatism of national minorities large enough to claim their own statehood, which became the cause of many intrastate conflicts. For all the economic, political, cultural and ethnic specificities of these internal state conflicts and differences of their geographical positions, they share some essential features. These include the bitterness of the defeat of the dominant titular ethnic group in the conflict with separatists as a result of external interference, the refugee factor (with the exception of Transnistria), the loss of territorial integrity as well as the fact that communism in the new independent states was replaced by nationalism. The only exception during the collapse of the USSR was Russia, where the communist system was overthrown by revolutionary democrats, whereas Russian nationalists advocated the restoration of the Soviet empire. However, this lasted for a very short period. As contradictions between Russia and its Western partners emerged and grew, the conflicts in the post-Soviet space became the mirrors of their rivalry threatening international and regional security. This was amply demonstrated by the Ukraine conflict. The settlement of "frozen" conflicts in the CIS can serve as the beginning of the revival of trust, which arises only in the process of joint problem solving.

T1  - Does violence beget violence? The role of family ethnic socialization and intergroup bias among youth in a setting of protracted intergroup conflict
AN  - 2264572988
AB  - Does violence beget violence among youth in a setting of protracted conflict? Framed by a developmental intergroup approach, this paper examines the mediating roles of family ethnic socialization and intergroup bias. Two time points from 466 (50% female/50% male, 51% Catholic/49% Protestant) 14- to 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland were analyzed. Bootstrapped chain mediation found that previous experience with sectarianism, or intergroup violence, was positively related to family ethnic socialization, which predicted later intergroup bias, which was related to higher levels of adolescent participation in sectarian antisocial behavior. Findings identify the importance of family processes in the link from experiencing to committing sectarian acts. Implications for preventing youth participation in sectarianism are discussed.

T1  - Intervention: grassroots organizing and mobilization
AN  - 2291849633
AB  - Violently divided cities - such as Mostar, Beirut, and Belfast - are places characterized by a deep conflict over the legitimacy of the state itself. These are places riven by ethnic and/or ethnonational cleavages that permeate all areas of political and social life (Nagle & Clancy, 2010). Divisions are reinforced by historically embedded patterns of social segregation and endogamy meaning that levels of intergroup distrust and hostility are high, economic growth is low and group boundaries are sharp enough so that 'membership is clear and, with few exceptions, unchangeable' (Lustick, 1979, p. 325).

T1  - Does Immigration Reduce the Support for Welfare Spending? A Cautionary Tale on Spatial Panel Data Analysis
AN  - 2258639187
AB  - There has been a long-lasting debate over whether increasing ethnic diversity undermines support for social welfare, and whether this conflict thesis applies not only to the United States, but also to European welfare states. In their 2016 ASR article, Schmidt-Catran and Spies analyzed a panel (1994 to 2010) of regional units in Germany and concluded that this thesis also holds for Germany. We argue that their analysis suffers from misspecification: their model specification assumes parallel time trends in welfare support in all German regions. However, time trends strongly differed between Western and Eastern Germany after reunification. In the 1990s, Eastern Germans’ attitudes adapted to a less interventionist Western welfare system (“Goodbye Lenin effect”). When allowing for heterogeneous time trends, we find no evidence that increasing proportions of foreigners undermine welfare support, or that this association is moderated by economic hardship (high unemployment rates). We conclude with some general suggestions regarding the conceptualization of context effects in spatial analyses.

T1  - What keeps diaspora from contributing to peace processes? Exploring diaspora online narratives of homeland conflict
AN  - 2253101762
AB  - Politically active diaspora are increasingly recognized as key stakeholders in homeland peace processes, driven in large part by the globalization of communication technologies. Previous research has identified ways that diaspora contribute to peace processes in their countries of origin, or foment conflict. This study seeks to fill a gap in the literature regarding factors that influence diaspora contributions using Rwanda as a case study. Status posts from public and anonymous Facebook and Twitter accounts of self-identified Rwandan diaspora living in the Global North. Thematic analysis and methods drawn from virtual ethnography revealed several themes that were consistent with the literature on conflict-generated diaspora typology related to ethnic identity, ethnic reconciliation, victim status and motivations framed in human rights terms. The results highlight several dynamics that can potentially serve as barriers to diaspora positive engagement, as well as the enduring nature of ethnic conflict.

T1  - "We are a collective, a lot of us together, standing up": South African black lesbian women's activism against discourses of blackwashing homophobia
AN  - 2281798842
AB  - Research centring South African black lesbian women's identities has increased significantly in recent years. However, a politics of visibility (in academic and public spaces) has not secured equal status and human rights for many of these women. Instead, dominant discourses of blackwashing homophobia (re)produce colonial strategies of othering, associating their identities with violence, fear, shame and victimhood. Black lesbian women are often constructed as inevitable targets of special crimes - particularly that of 'corrective rape' in township settings (in the case of South Africa). This repeated, negative stereotype conceals the effects of historical and contemporary inequalities that constrain the constitutional protection and social sanctioning of black, queer identities. An increasingly relevant, but under-examined area of study is the potential for collective political action to disrupt reductionist discourses, recognising these women's identities as whole, plural, fluid, complex and contradictory. This article thus focalises one exemplar of such resistance, using a feminist, intersectional methodological framework to explore secondary, textual data. The findings contribute to a growing body of research that foregrounds intersectionality theory as a valuable lens through which contemporary South African identities can be viewed. Counter-discourses that challenge blackwashing strategies are also offered. The findings allude specifically to the significance of black lesbian women's community-level mobilisation against gender-based violence, and its intersections with racial and sexual inequalities. Where blackwashing discourses tend to essentialise and divide these identities into parts, findings suggest that for some black lesbian women, racial, gendered and sexual identities are indivisible: connected particularly to joy, solidarity, pleasure, power, resilience and strength.

T1  - Structural Inequality and Ethnic Bloc Voting
AN  - 2230245800
AB  - ObjectiveA large body of ethnic politics literature suggests that horizontal inequalities exacerbate ethnic conflict. However, the relationship between intergroup inequality and ethnic bloc voting behavior has escaped empirical analysis. We test the relationship between ethnic bloc voting and horizontal inequality by examining how relative disparity affects individuals’ probability of supporting the same political party as other co‐ethnics.MethodsThis project uses data from the Integrated World and European Values Survey to test the relationship between relative disparity and ethnic bloc support in ethnically polarized states from 1981 to 2006.ResultsOur findings indicate that the probability of supporting the same party as other co‐ethnics is influenced by within‐group as well as between‐group inequality, while being relatively unaffected by individual‐level income.ConclusionWe conclude that increasing horizontal inequality, and not individual resources, leads to higher rates of ethnically polarized voting, which may lead to greater levels of ethnic conflict.

AB  - Studies on historical episodes of intergroup violence and conflicts have underlined the complicit role of bystanders in extreme intergroup dynamics. In regard to contemporary multicultural societies, the concept of intergroup indifference has recently been introduced, defined as being uncaring vis-à-vis arbitrary policies affecting other social groups. In the present manuscript, the reasons why an indifferent position towards minorities may imply some prejudicial attitudes towards them will be analyzed. In particular, moral disengagement and lack of social responsibility are considered to be variables that could explain why indifference might mask prejudicial attitudes and a lack of altruism for out-groups. The results show that moral disengagement and social responsibility are indeed significant mediators of the prediction of intergroup indifference to racism and altruism. In particular, the mediation model shows that moral disengagement partially mediates the path from indifference to racism, while social responsibility partially mediates that from indifference to altruism.

T1  - 100 Years of Sociology in Colonial and Post-Colonial Cyprus: Mapping Public Sociology and Critical Thought of a Small Divided Island-Country
AN  - 2355335527
AB  - This paper charts 100 years of sociology in Cyprus, detailing the sources, the contributions and the potential for public sociology. The paper connects Cypriot sociology to the broader critical thought in global sociological debates and explores the development of sociological and social thought in Cyprus in a small post-colonial, divided country. It critiques explanations for its marginal position as an academic discipline in Cyprus. This paper challenges the prevailing view that Cypriot society is 'isolated', 'insular' and 'barren' when it comes to producing ideas, theories and sociology, including the effects of the Cyprus problem and the 'deficient modernisation thesis', best expounded by Caesar Mavratsas. It then provides the first taxonomy of the sources and themes on the evolution of Cypriot sociology before it focuses on current issues and developments. The paper argues that, despite this relative marginality at an institutional level, there is an abundance of sociological thinking outside, ojien against or beyond the outmoded policy and sociology, often used as apologetics for the establishment. Public sociology and critical sociology provide serious challenge to hegemonic knowledge regarding different issues such as the Cyprus problem, state formations, ethnic conflict/relations class, gender, sexuality and migration. The paper examines how the combination of these historical factors, together with the particular organisation of institutional and class power, shaped all aspects of social and cultural life, including the development of sociology as a discipline. The paper concludes on the potential for critical and public sociology derived from the magma of Cypriot society.

T1  - Ethnic nationalism versus religious loyalty: The case of Kurds in Iran
AN  - 2202919522
AB  - When religious differences are present within an ethnic group, how do they affect the scope of its nationalist mobilization? The Kurds of Iran presents an ideal case to address this question given their religious diversity and varying levels of involvement in Kurdish nationalist movements. Building on an institutional approach to ethnic identity, this article argues that the dynamics of Kurdish ethnic mobilization in Iran reflect the nature of political exclusion in the Islamic Republic that is primarily based on sectarian affiliation. The article, based on original datasets compiled using several languages, including Persian and Kurdish, shows that recruitment into the Kurdish insurgency in Iran is significantly stronger in the Sunni Kurdish areas than the Shiite ones. While religious identity limits the appeal of ethno‐nationalism among the Shiite Kurds, it doubles the sense of marginalization among the Sunni Kurds and makes them more receptive to violent insurgent mobilization.

TT  - Języki i kultury w kontakcie. Miejsce nowomówców w systemie edukacji na Górnych Łużycach
AN  - 2536462498
AB  - Upper Sorbs are a Slavic minority group living in eastern Germany. The number of Upper Sorbian speakers is diminishing. Upper Sorbs, the majority of whom are Catholics, have a strong ethnic identity based on language, faith, and tradition and they form a rather closed community in relation to the surrounding German population. To counteract the process of language loss, the Sorbs have established an educational project called ‘Witaj’. The continuation of this project is the `2 plus’ program of bilingual education in schools, which has been implemented by the federal state of Saxony. The idea behind these initiatives is to connect native Upper Sorbian speakers and learners in order to facilitate the achievement of language competence and to break down existing ethnic boundaries. The realisation of this concept has encountered numerous problems. The German-speaking pupils involved often feel unmotivated to learn Sorbian and are often rejected by the Sorbian-speaking community as (potential) members.This article presents the results of a research project examining the way young people from German-speaking homes who attend one of the Upper Sorbian middle schools acquire Sorbian language competence and how they create an identity in relation/opposition to their Sorbian-speaking peers. The analysis is based on the sociolinguistic observations of language practices conducted in the school in 2017 and on interviews with both native speakers and learners of Upper Sorbian. The article focuses on the following issues: relations between language practices, the necessary conditions for the active use of minority languages by learners, language and interpersonal contact, the acceptance of new speakers, and the creation of ‘communities of practice’.Alternate abstract:Łużyczanie są słowiańską mniejszością zamieszkującą we wschodniej części Niemiec. Liczba osób posługujących się językami łużyckimi, w tym językiem górnołużyckim, stale maleje. Górnołużyczanie, w przeważającej mierze katolicy, tworzą raczej zamkniętą wspólnotę, opartą o silną tożsamość etniczną, język, wiarę i tradycje. Aby przeciwdziałać procesowi utraty języka, Łużyczanie stworzyli program „Witaj”, którego kontynuacją był stworzony przez land Saksonii program dwujęzycznego nauczania „2 plus”. Celem tych programów było połączenie rodzimych użytkowników łużyckiego oraz dzieci uczących się go, aby umożliwić tym ostatnim zdobywanie kompetencji językowych i przełamać istniejące granice etniczne. Realizacja tego pomysłu napotyka jednak liczne problemy. Uczniowie niemieckojęzyczni często czują się niezmotywowani do uczenia się górnołużyckiego, często są też odrzucani przez łużyckojęzyczną wspólnotę jako (potencjalni) użytkownicy łużyckiego.Artykuł przedstawia wyniki badań dotyczących sposobu, w jaki młodzi ludzie z niemieckojęzycznych domów chodzący do jednej z górnołużyckich szkół średnich, zdobywają kompetencje językowe i jak tworzą swoją tożsamość w relacji lub opozycji do ich łużyckojęzycznych kolegów. Analiza oparta jest o socjolingwistyczne obserwacje praktyk językowych, prowadzonych w szkole w 2017 roku, i na wywiadach z uczniami górnołużycko- i niemieckojęzycznymi. Tekst koncentruje się na relacji między praktykami językowymi, warunkami niezbędnymi do tego, żeby język mniejszościowy mógł być aktywnie używany przez uczących się i tworzeniem relacji między ludźmi, poczucia akceptacji oraz wspólnot praktyki.

T1  - Forging inclusive practice in ethnically-segregated school systems: lessons from one multiethnic, bilingual education classroom in Sri Lanka
AN  - 2140793896
AB  - This paper offers a perspective on bilingual education (BE) as inclusive education. Ethnolinguistically-separated schools and classrooms in Sri Lanka resulted from an enduring, mother tongue instruction policy which abetted a deeply ethnically-divided nation. More recently, Sri Lanka has experimented with a BE programme in pursuit of enriching the perceived value of the local mother tongues as well as building students' knowledge of English as a global language. This article presents analysis of the inclusive practice of two Sri Lankan BE teachers in their attempts to advance social cohesion through bilingual education. We demonstrate the logic of practice focussing on four features of the teachers' work: promoting interethnic relations through regular change of seating arrangements; equal delegation of responsibilities and absence of favouritism; cooperative group work in ethnically heterogeneous groups; and, promoting heteroglossic language practices or translanguaging. The positive, inclusive consequences of these practices are corroborated by focus group data gathered from students in the school. We argue that teachers have a significant role in changing the logic of practice in the classroom, and that the implicit rules teachers encode in their pedagogy can reorient exclusionary, ethnocentric identity positioning towards more inclusive, supraethnic identities.

T1  - Ethnic identity without ethnic media? Diasporic cosmopolitanism, (social) media and distant conflict among young Kurds in London: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2126430117
AB  - Media are fundamental to the way communities make sense of conflicts. This also holds true for diaspora communities, who are involved in and affected by distant/homeland conflicts. Shifting away from the dominant focus on ‘radicalization’ through media in this context, this study looks at the role media play in making sense of such conflict among young Kurds in London. Data consist of focus groups with Kurdish youth, participant observations in community centres and ethnographic conversations. While media are generally perceived as the central forces through which diaspora youth experience and engage with the Kurdish conflict in Turkey, ethnic media, in particular Kurdish broadcasting, play a very limited role. The distance vis-à-vis ethnic media is analysed and explained through respondents’ discourses on diasporic cosmopolitanism. The results show that their shift away from ethnic media facilitates more solid ethnic identities and more enhanced engagements with the Kurdish conflict.

T1  - Toward a Multi-Causal Model of Successful Conflict Regulation through Territorial Self-Government: Lessons from South Tyrol
TT  - Ein multikausales Modell erfolgreicher Konfliktregulierung durch Territorialautonomie - der Fall Südtirol
AN  - 2191287734
AB  - Territorial autonomies have been increasingly implemented as tools for the regulation of ethnic self-determination conflicts. Recent literature has primarily focused on the debate about the general conflict-solving potential of territorial self-government in multi-ethnic societies. However, autonomy consolidation is not an entirely endogenous process, but affected by various structural and actor-centered factors. Previous studies have so far given unsatisfactory answers as to the conditions under which reforms of autonomy succeed or fail in post-conflict situations. Building on Social Identity Theory, it is argued that ethnic recognition is the all-important condition for autonomy consolidation, which, however, presupposes specific, favorable framework conditions. A high scope of transferred competencies, weak horizontal inequalities, democratic-inclusive institutions, minority-friendly parties, and international engagement are identified as pivotal factors supporting the process of mutual recognition between ethnic groups. To test our theoretical assumptions, we create a multi-causal process model. We find evidence for the proposed mechanisms in a process-tracing case study on South Tyrols successful autonomy consolidation.Alternate abstract:Mitunter stellen Autonomiereformen eine geeignete institutionelle Option dar, um ethnische Selbstbestimmungskonflikte in friedliche Bahnen zu lenken. Gleichwohl sind Territorialautonomien weder ein Allheilmittel noch von vornherein zum Scheitern verurteilt. Der Artikel argumentiert, dass die Konsolidierung eines Autonomiearrangements von einem Zusammenspiel günstiger struktureller und akteurzentrierter Faktoren abhängt, die eine gegenseitige Anerkennung zwischen Mehrheit und Minderheit als Grundvoraussetzung für ethnischen Frieden ermöglichen. Der Fall Südtirol macht deutlich, dass dem Grad an Selbstbestimmung, horizontalen Ungleichheiten, demokratisch-inklusiven Institutionen, minderheitenfreundlichen Parteien und internationaler Unterstützung eine entscheidende Rolle zukommt.

T1  - Integration of Refugees and Support for the Ethos of Conflict
AN  - 2100686062
AB  - Following forced expulsion and campaigns of ethnic cleansing, substantial portions of national communities affected by conflict no longer live within the boundaries of the state. Nevertheless, existing wartime and postwar public opinion research is largely confined to countries directly affected by conflict. As a result, current research may overlook important war-affected populations and processes shaping their opinions. I address this problem by examining the question: does incorporation in settlement countries reduce support for conflict ideology? Examining this question requires new microdata. I examine the results of a large-scale survey of ex-Yugoslavs in Sweden. The findings suggest that incorporation undermines support for conflict ideology by increasing the socioeconomic security and social identity complexity of migrants. This has important implications for multiculturalism policies in the context of the current global migration crisis.

T1  - Rearticulating sociological narratives: Brazilian social theory, African diaspora and disracialization of the black experience
AN  - 2176562505
AB  - In this article I present results of the research “Brazilian sociology and diasporic stu­dies”, in which I analyze some approaches of Brazilian sociology in the theme of ethnic-racial relations and their points of convergence with the transnational debate on the African diaspora and postcolonial criticism. The central objective of this article is to understand the proximity between Brazilian social thought and postcolonial criticism through the selection of some Brazilian texts and to what extent this relationship allows us to revisit what has become known as “Sociology of race relations” in the Brazil. The article is structured through two general aspects, namely: a. the different understandings by some authors of Brazilian sociology on modernity and the national ethos, and how postcolonial criticism stresses the general bases of understanding of the Brazilian society; b. the revision of the classical notions of resistance and politics, through the aesthetics and cultural expressions of the diaspora. From our point of view, these aspects help us to understand the historical processes that racialized the black experience in Brazil, and point out some analytical limits on the part of Brazilian sociological interpretation of our social formation.

T1  - The Diversity Challenge for High and Low Authoritarians: Multilevel and Longitudinal Effects Through Intergroup Contact and Threat
AN  - 2067649056
AB  - The current studies integrate different frameworks on the positive and negative consequences of ethnic diversity for intergroup relations. Using a nationally stratified sample of Dutch majority members (N = 680) from 50 cities in the Netherlands, Study 1 demonstrated that objective diversity was indirectly related to prejudice and to generalized, ingroup, and outgroup trust, through more positive and more negative contact. These indirect effects tended to be stronger for high versus low authoritarians. Furthermore, perceived diversity was indirectly related to less trust and greater prejudice, via more negative contact and threat. Again, these associations were more pronounced among high authoritarians. Study 2, using a representative sample of German majority members (N = 412) nested within 237 districts, replicated the cross-sectional results regarding objective diversity and prejudice. In addition, longitudinal analyses indicated that objective diversity predicted more positive and more negative contact 2 years later, though only among moderate and high authoritarians.

T1  - Minorities and mistrust
AN  - 2036680038
AB  - An enduring debate in the conflict management literature concerns the wisdom of recognizing versus avoiding reference to ethnic identities in institutions to manage ethnic conflict. Understanding why ethnic recognition occurs is crucial for informing this debate. We develop a theory based on functional and political mobilization effects of recognizing ethnic groups. Contrary to reasoning that minority leaders would be most interested in recognition, the theory suggests that recognition consistently favors the interests of leaders from larger, plurality groups, whereas minority leaders face a ‘dilemma of recognition’ between functional gains and mobilization threats. We use mixed methods to test our theory. For our quantitative analysis, we draw on an original coding of recognition in constitutions and comprehensive political settlements from 1990 to 2012. We find that for cases with leaders from plurality groups, recognition is adopted 60% of the time. With leaders from minority groups, the rate is about 40 percentage points lower, even after accounting for many background factors. Additional quantitative tests and a qualitative analysis present more detailed evidence to show that the processes correspond to the logic of our theory. Answering these questions about when and why recognition is adopted is a crucial step in evaluating its effects on conflict.

T1  - The experience of discrimination among newly arrived Poles in Ireland and the Netherlands
AN  - 2017950339
AB  - This paper examines discrimination and early integration among Polish migrants in Ireland and the Netherlands using a new immigrants' panel survey. Drawing on insights from research on intergroup relations, stereotyping, ethnic competition and Bail's notion of the salience of racial and cultural boundaries, the paper develops hypotheses about the role of experience in and exposure to the host country, of gender and of country context in migrants' experience of discrimination. The key finding is higher discrimination among Poles in the Netherlands and a greater increase in discrimination over time, suggesting that perceptions of ethnic competition, negative public debate and ensuing stereotypes about East European migrants are contributing to a more negative experience for Polish migrants in the Netherlands as compared to Ireland.

T1  - From Marginal to Mainstream and Vice Versa: Leaders’ Valuation of Diversity While in the Minority versus Majority
AN  - 2017679383
AB  - This study examined tolerance and appreciation for differences within a group among leaders of numerically distinct factions (majority vs. minority), whose size remained stable or changed over time (majority ↔ minority). Appreciation or valuing differences in and of themselves was significantly higher among minority than majority leaders when their positions remained stable but not when their positions changed. Appreciation for differences decreased significantly when minority leaders became majority leaders. Tolerance or willingness to put up with differences even when evaluating them negatively increased significantly among both minority and majority leaders once their positions changed. Although this increased tolerance may be temporarily beneficial, in the long run, it could be detrimental to the group as it leads to a cessation of interactions between a minority and a majority. Findings could inform policies to advance functioning of the groups whose minority and majority factions may reverse positions by design (e.g., political parties winning or losing elections) or via demographic changes (e.g., ethnic or racial minorities becoming majorities and vice versa).

T1  - Afro-Latinos and the Black-Hispanic Identity: Evaluating the Potential for Intra-Group Conflict and Cohesion
AN  - 2502287234
AB  - With ethnic and racial minorities projected to comprise a majority of the U.S. population by 2042, current trends in political science scholarship have begun to assess the ways in which intra-group diversity can create opportunities for cooperation, but also contribute to conflict within the context of domestic politics and policy preferences. Research on the diversity of the Latino population in the United States has been predominate. Thus, it is widely regarded that the Latin American identity is not monolithic, and as a consequence, neither is Latino political behavior, as evidenced by the divergent political trajectories of Mexican Americans and Cuban Americans in U.S. politics (Desipio 1996; Claassen 2004; Newton 2000; de la Garza and Yetim 2003). Yet, despite the existing research, which highlights the diversity of the Latino ethnic identity, contemporary societal norms have led to the erroneous conflation of race and ethnicity, resulting in the explicit racialization of the Hispanic-Latino ethnic identity. As a result, Afro-Latinos are either forced to choose between their two member groups or identify themselves according to ambiguous alternatives, which, has resulted in Afro-Latino invisibility, and the subsequent underreporting of this group in national statistics.1 It is this orientation that provides the framework for this study, which indicates that in comparison to other Latin origin groups, Afro-Latinos face unique challenges with respect to the formation of their personal and social identity given the demarcations of race and ethnicity in the United States. The findings of this research explore the political implications of this dynamic.

T1  - Negotiating Identity, Ethnicity, and Place in Sumatra. Through Orang Rimba Origin Stories, Myths, and Legends
AN  - 2071301162
AB  - This article examines how the Orang Rimba along the Makekal River negotiate their social identity, ethnic boundaries, and place in Jambi through an analysis of their origin stories, myths, and legends. While the Makekal Orang Rimba believe they have shared ancestry with the Malay, they are extremely adamant towards preserving their customs, beliefs, and religion (adat), and their traditional way of life in the forests. One theme in their origin stories is a strong desire to maintain cultural and political autonomy by maintaining separation with the village Malay and the outside world. However, like other Austronesian peoples these stories also represent a negotiation to emplace themselves in the region through the manipulation of common origins, ancestor figures, law, and notions of precedence.

T1  - Social Relationships and the Prevention of Anti-Christian Violence in Egypt
AN  - 2037355029
AB  - Institutionalist accounts of sectarian and ethnic conflict tend to emphasize national divisions. For the "master cleavages" of identity politics to shape behavior, however, they must be reproduced at the local level. Otherwise, citizens will not experience private disagreements in terms of officially promoted differences. This finding comes from extensive fieldwork on collective assaults upon Christians in Qena, Egypt. The Egyptian state favors Muslim citizens over Christian citizens, but in Qena local practices eclipsed this national hierarchy. The likelihood of attacks on Christians depended not on how the state categorized Egyptian governors (Muslim or Christian), but whether the governors reproduced Muslim primacy in their social relationships.

T1  - Falling through the Coverage Cracks: How Documentation Status Minimizes Immigrants' Access to Health Care
AN  - 1985526961
AB  - Recent policy debates have centered on health reform and who should benefit from such policy. Most immigrants are excluded from the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) due to federal restrictions on public benefits for certain immigrants. But, some subnational jurisdictions have extended coverage options to federally ineligible immigrants. Yet, less is known about the effectiveness of such inclusive reforms for providing coverage and care to immigrants in those jurisdictions. This article examines the relationship between coverage and health care access for immigrants under comprehensive health reform in the Boston metropolitan area. The article uses data from interviews conducted with a total of 153 immigrants, health care professionals, and immigrant and health advocacy organization employees under the Massachusetts and ACA health reforms. Findings indicate that respondents across the various stakeholder groups perceive that immigrants' documentation status minimizes their ability to access health care even when they have health coverage. Specifically, respondents expressed that intersecting public policies, concerns that using health services would jeopardize future legalization proceedings, and immigrants' increased likelihood of deportation en route to medical appointments negatively influenced immigrants' health care access. Thus, restrictive federal policies and national-level anti-immigrant sentiment can undermine inclusive subnational policies in socially progressive places.

T1  - Factional conflict in groups: How majorities and minorities relate to one another: GPIR
AN  - 1932685702
AB  - Disagreement between numerically larger (majority) and smaller (minority) factions in groups is both common and consequential. For these reasons, there is a long tradition of social psychological interest in the causes and consequences of such disagreement. Early work focused on minority members' movement toward the majority (majority influence) and majority members' (negative) perceptions and evaluations of those who refused to move. Later work focused on similarities and differences between majority influence and its mirror opposite, minority influence, and on majority members' (sometimes relatively positive) perceptions and evaluations of minority members. This paper summarizes current knowledge on these topics and suggests promising avenues for future research.

TT  - AS RECONFIGURAÇÖES ETNO-TERRITORIAIS DOS CONFLITOS SOČIAIS: DA DIFERENCIAÇÂO CULTURAL A FRAGMENTAÇÂO POLÍTICA (AMAZÔNIA BRASILEIRA)
AN  - 1940441747
AB  - Despite the constitutional inscription of the territorial rights of indigenous and quilombola peoples, a new kind of conflict has emerged between differently classified populations. This article documents this conflict through the study of a disagreement between 'quilombola' and 'indigenous' populations in central Amazonia. The solutions of various actors reveal doubts concerning the real 'ethnic contrast' between the protagonists. The current organisation in ethnic territories is seen as the most recent instance of a series of socioterritorial reorganisations already adopted by the populations in interaction with diverse bodies. The article reconstructs the shifting alliances between opposed factions, highlighting the modalities involved in their formation. When the rights granted by the State to groups of populations due to their exceptionality come under threat, as at present, it is essential to recognise that the fluidity between legal categories reflects their shared struggle for survival.Alternate abstract:Apesar da inscriçâo constitucional dos direitos territorials de povos indígenas e quilombolas, surgiu entre populaçöes classificadas de modo diferente um novo tipo de conflito que o artigo documenta a partir do estudo de desacordo entre "quilombolas" e "indígenas" na Amazônia central. As soluçöes dos variados atores desvelam dúvidas acerca do efetivo "contraste étnico" entre os protagonistas. O alinhamento da atual organizaçâo em territorios étnicos é compreendido como uma última atualizaçâo de reordenamentos socioterritoriais já adotados pelas populaçöes na interaçâo com diversas instancias. O artigo busca restituir o jogo de alianças entre facçöes opostas realçando as modalidades de sua formaçâo. Quando os direitos concedidos pelo Estado a grupos de populaçöes em virtude de sua excepcionalidade estâo ameaçados de retrocesso, é imperativo reafirmar que a fluidez entre as categorias legais remete a luta compartilhada para sua sobrevivencia.

T1  - Firewall? or Wall on Fire? A Unified Framework of Conflict Contagion and the Role of Ethnic Exclusion
AN  - 1910260575
AB  - While some borders are real firewalls against conflicts, others appear like tinder just waiting for the smallest spark. Only recently has research focused on the transnational perspective of conflict and current research has focused mostly on isolated aspects of this phenomenon. In this article, we provide a unified framework for conflict contagion that takes into account receiver, sender, dyad, and network effects. This is a novel perspective on conflict contagion, and our empirical results suggest that distinguishing between sender and receiver effects allows for a better understanding of spillover effects. We provide insights that especially excluded ethnic groups impact the risk of countries sending and receiving conflicts from its neighbors.

T1  - What Turns Migrants into Ethnic Minorities at Work? Factors Erecting Ethnic Boundaries among Dutch Police Officers
AN  - 1898549692
AB  - Transnational migration flows have revitalised the interest in ethnicity in social sciences. The ethnic boundary approach (Barth, Wimmer) argues for a non-essentialist understanding of ethnicity and calls for detecting the factors that turn migrants into ethnic minorities. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among Dutch police officers between 2008 and 2013, this article presents three factors that together constitute a structural framework that produces events of ethnic boundary construction (salient ethnic identity plus ethnic closure) between migrant and non-migrant officers: (1) ethnicised precarity; (2) ethnic conflicts triggered by the ethnicising discourse in Dutch media and politics on migrants and migration; and (3) the quasi-therapeutic management style applied in the police organisation. It further calls for a differentiated understanding of migrants' precarity, questions explanations of ethnic closure in terms of stereotypes and critically scrutinises socio-psychological approaches of ethnicity and diversity management.

T1  - Agency of ethnic minority employees: Struggles around identity, career and social change: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Organization, Theory and Society
AN  - 1891833452
AB  - Going beyond recent studies emphasizing the 'successful' nature of ethnic minorities' agency, this qualitative study offers an in-depth analysis of the tensions and contradictions inherent to ethnic minority employees' agency. To conceptualize agency, we draw on the resistance literature and adopt the notion of struggle, which stresses the dynamic and often contradictory interplay between power and resistance in everyday experiences and actions. Based on 26 in-depth interviews with ethnic minority professionals, our study highlights three main agentic strategies individuals use in relation to discourses of ethnicity: rejecting, redefining and adopting discursively available subject positions. Yet, these strategies are characterized by inherent tensions and contradictions, as all three involve both resistance and compliance, simultaneously challenging and reproducing discourses of ethnicity and relations of power. Our study further suggests that the tensions and contradictions inherent to ethnic minority employees' agency can be linked to individuals' involvement in struggles on three interconnected plateaux: the plateaux of identity, career and social change. Tensions arise as struggles on these plateaux come into conflict, forcing individuals to make important trade-offs. Finally, our study contributes to the resistance literature, reinterpreting the current debate on the prevalence of 'banal' forms of resistance as linked to its tendency to study (ethnic) majority individuals who have the privilege of focusing their agentic strategies on the plateau of identity.

T1  - The Centrality of Race to Inequality Across the World-System
AN  - 1956454457
AB  - While the gap between rich and poor nations-as well as between the rich and the poor-is widening everywhere, global wealth is concentrating in fewer hands, and these few include those of subaltern elites. In this reconfigured global landscape, the rich cannot be identified exclusively with metropolitan nations; nor can the poor be identified exclusively with the Third and Second Worlds. The closer worldwide interconnection of ruling sectors and the marginalization of subordinate majorities has undermined the cohesiveness of these geopolitical units. The social tensions resulting from these processes often lead to a racialization of social conflict and the rise of ethnicities. In order to draw attention to the role of nonwestern semiperipheries in causing and exacerbating ethnic/racial inequality, Dunaway and Clelland observe that greater wealth accumulation has not been accompanied by an end to ethnic/racial oppression in the core, nor has ascent to semiperipheral status led to less ethnic/racial exploitation in nonwestern societies.

AN  - 2002253720
AB  - The period since the independence of the Republic of Macedonia in 1991 has shown the political importance of language, as well as the political tensions that can arise over language-related issues. For a long time, multilingualism in Macedonia was a problem that threatened the unity and stability of the country. In 2001 the armed conflict in Macedonia showed that governmental policies of ignoring certain issues fueled ethnic divisions and facilitated a climate of insecurity. In order to terminate the armed conflict, Macedonia has since introduced constitutional changes relevant to linguistic diversity. The constitutional amendment regulating the official use of languages in Macedonia was as a result of a necessary compromise to terminate the armed conflict. The amendment is formulated in a vague and contradictory manner; full of loopholes, views provided on official languages leads to different interpretations and is still subject to disputes between experts, as well as party leaders in Macedonia. This vagueness led to politicians using the topic of the official use of languages as a talking point in every electoral campaign since 2001. This article will examine the challenges and possibilities that came from the constitutional amendment on the use of languages in Macedonia. It will also analyze the loopholes of the legal norms on the use of languages, and the problems of its implementation.

T1  - "It's not Pans, It's People": Student and Teacher Perspectives on Bisexuality and Pansexuality
AN  - 1877827860
AB  - This article explores how Canadian youth who participate in Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality. Participants' perspectives on, definitions of, and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities. For GSA members, bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy. Despite these distinctions, both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility, mis/understandings, and prejudice in school. Findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity was more nuanced than their GSA advisors due to personal online research. GSA participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers, and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities. Although GSA involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities, this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs.

T1  - Focus on the Fundamentals: Reflections on the State of Ethnic Conflict Studies
AN  - 1843974574
AB  - Our failure to come to consensus on the causes of ethnic conflict stems in part from disagreement on the field's most basic concept, ethnicity. Yet surprisingly little research directly addresses the fundamental question of what ethnicity is, including whether it inherently involves conflictual behavior. New research is increasingly redressing this problem, but its grounding in social psychology often remains weak. Social scientists are urged to consider a sharper focus on the fundamentals, in particular using systematically contextualized experimental methods that blend the best of psychology with the best of sociology, history, anthropology, and political science.

T1  - Ethnic Conflict: Questions and Answers
AN  - 1843973903
AB  - This article implements systemism to identify what is known so far about ethnic conflict, along with the most and least useful developments. Systemism is an approach that relies on diagrams to convey causal mechanisms in a more complete and logically consistent way. On the positive side, it is possible to point out greater awareness of the nexus of international and domestic conflict. Overreaction against primordialism and in favour of constructivism stands out on the negative side. Assessment of the field guided by systemism argues in favour of a research agenda focusing on causal mechanisms involving ethnic diversity, local armed conflict, and diffusion of ethnic conflict, with investigation based on mixed methods.

T1  - A Jewish Riot against Muslims: The Polemics of History in Late Colonial Algeria
AN  - 1803878040
AB  - On Rosh Hashanah, 1961, six months before the conclusion of the Evian accords promised independence for Algeria, riots broke out in the city of Oran. Surprisingly to many, the aggressors were overwhelmingly Jews, while those injured or killed were largely Muslims. The events--widely covered in the media but since forgotten--were a product of Oran's particular social chemistry, but were also shaped by far wider set of debates about a chasm that was growing between Jews and Arabs in France, Algeria, and the wider Arab world. This article focuses on responses to these riots, especially how they drew on polemical renderings of a shared Muslim-Jewish history. I make two interrelated arguments based on printed matter of the period, French government archives, and memoirs. First, Algerian Jewish observers and pro-FLN nationalist writers, groups that only rarely agreed on the question of Algerian independence, both recalled that the two groups' shared a largely harmonious history. They vehemently disagreed, however, on what this shared, harmonious history meant in terms of political obligations. The article's second argument is that the Israel-Palestine conflict helped sour relations between Jews and Muslims in Algeria, as well as historical renderings of these relations, during the Algerian War of Independence. Specifically, the question of Palestine frequently appeared as a reference when interpreting the riots. Together, the two arguments demonstrate how international issues helped occlude the particular, local stories and belongingness of Algerians, while they defined the future, religio-ethnic contours of the Algerian nation.

T1  - Right-of-way gentrification: Conflict, commodification and cosmopolitanism
AN  - 1796286802
AB  - As gentrification processes accelerate in American cities, how do newcomers become solidly in-place while longtime residents become hopelessly out-of-place in neighbourhood public spaces? Bringing focus to the often-overlooked public right-of-way -- streets, sidewalks and alleys -- I examine social rhythms comprising this network of public spaces when used as an everyday infrastructure of transportation and socialisation or when configured for special events. Using the notion of symbolic economy to link the social production of public space with the municipal regulation of public space, this essay approaches gentrification from three perspectives: conflict, commodification and cosmopolitanism. Focusing on Highland, a rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood in Denver, Colorado, I first delve into skirmishes over street legitimacy. I then unpack quiet workaday measures used by cities to regulate the public right-of-way, namely parking policy and liquor license issuances. I move on to the commodification of ethnic culture by those who ultimately benefit from the displacement of Latino families from North Denver. Lastly, I engage with the concept cosmopolitanism, arguing that diversity discourses, both in the academy and on the street, obscure important relationships between asymmetrically positioned symbolic economies and low-level regulation of public space. Foregrounding routine urban governance over neoliberal agendas, this study critiques gentrification as a commonsense urban policy. [web URL: http://usj.sagepub.com/content/53/9/1803.abstract]

T1  - Conflict Appraisals in a Multiethnic Sample of Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 1794490951
AB  - Childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health issue, affecting millions of children each year. IPV-exposed children are at risk for developing behavioral and emotional problems. The Cognitive-Contextual Framework posits that children's post-conflict appraisals of threat and self-blame mediate these negative outcomes. However, conflict appraisals have primarily been studied in White, school-aged children. This study includes a large, multi-ethnic sample of children ages 5-12 (N = 158) who were interviewed regarding their experiences with family violence. The sample included White, Black, Latino/a, and biracial children. Self-blame was equivalent across groups. However, groups differed in threat appraisals, and Latino/a mothers and children reported discrepancies in the level of IPV-exposure. Directions for research and clinical implications are discussed.

T1  - The Marxist Aspect in Bessie Head's A Question of Power
AN  - 2188111522
AB  - South Africa is one country where racial discrimination was widespread. Like the rest of the color-skinned people, colored writers in South Africa are marginalized and denied the right to express their experiences of living in a society riddled with racial inequality and oppression. Marxism is a school of thought that is concerned about the conflict between the dominant powerful classes and the oppressed ones in any given society. According to Marxism, literary texts are viewed as material that can be interpreted within historical contexts. South Africa is a country where the Apartheid System has been dominant. It is a country that has people of different ethnicity: the White, the Black and the Colored who are known as people of mixed race or hybrid. In South Africa colored people are doubly oppressed by their community, as they belong neither to the Black nor to the White. The colored people are marginalized and demeaned to a very degraded status by their society. Bessie Head is a South African female writer who is concerned about the clash between the different classes in her society. In this study the researcher wants to explore the class-struggle of women in general and the hybrid females in particular under the Apartheid System from a Marxist point of view. As a South-African female writer, Head is concerned about the struggle for power between the White and The Black, on the one hand, and between the hybrids on the other. A Question of Power can be seen as an indictment of the governing system in South Africa. It is a system that governs people not as ordinary human beings but according to the color of their skin. It is an autobiographical novel that tells the story of Elizabeth as a women living under the Apartheid System. Elizabeth, the fictional character of Bessie Head, has to suffer greatly as a woman but her suffering as a hybrid is even greater. On the one hand, she is socially marginalized as a female living in a patriarchal society. On the other hand, she is also culturally colonized as an individual living in a society where racial discrimination is prevailing. On account of what is mentioned so far Elizabeth is suffering from an identity crisis.

T1  - Self-expansion motivation improves cross-group interactions and enhances self-growth: GPIR
AN  - 1752001233
AB  - Rather than seeing outgroup members as targets of fear, conflict, or even tolerance, the self-expansion model proposes that outgroup members might be seen as attractive opportunities for self-growth. The current study utilizes an experimental manipulation to raise (or lower) self-expansion motivation prior to a positive interaction with a stranger from a different ethnic group. The results show that priming high self-expansion motivation leads to higher quality interactions, greater interpersonal closeness, greater feelings of self-growth, and higher feelings of self-efficacy. In addition, these outcomes show patterns of mediation consistent with the predictions of self-expansion theory. These findings point to a potentially valuable tool for improving the quality of cross-group contact experiences. More broadly, they focus attention on the genuinely positive functions that relationships with outgroup members can have for the self. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/60.abstract]

T1  - The downside of tobacco control? Smoking and self-stigma: A systematic review
AN  - 1730771110
AB  - Little is known about the consequences of tobacco smoking stigma on smokers and how smokers may internalize smoking-related stigma. This review summarizes existing literature on tobacco smoking self-stigma, investigating to what extent smokers are aware of negative stereotypes, agree with them and apply them to themselves. We carried out a systematic search of Pubmed/Web of Science/PsycInfo databases for articles related to smoking self-stigma through June 2013. Reference lists and citations of included studies were also checked and experts were contacted. After screening articles for inclusion/exclusion criteria we performed a quality assessment and summarized findings according to the stages of self-stigma as conceptualized in Corrigan's progressive model of self-stigma (aware, agree, apply and harm). Initial searches yielded 570 articles. Thirty of these articles (18 qualitative and 12 quantitative studies) met criteria for our review. Awareness of smoking stigma was virtually universal across studies. Coping strategies for smoking stigma and the degree to which individuals who smoke internalized this stigma varied both within and across studies. There was considerable variation in positive, negative, and non-significant consequences associated with smoking self-stigma. Limited evidence was found for subgroup differences in smoking-related stigma. While there is some evidence that smoking self-stigma leads to reductions in smoking, this review also identified significant negative consequences of smoking self-stigma. Future research should assess the factors related to differences in how individuals respond to smoking stigma. Public health strategies which limit the stigmatization of smokers may be warranted.

TT  - Internalization of Intolerance as a Risk to Regional Development
AN  - 2134268250
AB  - Анализируются результаты исследования ситуации в сфере межнациональных отношений в одном из самых крупных регионов России - Красноярском крае. Показаны процессы, связанные с формами социального общения в многонациональном государстве. Представлены позиции лиц, интолерантных к проживанию в таком образовании. Описан социальный портрет «сторонников» и «противников» многонационального государства. Обсуждаются характер отношений с этническими группами трудовых мигрантов, политика государства в этой сфере. Дана характеристика взаимодействия субъектов в «ближнем» и «дальнем» кругах, основой которых является этническая принадлежность. Доказано наличие связанных с межнациональными отношениями барьеров в сфере семейных отношений. Описаны основные элементы возможного межэтнического конфликта: позиции участников, образ «врага», субъект его развития. На основе картографирования территории региона показана локализация очагов напряжения в межнациональных отношениях. Результаты исследования позволяют убедительно говорить о наличии четырех ареалов такого напряжения. Два из них находятся на границах с двумя другими субъектами Федерации, что чревато разрастанием возможного конфликта и превращением его в конфликт межрегионального уровня. Реальность такого риска подтверждается интенсивностью организационных действий определенного типа в сетях Интернета.Alternate abstract:The article presents the findings of the research on interethnic relations in one of the largest regions of Russia. The paper shows the processes associated with the forms of socialization in a multinational state. It also presents the stance of those individuals who are intolerant to living in such a formation, as well as a social portrait of supporters and opponents of a multinational state. We consider the nature of relations with labor migrants' ethnic groups and state policy measures in this field. We determine the characteristics of interactions within the inner and outer circles, which are based on ethnicity. The article proves the presence of barriers to family relationships related to interethnic ones. The main elements of a potential ethnic conflict are described as follows: positions of participants, an image of an «enemy», and a subject of its development. Based on mapping of the region, we show the locations of tension in interethnic relations. The study results clearly define four centers of such tension. Two of them are on the borders with other two Russian federal subjects. It is fraught with a potential contention, its growth and transformation into an interregional conflict. The feasibility of this risk is confirmed by the intensity of particular organizational activities in social media.

T1  - A Systematic Review of Patients’ Experiences in Communicating with Primary Care Physicians: Intercultural Encounters and a Balance between Vulnerability and Integrity
AN  - 2032099781
AB  - Communication difficulties persist between patients and physicians. In order to improve care, patients’ experiences of this communication must be understood. The main objective of this study is to synthesize qualitative studies exploring patients’ experiences in communicating with a primary care physician. A secondary objective is to explore specific factors pertaining to ethnic minority or majority patients and their influence on patients’ experiences of communication. Pertinent health and social sciences electronic databases were searched systematically (PubMed, Cinahl, PsychNet, and IBSS). Fifty-seven articles were included in the review on the basis of being qualitative studies targeting patients’ experiences of communication with a primary care physician. The meta-ethnography method for qualitative studies was used to interpret data and the COREQ checklist was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Three concepts emerged from analyses: negative experiences, positive experiences, and outcomes of communication. Negative experiences related to being treated with disrespect, experiencing pressure due to time constraints, and feeling helpless due to the dominance of biomedical culture in the medical encounter. Positive experiences are attributed to certain relational skills, technical skills, as well as certain approaches to care privileged by the physician. Outcomes of communication depend on patients’ evaluation of the consultation. Four categories of specific factors exerted mainly a negative influence on consultations for ethnic minorities: language barriers, discrimination, differing values, and acculturation. Ethnic majorities also raised specific factors influencing their experience: differing values and discrimination. Findings of this review are limited by the fact that more than half of the studies did not explore cultural aspects relating to this experience. Future research should address these aspects in more detail. In conclusion, all patients seemed to face additional cultural challenges. Findings provide a foundation for the development of tailored interventions to patients’ preferences, thus ensuring more satisfactory experiences. Health care providers should be sensitive to specific factors (cultural and micro-cultural) during all medical encounters.

T1  - Nationalism in a Russian Multicultural Region*
AN  - 1705245604
AB  - Objective 
This article describes the functional mechanisms and evolution of ethnic nationalism in the Tyumen provincial Russian region at the turn of 21st century. The study focuses on analysis of changes in social policies and characteristics of ethno-political movements that claim to represent the Russian and Tatar ethnic groups. 
Methods 
Analytical instruments applied in this research are the concepts of constructivism and Bourdieu's genetic structuralism. The empirical base for this research includes political documents from regional public authorities, public organizations and public figures of the region, press materials, interviews with ethnic leaders, focus groups with representatives of youth organizations, observations made at public events, and photographic materials of graffiti in the cities of the Tyumen Region. 
Results and Conclusions 
We suggest that the main elements of these movements are, on the one hand, associations included in official public institutions that legitimize policy of public authorities and, on the other hand, a few associations seeking to meet the hierarchic social interests of the regional population from the standpoint of an ethnic division of society.

AN  - 1900185960
AB  - How do groups mobilise around non-ethnic issues in deeply divided societies and cities? This article seeks to answer this question by offering a close reading of one particular exemplary episode in the recent history of post-conflict Bosnia & Herzegovina: the 2008 Sarajevo protests. Sarajevans took to the streets to demand more security in the wake of the murder of a young boy on a tram. The article analyses the framings used by the mobilising social movements in depth, exploring in detail the connections with the local cultural environment, as well as the demobilising authorities' counter-frames.

T1  - Ethnic Boundaries in Core Discussion Networks: A Multilevel Social Network Study of Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands
AN  - 2076975574
AB  - This study examines ethnic segregation of core discussion networks in the Netherlands. The analysis is based on Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, a large-scale survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 that contains an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco, the two largest non-western immigrant groups in Holland. Results show that among Turks and Moroccans, more than 75% of the confidants are co-ethnic multilevel logistic models of these ego networks which suggest that ethnic closure in core discussion networks of Turks and Moroccans is stronger among women, foreign-born immigrants, those who live in immigrant concentration areas and those who are culturally more dissimilar to the Dutch to (i.e., who speak Dutch less well, who more strongly participate in Muslim practices and who identify stronger with their ethnic group). Results further suggest that the socio-economic gradient in ethnic boundaries is due to both cultural and economic homophily.

T1  - Misnaming Social Conflict: 'Identity', Land and Family Histories in a Quilombola Community in the Brazilian Amazon
AN  - 1546203723
AB  - Abstract              This article addresses an internal conflict that arose in an Amazonian village when it adopted an officially recognised quilombola identity. It argues that this issue, which tends to be interpreted in terms of identity, is in fact primarily social. Indeed, the divergent positions adopted by different groups of relatives need to be examined in relation to the dynamics of socio-economic differentiation linked to family histories. The article shows that the conflict related back to power struggles between dominant groups of relatives and that the questions about the limits of the group reflected preoccupations concerning who held legitimate authority to make decisions about the future of the village. By analysing some of the assumptions of the current debate about multiculturalism and ethnicity in Amazonia, this article contributes to the wider discussion about these issues in Brazil and, more broadly, in Latin America.

T1  - Phantom Scandal: On the National Uses of the 'Thailand Controversy'
AN  - 1629332423; 201441190
AB  - The episode known as the 'Thailand Controversy' centred on claims that, during the Vietnam War, American anthropologists in Thailand had been collaborating with U.S. and Thai military interests and in ways that harmed social life and efforts towards equality and justice in that country. Reflection and comparison suggest that the allegations of impropriety allowed for emotional identification and understanding in terms of outrage, and that this dynamic is common in the context of anxieties over the transgression of ethnic boundaries. The case is compared with an episode of fears of witchcraft involving the Mien of northern Laos, when an ethnic militia took charge of spiritually and militarily guarding the ethnic boundary. Examination of how the anthropological crisis involving Thailand played out suggests various national differences in the academic discipline, in the United States, Australia, Austria and Thailand. The facts of the case are strongly connected to emotional identification, to a divide in the United States between theoretical and applied anthropology, and to responses to decades of political suppression in the United States.

T1  - Minorities and marginality: pertinacity of Hindus and Sikhs in a repressive environment in Afghanistan
AN  - 2698629217
AB  - The situation of Hindus and Sikhs as a persecuted minority is a little-studied topic in literature dealing with ethno-sectarian conflict in Afghanistan. Hindu and Sikh communities’ history and role in Afghanistan's development are examined through a structural, political, socioeconomic, and perceptual analysis of the minority populations since the country gained its independence in 1919. It traces a timeline of their evolving status after the breakdown of state structure and the ensuing civil conflicts and targeted persecution in the 1990s that led to their mass exodus out of the country. A combination of structural failure and rising Islamic fundamentalist ideology in the post-Soviet era led to a war of ethnic cleansing as fundamentalists suffered a crisis of legitimation and resorted to violence as a means to establish their authority. Hindus and Sikhs found themselves in an uphill battle to preserve their culture and religious traditions in a hostile political environment in the post-Taliban period. The international community and Kabul failed in their moral obligation to protect and defend the rights of minorities and oppressed communities.

T1  - Does Immigration Undermine Public Support for Social Policy?
AN  - 1496649255
AB  - There has been great interest in the relationship between immigration and the welfare state in recent years, and particularly since Alesina and Glaeser's (2004) influential work. Following literatures on solidarity and fractionalization, race in the U.S. welfare state, and anti-immigrant sentiments, many contend that immigration undermines public support for social policy. This study analyzes three measures of immigration and six welfare attitudes using 1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data for 17 affluent democracies. Based on multi-level and two-way fixed-effects models, our results mostly fail to support the generic hypothesis that immigration undermines public support for social policy. The percent foreign born, net migration, and the 10-year change in the percent foreign born all fail to have robust significant negative effects on welfare attitudes. There is evidence that the percent foreign born significantly undermines the welfare attitude that government "should provide a job for everyone who wants one." However, there is more robust evidence that net migration and change in percent foreign born have positive effects on welfare attitudes. We conclude that the compensation and chauvinism hypotheses provide greater potential for future research, and we critically consider other ways immigration could undermine the welfare state. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that factors other than immigration are far more important for public support of social policy. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'Not men enough to rule!': politicization of ethnicities and forcible circumcision of Luo men during the postelection violence in Kenya
AN  - 1542000264; 201427971
AB  - As a contribution to ongoing research addressing sexual violence in war and conflict situations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Rwanda, this paper argues that the way sexual violence intersects with other markers of identity, including ethnicity and class, is not clearly articulated. Male circumcision has been popularized, as a public health strategy for prevention of HIV transmission, although evidence of its efficacy is disputable and insufficient attention has been given to the social and cultural implications of male circumcision. This paper draws from media reporting and the material supporting the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court case against four Kenyans accused of crimes against humanity, to explore the postelection violence, especially forcible male circumcision. During the postelection violence in Kenya, women were, as in other conflict situations, raped. In addition, men largely from the Luo ethnic group were forcibly circumcised. Male circumcision among the Gikuyu people is a rite of passage, but when forced upon the Luo men, it was also associated with cases of castration and other forms of genital mutilation. The aim appears to have been to humiliate and terrorize not just the individual men, but their entire communities. The paper examines male circumcision and questions why a ritual that has marked a life-course transition for inculcating ethical analysis of the self and others, became a tool of violence against men from an ethnic group where male circumcision is not a cultural practice. The paper then reviews the persistence and change in the ritual and more specifically, how male circumcision has become, not just a sexual health risk, but, contrary to the emerging health discourse and more significantly, a politicized ethnic tool and a status symbol among the Gikuyu elite. In the view of the way male circumcision was perpetrated in Kenya, we argue it should be considered as sexual violence, with far-reaching consequences for men's physical and mental health.

T1  - "Once You've Blended the Cake, You Can't Take the Parts Back to the Main Ingredients": Black Gay and Bisexual Men's Descriptions and Experiences of Intersectionality
AN  - 1357002415
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Although Black gay and bisexual men have written eloquently about the intersections of race, gender, and sexual identity in anthologies such as Brother to Brother and In the Life, empirical studies of intersectionality with men, and Black gay and bisexual men in particular are rare. This qualitative study examined descriptions and experiences of intersectionality in individual interviews with 12 U.S. Black self-identified gay (n=9) and bisexual (n =3) men in Washington, DC. Participants ranged in age from 21 and 44 (M=36.33) and were predominantly highly educated and middle income. Research questions were: (1) How do participants describe and experience intersections of race, gender, and sexual identity?; (2) How do social processes shape their social identities?; (3) What are their challenges due to intersections of race, gender, and sexual identity?; and (4) What are the perceived benefits of these intersections? Analyses highlighted four key themes: (1) explicit and implicit descriptions of intersectionality; (2) the primacy of identities as Black and/or Black men first; (3) challenges such as negative stereotypes, racial microaggressions in mainstream and White LGB communities, heterosexism in Black communities, and gender role pressures to act "masculine"; and (4) perceived benefits such as psychological growth, liberation from traditional gender role or heteronormative expectations, and the freedom that being outsiders or "never being comfortable" confers in terms of exploring new opportunities and experiences. These findings imply that intersectionality can be expanded to incorporate the strengths/assets of intersectional identities in addition to oppression based on interlocking social identities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Transnational Activism in Ethnic Diasporas: Insights from Cuban Exiles, American Jews and Irish Americans
AN  - 2076977248
AB  - The actions of ethnic advocacy groups have an indisputable impact on political change in their ancestral homelands. Many observers attribute the United States' continued efforts to isolate Castro's Cuba, its on/off involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and its engagement and disengagement in the conflict in Northern Ireland to the influence of their efforts. Whether their actions take the form of lobbying, remittance-sending or acts of violence, diaspora groups' efforts to create change may determine the success of homeland opposition movements and efforts to resolve internal conflicts. This article surveys the activities of 30 political organisations in American Cuban, Irish and Jewish communities, examining the multiple ways in which these groups attempt to make change in Cuba, Northern Ireland and Israel respectively. In what ways do non-partisan, partisan and radical ethnic organisations attempt to make political change in their homelands? Why do these groups choose particular means for exerting influence-such as lobbying, working with homeland opposition movements or appealing to international organisations? These community dynamics are best understood by looking at each group's ability to find allies within the American and homeland governments, the ideology it espouses and its financial resources.

T1  - Linking Practitioners' Attitudes Towards and Basic Knowledge of Immigrants with Their Social Work Education
AN  - 2207362137
AB  - Based on a survey of 1,124 social workers in the United States, this article examines how practitioners' attitudes towards immigrants and their general knowledge of immigration varied according to the content of their social work education. Although the majority of practitioners reported receiving coursework on practice with immigrants, this showed no effect on their attitudes or knowledge. In contrast, coursework on immigration policy predicted more favorable attitudes towards immigrants. Considering the mounting anti-immigrant sentiment and retrenchment of immigrants' rights in the United States, the results suggest the need to further explore what course work content is needed to prepare social workers for the current needs of the field. We argue that social work education must expand upon existing cultural competence models of practice with immigrants, to better prepare social workers to address the deepening social exclusion of undocumented immigrants in the United States.

T1  - Socially Mobile Mexican Americans and the Minority Culture of Mobility: PROD
AN  - 1008897054
AB  - Based on 50 in-depth interviews and extensive fieldwork, this article contributes to the literature on inequality and middle-class minorities by examining socially mobile Mexican Americans -- those who were raised in low-income households, but who are now middle class. Mexican Americans who achieve extreme rates of intergenerational mobility straddle class and ethnic contexts, a position that is accompanied by a set of challenges that are unique to middle-class minorities. Socially mobile Mexican Americans retain an enduring familiarity with poverty and must manage intra-class relations with poorer coethnics, who often request financial and social support. As they enter white professional milieus, they must also manage interethnic relations with whites who do not view them as bona fide members of the white middle class. These challenges reinforce class and ethnic boundaries and lead middle-class Mexican Americans who grow up disadvantaged to adopt a minority culture of mobility that manifests through group-specific mobility strategies embedded in ethnic communities, such as creating and joining ethnic professional organizations.

T1  - The Tribalism Index: Unlocking the Relationship Between Tribal Patriarchy and Islamist Militants
AN  - 1322722911; 201311497
AB  - Tribal dynamics have been strikingly prominent in the success or failure of militant Islamists, from Central Asia to North Africa. However, to date little systematic research has been undertaken on tribal culture and its interactions with militant Islamist groups. Part of the challenge is the absence of a quantitative measure of tribal culture that can gauge the degree of tribalism. A measure of this sort would assist in the exploration of relationships between tribalism and militant Islam, religiously motivated violence, or the export of that violence. In this article, we put forward such a measure, the Tribalism Index. This Tribalism Index is a predictor of religiously motivated violence, and is effective in parsing the varying relationships of Islam, Islamist militancy and tribal patriarchy to that violence. It is also helpful in predicting religiously motivated violence in diaspora communities in Western nations, and has proved effective in doing so in the United Kingdom. Regression models that include both Muslim population percentage and level of tribalism demonstrate that, in the absence of a clear tribal culture, adherence to Islam does not make for susceptibility to extremism. Furthermore, these models show that it is within tribal environments that Islamist movements are best nurtured. The Tribalism Index proves of greater utility than the Failed States Index for eliciting the dynamics of violence in tribal societies, while illuminating the inaccuracy of seeing militancy as a function of Islam as such.

T1  - A meta-analysis of the effects of speakers' accents on interpersonal evaluations
AN  - 1037877277; 201230876
AB  - This paper reports a meta-analysis of the empirical literature on the effects of speakers' accents on interpersonal evaluations. Our review of the published literature uncovered 20 studies that have compared the effects of standard accents (i.e., the accepted accent of the majority population) versus non-standard accents (i.e., accents that are considered foreign or spoken by minorities) on evaluations about the speakers. These 20 studies yielded 116 independent effect sizes on an array of characteristics that were selected by the original researchers. We classified each of the characteristics as belonging to one of three domains that have been traditionally discussed in this area, namely status (e.g., intelligence, social class), solidarity (trustworthiness, in-group-out-group member), and dynamism (level of activity and liveliness). The effect was particularly strong when American Network accented speakers were compared with non-standard-accented speakers. These results underscore prior research showing that speakers' accents have powerful effects on how others perceive them. These and other results are discussed in the context of the literature along with implications for future research in this area. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Perceiving Status (In)stability in a Low-Status Group: The Effects of Identification on Explicit and Implicit Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 1037886682; 201230957
AB  - We examined whether perceptions of status (in)stability moderate the effects of ingroup identification on explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. We expected that identification with Italians (low-status group) would enhance ingroup bias toward (US) Americans (high-status group) more when status was unstable rather than stable. We also predicted that the effects of identification on bias would be driven by ingroup enhancement for explicit attitudes and by both ingroup enhancement and outgroup derogation for implicit attitudes. The results revealed that identification increased explicit ingroup evaluation and ingroup bias independently from status (in)stability. However, identification increased implicit outgroup derogation only with unstable status. The results are discussed with reference to social identity theory and to the importance of considering both explicit and implicit attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contextualizing Petro-Sexual Politics
AN  - 1907225736
AB  - Petro-violence is a feminist issue. Through the examination of U.S. mainstream narratives of gender violence and petroleum violence within Nigeria, the author reveals how gender and sexuality are central to representations of terrorism and ethnic-gang conflict within petroleum politics. Through a framework of petro-sexual politics, which links histories of gender and petroleum violence together, the author considers how petro-violence materializes in multiple forms that have always been gendered and systemically violent. By demonstrating that gender violence is not merely an effect of petro-violence, the author argues it is the necessary condition for such violence to even take place. Understanding petro-politics means recognizing that gender violence is part of a larger political economy of violence that creates the conditions fostering and facilitating petro-politics in the first place.

T1  - Ethnic Group Labels and Intergroup Attitudes in New Zealand: Naming Preferences Predict Distinct Ingroup and Outgroup Biases
AN  - 1030866742; 201230148
AB  - New Zealand society is unique in that New Zealanders of European descent (the majority group) are regularly labeled in institutional and popular discourse using an ethnic group label created by Maori (the indigenous minority group). This label is "Pakeha." Endorsement of this label is by no means consensual, and opposition to its use is often claimed on the grounds that the term is pejorative. We tested the validity of this concern in a national sample (N = 6,507) by assessing differences in the ingroup and outgroup evaluations of Maori and New Zealanders of European descent based on their label preferences. We found no support for the claim that the term "Pakeha" is associated with a negative evaluation of the majority group. Rather, Maori expressed positive attitudes toward New Zealanders of European descent regardless of the label they preferred to describe them. For Maori, use of the term "Pakeha" was instead indicative of ingroup cultural engagement, including the use of Maori language, and had little to do with outgroup attitudes. New Zealanders of European descent who preferred the term "Pakeha," in contrast, expressed more positive attitudes toward Maori than those who preferred the terms "New Zealand European," "New Zealander," or "Kiwi.".

T1  - In the Name of Equality? The Missing Intersection in Canadian Feminists' Legal Mobilization Against Multiculturalism: PROD
AN  - 1928281800
AB  - In Canada, women's rights organizations have successfully mobilized the law to foster gender equality. In doing so, they have been constrained by legal understandings of equality and discrimination, which have shaped their strategies to seek justice. In return, their mobilization, mainly through litigation, has contributed to craft or to alter legal categories (such as "substantive equality," "women," "sexual harassment," etc.), which in turn sustain their identities and their interests. However, claims made in the name of gender equality raise two issues: They tend to overlook the intersection of gender with other grounds of discrimination such as religion or race/ethnicity; and they tend to conflict with multiculturalism, a value enshrined in Canadian law. The recent decision taken by the province of Ontario to ban religious arbitration for family matters offers an illuminating case study of this tension between gender equality and religious rights in the Canadian context. This article analyzes women's rights activists' legal understandings of gender equality and religious/ethnic discrimination to explain how these representations have influenced women's mobilization against religious arbitration in Ontario. Bringing together the insights developed by critical legal studies about intersectionality and the study of legal mobilization, this articles explores through a concrete example the tension between feminism and multiculturalism.

T1  - Reconstructing Citizenship in a Global Economy: How Restricting Immigrants from Welfare Undermines Social Rights for U.S. Citizens
AN  - 743061815; 201045469
AB  - Scrutiny of immigrants' use of public benefits is a reoccurring theme in U.S. politics. Yet while the tough stance on immigrants taps into popular anti-immigrant sentiment, the consequences of such scrutiny are shared by all welfare recipients. Drawing upon interpretive policy frames, I examine how new requirements to verify citizenship and identity for Medicaid directly impacts social entitlements for both citizen and non-citizen populations. Analysis of state reports and policy studies of citizenship verification requirements for Medicaid illustrate that verification costs may exceed the costs of fraudulent misuse by unqualified immigrants. I argue that devolutionary shifts in welfare and immigration policy from federal to state governments further constrains who can benefit from the full range of rights and entitlements associated with citizenship in the United States.
