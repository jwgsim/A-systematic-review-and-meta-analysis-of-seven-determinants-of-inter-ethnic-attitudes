T1  - Empowering or endangering minorities? Facebook, language, and identity in Myanmar
AN  - 2701446047
AB  - Language policies play a major role in ethnic conflict because they affect the right of speakers to choose and use their preferred language(s), and help determine courses of action to maintain, assert or defend such rights. There has been insufficient analysis on the role of social media, particularly Facebook, in strengthening or undermining the survival of minority languages and collective identity in multi-ethnic countries. This paper uses Myanmar as a case study to demonstrate the extent to which Facebook language policies influence language use practices of minorities in Myanmar. While Facebook’s selection of Burmese as a ‘Facebook language’ has privileged the use of Myanmar’s majority language at the expense of its minority languages, it has simultaneously provided opportunities for ethnic minorities to preserve and promote their languages and cultures.

T1  - Daughters of Maghrebian Muslim and native non-Muslim couples in Spain: Identity choices and constraints
AN  - 2698576859
AB  - This article explores the life experiences of the daughters of mixed couples living in Spain. These adolescents and young adults have one Muslim parent of Maghrebi origin and another non-Muslim native Spanish parent. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we examine the identity processes of this female population and the interplay between factors of origin, location, and gender. We find that prejudices around Maghrebi Muslims in Spain have a constraining impact on the identity choices of females in particular. Social perceptions of Islam immediately place these teenagers and young women in a position of being the absolute Other, giving rise to differential treatment and limiting their identity choices and sense of belonging. However, these respondents also demonstrate resilience, empowerment, and agency in confronting socially imposed categories, such as forming counter-narratives and self-categorising in multiple ways – in turn illuminating the socially transformative aspects of ethnic and religious mixedness.

T1  - Online interventions for reducing hate speech and cyberhate: A systematic review
AN  - 2676551114
AB  - BackgroundThe unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme, hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television, radio, youth conferences, and text messaging campaigns, interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged.ObjectivesThis review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate.Search MethodsWe systematically searched 2 database aggregators, 36 individual databases, 6 individual journals, and 34 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature.Inclusion CriteriaWe included randomized and rigorous quasi‐experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10–17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background, religious affiliation, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, or citizenship status.Data Collection and AnalysisThe systematic search covered January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020, with searches conducted between August 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24, 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention, sample, outcomes, and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta‐analysis on two independent effect sizes.Main ResultsTwo studies were included in the meta‐analysis, one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta‐analysis we chose the treatment arm from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study. However, we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects, while the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = −0.134, 95% confidence interval [−0.321, −0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as “low risk” on the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study as “some” risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and “high risk” for selective outcome reporting bias. The Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as “some concern” for the selective outcome reporting bias domain.Authors' ConclusionsThe evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi‐experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions, addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software, and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both extremist and non‐extremist individuals in future intervention studies. We provide suggestions for how future research on online hate speech/cyberhate interventions can fill these gaps moving forward.

T1  - The Same, Yet Different: Understanding the Perceived Acceptability of Redface and Blackface
AN  - 2651992464
AB  - In recent years, several high-profile individuals were sanctioned (e.g., fired) when photos of them dressed in blackface surfaced. Yet, every weekend during sports seasons, fans dress in redface to support teams with Native mascots. Given the observed discrepancy, five studies examined whether and why the perceived acceptability of these two racialized representations differs. Across varying methods and designs, we found that redface was perceived as more acceptable than blackface. The differential acceptability was explained by the extent to which people believe that Native (vs. Black) Peoples: 1) largely do not exist within contemporary social contexts (i.e., social erasure) and 2) experience less racism. The results suggest that eliminating racialized representations requires understanding the role that sociocultural factors play in sustaining discrimination and prejudice.

T1  - One hundred thousand welcomes? Economic threat and anti-immigration sentiment in Ireland<sup>1</sup>
AN  - 2628898573
AB  - Public opinion has moved towards a more restrictive approach to immigration since 2008, particularly in countries more strongly affected by economic recession. This is generally assumed to be a consequence of economic threat due to greater competition for scarce material resources, such as employment, leading to anti-immigration sentiment. However, not all individuals are affected equally by job losses, nor by the presence of migrants. Using data from the European Social Survey (2008–2016), in conjunction with the Labour Force Survey (2007–2016), this paper examines if individuals within occupations and sectors which face economic decline as measured by job losses, and which have a greater representation of migrants, are more likely to express anti-immigration sentiment. In line with the threat hypothesis the study finds that positive job growth is associated with pro-immigration sentiment while a greater share of migrants within occupations and sectors is linked to greater opposition towards immigration.

T1  - The Politics of White Identity and Settlers’ Indigenous Resentment in Canada
AN  - 2641350800
AB  - This article introduces White identity as an understudied concept in Canadian politics and compares how White settlers’ ingroup attachments and their outgroup attitudes—specifically, White settlers’ anti-Indigenous attitudes—shape Canadian politics. We find that White identity is associated with greater support for government spending on policies that disproportionately benefit White Canadians, such as pensions, whereas Indigenous resentment is associated with greater opposition toward government spending on policies that are often perceived as disproportionately benefiting Indigenous peoples, such as welfare. In Canada outside Quebec, both White identity and anti-Indigenous attitudes are associated with voting Conservative. In Quebec, White identity mobilizes support for the Bloc Québécois, while White settlers’ negative attitudes toward Indigenous peoples are not associated with vote choice.

T1  - Connecting Ethnicity and Space: the New Russian-Mediterranean Pop Culture in Israel’s Periphery
AN  - 2628406301
AB  - This ethnographic study explores the co-influences between urban spaces and ethnic hierarchies in the pop-cultural creations of Russian-speaking immigrants of Generation 1.5 in Israel. The theoretical analysis draws on the concepts of orientalism, ethnicity and spatiality in the context of migration. The findings suggest that physical place influences intergroup/ethnic relations that in turn reshape the symbolic meaning of urban spaces. Young immigrant ethnic entrepreneurs have invented the new cultural trope of Mizrahi or Mediterranean Russianness, expressed in various venues of pop culture, in which they are involved as cultural producers: video clips, festivals, music and dance performances. It is a symbolic expression of Hitmazrehut — the Easternization process experienced by them in Israel’s geographic and social periphery.

T1  - General inclusive victimhood predicts willingness to engage in intergroup contact: Findings from Bosnia‐Herzegovina and the Basque Country
AN  - 2625912484
AB  - We investigated the relationship between general inclusive victimhood (i.e., perceived similarity between the ingroups’ and other victim groups’ experiences of collective victimization) and willingness to engage in direct, intimate (e.g., intimate relationships) and distant (e.g., neighbors) contact with the adversary group in the aftermath of collective violence. We tested this link across two post‐conflict contexts: Bosnia‐Herzegovina (N = 147 students) and the Basque Country (N = 351 adults). We found that general inclusive victimhood was linked to greater willingness to engage in distant intergroup contact in two contexts (e.g., having an outgroup member as a neighbor), but only predicted more intimate forms of intergroup contact (e.g., having a former adversary member as a romantic partner) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The link between general inclusive victimhood and both types of contact was sequentially mediated by conflict‐specific inclusive victimhood and trust in Bosnia‐Herzegovina and Basque Country, and via conflict‐specific inclusive victimhood and empathy in the Basque Country. Theoretical and practical implications for reconciliation in the aftermath of ethnic conflict are discussed.

T1  - Identifying the Undeserving Poor: The Effect of Racial, Ethnic, and Anti-Immigrant Sentiment on State Medicaid Eligibility
AN  - 2627320309
AB  - In the United States, race and racism are woven into the very fabric of the welfare state. Racial antipathy has undermined public support for benefits perceived as favoring African Americans and has resulted in significant cuts in programs for the poor. Recently, some studies have found that public discussion on immigration has linked attitudes toward Hispanics and illegal immigrants with preferences toward programs once overwhelmingly influenced by racial attitudes. Building on this literature, the present study assesses the effect of racial and ethnic attitudes on state policy outcomes. Specifically, we examine Medicaid eligibility criteria for four categories of beneficiaries, ranked by level of perceived deservingness. We find that eligibility limits are most generous for children, followed by pregnant women and parents. Benefits for “other adults” (low-income non-parents aged 18–64) are subject to more stringent eligibility criteria or entirely unavailable. In contrast with the limits for other groups, the primary attitudinal predictors of Medicaid eligibility limits for the “other adults” category are antipathy toward Blacks, Hispanics, and illegal immigrants. These results confirm that perceptions of deservingness are a central component of U.S. social policy and demonstrate that material policy outcomes – not just policy preferences – are substantially shaped by attitudes toward Hispanics and immigrants as well as African Americans.

T1  - “Ma sei fuori?”: a path to awareness on mental health and stigma
AN  - 2597246281
AB  - Mental health issues, frequently associated with weirdness and danger, can easily derail the lives of the people who suffer from them, creating loneliness and isolation. Due to stigma, people with mental health disorders could experience limitation in their economic, social and cultural human rights. In the effort to fight stigma against mental health issues, Fondazione The Bridge promoted a contest called “Ma sei fuori?”, targeted to students from secondary school. “Ma sei fuori?” could be translated as “Are you off your rocker?” or, more simply, as “Are you crazy?”; this phrase has been adopted by our juvenile slang to identify a person who's generally considered “not in line”. To those who answered our public call, we sent the contest regulation and factsheets on schizophrenia and stigma, matched with a brief bibliography/filmography. Students involved had to develop a slogan on stigma linked with music and images; 140 classes competed. The best catchphrase had been voted by a jury composed of influencers, clinicians, policy makers, writers, patient associations and other KOLs; besides the winning class, the jury issued three special mentions. All the results had been broadcasted live on Facebook during a public event. The winning class, as prize, got access to financial resources for didactic use and its slogan will be the core of a TV spot. The project had been backed by a communication campaign on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, with the involvement of the most famous italian tiktokers; just on TikTok the campaign reached 4.8 billion views. The project final scope was to raise young people's awareness about mental health issues and stigma, by stimulating a cultural shift. Students underlined another important result: working together online after school during the pandemic helped them filled the gap caused by the lack of socialization. Projects of this kind, easily replicable in other contests, could help creating a common language on the impact of stigma. Key messages  Social stigma still has a great impact on the lives of people with mental issues and disorders. Tackling bias and discrimination is the first step to raise awareness and build a stronger community. As a community, we must promote a responsible behavior and a common language to tackle prejudice on mental health issues; starting from young people could be the key to boost a cultural shift.

T1  - Together divided–divided together: Intersections of symbolic boundaries in the context of ex-Yugoslavian immigrant communities in Vienna
AN  - 2435729257
AB  - The inspiration for the following research arose from an identified ambivalence regarding the question of how relevant ethnic belonging – being Bosniak, being Croat, being Serb – is in everyday life of ex-Yugoslavian Viennese people. A qualitative analysis of narrative interviews as well as participant observations on Vienna’s Ottakringer Straße, a neighbourhood highly frequented by immigrants from the former Yugoslavia and their descendants, indicates that ethnicity indeed matters, particularly when it comes to questions of partner choice. The research, however, also reveals that there are further, intersecting boundaries encompassing or dividing the ‘ex-Yugoslavian community’: In light of being othered by the Austrian majority society and defined as ‘incomplete self’ Maria Todorova, i.e. as representatives of a sphere between the own and the foreign, educationally alienated young adults across ethnic boundaries notably celebrate the culture of ‘turbo folk’ on Ottakringer Straße – a lifestyle that emphasises their own ‘glamour and passion’ as opposed to Austrian ‘bleakness’. Therewith they reinforce the image of the ‘Balkan Other’. Simultaneously, ‘ex-Yugoslavian’ Viennese with higher education levels exhibit a substantial need to not only distinguish themselves from turbo folk and (night-)life on Ottakringer Straße, but also from the image of the ‘Balkan Other’. By emphasising their own ‘more sophisticated’ taste, they express their social position in terms of a specific lifestyle and set themselves apart from the ‘uneducated and common immigrants’. Hence, the analysis shows that, with regard to the ‘ex-Yugoslavian communities’ in Vienna, different symbolic boundaries are at work: the ethnic boundaries – (re-)constructed and (re-)enforced by the wars in the former Yugoslavia – the ‘Balkanised’ symbolic boundaries between ex-Yugoslavian minorities and the Austrian majority as well as the milieu-specific symbolic boundaries within the community itself.

T1  - Looking Back at White Working-Class Racial Attitudes and Behaviors in the Late 1940s: An Updated Analysis
AN  - 2558600640
AB  - We re-analyze quantitative and qualitative data from a study of a white, working-class neighborhood in mid-twentieth century Chicago to pursue two research goals. First, we test how attitudes toward blacks as coworkers and neighbors are correlated, and determine whether those attitudes are associated with commitment to the union and neighborhood attachment. Second, we address three timely issues in urban sociology and race relations: (1) how community efficacy is related to attitudes toward racial exclusion, (2) whether white homeowners are likely to oppose racial minorities as neighbors due to fears over property value decline, and (3) the “whitening” process by which people of southern and eastern European ancestry came to embrace a white racial identity.

T1  - Ethnic, Religious and Gender Differences in Intragenerational Economic Mobility in England and Wales
AN  - 2448829577
AB  - This study uses data from consecutive England and Wales censuses to examine the intragenerational economic mobility of individuals with different ethnicities, religions and genders between 1971 and 2011, over time and across cohorts. The findings suggest more downward and less upward mobility among Black Caribbean, Indian Sikh and Muslim people with Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani ethnicities, relative to white British groups, and more positive relative progress among Indian Hindu people, but also some variation in the experiences of social mobility between individuals even in the same ethnic groups. For some groups, those becoming adults or migrating to the UK since 1971 occupy an improved position compared with older or longer resident people, but this is not universal. Findings suggest that these persistent inequalities will only be effectively addressed with attention to the structural factors which disadvantage particular ethnic and religious groups, and the specific ways in which these affect women.

T1  - Is it just me, or was that sexist? The role of sexism type and perpetrator race in identifying sexism
AN  - 2353192158
AB  - Despite sexism occurring frequently, people often do not identify it as such. Using a vignette design, the current project explored whether sexism was identified at a different rate and intensity depending on the specific form of sexism enacted (hostile or benevolently sexist behavior) and race (Black or White) of the man perpetrating sexist behaviors. When a Black man engaged in a benevolently (paternalistic) sexist behavior he was perceived as more sexist than a White man. However, White and Black men were perceived similarly when they engaged in a hostile (overtly negative and derogatory) sexist behavior. Overall, female participants identified sexism more often and viewed it as more sexist than male participants did, especially in the context of benevolent sexism. These findings suggest there are significant effects of perceiver gender and perpetrator race in the perception of sexism. This demonstrates the importance of examining both race- and gender-based discrimination together.

T1  - When Can Exemplars Shape White Racial Attitudes? Evidence from the 2012 U.S. Presidential Campaign
AN  - 2431020183
AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later.

T1  - Ecological and cultural factors underlying the global distribution of prejudice
AN  - 2285716754
AB  - Prejudiced attitudes and political nationalism vary widely around the world, but there has been little research on what predicts this variation. Here we examine the ecological and cultural factors underlying the worldwide distribution of prejudice. We suggest that cultures grow more prejudiced when they tighten cultural norms in response to destabilizing ecological threats. A set of seven archival analyses, surveys, and experiments (∑N = 3,986,402) find that nations, American states, and pre-industrial societies with tighter cultural norms show the most prejudice based on skin color, religion, nationality, and sexuality, and that tightness predicts why prejudice is often highest in areas of the world with histories of ecological threat. People’s support for cultural tightness also mediates the link between perceived ecological threat and intentions to vote for nationalist politicians. Results replicate when controlling for economic development, inequality, conservatism, residential mobility, and shared cultural heritage. These findings offer a cultural evolutionary perspective on prejudice, with implications for immigration, intercultural conflict, and radicalization.

T1  - The Persistence of Racialized Health Care Attitudes: Racial Attitudes among White Adults and Identity Importance among Black Adults
AN  - 2283281404
AB  - This study evaluates the emergence and persistence of the racial divide on health reform in public opinion using survey data from 2008 through 2017. The findings support existing work showing a consistent relationship between racial resentment and attitudes on the Affordable Care Act among White adults. However, the study also builds on existing work by evaluating the relationship between strength of racial identity among Black adults and health care opinion during President Barack Obama's Administration. The paper investigates the implications of the findings for future health policy in the post-Obama era using survey data on the Republicans’ attempt to pass the American Health Care Act in 2017. The results underscore the conditions that make the “spillover” of racial attitudes into seemingly non-racial policy areas more or less likely to occur. The findings also provide suggestive evidence for how future health reforms may receive different levels of support from both White and Black adults.

T1  - Multiracial Identity, Color‐Blind Racial Ideology, and Discrimination: Professional Counseling Implications
AN  - 2164977494
AB  - Because of the expansive multiracial population growth in the United States, the authors explored multiracial identity integration (MII), color‐blind racial ideology (CBRI), and discrimination using regression analyses with 288 individuals. CBRI and discrimination significantly correlated and predicted MII, with 15.3% of the variance explained by discrimination and CBRI. Moderation analysis revealed that CBRI did not moderate the relationship between discrimination and MII. Continued research among multiracial individuals is recommended to better understand the CBRI and racial identity link.

T1  - Racial Resentment Attitudes Among White Millennial Youth: The Influence of Parents and Media*
AN  - 2081468391
AB  - ObjectiveWe examine levels of racial resentment among white Millennial youth. In addition, we explore the individual‐level determinants of racial resentment among this group, with specific attention given to the potential role of political socialization and social media.MethodsUsing a national survey of parents and children collected in October 2012 immediately prior to the U.S. presidential election, we examine the individual‐level predictors of racial resentment among white respondents (n = 613) who are 18 years old and younger. We test several competing explanations of racial resentment among Millennial youth, including demographic differences, traditional media use, social media use, general societal views, and levels of racial resentment among parents.ResultsOur findings suggest that white American Millennial youth may be slightly more racially progressive than their parents, and parental racial attitudes remain strong predictors of youth racial attitudes. In addition, some forms of social media may help to reduce levels of racial resentment.

T1  - (C)ELSI‐us: Reducing Friction with Indigenous Communities in Genomic Research
AN  - 2047367351
AB  - The importance of culture in framing how Indigenous communities engage with researchers and the context of genetics research does not often get the focus it deserves. Roderick R. McInnes (2011) made an effort to change this by using his 2010 Presidential Address to the American Society of Human Genetics to explore the topic “Culture: The Silent Language Geneticists Must Learn—Genetic Research with Indigenous Populations.” The following quotation from his speech outlines the broader social context in which engagement with Indigenous communities has occurred and its usual outcome: As geneticists and genomicists have reached out to study the world’s populations, particularly indigenous populations, the opportunities for cultural misunderstanding have grown . . . the cultural perspective of the researchers, and their more powerful cultural position in society, has prevented them from fully considering the priorities of the study population, well-intended research could not be undertaken or completed, and the population understudy has been left with a sense of mistrust, stigmatization, or weakened political authority. (McInnes 2011) This pattern has been repeated in many locations around the world, including Aotearoa, New Zealand. The Rakaipaaka Health and Ancestry Study (RHAS) was the only non-disease-speciﬁc population genetic research project of its type ever attempted in New Zealand (Ahuriri-Driscollet al. 2008; Hudson et al. 2007). It was a collaboration between the Rakaipaaka Tribal Authority and a Crown Research Institute. But this project was undermined by the controversy prompted by the principal investigator Rod Lea’s attribution of Māori  violence to the prominence of the “Warrior gene” among the Rakaipaaka (Merriman and Cameron 2007; Rochford 2012). The project itself, developed and promoted alongside the tribal community, was a study in broken promises: Great hopes are held for the study—not least that it may establish a prototype for how population genetic research projects maybe conducted within indigenous communities in the future. It is hoped that it will provide a case study of the way in which research involving a community may be conducted to directly beneﬁt that community. (Tipene-Matua and Wakeﬁeld 2007) RHAS was once a beacon of light and hope—a torch lighting the way for a promising future for genetic and genomic research with indigenous populations and for communities with a common ancestry. But the torch was dropped leaving scorched earth in its place. (Fitzpatrick 2018) This experience reinforced the negative stereotypes created through the genetically modiﬁed organism (GMO) debates in the early 2000s, which positioned scientists as unethical and unresponsive to the cultural perspectives of Indigenous communities (Cram, Pihama, and Philip-Barbara 2000; Roberts and Fairweather 2004; Smith and Reynolds 2000). Motivated by the need to address ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of engagement with genetic/genomic researchers to protect the rights of Indigenous communities, the majority of our research team had been involved with the development of a set of guidelines we call the Te Ara Tika Guidelines for Māori Research Ethics(Hudson et al. 2010; Hudson, Milne, et al. 2016). We were of the opinion that, even though some members of the Māori community were opposed to genetic research, there were many instances where families were given no choice about participation with genetic research (Guilford et al. 1998;Guilford et al. 2010) or were choosing to participate to address health issues (Port et al. 2008). We have specifically added the cultural dimension to the ELSI acronym to reﬂect the unique cultural worldviews that Indigenous communities bring to ELSI—or better, CELSI—debates(Arbour and Cook 2006; Garrison 2013; Haring et al. 2018; Hiratsuka, Brown, and Dillard 2012; TallBear 2013; Taualiiet al. 2014).

T1  - Intergroup Anxiety and Willingness to Accommodate: Exploring the Effects of Accent Stereotyping and Social Attraction
AN  - 2036681224
AB  - Guided by communication accommodation theory, the current study examined the effects of accent stereotyping on native English speakers’ (N = 243) perceptions of and willingness to communicate with the nonnative speaker and willingness to accommodate to Hispanic/Latino Americans in general. Accent stereotyping was manipulated through two experimental conditions: presence or absence of an explicit and negative stereotype in a written paragraph. After reading the paragraph, participants listened to a recording of an English speaker with a moderate, native-Spanish accent. Using PROCESS, results revealed participants in the stereotype condition rated the speaker as less socially attractive than the control condition, indicating accent stereotyping negatively affected perceptions of social attractiveness of the moderately accented speaker. Additionally, results indicated significant indirect effects of negative accent stereotyping on willingness to communicate with the speaker and willingness to accommodate to Hispanic/Latino out-group members sequentially through perceived social attractiveness and communication anxiety.

AB  - In words that sound very like the current article under discussion, Higham instead asked: "Should we not suspect that the nativist theme does little justice to objective realities of ethnic relations?" His discussion of nativism, he had now believed, had focused too heavily on "ideologies, not to actual social processes or conditions."[...]he declared most certainly prematurely that "the nativist theme, as defined and developed to date, is imaginatively exhausted."[...]most scholars ignored Higham's "second thoughts" and avoided dealing with the qualifications he had subsequently put on the thesis of Strangers in the Land.In an era of empires, this was an imprecise form of classification.[...]Powderly and his colleagues drew up a list of "races."

T1  - Couple-level Minority Stress: An Examination of Same-sex Couples' Unique Experiences
AN  - 1969814261
AB  - Social stress resulting from stigma, prejudice, and discrimination--"minority stress"--negatively impacts sexual minority individuals' health and relational well-being. The present study examined how being in a same-sex couple can result in exposure to unique minority stressors not accounted for at the individual level. Relationship timeline interviews were conducted with 120 same-sex couples equally distributed across two study sites (Atlanta and San Francisco), gender (male and female), and relationship duration (at least six months but less than three years, at least three years but less than seven years, and seven or more years). Directed content analyses identified 17 unique couple-level minority stressors experienced within nine distinct social contexts. Analyses also revealed experiences of dyadic minority stress processes (stress discrepancies and stress contagion). These findings can be useful in future efforts to better understand and address the cumulative impact of minority stress on relational well-being and individual health.

T1  - The class politics of prejudice: Brexit and the land of no-hope and glory
AN  - 1961335251
AB  - The debates relating to social class and whether it is still a useful concept in describing a lived reality of the British population has never been far away from media, political and academic dispute. Thatcher's Britain throughout the 1980s attempted to dilute class meaning with what was called 'a home owning democracy' and thus end class collective politics through easily available credit for the working class while simultaneously attacking trade union organization, recruitment and political action. During the late 1990s and into the noughties a 'New Labour' administration attempted to exacerbate the end of class politics through an agenda of a 'cultural distinction' to class identity. Class struggle, class politics and class identity is embedded deep within the cultural norms practices, and history of British democracy. Consequently it is difficult if not impossible to prise class inequality in the UK away from and out of national, local and personal politics (Savage et al. 2015: 393-8). This paper focuses upon the sense that class politics, and cultural class distinction, within the UK had the biggest influence in determining a working-class 'Leave Vote' in the 2016 referendum within the UK. This paper explores accounts and narratives from working-class 'leave' voters though an ethnographic study of the political and social viewpoints of working-class communities of East London, and of ex-mining towns of Nottinghamshire. Framing into fuller context the anger and apathy of being 'left out', arguing that being 'left out' has been part of working-class political narratives for over 30 years. Going beyond frustration and apathy, a significant part of the narrative of working people was of 'not existing', suggesting certain important linkages with ongoing debates about new ways of conceptualizing class differences and class structures.

T1  - Perception or Reality: The Relationship Between Stereotypes, Discrimination, and the Academic Outcomes of African American Male College Athletes
AN  - 1938736638
AB  - The current study examined the degree to which stereotypes and racial discrimination affected the academic outcomes of African American male college athletes. Furthermore, the ability of athletic identity and racial identity to moderate this relationship was examined. Participants (N = 168) were recruited from 13 predominately White institutions across the United States. Results indicated a "tipping point" by which negative stereotypes and discrimination moved from having a positive effect to a negative effect on the academic achievement. In addition, certain dimensions of athletic and racial discrimination were found to moderate the relationship between stereotypes and discrimination and academic outcomes. Findings are discussed in relation to theoretical and practical significance.

T1  - Jeremy Bentham on liberty of taste
AN  - 1950046765
AB  - This article examines Jeremy Bentham's treatment of taste in his essays on sexuality, in the context of the historical development of the idea of taste as a singular practice with a broadly social character. My analysis of Bentham's comments on taste in these essays also engages with Bentham's criticisms of David Hume's writing on social standards of taste. Bentham's essays on sexuality enable us to understand why he condemns Hume's critical, and avowedly unprejudiced, analysis of good and bad tastes, with as much vehemence as he does the anti-democratic attitudes of 'aristocratical' taste. In his essays on sexuality, Bentham defines taste as a disposition to derive pleasure, which assumes meaning in a social context where human beings transact with one another to secure and increase their enjoyment. By this definition, judgements on good and bad tastes are aspects of an anti-social practice that exerts a negative influence on what Bentham calls 'an uncontrolled choice' that links pleasure to utility.

T1  - Autonomy Support Fosters Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Disclosure and Wellness, Especially for Those with Internalized Homophobia
AN  - 1910720675
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals experience disparities in psychological well-being, including greater symptoms of depression and anxiety, relative to their heterosexual peers. One group of LGB individuals is particularly vulnerable--those with high levels of internalized homophobia, or sexual prejudice directed toward the self. The current research explored whether a supportive social environment might be especially beneficial for this group. Specifically, we tested whether autonomy support within a given social environment (e.g., with family, friends, and peers or coworkers) is associated with greater identity disclosure and well-being in that environment, especially for those high in internalized homophobia. Using within-person analyses, we found support for this: perceptions of autonomy support predicted greater disclosure (outness) and well-being, and this relation was particularly strong for those high in internalized homophobia. Implications of these findings for promoting well-being among LGB individuals, a critical social issue, are discussed.

T1  - The clash of ideologies: Notions of multiparty (liberal) democracy versus African systems
AN  - 1928755485
AB  - In South Africa traditional leaders, aka (also known as) chiefs or collaborators, had hoped that the new liberation political environment would retain and safeguard their deeply embedded cultural practices and values, which had existed for centuries, but had been partly violated during the colonial era. However, the new liberation era brought with it notions of liberal democracy-characterised by concepts of meritorious selections, based on democratic "elections", a practice that further marginalised and frustrated hereditary cultural norms and practices, upon which the pillars and identities of each ethnic group or community were based. In discussing the complex and interlocking interests, epochs of colonial and postcolonial experience, the introduction of "foreign" meritorious notions that dispensed with the craved hereditary positions, the chiefs, traditional leaders and former collaborators appear to have been forced to abandon the liberation project and take up the issue of their survival as custodians of customs and chiefdoms; even against the messaging coming from the new political classes. Inevitably, this has created new tensions in the political governance of urban and rural communities, by elected officials who have either failed or succeeded to coopt traditional leaders. This article argues for a balance between democracy and traditional leadership that can inform modern electoral processes and modernise the cultural practices and eliminate unnecessary conflict and tensions.

T1  - Making Everyday Microaggressions: An Exploratory Experimental Vignette Study on the Presence and Power of Racial Microaggressions
AN  - 1888628532
AB  - The term "microaggression" has experienced a lively existence in the field of psychology since its introduction in 1970s. Sociology has recently come to study microaggressions, yet serious gaps remain in the study of microaggressions. In particular, sociological analysis has not taken into account how exposure to microaggressive interactions may affect racial attitudes, how variations in microaggressive interactions have different effects, and what racial and gender positions render one more or less likely to engage in, or fail to oppose, microaggressions. Based on a GSS-based survey and an experimental vignette design, we address the following two questions: First, how might the presence of racial microaggressions affect racial attitudes? Second, what is the power of specific types of interactional microaggression? Results indicate that both exposure to microaggressions and the type of microaggressions are correlated with changes in specific racial attitudes associated with the marginalization, problematization, and symbolic and physical repression of people of color.

T1  - Identities beyond ethnic-based subordination or conflict in the Southeast Asian borderlands: a case study of Lao villagers in northeast Cambodia
AN  - 1832906757
AB  - This paper explores everyday expressions of identity by Lao villagers living in northeast Cambodia near the border with Laos, and uses this to reflect on trends in studies of identity in the remote borderlands of Southeast Asia. I argue that while ethnicity is certainly crucial, discipline-specific emphases - ethnic-based subordination or conflict for social studies and political studies, respectively - result in less attention to other important dynamics shaping identity. Furthermore, I suggest that low-profile case studies not strongly linked to ethnic-based subordination or conflict - such as the Lao in Cambodia - require study for a more comprehensive view of identity in the borderlands. The case study from northeast Cambodia identifies four key dynamics shaping identity: inter-state relations, ethno-national identities, cross-border livelihoods and social status. I show how minimal inter-state tensions and varied personal connections to Laos were important in facilitating villagers' involvement in lucrative illegal cross-border logging in Laos, but the latter were never used to justify this practice. Instead in this everyday setting, villagers emphasised their sense of marginalisation within Cambodia and thus demonstrate their regular prioritisation of status.

T1  - The other side of Malaysia's enviable economic and multiethnic stability: the obstinate resilience of 'money politics'
AN  - 1832906087
AB  - Many governments, in their zeal to progress and deliver the fruits of development, are caught in a web of unsavory habits and practices that impair not only their international image but also domestic legitimacy. One such perennially persistent and resilient disease is 'money politics.' Taking Malaysia as a case study, we note that despite sustaining a remarkable record of economic and multiethnic stability, the country has also been helpless in mitigating this obstinate issue. In this article, it is posited that the phenomenon is not a new or recent portent but has actually persisted even prior to independence. We shall then contend that unless the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition government attaches greater priority in stamping out this political bug, the country's otherwise enviable development trajectory and the quest to reach a 'developed nation' status via its Vision 2020 declaration, even if fulfilled, are not cause for celebration, given its implications to the country's economic sustainability and multiethnic stability.

T1  - Vietnamese in Poland: How does ethnicity affect immigrant entrepreneurship?
AN  - 1907272937
AB  - The article examines the business activities of Vietnamese immigrants in Poland. Against the backdrop of a highly differentiated Vietnamese population in Poland, this study found that the ethnicity of immigrants can serve as a resource (especially as a source of values, such as diligence and intra-group solidarity) and as a strategy for promoting success in business activities. However, negative stereotypes and state policies toward immigrant self-employment can limit the market access of certain groups. Findings from the study demonstrate that ethnic entrepreneurship in a post-communist country may be subject to the same processes as in other European states and the US.

T1  - Who do migrant associations represent? The role of 'ethnic deservingness' and legal capital in migrants' rights claims in Turkey
AN  - 1814221847
AB  - Considering that established migrant associations often play an active role in migrants' rights advocacy, the relationship between them and the growing numbers of irregular migrants needs careful scrutiny. Looking at the encounters between irregular Bulgarian Turkish migrants and associations established by their co-ethnics who hold Turkish citizenship in Turkey, our ethnographic evidence shows that co-ethnic migrant associations mobilise the legal frame of 'ethnic deservingness' with the intention of welcoming co-ethnics to the Turkish homeland. In the absence of other formal organisations for rights advocacy, associations' appeals to this frame emerge as a civic resource for the irregular newcomers in their permanent residency claims. At the same time, the same frame hides unequal power relations within co-ethnic communities, that is, newcomers' peripheral positions within associations and the economic costs of filing claims via associations. This situation creates a representational gap in the associational context between its active members with higher legal capital and irregular newcomers with lower legal capital. Tackling the problem of representation determined by the legal hierarchy, this study questions whether migrant associations should still be considered important political actors when undocumented/irregular migrants outnumber regulars-especially with regard to the immediate political/legal actions they require.

T1  - Kazakh perspective on China, the Chinese, and Chinese migration
AN  - 1812458780
AB  - Discourse analysis of different languages of newspapers in Kazakhstan reveals that Kazakhstanis' views towards China and the Chinese are divided. The official discourse in both state-sponsored Russian and Kazakh newspapers is in accordance with the country's policy towards further engagement with their rising Chinese neighbour. However, negative stereotypes of China and the Chinese, as well as sinophobia, are pervasive in private Kazakh language newspapers. Private Russian newspapers have a more nuanced view towards China, with a hidden inclination towards being critical of that country and its people. Although the majority of these societal voices do not have a direct impact on changing the national policies of Kazakhstan, they are important in the sense that Kazakhstan's ruling elite must continue to gauge social views and to placate differences in order to secure the stability and legitimacy of the regime.

T1  - Friendship Development and Intergroup Attitudes: The Role of Interpersonal and Intergroup Friendship Processes
AN  - 1817460987
AB  - Although there is a growing body of work concerning cross-group friendship and intergroup attitudes, this work typically focuses on a limited number of interpersonal processes among established friendships. In addition, little is known about the role of group-related processes within such friendships. Two studies were conducted to address this gap. Results from a retrospective online survey and a longitudinal study reveal that both interpersonal friendship processes (e.g., intimacy, affection, trust, self-disclosure) and intergroup friendship processes (e.g., belief that outgroup friend respects one's own group, spending time with outgroup friend's family members and friends) are associated with positive intergroup attitudes. Specifically, the current findings suggest that interpersonal friendship processes are vital to fostering positive attitudes for the outgroup early in the relationship, but that intergroup friendship processes become more strongly linked to attitudes once the relationship progresses. Results may inform interventions designed to promote positive interactions across "real-world" group boundaries.

T1  - Interpersonal contact and attitudes towards indigenous peoples in Canada's prairie cities
AN  - 1804187564
AB  - Research finds that non-indigenous peoples often hold negative racial attitudes towards indigenous peoples. Contact theory suggests that interpersonal contact can positively influence majority group members' attitudes regarding minority group members, raising the question of whether indigenous population growth in cities will alter non-indigenous peoples' attitudes. Using original 2014 survey data, this paper examines the relationship between interpersonal contact and racial attitudes in Canadian prairie cities. The analysis finds that while personal ties to aboriginal peoples are correlated with lower new and old-fashioned racism scores, general contact with aboriginal peoples only correlates with old-fashioned racism scores. As such, growing urban indigenous populations - and thus increased aboriginal-non-aboriginal general contact - alone should not be expected to result in positive racial attitudes. This research advances understanding of contact theory by considering how education interacts with interpersonal contact, and informs on-going dialogue about current racial relations between non-indigenous and indigenous peoples in Canadian prairie cities.

T1  - Diaspora activism in a non-traditional country of destination: the case of Filipinos in the Netherlands
AN  - 1765125800
AB  - Diasporas have played important roles in democratization in their homelands. But how does diaspora mobilization occur when the country of settlement has a small and isolated ethnic community, the host and homeland governments have weak relations, and the conflict is invisible in the geographies of power? Using case study research, I analyse how solidarity groups in the Netherlands facilitated the emergence and growth of diaspora mobilization for democracy in the Philippines during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. My findings show that in cases where exiles and migrants lack pre-existing economic, political and social ties in the host society, solidarity groups can affect the political opportunity structure in the host country, permitting the promotion of certain claims and demands in the public sphere. Furthermore, diaspora mobilization can develop within the formal organizations or associational networks of solidarity groups.

T1  - Exclusionary attitudes toward the allocation of welfare benefits to Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong
AN  - 1907272944
AB  - Studies on migration often assume that members of the same ethnic category are less likely to develop exclusionary attitudes toward each other. In order to explain why many Hong Kong people exhibit exclusionary attitudes toward granting social rights to Chinese immigrants who share the same ethnic ancestry with them, we conducted a phone survey to examine four important factors: (1) economic threat; (2) social threat; (3) negative stereotypes; and (4) contact with immigrants. We find that the economic threat--either at the societal or individual level--perceived by respondents does not explain their exclusionary attitudes. The results are consistent with alternative explanations emphasizing cultural and non-economic concerns commonly associated with ethnocentrism.

T1  - Stigma of persons with disabilities in Afghanistan: Examining the pathways from stereotyping to mental distress
AN  - 1774575492
AB  - Despite evidence that stigma of disability is frequently reflected through stereotyping and often results in mental distress, very limited literature demonstrates the pathways through which stereotyping has an impact on mental health. Drawing from a large sample of 1449 participants interviewed between December 2012 and September 2013 from an Afghan community-based rehabilitation program, we examined the structure of stigma associated with disability in Afghanistan. Labeling and negative stereotypes, associated with a specific cause of disability, result in social exclusion that in turn impacts mental health. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examined the mediation effect of stereotypes associated with disability on mental distress and anxiety. We found a mediating role of social exclusion between stereotypes and mental distress but only in the case of persons with disabilities from birth. Comparing the total effect of 'disabled at birth' and mental distress 0.195 (95% CI: 0.018-0.367) the effect size of this mediation effect was 0.293 (95% CI: 0.173-0.415). There was no significant direct effect between 'disabled at birth' and mental distress once mediation effect was accounted for in our model. These findings suggest that a multipronged policy approach that recognizes the driving forces of stigma and promotes social participation directly alongside psychosocial interventions on mental distress of persons with disabilities is necessary to achieve wellbeing for a group that has been historically and systematically excluded from development interventions.

T1  - How ordinary people view Muslim group rights in Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany: significant 'gaps' between majorities and Muslims?
AN  - 1784151267
AB  - Taking four countries-Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany-with distinct state approaches and public debates over accommodating Muslims, we study the views of ordinary people from the majority and Muslim populations on Muslim group rights. We compare their responses to questions on mosque-building, teachers wearing religious symbols, and religious classes in schools, to determine whether there is a significant 'gap' between the majority and Muslim minorities. We find highly significant 'gaps' between the majorities and Muslims over Muslim group rights in all countries, with the majorities less supportive. Importantly, it is a shift by the majority population against Muslim group rights that produces this 'gap' as the question moves from provision for Christians to Muslims, while Muslims hold similar views over rights for Christians and their own religion. In Britain and Germany, the two countries where church/state relations privilege Christianity over other religions, majorities especially support Christian over Muslim group rights. The British findings are remarkable, because a country which substantially grants and has the most supportive public debate for Muslim group rights, produces the largest 'gaps' between its majority and Muslims. We think this is due to political context, where in contrast to the Netherlands, there is no outlet for political opposition to Muslim group rights.

T1  - Are Smart People Less Racist? Verbal Ability, Anti-Black Prejudice, and the Principle-Policy Paradox
AN  - 1777916366
AB  - It is commonly hypothesized that higher cognitive abilities promote racial tolerance and a greater commitment to racial equality, but an alternative theoretical framework contends that higher cognitive abilities merely enable members of a dominant racial group to articulate a more refined legitimizing ideology for racial inequality. According to this perspective, ideological refinement occurs in response to shifting patterns of racial conflict and is characterized by rejection of overt prejudice, superficial support for racial equality in principle, and opposition to policies that challenge the dominant group's status. This study estimates the impact of verbal ability on a comprehensive set of racial attitudes, including anti-black prejudice, views about black-white equality in principle, and racial policy support. It also investigates cohort differences in the effects of verbal ability on these attitudes. Results suggest that high-ability whites are less likely than low-ability whites to report prejudicial attitudes and more likely to support racial equality in principle. Despite these liberalizing effects, high-ability whites are no more likely to support a variety of remedial policies for racial inequality. Results also suggest that the ostensibly liberalizing effects of verbal ability on anti-black prejudice and views about racial equality in principle emerged slowly over time, consistent with ideological refinement theory.

T1  - The role of social desirability bias and racial/ethnic composition on the relation between education and attitude toward immigration restrictionism
AN  - 1750999821
AB  - Social scientists note individuals tend to respond favorably to sensitive topics in surveys, but few consider factors triggering these responses. This study uses unique data to examine respondents' racial/ethnic attitude under direct and indirect modes of elicitation. In particular, the list experiment provides a cloak of anonymity to a random subsample of individuals that allows them to respond truthfully about their racial/ethnic attitudes. By comparing responses between administration modes, this study evaluates whether social desirability pressures mediate, and racial/ethnic composition moderate, the relation between education and racial/ethnic attitudes. Findings indicate an initial positive relation between education and racial/ethnic attitudes, but desirability bias mainly drives this relation. Furthermore, there is some support racial/ethnic composition moderates the influence of social desirability on education. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331914000986]

T1  - HOW RACIAL ATTITUDES AND IDEOLOGY AFFECT POLITICAL RIGHTS FOR FELONS
AN  - 1700674170; 201525349
AB  - This research examines the extent to which negative attitudes toward African Americans influence public reactions to restoring political rights to felons. We argue that race-neutral policies, such as felon disenfranchisement laws, are non-separable from racial considerations, as images of criminals and felons are typically associated with Blacks. Such attitudes produce collateral consequences for felons, hampering the restoration of their full political rights and, ultimately, their citizenship. Predispositions, such as racial attitudes and political ideology, provide both racial and nonracial justifications for supporting these laws, yet, there are no empirical accounts of their relational effects on opinion toward felons' rights. Using nationally representative survey data, we find that racialized resentment and ideology exert the most influence on the reactions to policies seeking political rights for felons as well as beliefs about the value of doing so. Consistent with much of the literature on attitudes toward ameliorative racial policies, higher levels of racial resentment strongly predict lower support for felons' political rights among both conservatives and liberals, yet, racial resentment is most influential among liberals. Conservatives exhibit the highest levels of racial resentment, but its impact is depressed more by agreement on both racial attitudes and opposition to political rights of felons.

T1  - The Conditions Ripe for Racial Spillover Effects
AN  - 1752995455; 201600223
AB  - A growing body of research shows that Barack Obama's rise to prominence has further polarized mass politics by racial attitudes and race-a phenomenon we have described elsewhere as the spillover of racialization. There is still much that remains unknown about source-cue spillover effects in general and the spillover of racialization in particular. This study helps fill that void by drawing on prior research in political psychology and several new empirical examples to address lingering questions that have not been adequately answered. Those new empirical analyses suggest that issues that are already strongly influenced by racial attitudes, issues that the public has strong opinions about, and issues where Obama cross-pressures Americans with racially conservative positions are all less likely to racialize in response to the president's visible positions. I also show that low-information Americans and Democrats are most susceptible to racial spillover effects. Finally, the extant evidence suggests that the source-cue spillover effects can have lasting impacts on public opinion and that the races, religions, and genders of other prominent elite sources can also activate group-based considerations in mass opinion formation.

T1  - National minority and racialized minorities: the case of Pakistanis in Quebec
AN  - 1667951594; 201509537
AB  - Canada is often characterized as a multicultural country with two official languages associated with two official population groups: the national majority of white, anglophone Canadians and the national minority of white, francophone Quebecers. Racialized minorities, including immigrants, are situated as the third node in the construction of Canada as a multicultural society. While there is often discussion of the minority/ majority relationship between the national majority and the national minority, or the national majority and racialized minorities, there is much less attention given to the relationship between Quebec and racialized minorities in the province. This paper examines the construction of difference in this relationship through the experiences of Pakistani Muslims living in Montreal. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - In the Belly of the Beast: Effects of Anti-Immigration Policy on Latino Community Members
AN  - 1735658032; 201536921
AB  - This paper examines the experiences of Latino adults in South Phoenix, Arizona, during a time of changing immigration policy, through the theoretical lenses of structural vulnerability and macro- and microaggression. The analyses describe how U.S.- and foreign-born Latinos experience the effects of local immigration laws and anti-immigrant sentiment. The results suggest that while there are differences between the U.S.-born and foreign-born in perceived impacts of immigration enforcement, there are few differences in perceptions of vulnerability and no evidence of lesser psychological distress among those who are not the direct targets of immigration enforcement activities. Even if they do not feel directly at risk, most respondents express concerns for family members and others in their social networks as a result of increased attention to immigration enforcement or anti-immigrant sentiment. These shared impacts may have long-term implications for Latino communities in the United States. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Belonging to the nation: generational change, identity and the Chinese diaspora
AN  - 1660022188; 201505555
AB  - This study reviews developments in the ethnic and national identity of the descendants of migrants, taking ethnic Chinese as a case study. Our core question is why, in spite of debates worldwide about identity, exclusion and rights, do minority communities continue to suffer discrimination and attacks? This question is asked in view of the growing incidence in recent years of 'racial' conflicts between majority and minority communities and among minorities, in both developed and developing countries. The study examines national identity from the perspective of migrants' descendants, whose national identity may be more rooted than is often thought. Concepts such as 'new ethnicities', 'cultural fluidity', and 'new' and 'multiple' identities feature in this examination. These concepts highlight identity changes across generations and the need to challenge and reinterpret the meaning of 'nation' and to review problems with policy initiatives designed to promote nation-building in multi-ethnic societies.

T1  - Segmented assimilation and socio-economic integration of Chinese immigrant children in the USA
AN  - 1660021832; 201505846
AB  - Research on the new second generation has paid much attention to testing one of the hypotheses posed by segmented assimilation theory - downward assimilation into America's underclass - and has neglected to examine other possible outcomes. In this paper, I address a much understudied pathway - assimilation by way of the ethnic community - based on a case study of Chinese immigrant children in the USA. I show that the children of Chinese immigrants have made inroads into mainstream America through educational achievement, not only because of the strong value their parents put on education but also because resources generated in the ethnic community help actualize that value. The Chinese American experience suggests that, in order to advance to the rank of middle-class Americans, immigrant parents have chosen the ethnic way to facilitate children's social mobility and achieved success. Paradoxically, 'assimilated' children have also relied on ethnicity for empowerment to fight negative stereotyping of the racialized other. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cleanliness/dirtiness, purity/impurity as social and psychological issues
AN  - 1728662622; 201533987
AB  - The issue of cleanliness in its clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies definitely has a social and cultural dimension. Some daily cleaning practices are indeed quite common actions in every culture and society, even if some differences in the frequency and quality of the practices and in the value attributed to them do exist. In this article, we will discuss how cleaning practices and contamination fears sink their roots in the social context and in cultural practices. In particular, we will explore the connections between one's own sense of cleanliness and attitudes of prejudice and intolerance toward other groups. First, the issue of cleanliness over the centuries and the exaggerations of cleanliness referring to individual psychopathology will be examined. Then, the psychosocial meaning of cleanliness will be considered in revealing the impact of the clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies on day-to-day social interactions with others.

T1  - More Diverse Yet Less Tolerant? How the Increasingly Diverse Racial Landscape Affects White Americans' Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1708525734; 201528613
AB  - Recent Census Bureau projections indicate that racial/ethnic minorities will comprise over 50% of the U.S. population by 2042, effectively creating a so-called 'majority-minority' nation. Across four experiments, we explore how presenting information about these changing racial demographics influences White Americans' racial attitudes. Results reveal that exposure to the changing demographics evokes the expression of greater explicit and implicit racial bias. Specifically, Whites exposed to the racial demographic shift information preferred interactions/settings with their own ethnic group over minority ethnic groups; expressed more negative attitudes toward Latinos, Blacks, and Asian Americans; and expressed more automatic pro-White/anti-minority bias. Perceived threat to Whites' societal status mediated the effects of the racial shift information on explicit racial attitudes. These results suggest that rather than ushering in a more tolerant future, the increasing diversity of the nation may instead yield intergroup hostility. Implications for intergroup relations and media framing of the racial shift are discussed.

T1  - Raising the bar in analysis: Wimmer's Ethnic Boundary Making
AN  - 1551001609; 201429107
AB  - Most books on ethnicity and race purport to relate specifically to one country, for instance, the USA. So Wimmer's new book is highly ambitious in presenting a comparative analytical framework for understanding ethnic boundary making, which transcends the particularities of any one country. While stressing the many ways in which actors are strategic in their practices, assertions and affiliations, in Ethnic Boundary Making, Andreas Wimmer insists on avoiding the tiresome binaries of instrumentalism versus primordialism. Wimmer's comparative framework centres on a search for recurring processual patterns. The search for such patterns means that there are only a finite number of ways in which ethnic boundaries are made, redefined, demolished, and so on -- even across quite disparate societies around the world. It is this dogged determination to be precise and comprehensive that marks this book from others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Walking on the Edge: Towards a Sociography of Discrimination against the Buraku: Lectures on Discrimination in Letter Format
AN  - 1559006442; 201431994
AB  - This article demonstrates a new methodological approach to recognize, analyze and write about discrimination against the buraku, which is one form of social discrimination in contemporary Japan. The structural discrimination proposed in this study is based on the concept of relational discrimination, which is derived from fundamental criticisms of the conventional concepts of material and psychological discrimination. Relational discrimination occurs when we are placed in a certain type of relationship and may become accomplices to discrimination or cause it, regardless of whether or not there is any individual prejudice or discriminatory consciousness at work. From this perspective, this article tries to fundamentally re-examine the binary thinking assumed in conventional sociology that there are minorities (those who are discriminated against) and majorities (those who discriminate against the minority). I focus on the complex ways of being human, and in particular on the transformations that accompany changes in particular relations such as from a person who does not discriminate to one who discriminates against others; from a person who is discriminated against to one who discriminates against others and from a person who is not discriminated against to one who is discriminated against. By focusing on the meaning of the deep suffering of a man who made discriminatory remarks to people living in a buraku community, and of a woman who married into a family living in a buraku community, I try to understand life ethics for people who discriminate and who at the same time are discriminated against.

T1  - Social Exclusion of Children: Developmental Origins of Prejudice
AN  - 1543801910
AB  - Over the past decade, developmental and social psychological research has explicitly adopted a developmental intergroup framework, integrating social and developmental psychology fields to understand the origins of social exclusion and prejudice. This article argues that a social developmental analysis of how groups and individuals experience, evaluate, and understand exclusion is essential for a complete picture of the human experience, interpretation, and consequences of exclusion. What has been missing in much of the social psychological research on exclusion is an incorporation of developmental perspectives; likewise, what has been missing in development psychological research is a focus on group identity and group dynamics for understanding the basis for exclusionary behavior in childhood. Yet, the roots of adult forms of exclusion can be documented in childhood, and children who experience exclusion are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, and especially when exclusion is based on group membership. Moreover, interventions designed to ameliorate social problems associated with exclusion need to be based on an understanding of how, why, and under what conditions, children and groups make decisions to exclude others, how they experience this exclusion, and how exclusion originates and changes over the course of the lifespan. Thus, a growing body of psychological work, exemplified in this issue of the Journal of Social Issues (2014), highlights implications for theory in psychology and related social sciences, and for interventions and policies to tackle social exclusion.

T1  - Mediators of stereotype threat among black college students
AN  - 1520325675; 201413289
AB  - We hypothesize that the manner in which stereotype threat affects college-grade achievement is mediated by institutional context as well as individual characteristics. Drawing on a sample of black students from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, we find weak and inconsistent evidence that institutional characteristics influence the operation of stereotype threat. We find more consistent evidence to indicate that the effect of stereotype threat is conditioned by individual factors such as skin colour, multiracial origins and an integrated upbringing. Most of the effect on grade achievement occurs through the internalization pathway, in which the internalization of negative stereotypes leads to disinvestment manifested by a reduction in academic effort. The reduction in work effort, in turn, lowers grades. We also find evidence that immigrant origin confers protection from the negative effects of stereotype threat through both internalization and externalization mechanisms, although the ultimate effect of grade achievement is rather small.

T1  - 'The unwilling and the unwell'? Exploring stakeholders' perceptions of working with long term sickness benefits recipients
AN  - 1692288681; 201521363
AB  - This paper draws on qualitative research with Incapacity Benefit (IB) stakeholders in the North East of England, UK. Stakeholders' experiences of working with long-term sickness benefits recipients reveal multiple barriers that both sick and disabled people, and themselves as practitioners, clearly face. Reflections on what ongoing welfare reform could mean for future practice for both stakeholders and recipients will be explored. The findings suggests that whilst stakeholders recognise the complex barriers faced by those receiving sickness benefits, a wider moral dialogue between 'deserving' and 'undeserving' is being created and sustained as a result of negative stereotyping of sickness benefits recipients.

T1  - 'Reel love' across ethnic boundaries? The extent and significance of inter-ethnic intimacy in Australian cinema
AN  - 1520342843; 201413204
AB  - National cinemas play an important role in the construction of national identities, representing the 'self' to both domestic and international audiences. Evidence of the material impacts of media representations on individuals and society, and the pervasiveness of movie-watching as a cultural activity, underscore the importance of scholarly inquiry into film. Here, we are concerned with how ethnic diversity has been negotiated within the Australian national cinema -- specifically at the scale of intimate interpersonal relationships. Our analysis of twenty-five recent Australian films considers how cinema alerts audiences to the possibilities and limitations of love within and across ethnic boundaries. We find cause for modest optimism in regard to the frequency of Australian cinematic representations of inter-ethnic intimacy, although the narrow range of ethnic groups permitted to participate in these encounters, and an apparent reticence to portray marriage, co-habitation and child-bearing across ethnic boundaries, remain cause for concern.

T1  - Competition in stereotyped domains: Competition, social comparison, and stereotype threat
AN  - 1512219815; 201408715
AB  - The current work examines a novel and specific way in which competition can hurt the performance of negatively stereotyped individuals: by evoking stereotype threat. In four experiments, we demonstrate that women's underperformance in math when primed with competition was due to feeling worried about confirming negative stereotypes about women's math ability (i.e., stereotype threat), that the activation of negative performance stereotypes for women primed with competition was due to increased group-level social comparisons (i.e., comparing the self with men and women), and that priming competition led men to perform more poorly than women in a domain where they are negatively stereotyped (i.e., verbal ability). This research suggests that priming people with competition in contexts where they are negatively stereotyped leads to greater social comparison, activation of negative stereotypes, and concern about confirming these stereotypes, thereby decreasing stereotyped individuals' performance in the stereotyped domain. .

AB  - This article introduces a racialized conflict theory to explain how racial divisions structure welfare state development in the absence of de jure discrimination. The author explains the effect of racial divisions on policy outcomes as the result of the attitudinal, cultural, and political spillover effects of prevailing conflicts in a social field. Using a paired-case comparison and analysis of multiple data sources, the author applies this theory to analyze Georgia's and Alabama's surprisingly divergent welfare reforms in the 1990s. Results support the racialized conflict theory and suggest important revisions to prevailing theories about the sociopolitical effects of contemporary racial divides. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - National Identity and Group Narcissism as Predictors of Intergroup Attitudes Toward Undocumented Latino Immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1494748570; 201402193
AB  - The debate surrounding immigration reform to address undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States has been emotionally charged and polarizing. This study's goal was to better understand some of the psychological predictors of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States, namely, collective identity as an American, group-level narcissism, and their interaction. A university sample (N = 223) completed an online survey measuring attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. As anticipated, we found that, at mean and high (but not low) levels of group narcissism, national in-group identification was a significant predictor of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. The implications of these findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed in light of the current debate on undocumented immigration in the United States.

T1  - Narratives from a Nottingham council estate: a story of white working-class mothers with mixed-race children
AN  - 1463011945; 201345836
AB  - This paper introduces a group of white working-class women living on a council estate in the UK drawing on an ethnographic study conducted between 2005 and 2009, examining the impact of class inequality and a stigmatized living space in an ethnically diverse urban neighbourhood. All of the women are mothers and have mixed-race children; they reside on the St Ann's estate in Nottingham, an inner-city neighbourhood that has been subject to poor housing, poverty and unemployment for many generations. The women who live on this estate say that they suffer from negative stereotypes and stigmatization because of the notoriety of the estate, because they are working class and because they have had sexual relationships with black men. However, there is a sense of connectedness to the estate and there are strong cultural meanings that are heavily influenced by the West Indian community. This paper then highlights the importance of place when focusing upon families, class inequality and intercultural relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ideologies of nationhood in sending-state transnationalism: Comparing Surinam and Turkey
AN  - 1448991595; 201342897
AB  - Why do some sending states encourage continued emigrant involvement whereas others do not? And to what extent does sending-state transnationalism lead to a redefinition of borders? Although research on sending-state transnationalism is flourishing, so far it only covers the positive cases and remains silent on states inactive in this respect. This article addresses this lacuna by comparing transnational costs, benefits and strategies of two radically different sending states, Surinam and Turkey, including one that never reached out to its emigrants. The two sending states have very different ideologies of nationhood: one based on 'unity in diversity' on one territory (Surinam), the other based on ethnic nationalism (Turkey). Homeland ideologies of nationhood, this article argues, play a significant role in including or excluding emigrants and their descendants. In this way sending states reinforce rather than deterritorialize their national borders. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Understanding disagreement within the majority about action to atone for past wrongs
AN  - 1433108420
AB  - Policies atoning for past wrongs against minority groups are often contested within the majority. During the year after the apology to the Indigenous Australian Stolen Generations, predictors of non-Indigenous (majority) collective action intentions focusing on support or opposition to reform reconciliation policies (Study 1, N=206) and compensation to the Stolen Generations (Study 2, N=215; Study 3, N=298) were examined. Action was analyzed as a function of national identity, opinion-based group identity, group-based guilt, political orientation, and collective efficacy. Opinion-based group identification was an independent predictor of action for all groups except for anti-compensation, where efficacy strongly predicted action. Findings highlight opinion-based groups' role in capturing the fault lines of disagreement within majority groups.

T1  - The Moderating Effects of Skin Color and Ethnic Identity Affirmation on Suicide Risk among Low-SES African American Women
AN  - 1494749955; 201402121
AB  - This study examined the influence of concurrent racism and sexism experiences (i.e., gendered racism) on African American women's suicidal ideation and behavior in the context of disadvantaged socioeconomic status. Drawing on a stress process framework, the moderating effects of ethnic identity and skin color were explored using multiple regression analyses. Data were from 204 low-income African American women in the B-WISE (Black Women in a Study of Epidemics) project. Findings suggested that experiencing gendered racism significantly increased these women's risk for suicidal ideation or behavior, though only among women with medium or dark skin color. Also, having strong ethnic identity buffered the harmful effects of gendered racism. The moderating properties of skin color and ethnic identity affirmation likely operate through psychosocial pathways, blocking internalization of negative stereotypes and reducing the level of distress experienced in response to gendered racism.

T1  - Opening Pathways for Vulnerable Young People in Patagonia
AN  - 1373426659; 201330477
AB  - New and improved institutions are needed to support the transition to adulthood of vulnerable young people. Existing institutions that should provide that support demonstrate structural lag: they have not adapted to changing circumstances. Action research was conducted in Por un Manana, an employment training program for low-income youth and young adults in the Patagonia region of Argentina to explore how to build developmental assets and to overcome employers' prejudice against low-income youth. Consultation with program graduates generated new program elements to increase social inclusion and employability of young mothers and graduates. The action research team uncovered participants' fears and preconceptions about work and the need to move them out of the program's protective bubble. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Improving intergroup attitudes via mediated intergroup contact in a bilingual setting
AN  - 1463012904; 201345887
AB  - This paper explores the role of mediated intergroup contact in improving intergroup attitudes between Italian speakers and German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy. Specifically, we examine how German-language television consumption affects attitudes towards the German-speaking group among Italian-speaking youth. The data (N = 229) were collected among Italian-speaking secondary school students in 2011. As expected, the results indicated that more German TV use was associated with more positive attitudes toward German speakers. A cognitive mediator (intergroup understanding) had a greater influence than an affective one (intergroup anxiety) in mediating the effect of TV use on attitudes. The effect of TV use on attitudes was greater among those who had less personal intergroup contact, but there were no differences in the effects of television based on variations in the local ethnolinguistic vitality of the two groups. Findings and implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Re-making a Frontier Community or Defending Ethnic Boundaries? The Caucasus in Cossack Identity
AN  - 1504423169; 201405517
AB  - The essay focuses on the notion of the Caucasus as a reference point in the construction of Cossack identity in southern Russia. Since the late Soviet period, the Cossack revivalist/nativist movement has emerged in the territories which constituted the frontier zones of Tsarist Russia. Arguably, the historical Cossack hosts were established as a kind of frontier community which played an important role in the expansion of the Russian Empire. This essay examines how post-Soviet Cossacks reinterpret the meanings of the Caucasus as a spatial and cultural realm where, or in relation to which, they produce their identity as a distinct ethnic and cultural community.

T1  - Direct and Mediated Intercultural Contact: Koreans' Attitudes toward U.S. Americans
AN  - 1033026447
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis, this study tested two models examining the associations among Korean young adults' consumption of U.S. dramas, direct contact with a U.S. American person, and their attitudes toward U.S. Americans in general. Results demonstrated that personal contact and mediated contact had a positive effect on intergroup attitudes, but that frequency of personal contact was a negative contributor. Mediated contact had different and stronger influences on participants' intergroup attitudes when they did not have personal contact with U.S. Americans. In addition, intergroup anxiety played a significant role in the contact modes and attitudes links. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnic Microaggressions and the Depressive and Somatic Symptoms of Latino and Asian American Adolescents
AN  - 1019369070; 22453294
AB  - Ethnic microaggressions are a form of everyday, interpersonal discrimination that are ambiguous and difficult to recognize as discrimination. This study examined the frequency and impact of microaggressions among Latino (n = 247) and Asian American (n = 113) adolescents (M ^sub age^ = 17.18, SD = .75; 57 % girls). Latino adolescents reported more frequent microaggressions that dismiss their realities of discrimination and microaggressions characterized by treatment as a second class citizen than Asian Americans, but similar levels of microaggressions that highlight differences or foreignness. There were no ethnic differences in the extent to which adolescents were bothered by microaggressions. Moreover, even supposedly innocuous forms of discrimination are associated with elevated levels of anxiety, anger, and stress, which may increase feelings of depression and sickness. Microaggressions should be recognized as subtle discrimination that send messages about group status and devaluation, and similar to overt discrimination, can evoke powerful emotional reactions and may affect mental health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Are there rights in a time of crisis?
AN  - 1541998950; 201426848
AB  - The key issue in the present economic and political context is that some of the current and planned responses to the crisis could become a huge barrier for persons with disabilities, since they are currently experiencing greater difficulties in the exercise of their human rights. While new economic stimulus packages are targeted towards recently unemployed workers rather than the already unemployed that belong to different vulnerable groups, social protection programs are decreasing in a number of countries due to resource limitations. In essence, the economic crisis has left many countries with serious budgetary deficits. The European Disability Forum (n.d.) has warned that austerity measures undertaken by governments undermine progress towards the realization of the rights and social measures of persons with disabilities. These rights and social targets are enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as in other normative and legislative texts. Economic, social and political reforms, implemented without duly consideration of the rights of people with disabilities, can exacerbate problems such as poverty, social exclusion, discrimination, marginalization, illiteracy and negative stereotypes.

T1  - The Cinematic Incarnation of Frazier's Black Bourgeoisie: Tyler Perry's Black Middle-Class
AN  - 1364700379; 201323426
AB  - Images of Black Americans in modern cinema often depict negative stereotypes of working- and lower-class Blacks. Yet, with the rise of the Black middle-class and the increasing inclusion of Blacks in positions of power within the mass media, more images of middle-class Blacks have begun to appear, particularly through the work of Tyler Perry. We find that Perry's images largely reflect E. Franklin Frazier's characterization of middle-class Blacks in The Black Bourgeoisie (1957), where Perry frames them as (1) materialistic and status-obsessed, (2) dysfunctional and abusive, and (3) disdainful of working- and lower-class Blacks. We also argue that he is creating new controlling images like the "Emasculated Black Gentleman." In these ways, Perry's images may have detrimental consequences including perpetuating Black stereotypes, reinforcing existing class and gender tensions in Black America, and impeding the life chances of middle-class Blacks by suggesting that they are unsuitable for assimilation and integration.

T1  - Violence Committed Against Migrants in Transit: Experiences on the Northern Mexican Border
AN  - 1010078620; 21655940
AB  - Thousands of Mexican and Central American migrants converge at the Mexico-United States border. Undocumented migrants in transit to the United States are vulnerable due to their lack of access to health care and legal assistance. This study attempts to provide evidence on the violent-related consequences that migration has on migrants. A mixed-method study was conducted between April 2006-May 2007 in shelters in Baja California, Mexicali and Tijuana, Mexico. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were performed and fifteen hundred and twelve migrants responded a questionnaire. Results from both in-depth interviews and the analysis of the quantitative data shows the different types of violence experiences by migrants which include threats, verbal abuse, and arbitrary detention based on ethnicity, as well as assaults, beatings and sexual violence. It is crucial to stress the importance and the need to evidence the condition in which migrants' transit to the US and to effectively respond to the violence they experience. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - RESPONSES TO STIGMATIZATION
AN  - 1531931807; 201423377
AB  - The more that devalued group members experience stigmatization, the worse their physical and mental health, well-being, and performance will be. However, the effects of stigmatization are often mixed, weak, and conditional. We should expect such variability in how devalued group members respond to stigmatization because resilience in the face of challenges is possible, depending on how stressful stigmatization is for people. Using the transactional model of stress (Lazarus and Folkman) as an organizing framework, I provide evidence that people will have different reactions to stigmatization depending on primary appraisals-that is, how harmful and self-relevant they appraise it to be-and on secondary appraisals-that is, whether or not they believe that they have the resources to cope with it. My review of the literature suggests that a stronger ingroup identification, stronger identification with a negatively stereotyped domain, chronic beliefs about stigmatization, and beliefs about meritocracy create vulnerabilities to stigmatization because they lead people to appraise stigmatization as more harmful and self-relevant. Furthermore, psychological optimism, a sense of control, self-esteem, as well as high socioeconomic status, a stronger identification with one's ingroup, and positive evaluations of the ingroup create resilience to discrimination because they allow people to perceive themselves as having the resources needed to cope with stigmatization. In conclusion, people will respond to the same potential stressor in different ways, depending on how self-relevant and harmful they perceive it to be and whether or not they perceive themselves as having the resources to cope. Thus, attention should be directed to developing families, communities, institutions, and societies that can provide people with the resources that they need to be resilient.

T1  - Historical memory and present-day oblivion: The Mapuche conflict in post-dictatorial Chile
AN  - 1463010324; 201345892
AB  - The conflict between the Chilean state and the Mapuche ethnic minority, and the history of dispossession of land, discrimination and marginalization go back to the end of the nineteenth century. The Pinochet military dictatorship made matters worse by giving their land away to big forest and hydroelectric enterprises. The end of the dictatorship produced expectations that these historical injustices would be addressed. While the post-dictatorship governments have implemented social assistance and cultural recognition policies, they have continued the economic policies put in place under the dictatorship and have criminalized social protests by sections of the Mapuche community. Meanwhile, Chilean society more broadly has remained indifferent towards the plight of Mapuche because of the pervasive narratives that depict Mapuche as standing outside the nation. Neither the state nor non-indigenous society has resolved their relationship with the Mapuche minority. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - SON PREFERENCE AND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE VICTIMIZATION IN INDIA: EXAMINING THE ROLE OF ACTUAL AND DESIRED FAMILY COMPOSITION
AN  - 906369529; 21756416
AB  - Summary              Son preference has been considered as a determinant of women's risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) experience in India, although quantitative evidence from large nationally representative studies testing this relationship is limited. This study examines the association between husband's son preference, sex composition of children and risk of physical and sexual IPV victimization among wives. Information was collected for 26,284 couples in the nationally representative 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey of India. The exposures were husband's son preference measured as husband's desire for one or more sons greater than the number of daughters and sex composition of the household: only sons, only daughters and mixed. Outcome included past year physical and/or sexual IPV. The results showed that husband's reported son preference (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98-1.13) and sex composition of children were not associated with risk for IPV victimization in the models adjusted for socio-demographic factors. The findings from this first population-based study of socio-cultural norms around son preference and married Indian women's risk for IPV victimization indicate that cultural preference for sons does not influence women's risk for IPV victimization.

T1  - Climate: The Forgotten Culprit. The Ecological Dimension Of The Darfur Conflict
AN  - 1221407760; 201243960
AB  - Even though one cannot deny the importance of the ethnic dimension in the Darfur conflict, it cannot be argued it was the triggering factor of the conflict, but rather has gradually imposed itself more as a consequence of the prolonged conflict than a cause. While the conflict in Darfur is over-determined, and a complex web of triggering factors have contributed to its eruption, this paper argues nevertheless that the conflict which has been going on, with varying intensity, since the early 1980s in the region of Jebel Mara (north Darfur) is in fact an ecological conflict par excellence in which issues of race and ethnicity have been used by the warring parties -- and unfortunately the mainstream western media also -- as mobilizing tools although regrettably they have ended up being ends in themselves.

T1  - Identity and Academic Success among Underrepresented Ethnic Minorities: An Interdisciplinary Review and Integration
AN  - 900190105
AB  - A growing body of literature provides insight into the ingredients for academic success for underrepresented ethnic minority students at all points of the academic pipeline. Theory and research in developmental and social psychology, education, and sociology all point to the important role of identity for students' academic success. The purpose of this article is to review some of the major findings across these social science disciplines to identify points of synergy that can inform effective policy recommendations. The review is structured around three points of convergence across disciplines: (1) prejudice and stereotype threat; (2) the role of social support; and (3) the availability of options for identity development. Reviewing these three topics sheds light on how the relation between identity and academic success in list be understood on individual, relational, and institutional levels of analysis.

T1  - Religious intolerance and Euroscepticism
AN  - 964188845; 201208938
AB  - Research on Euroscepticism focuses increasingly on the role of group identities: national identities and attitudes towards multiculturalism. Yet hardly any attention has been paid to the way in which religious intolerance shapes Euroscepticism. We argue that religious intolerance influences not only diffuse Euroscepticism, but also more specifically opposition to enlargement of the European Union with Turkey. To examine the relationship between religious intolerance and Euroscepticism, this article analyses unique data from two representative surveys conducted in Ireland and the Netherlands. Our findings show that religious intolerance is indeed a powerful determinant of attitudes towards the European Union and that it particularly shapes people's attitudes towards future Turkish enlargement. This study therefore contributes to the literature by demonstrating that social identities are strong determinants of Euroscepticism.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF WOMEN'S STATUS AND COMMUNITY ON THE GENDER DIFFERENTIAL IN CHILDREN'S NUTRITION IN INDIA
AN  - 899273924; 21401977
AB  - Summary              This study uses the third National Family Health Survey (2005-06) in India to investigate whether differences in women's status, both at the individual and community levels, can explain the persistent gender differential in nutritional allocation among children. The results show that girls are less likely than boys to receive supplemental food and more likely to be malnourished. In general it appears that higher women's status within a community, as well as higher maternal status, have beneficial effects on a daughter's nutritional status. Further, the moderating effects of community appear to be more consistent and stronger than the individual-level characteristics. A positive relationship between the percentage of literate women in a community and the gender differential in malnutrition appears to be an exception to the general findings regarding the beneficial nature of women's status on a daughter's well-being, showing the need for more than just basic adult literacy drives in communities to overcome the problem of daughter neglect.

T1  - Associations of Parental and Peer Characteristics with Adolescents' Social Dominance Orientation
AN  - 1037878529; 201233346
AB  - Studies with adults of social dominance orientation (SDO), a preference for inequality among social groups, have found correlations with various prejudices and support for discriminatory practices. This study explores the construct among adolescents at an age when they are beginning to recognize the social groups in their environment, particularly adolescent crowds. The relationship of SDO and perceptions of parents' responsiveness and demandingness were also investigated. Subjects were in grades 9-12 (N = 516, 53% female, 96% White). Mother's and father's responsiveness significantly predicted adolescent's SDO scores, with greater perceived responsiveness associated with lower SDO. To analyze the multiple crowd memberships of the 76% belonging to more than one crowd, two-step cluster analysis was used to identify patterns, resulting in 8 clusters of distinct, heterogeneous composition. SDO differed significantly among males in different clusters, but not females. The importance of membership was positively associated with SDO among high-status crowds and negatively associated with SDO among the academic and normal crowds. The findings have implications for prejudices that may be developing in adolescence and indicate a need for further research into the social context of SDO and its development.

T1  - Measurement of Attitudes Toward Bisexual Men and Women Among South African University Students: The Validation of an Instrument
AN  - 902084401; 201122208
AB  - Research was conducted investigating university students' prejudicial attitudes toward bisexual men and women in South Africa. The combined male and female Attitudes Regarding Bisexuality Scale (ARBS) showed unacceptable internal consistency reliabilities, especially for the Black-African participants. An expert focus group was convened in order to elaborate on and clarify the low reliability coefficients. The ARBS was then adapted for the South African population and resulted in two separate instruments designed to measure attitudes regarding bisexual men and bisexual women separately. Five hundred eighty seven university students completed these scales. The results indicated that the attitudes of heterosexual, homosexual, and asexual students toward bisexual men and women are more negative than the attitudes of bisexual students.

T1  - Black Market, Chinatown, and Kabukicho: Postwar Japanese Constructs of "Overseas Chinese"
AN  - 881469237; 201116479
AB  - Examines three urban sites central to the postwar Japanese imagination of kakyo, or "overseas Chinese." These are black market (yamiichi), Chinatown, and Kabukicho, the demimonde in Shinjuku, Tokyo. All three exist as concrete entities in the real world, including a distinct urban locale or streetscape, a social group, and economic activities. But they are also icons of postwar Japanese experiences of kakyo, which have evolved with the changing circumstances of Japanese society, Japan's relations with China and Taiwan, and the immigrant community. As cultural constructs, these sites denote perceptions and experiences that are based on -- but transcend -- everyday encounters between Japanese and Chinese people. The author argues that Japanese society attributes to the Chinese community stereotypical meanings that reflect first and foremost its own concerns. Further, immigrants are not detached from or passive in the processes of stereotyping: they not only collaborate in the production of relevant images but shape them to their advantage. Finally, it discusses recent moves by host society and immigrant community alike to renegotiate the meaning of kakyo at a time when differences between Japan and China are becoming more pronounced even as bilateral relations are deepening and diversifying.

T1  - Ethnic Context and Immigration Policy Preferences Among Latinos and Anglos
AN  - 862596151; 201109711
AB  - Objective. We examine how the immigration policy preferences of Anglos and Latinos vary according to ethnic context. Specifically, we hypothesize that immigration policy attitudes are a product of both Latino immigrant and Latino native born group size. In contrast to previous work, which found that Latinos and Anglos react to contextual forces in an identical manner, we argue that Latino group size produces opposite reactions for Anglos and Latinos. Methods. These hypotheses are tested using an original state-wide survey of Anglos and Latinos in Texas conducted during 2006, which is supplemented with data from the 2000 Census. Results. Our findings show that residing in a heavily Latino area produces more liberal immigration attitudes among Latinos and more conservative attitudes among Anglos. However, this result is driven not by the size of the foreign-born Latino population, but by the size of the native-born Latino population. Conclusion. Anti-immigrant sentiments among Anglos appear to result, at least in part, from ethnic concerns. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Conflict: The Discursive Construction of "Illegal Immigrants" in a Regional U.S. Newspaper
AN  - 1928170803
AB  - Using an intergroup communication framework, this article examines how a newspaper in southeastern Virginia discursively constructs the "illegal immigrant" as a metonym for Latino immigrants. This mixed methods study traces the development of this newspaper discourse about illegal immigrants from1994 to 2006 using quantitative lexical analysis. It then shows how two local news events further instantiate an illegal immigrant metonymy influencing perceptions of Latinos, subsequent media discourse about immigration, and local immigration policies using critical discourse analysis. The quantitative findings suggest that news discourse focusing on (illegal) immigration tended to use lexical items low in optimism and commonality, consistent with out-group negativity. The qualitative findings show how two incidents involving "illegal immigrants" attached negative stereotypes to this category, which then potentially influenced perceptions of Latinos more broadly. This analysis shows some of the ways that media discourse influences perceived intergroup threats at the local and national levels.

T1  - Missing and Misrepresented: Portrayals of Other Ethnic and Racialized Groups in a Greater Toronto Area Ethnocultural Newspaper
AN  - 1429627688; 201335780
AB  - The vibrant ethnocultural press in the Greater Toronto Area is a testament to the multicultural reality of a metropolitan area where visible minorities are expected to be the majority by 2031. The GTA's ethnocultural and racialized communities are served by more than 200 newspapers, many of them published in languages other than English or French. What role do these publications play in shaping how ethnic and racialized groups "see" each other? This case study examines how other groups are portrayed in the Chinese-language daily newspaper Ming Pao. With the exception of members of the White community, it concludes that other racial and ethnic groups are represented only to a limited extent and that, in some cases, they are also misrepresented.

T1  - Protesting While Black? The Differential Policing of American Activism, 1960 to 1990
AN  - 908527755
AB  - How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time. In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white protest events to be policed. While there is support for a "Protesting While Black" phenomenon, it is not invariant across the entire period of inquiry. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Sovereigns and citizens? The contested status of American Indian tribal nations and their members
AN  - 870431911; 201114314
AB  - American Indian tribal members are citizens of both tribal nations and the larger national body. Tribal nations' contemporary resurgence has made tribal citizenship politically visible, materially significant, and politically contested. Conflicts about tribal members' status are not merely racial or ethnic in character, but reflect fundamental tensions between settler societies and indigenous survivors who challenge national narratives and demand collective rights. Tribal members' dual citizenships and the conflict about them are the result of discordant federal policy legacies, tenacious tribal survival, and the erosion of racial barriers to citizenship. Differences between ethnonational tribal citizenship and republican-based US citizenship fuel public criticism in the context of widespread ignorance about treaties and tribal rights. Crucially, while legal and political dimensions of citizenship have been partly extended to tribal members, they remain excluded from the national identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity and Ethnic Strife. An Interdisciplinary Perspective
AN  - 856403638; 201106891
AB  - The objective of this paper is to present an overview of ethnicity, ethnic strife, and its consequences, as seen from the perspective of the disciplines of economics, political science, social anthropology, and sociology. What exactly is ethnicity-how is it to be defined, characterized, and measured? What exactly are the causal links from ethnicity so defined to its presumed consequences, including tension and violence? What are the feedback loops from the consequences of ethnic divisions back to these divisions themselves? How can policy, if at all, mitigate ethnic divisions and ethnic conflict? Finally, what role does interdisciplinarity have in helping to understand ethnicity and ethnic strife, and how can interdisciplinary collaboration be enhanced? These are the questions which this paper takes up and deals with in sequence. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Contesting Visibilities: Sartorial Strategies Among Muslim Women in Danish Media
AN  - 1081865002; 201235204
AB  - New media technologies and migration networks create a new situation for the Muslim population in Europe. During the past decade Muslims, usually descendants of migrants, have increasingly taken part in media debates in Danish national and interactive media. They blog on the Internet, write in newspapers and partake in televised panel debates. A significant share of these media activists are women and their reflections on clothing and appearance constitute the major part of my argument in this paper. I discuss the clothing style of eight women who identify as Muslim and who have attracted attention in different forms of media; written and visual mass media or individualised interactive media. Beginning with the concept of sartorial strategies, I argue that by entering the Danish media these women challenge what it means to be equal and available for social contact in a Danish public realm. Some do so by considering how to avoid being ascribed negative stereotypes in everyday interaction and by media audiences, and others by choosing a distinct Islamic style of clothing, consequently their visibility as Muslim women is contested. In other words for some, subtle ways of communicating the new presence of active Muslim women in the media is the response, whereas others communicate this presence more distinctly. These strategies constitute a form of conscious impression management, revealing that Muslim women enter the Danish media with caution. Thus, wearing Islamic fashion is a form of micro-politics, a level of politics usually ignored in discussions of Islam in Europe. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The holistic ambition: Social cohesion and the culturalization of citizenship
AN  - 862596131; 201109678
AB  - Policy-making in Europe with respect to migrant population problems builds on an integration--citizenship--social cohesion nexus representing a holistic ambition where each nation state manifests its own presumed national--cultural order as normative. Migrant-related issues thus become couched in idioms focusing on culture, ethnicity and identity. The shortcomings of this approach are discussed with reference to the shape of immigration-related social issues. The article also indicates how the representation of problem issues through the integration--citizenship--social cohesion nexus opens for conflicts, not just between migrants and autochthonous, but also between segments in the host populations. A main argument is made to the effect that we need a much better understanding of how the receiving countries' national and other contingencies shape migrant lives.

T1  - Racial Reconciliation in South Africa: Interracial Contact and Changes over Time
AN  - 743066608; 201043255
AB  - Relying upon Gibson's (2004) theory equating lack of prejudice with interracial 'reconciliation,' we investigate racial attitudes based on a 2004 nationally representative survey of South Africans. We begin by documenting substantial group-based differences in intergroup prejudice, with Blacks being considerably less reconciled with Whites as compared to the three racial minorities' levels of reconciliation with Blacks. We also discover that the Black majority has become less reconciled with Whites over the period from Gibson's survey (in 2001) to the current survey (in 2004). Improvement in racial attitudes is observed among the other three groups. We next investigate intergroup contact as an explanation of differences in attitudes, finding some effects of mere contact and powerful effects of intimate contact. However, the consequences of contact differ across the various racial groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Experiences of Racial Discrimination & Relation to Violence Perpetration and Gang Involvement among a sample of Urban African American Men
AN  - 199567075; 18553221
AB  - Objective To examine racial discrimination and its relation to violence involvement among a sample of urban African American men. Methods Participants of this cross-sectional study were African American men (N = 703) between the ages of 18 and 65 years, recruited from four urban community health centers and two hospital-based clinics within an urban center in the Northeast. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relation of reported racial discrimination to recent perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), street violence involvement, and gang involvement. Racial discrimination was measured via 7 items assessing everyday and lifetime experiences of racial discrimination. Results In logistic regression models adjusted for age and homelessness, men reporting high levels of discrimination (scores above the sample median) were significantly more likely to report IPV perpetration (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.9; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2-2.9) and street violence involvement (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2) as compared to men reporting lower levels of discrimination. No relation was found between experiencing discrimination and gang involvement. Conclusions Findings showcase the potential relevance of racial discrimination to efforts focused on reducing racial disparities related to violence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'Away with the fairies?' Disability within primary-age children's literature
AN  - 743050779; 201031556
AB  - This article outlines the findings of a new study that explores the portrayal of disability within a sample of the primary-age children's literature most readily available to UK schools. The kind of literature to which children are exposed is likely to influence their general perceptions of social life. How disability is handled by authors is therefore important from the standpoint of disability equality. Findings suggest that whilst there are some good examples of inclusive literature 'out there', discriminatory language and/or negative stereotypes about disability continue to be present in a range of more contemporary children's books. Clearly, more still needs to be done to ensure that schools and teachers are provided with information relating to the best examples of inclusion literature and efforts must continue to be made to inform authors, publishers and illustrators about how to approach the issue of disability. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Growing up with a sibling with dwarfism: perceptions of adult non-dwarf siblings
AN  - 743046939; 201031661
AB  - Despite the fact that society seems to have become more tolerant towards human diversity, skeletal dysplasia still carries some extent of stigmatization and negative stereotyping. There seems to be a lack of knowledge regarding psychosocial factors associated with skeletal dysplasia, specifically as it relates to interpersonal relationships. Since the negative attention directed at individuals with dwarfism may also have an impact on family members and family relationships, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore adult non-dwarf siblings' experiences of growing up with siblings with a skeletal dysplasia. Thematic analyses of semi-structured interviews with four adult non-dwarf siblings confirmed both negative and positive effects. These effects were evident in childhood and continued into adulthood. For the adults who took part in this study, the positive effects seemed to be more profound. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - College Students' Racial Attitudes and Friendship Diversity
AN  - 743065835; 201043311
AB  - Using the contact hypothesis as a theoretical framework, this study investigates the relationship between college students' racial attitudes and the diversity in their intercultural friendship networks. The results tend to support a conventional view of racial hierarchy, as students in this study categorized ethnic/racial groups into fairly dichotomized categories of Whites and non-Whites. In addition, students who reported fewer ethnically/racially different friends are more likely to define race by skin color than those who have more diverse friendship networks. Further, White students were more much more likely to see race as defined by skin color than students of color. Overall, results reveal an interesting relationship between these college students' racial attitudes and their friendship choices. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - "Like a Frog in a Well": Young People's Views of the Future Expressed in Two Collaborative Research Projects in Sri Lanka
AN  - 743044860; 201025847
AB  - In a Sri Lankan context of rising youth unemployment, a long ethnic war, and neoliberal economic policies on the re-privatized tea estates, this article discusses two 2004 collaborative research projects with young people that focused on their views of the future. One project, designed by a group of university students, concerned the high rate of unemployment of young adults in Sri Lanka. This was an issue of grave import to the students that was largely unmentioned in national discourses, e.g., electoral rhetoric. The other project concerned the future of young, mostly Tamil, people on tea estates in Sri Lanka. This project was organized in response to the view expressed by middle-aged decision-makers in Sri Lanka's tea industry that young people on the estates will not choose agricultural work in the future. They anticipated a labor shortage in the tea sector, but had not consulted young people directly about their future hopes and plans. Contrary to views attributed to them by others, the young tea estate residents prioritized wage equity over leaving the estates (if given the option to migrate). Where Sri Lankans, especially Tamils, choose to live, or are forced to live, is highly politicized in the current context. The armed conflict may be over, but not the ethnic conflict. Collaborative social science research with young people is vital to understanding the possibilities and challenges in Sri Lanka's future. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Covert Racism and the Formation of Social Capital among a Volunteer Youth Corps
AN  - 1928728124
AB  - In this ethnographic case study, I examine the race-ethnic and educational network patterns of association and subsequent social capital formation of 41 youth volunteers working for a national leadership program. Findings indicate that race-ethnic minority youth are more likely than white youth to cross race-ethnic and educational boundaries in their network (discussion partner) choices. White college-educated men report the highest levels of social capital benefits from their year-long program. White college-educated females, black high-school (and GED only) males, and white high-school males reported relatively lower levels of social capital formation and opportunities, with black males least satisfied with their experiences. The ethnographic data reveal how powerful racial identity is in the formation of social networks. The findings demonstrate the subtle ways in which covert racism continues to shape the reproduction of race-ethnic inequalities even in this civic organization that explicitly seeks to equalize opportunities.
