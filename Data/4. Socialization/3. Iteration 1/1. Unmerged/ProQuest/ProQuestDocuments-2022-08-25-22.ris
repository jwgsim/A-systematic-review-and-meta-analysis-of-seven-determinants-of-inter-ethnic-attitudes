T1  - Elite-level athletes with physical impairments: Barriers and facilitators to sport participation
AN  - 2679591630
AB  - Knowledge of the often-complex psycho-social factors that influence sport participation is important to increase the number of individuals with a physical impairment participating in sport, and simultaneously enhancing social inclusion and community engagement. The present study examined the sporting experiences of ten high-performing Australian athletes with a physical impairment from grassroots to elite-level. The interviews were transcribed, and thematic analysis was performed for data synthesis. Drawing on the theory of self-determination and the social model of disability, the results highlighted increases in wellbeing including improved fitness, social interaction and self-confidence. The athletes identified primary school and high school as highly influential environments in establishing their interest in sport, with these settings also considered as fruitful platforms to support an inclusive culture and education on disability and sport amongst the wider community.Points of InterestCommunity perceptions of disability have long been connected to reduced ability and this can be a barrier to sport participation for those with a physical impairment.Participation rates in sport for individuals with a physical impairment are persistently lower than those who are able-bodied.Sport participation has a positive effect on adapting and adjusting to a physical impairment as well as facilitating social inclusion.Sport participation for those with a physical impairment can promote confidence, independence and a feeling of acceptance.The school curriculum can enable pathways for sport participation among individuals with a physical impairment and create early positive experiences.Developing school curricula to include disability-sport can facilitate awareness for all students. Long term this can assist to reduce negative stereotypes and promote social inclusion.

T1  - Whites’ Racial Resentment and Perceived Relative Discrimination Interactively Predict Participation
AN  - 2654886595
AB  - Scholarship in American politics finds whites’ racial resentment and status threat predict their vote choice. However, research in social identity indicates that such variables should negatively correlate with participation, attenuating resentful whites’ political power. We resolve this contradiction by studying these variables interactively, using data from the 2012, 2016, and 2020 American National Election Studies. Our primary independent variables are racial resentment and a measure of relative discrimination that captures whites’ perceptions of inequality relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Both constituent variables are negatively associated with participation. Interactively, they are positively associated with political participation. These relationships persist when we predict voter turnout, an index measuring non-electoral participation, and an index measuring civic engagement. In 2012, our interaction term moderates the negative impact of racial resentment in relative discrimination. In elections contested by Donald Trump, our interaction term has a positive substantive effect. Our findings advance scholarship on white political behavior. First, they identify a relationship between whites’ racial attitudes and participation, advancing a research program that primarily examines vote choice. Second, they clarify the relationship between different white racial attitudes. Next, they detail the conditional relationship between whites’ prejudice and politics and how it has changed over time.

T1  - Feeling Invisible and Unheard: A Qualitative Exploration of Gendered-Racist Stereotypes Influence on Sexual Decision Making and Mistreatment of Black Teen Girls
AN  - 2669997833
AB  - Gendered racism can impact how Black teen girls perceive themselves in relation to the world and influence their behaviors. This form of discrimination tends to manifest in stereotypes that promote the victimization and mistreatment of Black teen girls. This qualitative study, using Black feminist thought through a Black Girlhood lens as a guiding framework, aims to understand how Black teen girls are affected by gendered-racist stereotypes and how these stereotypes impact sexual decision making among this group. Using a sample of (N = 27) Black teen girls, three major themes arose: (1) experiencing the effects of racist-sexist stereotypes, (2) feeling powerless and invisible due to stereotypes, and (3) navigating the pressure to have sex due to stereotypes. Implications for this study include incorporating elements of Black Feminist Thought through a Black girlhood lens within prevention programing while also providing Black teen girls with the tools to challenge negative stereotypes with support from adult allies in school and family settings.

T1  - Is Emma or Liam the Top Scorer in Math? The Effects of a Counter-Stereotypical Role Model on Math Achievement
AN  - 2663831922
AB  - From 2015 to 2018, the math gender gap decreased primarily due to a decline in boys' performances (OECD, 2015, 2016, 2018). However, there is ample evidence that girls continue to be negatively stereotyped in math. Using a longitudinal design, we examined whether prolonged exposure to a counter-stereotypical role model embodied by a female top math scorer may prevent other girls in the class from experiencing stereotype threat. Multilevel analyses were conducted among 1,043 6th graders nested in 46 math classes. There was a decline in math performance throughout the school year for all students, but being a girl had a buffering effect against this decline. The results failed to support the main effect hypothesis (H1) which anticipated that student gender and top math scorer gender would be associated with student math achievement when jointly considered. The results supported the cross-level interaction hypothesis (H2) which anticipated that the greatest benefits would emerge for girls exposed to a counter-stereotypical role model; that is, in a class whose top math scorer was a girl. These results offer new insights regarding the extent to which a counter-stereotypical role model embodied by the top math scorer may influence differences in math performances.

T1  - Why and when do citizens support populist right-wing social movements? Development and test of an integrative theoretical model
AN  - 2658419097
AB  - What are the microlevel mechanisms that explain citizens’ support of populist social movements? We address this question by focusing on the ‘PEGIDA’ (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident) protest groups in Germany, which became particularly prominent by attracting large numbers of attendees in street protests during the years 2015/16. We develop and test an integrative theoretical model that points to the key roles of anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction as mediators linking subjective socioeconomic deprivation with citizens’ support of the ‘Pegida’-movement. Equally important, this model holds that citizens’ political dissatisfaction moderates the nexus between anti-immigrant attitudes and support for ‘Pegida’. The results based on data from seven cross-sectional general population surveys provide clear support for these predictions. Combined, these efforts help to advance scholarly understanding of not only why, but also how and under what conditions non-activist citizens support anti-immigrant collective action as exemplified by the ‘Pegida’ movement.

T1  - “Condemned to Disappear”: Indigenous Genocide in Tierra del Fuego
AN  - 2627037866
AB  - Nation state building, competing sovereign claims, the capitalist drive for land and resources fuelled by international market forces and prevalent racial ideologies can be identified as major structural factors that leads to the dispossession of indigenous lands and in many cases to the physical destruction of indigenous peoples. In this context settler colonial studies continues to work towards a theory of settler colonialism. This article contributes to these debates by examining the genocide of the Selk’nam in Tierra del Fuego through the lens of extinction discourse. It analyses the way that extinction discourse emerged as an explanatory – and exculpatory – narrative for the fast diminishing numbers of the Selk’nam not only among officials and settlers uninterested in their fates, but also among the missionaries engaged in humanitarian efforts to save them. In particular the relationship between negative stereotypes of primitiveness and savagery and the settler process constitute a major point of analytical inquest. This epistemological ambition means that this article is textually based and as such relies on displaying a selection of texts in their original forms contextualised within the history of settler colonialism. It concludes by suggesting that understanding and challenging the role and pervasiveness of social Darwinist discourses on extinction remains a central issue in understanding settler genocides and a challenge for promoting the recognition of indigenous identities and rights.

T1  - So much to offer: an exploration of learning and cultural wealth with Roma Slovak post-16 students
AN  - 2643176997
AB  - The newly arrived Roma Slovak community in a large urban city in the north of England has been widely perceived as having a myriad of social problems and there is a conflict with the wider community. This paper presents the results of a project to explore barriers and possibilities for the social and educational integration of newly arrived Roma Slovak migrants in the UK. The research carried out ethnographic fieldwork in a post-16 service for young people, using a CRT approach based on Yosso’s community cultural wealth model. The paper also applies an intersectional analysis and problematises assumptions that portray Roma communities as homogeneous, marginalised, and uncritically family oriented. The findings recover the voices and perspectives of the Roma Slovak community from a critical, though positive, perspective. The Roma Slovak students’ stories that emerged from this research are in stark contrast to the negative stereotypes commonly shared about the community.

T1  - Indios, Negros, and Criollos: The Racial Anxieties of Argentine Yiddish
AN  - 2624693683
AB  - This article analyzes discourses of Latin American race and ethnicity in the context of the ethnic language production ofa transnational immigrant group: Yiddish-speaking Jews in Argentina. Argentine Yiddish writings have been analyzed in previous scholarship as an offshoot of a global Yiddish culture that entered a marked decline as immigrants culturally assimilated in the 1930s. By contrast, this article analyzes the presence of nationa a tropes and racial stereotypes in Yiddish-language materials after 1930 to argue that immigrants engaged with the changing ethnic and racial landscape of mid-century Argentina. In a context of heightened race and class anxiety spurred by Creole mass migration to cities, these authors used Yiddish to reproduce and reinforce-and in some cases, to contest-negative stereotypes of Indigenous and Creole Argentines. In doing so, they reflected and appropriated a Spanish-language discourse that racialized poor and dark-skinned people, aligning Jewish Argentines with a white middle class.

T1  - Does Emotional Expression Moderate Implicit Racial Bias? Examining Bias Following Smiling and Angry Primes
AN  - 2582220218
AB  - Given the pervasiveness of prejudice, researchers have become increasingly interested in examining racial bias at the intersection of race and other social and perceptual categories that have the potential to disrupt these negative attitudes. Across three studies, we examined whether the emotional expression of racial exemplars would moderate implicit racial bias. We found that racial bias on the Affect Misattribution Procedure only emerged in response to angry but not smiling Black male faces in comparison to White (Study 1) or White and Asian (Study 3) male faces with similar emotional expressions. Racial bias was also found toward Asian targets (Studies 2 and 3), but not only following angry primes. These findings suggest that negative stereotypes about Black men can create a contrast effect, making racial bias toward smiling faces less likely to be expressed in the presence of angry Black male faces.

T1  - Securing self‐integrity over time: Self‐affirmation disrupts a negative cycle between psychological threat and academic performance
AN  - 2574948669
AB  - Adolescence can be a tumultuous period with numerous threats to self‐integrity. A 3‐year field experiment tested whether repeated affirmations of self‐integrity can help lessen the impact of psychological threat on adolescent (11–14 years old) students’ core course GPA over time. A diverse cohort of students (N = 163) was randomly assigned to a control condition or to an affirmation condition, in which teachers repeatedly administered classroom writing exercises that affirmed students’ personal values. Results showed that affirmation lessened a downward trajectory of GPA over time. In contrast to previous research, this effect occurred among all ethnic groups rather than only among stereotype‐threatened ethnic minority groups. Affirmation did not reduce self‐reported psychological threat, but it severed its relationship with performance: Among control students, psychological threat predicted lower GPA. Among affirmed students, psychological threat was unrelated to performance. Beyond their practical implications, these results make two theoretical contributions. First, affirmation can have broader benefits than those previously documented among negatively stereotyped groups, if timed to co‐occur with different sources of threat that emerge over a long developmental window. Second, the effect of affirmation may not be so much to reduce threat as to disrupt its adverse cognitive and motivational effects.

T1  - Divergent perceptions of Muslim Americans on being stereotyped as terrorists
AN  - 2555237718
AB  - Being labeled as terrorists has been one of the primary negative stereotypes used against Muslims in the USA. Muslim Americans are very diverse coming from different ethnic, historical, and cultural backgrounds. They belong to various religious schools of thought and practice, as well as branches of Islam. Differences among this diverse group stipulate different perceptions of being stereotyped as terrorists, which was at large ignored by previous research. I use data from the 2011 Pew Religion and Public Life Survey (N = 806), to analyze differences among various Muslim American racial/ethnic groups in perceptions of being stereotyped as terrorists. Black, Asian, and Hispanic Muslims report a few times lower odds of being viewed as terrorists than white Muslims (respondents having origins primarily in the Middle East or North Africa). Compared to conservatives, moderates and liberal Muslims are more likely to name ‘viewed as terrorists’ among the most important problem facing Muslims living in the USA today. Among acculturation and socio-demographic correlates, nativity was associated with being viewed as terrorists. Using the Muslim case, the study identifies different positions in perceptions of stereotypes and challenges the stereotypical approach of constructing a population identity as homogeneous.

T1  - Increasing understanding of the aspirations and expectations of Roma students
AN  - 2577604675
AB  - It is estimated that only approximately 20 percent of adult European Roma have attained higher than primary education. Scholars have identified different potential causes of the unfavourable school outcomes achieved by Roma students. Cultural differences between the (traditional) way of life in Roma families and the values professed by the mainstream society are often blamed for high dropout rates and the low educational attainment of Roma. Yet there is also a group of researchers who disagree with this, and suggest that it is more to do with economic and other differences. Our empirical study is based on a large representative sample of UNDP/WB/EC Regional Roma Survey conducted in twelve European countries. We show that, on average, Roma respondents (in comparison to non-Roma) express remarkably lower levels of educational aspirations for children. However, these differences diminish considerably when controlling for common individual and household characteristics, and again when including culture proxies. Consequently, our study contributes to questioning one of the negative stereotypes about the distinctiveness of Roma and their culture in relation to education.

T1  - The Stigma of ADHD: Teacher Ratings of Labeled Students
AN  - 2501804883
AB  - Despite the increasing prevalence of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), little sociological research has focused on effects of diagnosis in schools. This study, which is grounded in the modified labeling approach, relies on three waves of Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K:2011) data to determine if teachers evaluate the academic performance of ADHD students as less promising than non-diagnosed peers. Results indicate that teachers are more likely to rate ADHD students as performing below grade level and are less likely to acknowledge these students as performing above grade level—regardless of demonstrated ability on subject-specific tests. The latter finding is, in part, a function of real and/or perceived behaviors in the classroom that inform teachers’ grade-level performance ratings. We argue that diagnosis may be a double-edged sword for children and their families, as it can provide access to special resources in the school but may activate teachers’ negative stereotypes about diagnosed students.

T1  - Examining Christians’ Reactions to Reminders of Religion–Science Conflict: Stereotype Threat versus Disengagement
AN  - 2491565576
AB  - Stereotypes of religion (particularly Christianity) as incompatible with science are widespread, and prior findings show that Christians perform worse than non-Christians on scientific reasoning tasks following reminders of such stereotypes. The present studies (N = 1,456) examine whether these reminders elicit stereotype threat (i.e., fear of confirming negative societal stereotypes about one’s group), disengagement (i.e., distancing oneself from a domain perceived as incongruent with the values of one’s group), or both. In Studies 1 and 2, Christians demonstrated lower task performance and greater subjective feelings of stereotype threat (but did not spend less time on the task) relative to non-Christians when beliefs about Christianity–science incompatibility were chronic or made salient. Furthermore, the effects of incompatibility stereotypes on performance were most pronounced among Christians who identified strongly with science and hence worried most about confirming negative stereotypes (Studies 3–4). Implications for Christians’ responses to religion–science conflict narratives and participation in science are discussed.

T1  - Immigrants' ethnic provocation in the art created by the Russian-Israeli Generation 1.5
AN  - 2469015327
AB  - This article explores the political relevance of popular artistic productions by immigrants and the links between art and identity politics in the context of Israel. I propose the term ethnic provocation as an analytical tool for understanding the role of immigrant artists’ critical stance in their new society, and the anti-hegemonic spirit they advance. I examine the work of immigrant artists, members of the Russian-Israeli Generation 1.5, who came to Israel as children. The provocative art created by these immigrants tackles four different aspects of their ethnic identity: the stereotype of Russian speaking women as “sluts”, the religious-nationalist view of ex-Soviet Jews as gentiles, presentation of them as foreigners who do not belong in the Jewish state and their ambiguous location on the Israeli ethnic map. The article argues that ethnic provocation aims at resisting the negative stereotypes and exclusion of immigrants, and at challenging the ethnic hegemony in the host society.

T1  - Got Skillz? Recasting and Negotiating Racial Tension in Teacher–Student Relationships Amidst Shifting Demographics
AN  - 2504359477
AB  - This paper reports on a curriculum designed for Black students whose school teachers and administrators sought to address concerns about students’ academic underachievement and behavioral challenges. In order to design the curriculum, we examined Black students’ reactions to race- and academic-related stress as a result of their interactions with mostly White teachers and peers in an increasingly diversifying predominantly White, middle-class community. Grounded in principles of Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST), a paradigm for understanding the racial coping strategies utilized by individuals to contend with racial stress and well-being, the study sought to elucidate racial tensions found in schooling relationships that foster racial disparities in classrooms. Specifically, our team conducted focus group sessions with Black parents and students which were guided by our use of the Cultural and Racial Experiences of Socialization Survey (CARES), a racial and ethnic socialization measure that elicits responses from students about the kinds of messages students receive about race and ethnicity from people parents and teachers. Data from the sessions subsequently informed the design of Let’s Talk? (LT), a racial conflict resolution curriculum for Black adolescents. In this paper, we share what we learned about students’ school experiences and coping mechanism through their participation in LT.

T1  - Teaching Note—Exploring Podcast-Facilitated Course Work on Racism
AN  - 2487676701
AB  - Social work educators teach cultural competency and guide students to understand and address racism. Using mixed methods, we explored the influence of a one-semester course on racial attitudes, skills, and knowledge among 10 diverse undergraduate students. The Seeing White podcast delivered content about historic and systemic race-based oppression and discrimination in American society. Students participated in seminars, maintained reflective journals, and wrote a self-analysis paper to integrate learning. Findings indicate increased knowledge and understanding of key concepts and a commitment to respond to institutional racism. Implications for social work education suggest the need for humility and a willingness for educators and institutions to share power. Ideas for course work on racism are provided.

T1  - Intergenerational family conflict and ethnic identity among Chinese American college students
AN  - 2485544543
AB  - There has been a call for increased attention to experiences of sociocultural contexts and their role in mental health and help-seeking among specific subgroups of Asian Americans (Leong, Park, & Kalibatseva, 2013). In particular, as suggested by the integrative contextual framework of minority youth development (García Coll & Marks, 2012), racial minority adolescents and emerging adults develop identity and psychological well-being through their experiences within multiple contexts. Guided by this perspective, the present study examined the role of specific developmental and contextual factors (e.g., acculturation-based intergenerational family conflict and ethnic identity) on depressive and anxiety symptoms and help-seeking attitudes among Chinese American college students. One-hundred and 73 Chinese American college students (132 women and 36 men) from various geographic regions in the U.S. completed a series of questionnaires administered online, assessing acculturation-based intergenerational family conflict, ethnic identity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and help-seeking attitudes. The findings indicated that the seriousness of acculturation-based intergenerational family conflict and the commitment dimension of ethnic identity were associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, the exploration dimension of ethnic identity was associated with less favorable attitudes toward seeking help from mental health professionals. There was no association between acculturation-based intergenerational family conflict and help-seeking attitudes. The findings underscore the importance of developing culturally informed interventions that attend to the intensity of family conflict and one's sense of connection to ethnic community in the college context.

T1  - “It's Nothing to be Ashamed of, I'm Like, I'm Bisexual and I Love Women, I Like Men” - Being a Bisexual Person with an Intellectual Disability
AN  - 2470588821
AB  - Despite increasingly liberal attitudes in the UK, people who identify as bisexual face unique challenges from both mainstream society and within the LGBTQ + community. Negative stereotypes persist surrounding bisexuality, such as people are confused or hiding their ‘true’ sexual orientation as a gay man or a lesbian. No research explores the experiences of bisexual people with an intellectual disability. However, LGBTQ + people with an intellectual disability are a minority and potentially face double discrimination. Eight bisexual people with intellectual disabilities took part in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences. Participants' narratives were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. The study highlighted that being bisexual was an essential part of their identity. They experienced the same challenges, such as biphobia, as bisexual people without an intellectual disability. Participants were fearful of disclosing their sexuality to family, friends or their support staff, but overall, this has been a positive experience by enabling individuals to be their authentic self. Participants’ sexuality could pose challenges within their intimate relationships if their partner was not also bisexual. The research highlights the importance of LGBTQ + support groups to people with intellectual disabilities as a safe space to explore their identity, build connections with peers and provide support to integrate within the LGBTQ + scene. There is a clear need for those supporting people with intellectual disabilities to have training surrounding bisexuality and the distinct issues that this group can face.

T1  - Fear, Institutionalized Racism, and Empathy: The Underlying Dimensions of Whites’ Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2451352086
AB  - For nearly 75 years, scholars of American public opinion have sought to measure whites’ attitudes toward blacks: social scientists have invented and revised ways to measure what we could refer to as “racial prejudice.” With each revision, scholars who believe they have captured new forms of racial animus are met with opposition from those who believe that old-fashioned anti-black affect is a thing of the past. We directly answer these claims by collecting a surfeit of attitudinal measures to simultaneously estimate the relationship between cognitive beliefs about the racial status quo and emotional reactions to racism. First, we uncover that two higher-order dimensions undergird whites’ racial attitudes. Second, we validate a four-item version of our new battery using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study.

AB  - Une tradition d’innovation: Les Annales dans le paysage transnational des revues d’histoire, 1990-2020Cet essai examine les Annales au prisme de revues d’histoire comparables et, parfois, concurrentes. En se concentrant sur leurs choix éditoriaux, notamment sur les titres de leurs numéros spéciaux et thématiques, il met en évidence la circulation transversale et transnationale des approches et des sujets de recherche. Une dizaine de revues provenant de différents pays sont analysées sur les trente dernières années ; elles partagent avec les Annales une même pratique, celle d’afficher leurs ambitions conceptuelles et leurs choix thématiques par le biais de mots-clefs et de titres. Considérées ensemble, ces revues d’histoire construisent un vaste texte où se trame l’agenda de l’historiographie internationale. De nouveaux thèmes de recherche comme la micro-histoire, l’histoire du quotidien, les identités religieuses et ethniques, les relations genrées et les inégalités sociales ou encore l’histoire globale et le changement climatique sont ainsi mis en circulation dans le dialogue et la compétition. Au sein de ce paysage dynamique, les Annales ont poursuivi et maintenu leur tradition d’innovation.Alternate abstract:This essay looks at the Annales through the lens of similar (and sometimes rival) history journals. In focusing on their editorial choices, in particular on the titles of special and thematic issues, the transversal and transnational circulation of approaches and research subjects is highlighted. About a dozen journals from several countries are analyzed over the last thirty years. They share with the Annales the practice of announcing their conceptual ambitions as well as their thematic choices through keywords and headings. Considered together, these history journals collectively construct a vast, interwoven text that traces the agenda of international historiography. New themes like microhistory or the study of the everyday, religious and ethnic identities, gender relations and social inequality, global history and climate change are circulated through dialogue and competition. In this dynamic landscape, the Annales have pursued and upheld their tradition of innovation.

T1  - Psychological well-being of people living near landfills: preliminary case study in Indonesia
AN  - 2499000012
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore the psychological well-being of people living around landfills, which constitutes a preliminary case study localized in Samarinda city, Indonesia.Design/methodology/approachThis current study used a descriptive, participatory case study design. For data collection, interviews and participatory observation were used. Specifically, this case study took place in Samarinda City, Indonesia.FindingsThe psychological well-being of the people living around landfills was indicated very low in the light of psychological well-being such as personal growth, life’s goals and self-acceptance dimensions.Research limitations/implicationsPsychological well-being is part of an attitude of gratitude, thus making individuals happy and satisfied in life. The results of this study point to the fact that people who live around landfills have low psychological well-being due to lack of support from the community and government. In addition, with this research, people who live near landfills are very happy because they feel cared for and care about their condition. People who live near landfills expect the government and surrounding communities to know about their situation so that they become prosperous and well-being. In addition, providing medical team services, sending clean water and providing good solutions can help people who live near landfills. The limitation of this preliminary study was that researchers could deeply explore the lives of people in the next research. Besides, the next research can provide a camera or voice recorder in the state of only observation. In addition, the researcher can analyze more deeply in the next research. The final limitation was that participants could not have enough time to interact with, thus, the researcher could not collect the data to explore further.Practical implicationsBase on the result in this study, the government needs to have the policy to take care of those people who stay near landfills, for example, improving drinking water, establish the health management and giving a right to people to stay near landfills.Social implicationsBy improving the growing environment, the people live near landfills can have some changes in their life. In addition, the negative stereotype and prejudice can be decreased and establish a more friendly society and increasing their well-being.Originality/valueThe participants were found to be problematic, primarily in managing their environment and influencing their personal growth. On top of that, the participants appeared to possess a lack exposure of to social interaction with other communities, which might cause them social gap and lack of caring perceived toward the surrounding environment, lack of better life’s goals, the disappointment of current conditions due to low educational and skill backgrounds. Nonetheless, the participants were still of gratefulness upon the situation for they were still granted health for studies to support their families. Besides, the participants did not show any positive attitudes toward themselves because of the disappointment of their condition and personal qualities.

T1  - Young immigrants in Norway: The role of national and ethnic identity in immigrants’ integration
AN  - 2371781076
AB  - The present work investigates the endorsement, antecedents, relationships, and consequences of young immigrants’ social identities in Norway. Despite increasing numbers of refugees and immigrants entering Norway in recent years, little is known about the relationship between immigrants’ different social identities and their feeling of integration into Norwegian society. The main goal of the present research is to fill this gap by investigating whether relationships found in other European countries replicate in the Norwegian context. In line with theoretical considerations and earlier international findings, results from two studies with different immigrant groups (Study 1: high school students; N = 97; Study 2: university students; N = 93) show that the more young immigrants in Norway endorse their national (i.e., Norwegian) identity, the less they endorse their ethnic identity (e.g., Kurdish). We further show that perceived conflict between the two cultures cannot explain the negative relationship between national and ethnic identity. In addition, immigrants’ national identity endorsement is positively related to their dual identity endorsement (e.g., Kurdish‐Norwegian). Positive contact with members of the receiving society predicts young immigrants’ feeling of being integrated in Norwegian society and this relationship is mediated by national identity. Results are discussed in terms of the crucial role social identities play in immigrants’ feeling of integration into European societies.

T1  - Intercultural contacts and acculturation resources among International students in Australia: A mixed-methods study
AN  - 2419121295
AB  - This paper explores the impact of acculturation conditions, orientations and outcomes on international students in Australia’s tertiary education sector. Specifically, we investigate the factors that facilitate or hinder acculturation of international students within a multidimensional acculturation context (Arends-Tóth & van de Vijver, 2006). We used a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design in two studies to investigate acculturation of international students at an Australian university and test how these factors are related to psychological and sociocultural outcomes. In Study 1, we conducted a generic qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with a conventional content analyses approach,which compared the experiences of international students who on average had high numbers of positive experiences versus those who had high numbers of negative experiences. We found that a support network of mixed-nationals, and especially host locals, facilitates positive psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and buffers acculturative stress. Study 2 quantitatively tested the association of factors found in Study 1 (perceived stereotypes, intercultural and ethnic network/resources) with psychological and sociocultural acculturation outcomes. Study 2, shows that perceived negative stereotypes loosen ties with the dominant (host) culture and reinforces ties with the ethnic (non-host) culture. The social resources associated with either culture was found to be useful for acculturation, with both independently contributing to participant well-being. Contact with host locals played a particularly crucial role in developing these resources. Our findings provide foundations for pragmatic policy implications, suggesting value in the development of formally organized contact programs in the early sojourn experience of international students.

(з головним акцентом на аналізі даних останнього опитування), які були виконані співробітниками сектору міграційних досліджень Інституту демографії та соціальних досліджень ім. М.В. Птухи НАН України (Київ). Ключовими цілями статті є: 1) виявлення особливостей міжетнічних взаємовідносин у київських закладах вищої освіти; 2) визначення ставлення київських студентів-українців до іноземців; 3) оцінка характеру змін у ставленні київських студентів-українців до іноземців протягом останніх десяти років. Новизна дослідження: уперше розраховано індекс інтолерантності за авторською методикою та здійснено порівняльний аналіз результатів декількох хвиль опитувань київських студентів. Порівняння результатів опитування 2018 року з попередніми опитуваннями вказало на покращення ставлення студентів закладів вищої освіти столиці до іноземців: зменшення конфліктності, підвищення рівня та частоти комунікативності між іноземцями та студента миукраїнцями, зростання дружності у міжетнічних взаємовідносинах. Після розрахунку індексу інтолерантності та індексу ксенофобії з'ясовано основні чинники, що впливають на ставлення українських студентів до іноземців: стать респондента, досвід та частота спілкування респондентів з іноземцями, місцевість проживання респондента до вступу у заклад вищої освіти. В результаті побудови комплексного профілю ставлення київських студентів до іноземців було ідентифіковано п'ять кластерів за характером сприйняття різних етнічних груп. Установлено, що попри загальне покращення ставлення київських студентів-українців до іноземців за останнє десятиліття у студентському середовищі відбулося формування негативних ксеностереотипів, які межу ють із расизмом та релігійною нетерпимістю, що вимагає негайної протидії шляхом просвітницької роботи. З'ясовано, що на можливість інтегрування іноземців до українського суспільства впливає соціально-економічна і геополітична ситу ація в Україні, імміграційна криза в Європі та вітчизняний і зарубіжний медіаконтент.Alternate abstract:Th e article analyses the data of several sociological surveys of Ukrainian students in Kyiv in 2005, 2009 and 2018 (with the main focus on the analysis of the data of the last survey), which were conducted by the staff of the department for migration studies (Institute for Demography and Social Studies, Kyiv). Th e key goals of the paper are to identify the features of interethnic relations at institutions of higher education in Kyiv; to determine the attitude of Ukrainian students in Kyiv to foreigners; to assess the character of changes in the attitude of Ukrainian students in Kyiv to foreigners for the last decade. Novelty of research: in the article, the intolerance index was calculated by the author's method and performed a comparative analysis of the results of several waves of Kyiv student surveys. Comparison of the results of the survey in 2018 with previous polls indicated an improvement in the attitude of students at institutions of higher education of the capital towards foreigners - reducing confl ict, increasing the level and frequency of communication between foreigners and students, increasing friendship in interethnic relations and so on. Also, aft er the intolerance index and xenophobia index were calculated, it was found out the main factors infl uencing the attitude of Ukrainian students to foreigners, such as the respondent's gender, the experience and frequency of respondents' communication with foreigners, the respondent's place of residence before admission to the institution of higher education. As a result of building a complex profile of the attitude of Kyiv students to foreigners, it was identified 5 clusters of nations by the character of the perception of diff erent ethnic groups. It has been established that despite the general improvement in the attitude of Ukrainian students in Kyiv to foreigners for the past decade, negative xenostereotypes have formed in the student environment that border on racism and religious intolerance, which is alarming and requires immediate opposition through educational work. It has been found out that the possibility of integrating foreigners into Ukrainian society is infl uenced by the socio-economic and geopolitical situation in Ukraine, the immigration crisis in Europe, domestic and foreign media content.

T1  - Bisexuality, Bad Girls, and Bullying
AN  - 2381948706
AB  - Bisexual-identified students face ongoing challenges such as denial of their identity, negative stereotypes, biphobia, and sexual harassment at school. Stigma and denial of bisexuality contribute to the erasure and invisibility of bisexual people, resulting in limited role models and positive representation for bisexual youth. Based on three years of ethnographic research in a U.S. public high school, this article examines how social regulation of gender and sexuality work to reinforce notions of proper femininity and uphold cis-heteronormativity.

T1  - Generational change and attitudes to immigration
AN  - 2376777343
AB  - This paper examines the extent to which generational change is likely to be producing attitude change on the issue of immigration in Europe. Using multi-level modelling on seven rounds of the European Social Survey (2002–2014) and 16 European countries, we investigate the question of whether there are significant differences in anti-immigration sentiment between cohorts of Europeans, focusing on the roles that education and far-right mobilisation are likely to play in the process of generational change. The paper’s findings indicate that it is the most educated amongst the youngest cohorts who appear to be persistently more positive about immigration, even controlling for aging processes, but this combined effect of cohort and education diminishes for younger cohorts socialised in the context of a strong far-right anti-immigration presence. Thus, generational-change-induced attitude change in the realm of immigration attitudes may be occurring but this is likely to be dependent on individuals having adequate education skills to process the vast changes brought by immigration; in contexts where the far-right is likely to be mobilising anti-immigration sentiment these education skills appear to have a more limited impact on attitudes to immigration.

T1  - Refugees in the media: Exploring a vicious cycle of frustrated psychological needs, selective exposure, and hostile intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2310141562
AB  - Two research objectives underlay the present research. First, we tested how frustrated psychological needs caused by the refugee‐influx influence the endorsement and selection of refugee‐relevant information. Second, we tested how information selection processes contribute to the development of exclusionary attitudes that counteract the integration of refugees into host countries. In a laboratory study (n = 181), frustrated psychological needs decreased participants’ endorsement of a refugee‐friendly essay (vs. a control essay). Additionally, frustrated needs led to a biased selection of refugee‐hostile over refugee‐friendly information and such selection biases, in turn, predicted higher levels of ingroup defense and prejudice toward refugees. The findings imply that host societies’ receptiveness to refugees is influenced by the maintenance of basic psychological needs.

T1  - Caught between sympathy and suspicion: journalistic perceptions and practices of telling asylum seekers’ personal stories
AN  - 2296048924
AB  - Personal stories in news reports serve multiple purposes, but at their core lie efforts at illustrating and authenticating a social or political issue through human experience, an illustration that is compelling in its affective appeal. Telling the personal stories of people belonging to minority groups may work as a potent journalistic vehicle in countering negative stereotypes and prejudices against them. This article examines how Finnish journalists incorporate the personal stories of asylum seekers into their coverage of the so-called ‘European refugee crisis’ of 2015–2016. Drawing on qualitative interviews, we inquire into how journalists understand the meaning and purpose of asylum seekers’ personal stories in their news reporting and reflect on the professional values and ethical dilemmas when telling them. Our findings reveal that while journalists tend to sympathise with the vulnerable and see it as important to combat xenophobia and racism, their relationship with asylum seekers becomes increasingly informed and constrained by socio-political and discursive structures that foster a culture of suspicion towards asylum seekers.

T1  - Catholic heritage, ethno-racial self-identification, and prejudice against Haitians in the Dominican Republic
AN  - 2264601271
AB  - Latin American cultures are significantly influenced by Catholicism, which partially but meaningfully represents the European legacy that situates Latin American societies into the Western world. This influence may be particularly relevant in the Dominican Republic, where local discourses have underlined the role of Catholicism as an essential characteristic of the Dominican identity. In this study, I use nationally- and regionally-representative survey data to examine whether Catholic self-identification is directly associated with self-identifications that downplay individuals' own Afro characteristics, and whether individuals who self-identify as Catholic are significantly prejudiced against Haitians. I find regional-level evidence of direct associations between Catholic self-identification and self-identifications that downplay Afro characteristics. I also find national- and regional-level evidence of direct associations between Catholic self-identification and different indicators of prejudice against Haitians. These findings reveal the prevailing influence of Catholicism on ethno-racial self-identification and anti-Haitian sentiment in the Dominican Republic.

TT  - Zemljišče kot kazalnik nacionalnih politik do (naravnih) virov: primer distribucije prostorskih virov v Izraelu
AN  - 2336267379
AB  - This interdisciplinary geo-spatial overview represents a conceptual foundation for policy research concerning allocations of public commodities as represented by land (settlement) resources. Principles of collective vs. individual rights to benefit from these may pose moral dilemmas for decision-makers. Such a conflict of interests could prompt 'ambiguous' governing decisions that lack clear directives for implementation. The resulting policies might support declarations of multicultural inclusivity while embracing exclusive ethnic communities. A case in point is the Israeli spatial policy on Arab and Ultra-Orthodox minority groups, analysed using primary and secondary sources and statistical data relating to political affiliations, income, housing costs and locational preferences. If land is an adequate indicator of ambiguous resource-based issues, further analyses should define how socio-spatial distributions are decided and at which particular stages of the policy process.Alternate abstract:Ta interdisciplinarni geografsko-prostorski pregled predstavlja konceptualno podlago za raziskovanje politik dodeljevanja naravnih dobrin na primeru poselitvenih (prostorskih) virov. Načela kolektivnih nasproti individualnim pravicam do teh virov lahko postavljajo moralne dileme za tiste, ki o tem odločajo. Takšen konflikt interesov lahko spodbuja ?dvoumno? odločanje, če ni jasnih smernic za izvajanje distributivnih politik, ki bi bile usposobljene za izvajanje podpor večkulturne jivosti etnično izključujočim skupinam. Obravnavan je primer izraelske poselitvene (prostorske) politike glede arabskih in ultraortodoksnih manjšinskih skupin. Analiza je podprta z uporabo primarnih in sekundarnih virov ter statističnih podatkov o politični pripadnosti, dohodku, stanovanjskih stroških in lokacijskih preferencah. Če je zemljišče primeren kazalnik za sicer politično dvoumno zastavljene družbeno-prostorske dileme o naravi virov, bi morale nadaljnje procesualne analize politik pokazati, kako in na katerih stopnjah se sprejemajo odločitve o distribuciji zemljiških (prostorskih) virov.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore whether face recognition technology – as it is intensely used by state and local police departments and law enforcement agencies – is racism free or, on the contrary, is affected by racial biases and/or racist prejudices, thus reinforcing overall racial discrimination.Design/methodology/approachThe study investigates the causal pathways through which face recognition technology may reinforce the racial disproportion in enforcement; it also inquires whether it further discriminates black people by making them experience more racial discrimination and self-identify more decisively as black – two conditions that are shown to be harmful in various respects.FindingsThis study shows that face recognition technology, as it is produced, implemented and used in Western societies, reinforces existing racial disparities in stop, investigation, arrest and incarceration rates because of racist prejudices and even contributes to strengthen the unhealthy effects of racism on historically disadvantaged racial groups, like black people.Practical implicationsThe findings hope to make law enforcement agencies and software companies aware that they must take adequate action against the racially discriminative effects of the use of face recognition technology.Social implicationsThis study highlights that no implementation of an allegedly racism-free biometric technology is safe from the risk of racially discriminating, simply because each implementation leans against our society, which is affected by racism in many persisting ways.Originality/valueWhile the ethical survey of biometric technologies is traditionally framed in the discourse of universal rights, this study explores an issue that has not been deeply scrutinized so far, that is, how face recognition technology differently affects distinct racial groups and how it contributes to racial discrimination.

T1  - Black Women: Then and Now
AN  - 2290788865
AB  - Social media and traditional resources were used to examine discourse about the role and position of Black women during the civil rights movement of the 60s and the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Discourse in both eras highlighted persistent issues with the gendered oppression of Black women, systems of patriarchy and misogyny supporting that oppression, and conflicts about the role of feminism. Common themes included in past and contemporary discourse included issues of invisibility, vulnerability, colorism, and negative stereotyping. The clinical implications of this discourse for Black women and of the current movement's emphasis on an intersectional approach are discussed.

T1  - Picking on immigrants: a cross-national analysis of individual-level relative deprivation and authoritarianism as predictors of anti-foreign prejudice
AN  - 2240359365
AB  - In many European countries, anti-immigrant sentiments seem to have spread following recent economic challenges. By drawing on relative deprivation (RD) theory, we establish a theoretical connection between economic downturns and anti-immigrant prejudice. We argue that the experience of individual-level relative deprivation (IRD) is comparable to that of social threat and social exclusion. We draw on a large body of research that suggests the experience of social threat and uncertainty leads to the perception of the world in ethnocentric terms and rejecting pluralistic belief systems. Unlike much of the literature, we focus on individual-level perceptions and distinguish between an objective and subjective relative deprivation. Given our focus on individual-level predictors, we also test for the effects of authoritarian preferences on the likelihood of anti-immigrant bias. Our study demonstrates that unlike objective deprivation, both subjective deprivation and authoritarianism have a significant impact on anti-immigrant sentiments. Furthermore, we find evidence that one component of authoritarian preferences, namely authoritarian submission, moderates the effect of relative deprivation on economic (not cultural) forms of anti-immigrant prejudice.

T1  - Motivated prejudice: The effect of need for closure on anti-immigrant attitudes in the United States and Italy and the mediating role of binding moral foundations
AN  - 2245661402
AB  - Why do people have anti-immigrant attitudes? We proposed that individuals’ need for cognitive closure-an epistemic motivation associated with an aversion to change in established environments-is predictive of a dislike of immigrants through increased binding to powerful groups. In four studies, collected in both Italy (Study 1) and the United States (Studies 2–4), we found that there were effects of need for cognitive closure on anti-immigrant attitudes, as well as indirect effects through binding. These results were significant controlling for participants’ political orientation (Studies 2–4), when either dispositional measure (Studies 1–3) or an experimental induction (Study 4) of need for cognitive closure was used, and when both general attitudes toward immigrants (Studies 1, 2, 4) and attitudes toward immigrants’ economic impact (Studies 3 and 4) were assessed.

T1  - Worshiping across the Color Line: The Influence of Congregational Composition on Whites’ Friendship Networks and Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2406941362
AB  - Religious participation has reinforced the color line in American society for generations. Despite rising racial and ethnic diversity across U.S. communities, most Americans continue to belong to congregations composed primarily of others from their own racial/ethnic groups. Yet recent scholarship suggests that the presence of multiple racial or ethnic groups in the same congregation is increasing. The authors examine how the racial/ethnic composition of U.S. congregations is related to white attenders’ friendship networks and comfort with other racial/ethnic groups (i.e., blacks, Hispanics, and Asians). Using national survey data, the authors find that whites in multiracial congregations report more diverse friendship networks and higher levels of comfort with nonwhites than do whites in nonmultiracial congregations. However, the influence of worshipping with another race/ethnicity seems to be most pronounced for whites in congregations with Hispanics. Moreover, neighbors and friends of other races have more impact on whites’ friendship networks and attitudes than do congregations. The authors discuss implications of these findings for understanding U.S. intergroup relations and the potential of congregations to address the color line.

T1  - STEREOTYPES OF OLD AGE: VIEWS ON THE ELDERLY IN BRAZILIAN ADVERTISING
TT  - STEREOTİPİ VEZANI UZ STARiJU DOB: POGLED NA STARIJE U BRAZILSKOM OGLAŠAVANJU
AN  - 2404088490
AB  - Ageing, more than a demographic phenomenon (a consolidated process in Europe, still a recent one in Brazil), is a social construction influenced by the media. Advertising, which simultaneously reflects and contributes to the construction of social values, uses stereotypes as a tool for creating easily identifiable characters. This study aims at identifying aspects explored by advertising messages using stereotypes to portray older people. The sample consists of nineteen pieces selected from more than 4,500 posts on Facebook and Youtube by the ten companies with the largest advertising spending in Brazil from July 2017 to June 2018. Among the 104 pieces that feature elderly people, nineteen did use stereotypes. In twelve of them, positive stereotypes, always related to longlife accumulated experience, while seven included negative traits, such as elderly people losing touch with reality, having difficulties with technology, poor social interaction, physical impairements, or old-fashioned clothing. Negative stereotyping reflects an outdated perspective of the ageing process.Alternate abstract:SAŽETAK Starenje (proces koji je već duboko zahvatio Europu, a sada i Brazil) više od ostalih demografskih fenomena predstavlja socijalnu konstrukciju koja je pod utjecajem medija. Oglašavanje, koje istovremeno reflektira društvene vrijednosti i doprinosi konstrukciji društvenih vrijednosti, koristi stereotipe kao alat za kreiranje prepoznatljivih likova. Cilj ovog istraživanja jest identificirati aspekte oglašivačkih poruka koje koriste stereotipe u portretiranju starijih ljudi. Uzorak se sastojao od devetnaest jedinica oglasa odabranih izmeðu 4,500 objava na Faceebooku i Youtubeu deset kompanija s najvećom potrošnjom na oglašavanje u Brazilu, u razdoblju od srpnja 2017. do lipnja 2018. Od 104 oglasa koji prikazuju starije ljude, 19 je koristilo stereotipe. U njih 12 koristili su se pozitivni stereotipi u smislu životnog iskustva koje dolazi s godinama, dok ih je 7 prikazivalo negativne osobine koje se vezuju uz starost: gubitak osjećaja za stvarnost kod starijih osoba, teškoće s tehnologijom, siromašna socijalna interakcija, fizičke teškoće ili staromodno odijevanje. Negativni stereotipi odražavaju zastarjelu percepciju procesa starenja.

T1  - Fancy Schools for Fancy People: Risks and Rewards in Fieldwork Research Among the Low German Mennonites of Canada and Mexico
AN  - 2326933969
AB  - In the 1920s, conflict over schooling prompted the exodus of nearly 8000 Mennonites from the Canadian prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan to Mexico and Paraguay; this is the largest voluntary exodus of a single people group in Canadian history. Mennonites—whose roots are found in the 1520s Reformation—are an Anabaptist, pacifist, isolationist ethnic, and religious minority group, and victims of a fledgling Canada’s nation-building efforts. It is estimated that approximately 80,000 descendants of the original emigrants have subsequently returned to Canada, where tensions over schooling have persisted. The tensions—then, as now—are rooted in a fundamentally different understanding of the purposes of education—and it is this tension that interests me as an ethnographer and education researcher. My research is concerned with assessing attitudes towards education within the Low German Mennonite (LGM) community in both Canada and Mexico. Too often academic research is presented as a tidy finished product, with little insight shed into the messy, highly iterative process of data collection. The purpose of this article is to pull back the curtain and discuss the messiness of the process, including security risks involved with methodology, site selection, research participants, and gaining access to the community.

AN  - 2323056963
AB  - Over the past two decades, higher education research has built a consensus that engaging with coursework on race is beneficial to students' socioemotional and cognitive development. Paradoxically, we do not have clarity as to what that means, specifically. Most studies exploring the association between diversity courses and the development of students' racial understanding examine a variety of dependent variables and consider combinations of outcomes - attitudinal, behavior and cognitive - that, while related, are distinct. This heterogeneity of results is a challenge for institutions of higher education, researchers, and practitioners. This study addresses that challenge by narrowing the scope of inquiry. We focus on Ethnic Studies courses in particular, and on their effect on two distinct types of racial attitudes: students' understanding of structural racism, and students' cross-racial empathy. Employing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF), we address a persistent methodological challenge in the research by employing propensity score matching to statistically control for self-selection bias. We find that while there is some association between Ethnic Studies course-taking and racial attitudes, the relationship varies across different types of Ethnic Studies courses.

T1  - Crime and punishment: A realistic group conflict approach to racial discrimination in hiring convicted felons
AN  - 2176737419
AB  - PurposeA surprisingly large proportion of the working population of the USA consists of individuals with felony convictions. Moreover, the issue of employability of these individuals is compounded for minorities. This paper aims to present two experimental studies investigating whether minorities with felony backgrounds have a more difficult time being selected for employment than identically situated white applicants. The authors ground the paper in realistic group conflict theory. Results indicate discrimination is more acute against minorities with felony backgrounds than whites with the same background and shed light on the mechanisms leading to this discrimination. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.Design/methodology/approachThis paper involves two experimental studies involving working adults engaging with realistic survey situations using mTurk.FindingsResults of both studies indicate discrimination is more acute against minorities with felony backgrounds than whites with the same background, and shed light on the mechanisms leading to this discrimination.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation of the methodology is that the authors used fictional candidates and jobs. This may have led to understating the effects of discrimination on minorities because it allowed applicants to answer in socially desirable ways (e.g. absent of racial bias) without suffering any of the anticipated negative consequences of actually hiring individuals about whom they hold negative stereotypes.Practical implicationsThis research has several important implications for practice. First, organizations should be keenly aware of the potential for subtle and unconscious bias to affect the job application process even among well-intentioned hiring managers. Second, as the bias is often triggered by threats, organizations should share with their employees the nature of the threat involved with former felons.Social implicationsOrganizations should deliberately address issues associated with the use of criminal background checks. For many organizations, a felony conviction in an applicant’s background automatically eliminates that person from employment. However, a substantial amount of the workforce now has a felony in their background. Indeed, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2012) has issued guidelines that detail important factors that organizations should consider on a case-by-case basis when considering employment for former felons. Organizations may consider updating any blanket exclusions regarding the hiring of ex-felons – not only because it makes good policy but also because it may help the organization hire the best people.Originality/valueThis research studies an important – and growing – societal problem related to the hiring of convicted felons, and the related issue of racial discrimination that affects black convicted felons particularly hard. There has been very little work in the management area on this topic. Moreover, there has been very little work in all areas that includes experimental methods. The use of such methods is particularly useful to eliminate confounds found in field data.

T1  - The nexus between attribution theory and racial attitudes: a test of racial attribution and public opinion of capital punishment
AN  - 2113240819
AB  - Research has shown that attribution theory and racial attitudes are among the most consistent attitudinal predictors of capital punishment opinion. This study explores the overlap of these two constructs, racial attribution, and its ability to account for support and opposition to the death penalty. Using data from the 1972-2016 cumulative data file of the General Social Survey, three logistic regression models were used to analyze the effect of internal and external racial attribution on capital punishment opinions for (a) the aggregate sample, (b) White respondents only, and (c) Black respondents only. Respondents were asked whether racial inequalities were due to structural disadvantages or personal deficiencies of Black Americans. Findings showed that respondents in all three models were more likely to support the death penalty when they attributed racial inequalities to personal deficiencies of Blacks and less likely to support the death penalty when they endorsed structural disadvantages, although the effects were somewhat muted for Black respondents. These findings suggest that ongoing public support for capital punishment in the United States is based at least in part on a fundamental attribution error in which Whites and some Blacks alike blame Blacks for their own deprivation.

T1  - Who Deserves Solidarity? Unequal Treatment of Immigrants in Swiss Welfare Policy Delivery
AN  - 2095253526
AB  - Rising immigration rates in Western Europe concur with increasing anti‐immigrant attitudes. While assessments of welfare eligibility in the United States demonstrably hinge on how public servants perceive different racial groups as deserving, we know less about ethnically motivated discrimination in the European context. This paper argues that Switzerland is a critical case for studying such developments. It combines social construction theory and the deservingness heuristic to analyze how social constructions of Swiss natives and immigrants influence 90 disability benefits insurance procedures. Findings reveal that immigrants are perceived as less deserving and less powerful than Swiss applicants. Thus, Swiss welfare workers do not allocate welfare benefits independently of an applicant's nationality. Our results raise fundamental questions about the equal treatment of welfare applicants in times of rising immigration and anti‐immigrant attitudes. The feed‐forward effects of social constructions imply longer‐term consequences for good administrative practices and society that require scholarly attention.Alternate abstract:西欧高速增长的移民率使得反移民态度也日趋强烈。尽管对于美国享受福利资格的评估表明这取决于公职人员如何评判不同种族是否应得, 我们对于欧洲有关民族的歧视却知之甚少。本文认为瑞士是研究相关发展的一个重要案例。它结合了社会建构理论和正当性启示法来分析瑞士本地人和移民的社会建构是如何影响90位残障人士的保险受益程序的。结果显示相比于瑞士申请人, 移民被认为拥有较少的正当性和权力。也就是说, 瑞士福利工人的福利受益分配不是独立于申请人国籍的。我们的结果在移民大量涌入和反移民态度日渐强烈的当下提出了关于平等对待福利申请人的重要问题。社会建构的正反馈作用意味着这些会影响行政实践和社会的长期结果值得学者们的关注。

T1  - Childcare, Household Composition, Muslim Ethnicity, and Off-Farm Work in Rural China
AN  - 2019767795
AB  - This study explores how religious and ethnic norms and gender relations interact across the domestic and public spheres of work in rural China's minority-concentrated regions. It focuses on the roles that childcare and household composition play in the employment decisions of prime-age married individuals of Muslim and non-Muslim ethnicity. Using the 2012 China Household Ethnicity Survey (CHES), the study finds that children generally decrease women's likelihood of employment outside the home and increase men's. The gender gap in the probability of off-farm employment is larger for those of Muslim ethnicity. Non-Muslim parents of sons are more likely to migrate for employment than parents of daughters. The presence of women of grandparent age (46-70) universally facilitates labor migration. Men of grandparent age tend to increase only the probability that non-Muslim parents migrate for employment. Additional adult male household members reduce the likelihood that women of Muslim ethnicity have off-farm employment.

T1  - Positive Feedback From Male Authority Figures Boosts Women’s Math Outcomes
AN  - 1999028523
AB  - People often search for cues in the environment to determine whether or not they will be judged or treated negatively based on their social identities. Accordingly, feedback from gatekeepers—members of majority groups who hold authority and power in a field—may be an especially important cue for those at risk of experiencing social identity threat, such as women in math settings. Across a series of studies, women who received positive (“Good job!”) versus objective (score only) feedback from a male (vs. female) authority figure in math reported greater confidence; belonging; self-efficacy; more favorable Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) attitudes/identification/interest; and greater implicit identification with math. Men were affected only by the type of math feedback they received, not by the source of feedback. A meta-analysis across studies confirmed results. Together, these findings suggest that positive feedback from gatekeepers is an important situational cue that can improve the outcomes of negatively stereotyped groups.

T1  - The Endurance of Interpersonal Confrontations as a Prejudice Reduction Strategy
AN  - 1999027609
AB  - Previous work has found that individuals who have been confronted for discrimination demonstrate a reduction in explicit prejudice and use fewer stereotypes immediately after the confrontation. Although confronting prejudice has been touted as a tool for prejudice reduction, it is not known how these effects translate over time and what processes might account for their endurance. Across two studies, the present research finds that individuals used significantly fewer negative stereotypes 7 days after confrontation (Study 1) and engaged in behavioral inhibition to stereotypical cues on a probe task 1 week after confrontation. Moreover, guilt and prolonged rumination mediated these effects for confronted participants (Studies 1 and 2). Across two studies, the present studies reveal the lasting effects of interpersonal confrontations in prejudice reduction and the process by which these effects endure.

T1  - Ethnic identity and attitudes toward state institutions: evidence of judicial legitimacy among the indigenous in Latin America
AN  - 2571083694
AB  - How does ethnic identity affect how an individual evaluates state institutions? Drawing on the US courts and political psychology literatures, we argue politically marginalized groups (e.g., the indigenous in Latin America) are more likely to emphasize the what – are the outcomes satisfactory – but less likely to value the how –are the procedures fair – than their politically powerful (e.g., the whites in Latin America) counterparts. This is because the former have been historically marginalized and socially disenfranchized. This political underrepresentation shapes an individual's attitude toward state institutions including the judiciary. We test this argument using two Latin American Public Opinion Project samples: the first is cross-national for 2010; the second, over-time for Bolivia. The results suggest that, on the one hand, the gap between how the indigenous and their white counterparts evaluate the judiciary is narrowing. Yet, on the other hand, there is evidence that Latin American courts are still lacking a “reservoir of goodwill” that is perceived equally across all ethnic identities. These results have major implications for political representation and democratic consolidation.

T1  - Citizenship, Legal Status, and Federal Sentencing Outcomes: Examining the Moderating Effects of Age, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity
AN  - 2558484043
AB  - Research has yet to fully investigate whether the effects of citizenship and legal status are moderated by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This is a significant oversight because negative stereotypes of young, male, black, and Hispanic offenders may intensify overall negative perceptions for noncitizen and undocumented immigrant offenders. Using data from the United States Sentencing Commission for fiscal years 2006–2008, we investigate whether the effects of citizenship and legal status on sentencing outcomes are moderated by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The results indicate that the effects of citizenship and legal status on incarceration decision, but not sentence length decision, are moderated by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Further, young Hispanic male noncitizen and undocumented immigrant offenders are among the groups that have the greatest odds of being sentenced to prison. We discuss the implications of these findings and conclude with a discussion of future research.

T1  - A Model and Indicator of Aggregate Need Satisfaction for Capped Objectives and Weighting Schemes for Situations of Scarcity
AN  - 1931546766
AB  - Normative criteria for evaluations of economic and social outcomes are often formulated in terms of social welfare functions which are essentially and importantly non-satiable. However, there are good reasons to consider certain normative criteria and many policy objectives to be capped, i.e. bounded, and thus satiable provided sufficient resources are made available for their satisfaction. Inspired by the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class of indicators, this paper uses an interdisciplinary approach to develop a model for assessing outcomes in terms of capped objectives based on an understanding of individual shortfalls from the objective, denoted needs. We present an indicator to measure need satisfaction in a population of individuals with heterogeneous needs and highlight an aggregation problem under scarcity. For such situations, we develop three ways in which the indicator can be weighted that reflect respectively concerns over the frequency, depth and severity of the need shortfalls and show that normative evaluations based on these weighting schemes can conflict, yielding mutually inconsistent outcome rankings. The indicator can be adapted to measure a wide variety of phenomena, e.g. health needs, education shortfalls, deprivation, etc., and it is suited for targeting exercises and other policy implementations. In particular, it allows for exogenous weighting schemes, i.e. weights that can incorporate non-shortfall characteristics relevant for the evaluation, e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, etc. The indicator thus enables new ways for researchers to promote and study satiable objectives in a wide variety of contexts relevant to economic and social policy, e.g. human development programs, poverty reduction, healthcare policies, etc.

T1  - Leaning Out: How Negative Recruitment Experiences Shape Women's Decisions to Compete for Executive Roles
AN  - 1925613123
AB  - This paper proposes that gender differences in responses to recruitment rejections contribute to women's underrepresentation in top management. We theorize and show that women are less likely than men to consider another job with a prospective employer that has rejected them in the past. Because of women's status as a negatively stereotyped minority in senior roles, recruitment rejection triggers uncertainty about their general belonging in the executive domain, which in turn leads women to place greater weight than men on fair treatment and negatively affects their perceptions of the fairness of the treatment they receive. This dual process makes women less inclined than men to apply again to a firm that has rejected them. We test our theory with three studies: a field study using longitudinal archival data from an executive search firm, a survey of executives, and an experiment using executive respondents testing the effects of rejection on willingness to apply to a firm for another position. The results have implications for theory and practice regarding gender inequality at the labor market's upper echelons, highlighting that women's supply-side decisions to "lean out" of competition for senior roles must be understood in light of their previous experiences with employers' demand-side practices. Given the sequential nature of executive selection processes, rejection-driven differences in the willingness to compete in a given round would affect the proportion of available women in subsequent selection rounds, contributing to a cumulative gender disadvantage and thus possibly increasing gender inequality over time.

T1  - "A Crash Course in Herstory": Remembering the Women's Movement in MAKERS: Women Who Make America
AN  - 2013118854
AB  - This article explores how the documentary MAKERS: Women Who Make America constructs a collective memory of the women's movement. MAKERS deploys three strategies to present a particular version of the feminist past: the use of individual women as witnesses to the second wave, the use of archival journalism as an "authentic" guide to the past, and the use of narrative to personalize the political. These strategies create an authoritative memory of the women's movement as a narrative of progress that highlights individualism and ends in women's freedom to choose. This collective memory of "feminism as choice" serves as a corrective to negative stereotypes of second-wave feminism; however, it does not effectively mobilize collective feminist action in the present.

T1  - From flip-flopping stereotypes to desecuritizing hybridity: Muslims as threats and security providers in Danish broadcast drama series
AN  - 1926272397
AB  - Muslims are making their way into filmed entertainment in Hollywood and Europe. Critical reception has uniformly acclaimed the quantitative progress, however, disagreeing on the quality of the representation. One position laments how the increased representation of diversity is structured by negative stereotypes; another is encouraged by how the very same stereotypes are ironically taken to extremes. Bearing in mind the intimate relation between identity and security, however, the stereotypical representation of difference is never innocent. The overall narratives of Danish public service broadcast series such as The Killing, Government and The Protectors rely on stereotypical security policy narratives identifying Muslims as threats. Even when stereotypes are creatively articulated to reverse the negative valuation, Muslim roles are distinctly charged or ‘securitized’ when compared to non-Muslim roles. However, placing the ‘Muslim’ character centre stage allows a separate level of representation of a distinct role in the way stories articulate stereotypes, facilitating hybrid identities.

T1  - Distinctiveness, deference and dominance in Black Caribbean fathers' engagement with public schools in London and New York City
AN  - 1915903943
AB  - In the US and UK, Black fatherhood has long been steeped in narratives of pathology. Despite the promotion of nuanced understandings of Black fatherhood in recent scholarship, research on Black fathers' positive engagement with urban schools remains remarkably limited. This article adds to the literature by highlighting the strategies Black Caribbean fathers deploy to challenge assumptions about their identities and involvement. Based on 20 in-depth interviews with 10 Caribbean immigrant fathers in London and New York City, the analysis rendered utilises Critical Race Theory to highlight how some Black men attempt to counter racial subordination through masculine domination, particularly when engaging with white female teachers. The empirical analysis reveals that groups of Caribbean immigrant fathers draw on three common strategies to offset negative stereotypes about their engagement and assert their masculinities - namely, distinctiveness, deference and dominance.

T1  - Show your pride? The surprising effect of race on how people perceive a pride display
AN  - 1875133055
AB  - Non-verbal expressions of pride convey status. But pride displays can be interpreted as either authentic or hubristic. Given negative stereotypes about Blacks, we hypothesized that when displaying pride, Blacks would be rated higher in hubristic and lower in authentic pride compared to Whites. Contrary to predictions, three experiments found consistent evidence that Whites are judged to be more hubristic than Blacks when displaying pride. This effect occurred when pride was displayed in an unspecified (Study 1), academic (Study 2), or work-related context (Study 3). Effects were largely specific to pride displays and not a function of a general race-based response bias. We speculate that these counterintuitive findings might reflect a negative reaction to those with high status flaunting their success.

T1  - Conceptualising and Measuring Social Cohesion in Africa: Towards a Perceptions-Based Index
AN  - 1879392512
AB  - Social cohesion is a key concept in development studies. Weak social cohesion is often related to slow economic growth and (violent) conflict. So far few attempts have been made to measure this complex concept in a systematic manner. This paper introduces an innovative method to measure national-level social cohesion based on survey data from 19 African countries. We distinguish three dimensions of social cohesion; i.e. the extent of perceived inequalities, the level of societal trust, and the strength of people's adherence to their national identity. Importantly, our Social Cohesion Index (SCI) is based on individuals' perceptions vis-à-vis these three different dimensions of social cohesion rather than certain macro-level 'objective' indicators such as GDP/capita or Gini-coefficients. We develop two social cohesion indices: a national average SCI and a Social Cohesion Index Variance-Adjusted (SCIVA); the latter one takes into account the level of variation across different ethnic groups within countries. The SCI and SCIVA are computed for and compared across nineteen African countries for the period 2005-2012 on the basis of Afrobarometer survey rounds 3, 4 and 5. We also investigate quantitatively the relationship between countries' levels of social cohesion and the occurrence of a range of conflict events. As expected, we find that countries with low levels of social cohesion in a particular year according to our SCI are more likely to experience a range of different violent conflict events in the subsequent year.

AN  - 1865121572
AB  - This study examines the negative stereotypes of the category of women and their subcategories through the language of insults. Participants produced a list of epithets induced by the same hypothetical scenario in which the protagonist was presented either as a "prostitute" or as a "girl" (i.e., nonprostitute). Findings showed that the prostitute was addressed with taboo-related insults exaggerating sexual behavior, whereas the girl was mainly given warnings and intellectual insults. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the underlying processes.

T1  - DO STEREOTYPES HINDER OR PROMOTE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT? THE CASE OF WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES
AN  - 1841722934
AB  - In this paper we explore the influence of national stereotyping on bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) in seven countries of former Yugoslavia 25 years after it disintegrated. Western Balkan countries face revived economic cooperation, but also large and ongoing differences in economic development and bilateral FDI. Their understanding lies beyond the wellknown determinants of FDI location choice. The results show a positive relationship between the share of positive stereotypes and the share of inward FDI in total FDI in the former Yugoslav countries. The value of inward FDI stocks in host countries for which positive stereotypes dominate is statistically significantly higher than in countries where negative stereotypes exist. Qualitative analysis further indicated that stereotypes influence the initial decision-making and learning process, as well as control and management in foreign affiliates. Positive stereotypes enhance and increase FDI, while negative ones stimulate learning and risk assessment. A lack of inter-cultural knowledge and (subsequent) failures may lead to the (ab)use of stereotypes as excuses.

T1  - Sexual Responsibility and the Politics of Abortion and Contraception
AN  - 1802422391
AB  - Rape myths, which shift responsibility for sexual assault from the assailant to the victim, have gained prominence in American politics. Like many negative stereotypes, rape myths have a strong association with public opinion on the social groups affected by the stereotype. In this study, I investigate rape myth acceptance in the US population, differences in the causes of rape myth acceptance among men and women, and the effect of rape myths on political beliefs. I show that rape myth acceptance is significantly related to a decrease in support for access to contraception and increases opposition to abortion among male respondents. This finding is particularly significant given the current debates over women's healthcare and the future of reproductive health policy in particular.

T1  - Segregation in Civic Life: Ethnic Sorting and Mixing across Voluntary Associations
AN  - 1810071179
AB  - To what extent do voluntary organizations like sports, leisure, and neighborhood associations provide a platform where ethnic groups mingle and ethnic boundaries are overcome? This study uses unique panel data from the Netherlands Longitudinal Life Course Study (NELLS) to shed light on the integrative power of voluntary associations. I investigate decisions to join and leave associations of different ethnic composition, as a member or a volunteer, among individuals of Turkish, Moroccan, and native Dutch origin. In general, all ethnic groups are equally likely to join voluntary organizations, but ethnic minorities are more likely to leave than are Dutch natives, even after accounting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics. This alone explains ethnic minorities' lower involvement rates. Moreover, joining decisions are characterized by strong ethnic sorting across organizations of different ethnic composition: people are much more likely to join associations containing fewer ethnic out-group members. This limits the potential of voluntary associations as pathways to social integration. In contrast, once the initial hurdle of getting involved has been taken, people are no more likely to disengage from organizations with more ethnic out-group members. Inter-ethnic neighborhood contact and the local supply of involvement opportunities are most influential in explaining the strong sorting tendencies in people's joining decisions.

T1  - From "brute" to "thug:" The demonization and criminalization of unarmed Black male victims in America
AN  - 1768022922
AB  - The synonymy of Blackness with criminality is not a new phenomenon in America. Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in the post-Reconstruction era and have culminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today. Misconceptions and prejudices manufactured and disseminated through various channels such as the media included references to a "brute" image of Black males. In the 21st century, this negative imagery of Black males has frequently utilized the negative connotation of the terminology "thug." In recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be "suspects" or "persons of interest." The exploitation of these often-targeted victims' criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths. Despite the connection between disproportionate criminality and Black masculinity, little research has been done on how unarmed Black male victims, particularly but not exclusively at the hands of law enforcement, have been posthumously criminalized. This article investigates the historical criminalization of Black males and its connection to contemporary unarmed victims of law enforcement. Action research methodology in the data collection process is utilized to interpret how Black male victims are portrayed by traditional mass media, particularly through the use of language, in ways that marginalize and devictimize these individuals. This study also aims to elucidate a contemporary understanding of race relations, racism, and the plight of the Black male in a 21-century "postracial" America.

T1  - Work wisdom: Teaching former prisoners how to negotiate workplace interactions and perform a rehabilitated self
AN  - 1790890784
AB  - Drawing on eight months of ethnographic fieldwork at a community-based prisoner reentry program, this article investigates how staff members attempt to cultivate former prisoners' cultural capital to mitigate stigma and facilitate interactions with employers. I call this curriculum work wisdom, which involves teaching clients how to (1) disclose discrediting information and communicate remorse; (2) tailor their style of dress, speech, and bodily comportment to avoid evoking negative stereotypes; (3) negotiate the tacit norms of workplace culture; and (4) remain confident and resilient in the face of rejection. Work wisdom provides former prisoners with the dramaturgical resources to perform dominant cultural scripts and practices in the short term as they undergo the longer-term process of reintegration. These findings illustrate how the cultivation of cultural capital begins by teaching superficial performances that can be internalized as durable dispositions over time. In the conclusion, I discuss the limitations of work wisdom.

T1  - Three cultural models of teacher interaction valued by Mexican students at a US high school
AN  - 1784145601
AB  - Using students' interviews as data source, this study explores the interactional experiences of several Mexican students at a US high school in the Midwest with their teachers and discusses how three cultural models of teacher interaction valued by the students impact their affiliation, motivation, and engagement with school. Emphasis is given to the students' voices to explore how teachers are perceived by them. The study found that several teachers displayed negative stereotypes influenced by cultural and social biases toward Mexicans and the anti-immigrant climate in society. Insights are provided regarding the manner in which Mexican students' teacher interaction influences their high drop out rate, their low academic achievement, and their low graduation statistics. The findings suggest that there is an urgent need to improve teachers' cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity toward Mexican students.

T1  - The Delhi dilemma: media representation of the 2010 Commonwealth Games
AN  - 1784139502
AB  - Developing nations increasingly use sporting mega-events to demonstrate capacity, staking a claim to a place on the 'world map' by participating in what has been referred to as the 'global circus', or alternatively, the 'prestige model'. The 2010 Commonwealth Games, hosted by India, provide an example of a mega-event which had mixed results in terms of signalling global modernity. This study extends existing media analysis research that found that the Western media's interpretation of the event was critical overall and employed negative stereotypes that served to undermine India's status as a modern power. This study employed a comprehensive textual analysis of relevant articles from eight major daily newspapers to reveal that the Australian print media coverage often focused on the inadequacies of India as an appropriate host nation for the Commonwealth Games.

T1  - Accounting for Racism Against Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand: A Discourse Analytic Study of the Views of Maori Adults
AN  - 1769918025
AB  - Previous discursive studies on the construction, reproduction and justification of racism have focussed on the accounts of perpetrators to the exclusion of the targets of racist talk. The current study redresses this imbalance by exploring the talk of targets of racism in Aotearoa/ New Zealand. Interviews were conducted with 24 participants, 19 Maori and five Pakeha partners. Our social constructionist discourse analysis identifies four primary discourses that participants drew on to account for racism, two of which resonated strongly with the literature and two which spotlighted new areas of interest. A discourse of ignorance functioned to allow participants to account for racism by highlighting Pakeha ignorance of Maori people and culture, and of racism itself. The second discourse implicated the media for emphasising negative Maori news, avoiding positive Maori achievements and promoting negative stereotypes. A third discourse constructed Pakeha as possessing an innate sense of superiority which contributed to racism, and fourthly, institutionalised racism was used by participants to construct a colonial society which continued to marginalise Maori. Finally we consider the implications of these findings with respect to existing literature, some implications around the intersectionality and relationship between these discourses, and the importance of potential gains in understanding made possible through the study of targets' perspectives.

Disclosure is a complex process for victims of both genders, however masculine norms and stereotypes have contributed to an environment that often negates the experiences of men. The disclosure process of 17 adult male survivors of child sexual abuse was explored using transcripts of telephone interviews. A combination of two qualitative methodologies, the phenomenological method and interpretive description approach, was used to analyze this secondary data. The results indicated that the majority of the men in the study waited until adulthood to disclose their abuse, with negative stereotypes contributing to their delayed disclosures. In terms of specific experiences with disclosure, the participants found they received both positive and negative responses. These results were consistent with the literature.

T1  - Stronger Than You Think: Older Women and Physical Activity
AN  - 1772855328
AB  - Many negative stereotypes of older women are related to changes in the body that render it incompetent (e.g., weak, frail, debilitated). Such stereotypes disempower women in the eyes of others and in their own eyes if they come to embody the stereotype. One way to resist the stereotype and remain empowered is to engage in regular physical activity, which increases stamina, energy, muscle strength, joint flexibility, and balance. Here we review the physical and mental health benefits of physical activity for older women and discuss the barriers that keep many older women from regular exercise. We discuss ways that feminist therapists can encourage their older clients to become more physically active, provide information about role models who can inspire clients, and suggest resources suitable for recommendation.

T1  - An Analysis of a White Preservice Teacher's Reflections on Race and Young Children Within an Urban School Context
AN  - 1752554543
AB  - Building upon research that theorizes and documents students' perceptions of race, racial attitudes, and treatment by teachers, this article explores the impact of resegregation on how children of Color see and experience race in schools, specifically in relation to their teachers. Drawing upon our interpretations of a White preservice teacher's interactions with two African American elementary students, the students' awareness of her race, and their subsequent "racialized" perceptions of her effectiveness as a teacher, we explore the domino effects of racial and economic segregation on young children's schooling experiences, particularly as they relate to their relationships with teachers.

T1  - Liberal intervention, anthropology and the ethnicity machine
AN  - 2572856861
AB  - This article explores the turn towards anthropology and sociology among ‘critical interventionists’, i.e. those who are not opposed to liberal intervention as such, but merely worry that actually existing intervention tends to fail because it is top-heavy with ‘Western’ ideas of ‘good governance’ and lacks an ‘anthropological sensitivity’ to the communal nature of the local, indigenous identities and practices implicated in conflict. The article problematises the critical interventionists’ conception of indigenous practice (culture) and communal conflict and questions the role assigned by them to the anthropologist/sociologist, i.e. as expert in the ’communal’ and translator of indigenous culture to the international purveyors of ‘good governance’. What this division of labour rules out is an anthropology/sociology of governance. Using as an illustrative example the phenomena of ‘telling’ – a supposedly irenic form of group designation indigenous to Northern Ireland that has become foundational to the peace process – this article argues that anthropology can help us understand communalism not as the antithesis of liberal ‘good governance’ but as one of its foremost techniques.

T1  - Neighborhood Stereotypes and Interpersonal Trust in Social Exchange: An Experimental Study
AN  - 1735658537; 201537622
AB  - Recent research indicates that segregation is, in addition to many other undesirable consequences, negatively associated with social capital, in particular, generalized trust within a community. This study investigates whether an individual's residential neighborhood and the stereotypes associated with this neighborhood affect others' trusting behavior as a specific form of social exchange. Using an anonymous trust game experiment in the context of five districts of the German capital, Berlin, we show that trusting is contingent on others' residential neighborhood rather than on deliberate assessments of trustworthiness. Participants show significantly greater trust toward individuals from positively stereotyped neighborhoods with favorable sociodemographic characteristics than to persons from negatively stereotyped neighborhoods with unfavorable sociodemographics. Importantly, when stereotypes and sociodemographic factors point in opposite directions, participants' trust decisions reflect stereotype content. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diverse Workplaces and Interethnic Friendship Formation-A Multilevel Comparison across 21 OECD Countries
AN  - 2076977206
AB  - We study how workplace diversity affects how native-born populations form interethnic friendship relations. Drawing on network elasticity research, the relationship between functional and cognitive interdependencies, and intergroup contact theory, we argue that diverse workplaces-because they restrict individuals' opportunities to act on tendencies towards homophily more than other social units-have a particularly strong potential for integration. We test our argument by analysing data from the first round of the European Social Survey with multilevel modelling. In line with expectations, we find that individuals who work at diverse workplaces are more likely than individuals who work at homogenous workplaces to have immigrant friends; that workplace diversity is more efficacious than neighbourhood diversity in generating interethnic friendship relations; and that the association between workplace diversity and the likelihood of having immigrant friends is stronger among individuals who have a low level of education, feel economically vulnerable, and who live in countries characterized by relative resource scarcity.

AN  - 1667948910; 201509178
AB  - Data from 115,052 active United States military personnel were analyzed to explore links between contact with gay people and attitudes about repealing 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' Results showed that prejudice against homosexuals significantly mediated the association between contact and supporting repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'; quality of contact in the military was a stronger predictor than other measures of contact. Quality and quantity of contact interacted: more contact quantity had opposing statistical effects on policy attitudes for people experiencing high versus low quality contact. Findings are discussed in terms of contact theory, the association between intergroup attitudes and policy preferences, and practical implications for situations in which groups' access to new positions or roles is limited, and hence contact opportunities are rare.

T1  - THE IMPACT OF ETHNIC CONCENTRATION ON PREJUDICE: THE ROLE OF CULTURAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES AMONG ETHNIC NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS
AN  - 1629033797
AB  - Many studies have examined the impact of the size of the neighborhood minority population on prejudicial attitudes of majority residents. However, few studies have investigated how residents of different ethnic origins evaluate different ethnic outgroups based on the shares of these particular ethnic outgroups in their neighborhood. Based on the belief congruency theory and social identity theory, we propose that the effect of outgroup size on outgroup attitudes depends on the socioeconomic and cultural differences between ethnic groups. Multilevel analyses of Dutch survey data gathered among Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Antillean, and native Dutch residents indicate that for most groups outgroup attitudes are not influenced by the share of the particular outgroup in their neighborhood. For some ethnic groups, however, the size of a particular outgroup is associated with less positive attitudes toward that outgroup. Differences in the effect of outgroup size on outgroup attitudes only partly correspond with cultural differences and socioeconomic status differences.

T1  - Living in the Eye of the Storm: How did Hazleton's Restrictive Immigration Ordinance Affect Local Interethnic Relations?: PROD
AN  - 1618850531
AB  - As Hispanic immigrants have moved beyond traditional immigrant gateways in recent years, local restrictive immigrant ordinances have proliferated. Although scholars have studied the determinants of these policies, we still know little about their social consequences. Drawing on ethnographic and interview data with 103 white, black, and Hispanic residents, collected in 2007 and 2011 in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which passed an anti-immigrant ordinance in 2006, the author found that the law motivated anti-immigrant activism, hardened native views of Hispanics (regardless of documentation status), and increased native whites' fears of lawlessness and crime. By 2011, however, locals reported significantly lower ethnic animosity, and the Latino population, led by Dominicans, continued to grow. This research reveals the unintended consequences of symbolic exclusionary laws and also highlights their limitations. It also demonstrates the capacity that microlevel political factors have to affect immigrant incorporation and intergroup relations and shows that the recent spread of local and state immigrant restrictionist policies may negatively affect immigrants' ability to incorporate in new destinations of settlement at least in the short term.

T1  - In the Belly of the Beast: Effects of Anti-Immigration Policy on Latino Community Members: PROD
AN  - 1618850177
AB  - This paper examines the experiences of Latino adults in South Phoenix, Arizona, during a time of changing immigration policy, through the theoretical lenses of structural vulnerability and macro- and microaggression. The analyses describe how U.S.- and foreign-born Latinos experience the effects of local immigration laws and anti-immigrant sentiment. The results suggest that while there are differences between the U.S.-born and foreign-born in perceived impacts of immigration enforcement, there are few differences in perceptions of vulnerability and no evidence of lesser psychological distress among those who are not the direct targets of immigration enforcement activities. Even if they do not feel directly at risk, most respondents express concerns for family members and others in their social networks as a result of increased attention to immigration enforcement or anti-immigrant sentiment. These shared impacts may have long-term implications for Latino communities in the United States.

T1  - The Reversal of Lifelong Labeling: An Autoethnography
AN  - 1550999556; 201428854
AB  - The periphery belongs to me. I was born and grew up in a poor neighborhood. In common imagery, it evoked the negatively stereotyped image of a place as a poverty and crime heap. Because of my neighborhood, I've suffered various forms of strain. A lifelong labeling process has plagued my life, while in many theories of deviance and crime I would be a criminal. Therefore, how did these theories function with me and with my behavior? How has my lifelong labeling influenced my identity? What suggestions does my life experience offer in terms of urban/social policies? Now I'm trying to answer these questions through my autoethnography. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ecopsychology and Relationship Competency: The Empowerment of Women Graduate Students Through Nature Experiences
AN  - 1531932431; 201425346
AB  - Professional psychology has struggled to find ways to enhance graduate students' relationship competencies. An Ecopsychology course can increase relationship competencies and also empower women students through exercises and experiences that help women connect with nature and shift into an ecofeminist, equalitarian framework. Through the Ecopsychology course, women can undo internalized negative stereotypes they have held about themselves and other women as a result of their gender minority status in society. The course can also enable women to experience a change in power dynamics and relinquish impression management rituals, thereby empowering them to 'be themselves' in public as well as in private. Evaluations over 10 years of the course are consistently very high-close to Outstanding. Qualitative analysis of course participants' evaluation feedback reveals that students derive benefits in relationship, intervention, and research competencies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Getting Angry to Get Ahead: Black College Men, Emotional Performance, and Encouraging Respectable Masculinity
AN  - 1494300552; 201401963
AB  - This article draws on two years of ethnographic fieldwork to explore how a group of black men on a college campus displayed anger in order to encourage other black men to adopt a respectable form of masculinity. Although prior research suggests that black men may work to avoid public displays of anger to evade negative stereotypes of black men, we uncover the contexts in which black men were comfortable expressing feelings of anger, frustration, annoyance, and irritation. Specifically, group leaders displayed these emotions when they observed recruits to their group engaging in actions or behaviors that threatened to reinforce certain stereotypes about black men.

T1  - The institutional logic of images of the poor and welfare recipients: A comparative study of British, Swedish and Danish newspapers
AN  - 1429637794; 201339045
AB  - The article investigates how the poor and welfare recipients are depicted in British, Danish and Swedish newspapers. The study was inspired by American media studies that have documented a negative stereotypic way of portraying the poor and welfare recipients, especially when they are African Americans. The article argues that there is an institutional welfare regime logic behind the way the poor and welfare recipients are depicted in the mass media. It is not only a matter of race. This argument is substantiated by showing that the poor and welfare recipients are (1) also depicted negatively in a liberal welfare regime, the UK, where most of the poor and welfare recipients are perceived to be white, and (2) depicted positively in two social-democratic welfare regimes, Sweden and Denmark, where the poor and welfare recipients have increasingly come to be perceived as non-white, especially in Denmark. The empirical analyses are based on a sample of 1750 British, 1750 Danish and 1750 Swedish newspapers covering the period from 2004 to 2009.

T1  - Two Signatures of Implicit Intergroup Attitudes: Developmental Invariance and Early Enculturation
AN  - 1463012637; 201345659
AB  - Long traditions in the social sciences have emphasized the gradual internalization of intergroup attitudes and the putatively more basic tendency to prefer the groups to which one belongs. In four experiments (N = 883) spanning two cultures and two status groups within one of those cultures, we obtained new evidence that implicit intergroup attitudes emerge in young children in a form indistinguishable from adult attitudes. Strikingly, this invariance from childhood to adulthood holds for members of socially dominant majorities, who consistently favor their in-group, as well as for members of a disadvantaged minority, who, from the early moments of race-based categorization, do not show a preference for their in-group. Far from requiring a protracted period of internalization, implicit intergroup attitudes are characterized by early enculturation and developmental invariance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A lesson not to be learned? Understanding stereotype threat does not protect women from stereotype threat
AN  - 1438558028; 201342294
AB  - This research examines whether reading a text presenting scientific evidence concerning the phenomenon of stereotype threat improves or disrupts women's performance in a subsequent math task. In two experimental conditions participants ($$N = 118$$) read a text summarizing an experiment in which stereotypes, and not biological differences, were shown to be the cause of women's underperformance in math (Gender-relevant condition), or the deficits of Afro-Americans on verbal tests (Control condition). Results showed that, whereas men's performance was not affected by the information provided, women who properly understood the mechanism of stereotype threat had their math performance disrupted in the Gender-relevant condition. These findings suggest that the mere presentation of research evidence on stereotype threat, in the absence of other interventions aimed at reducing the aversive effects of negative stereotypes, may have harmful effects on the targets of stigma.

T1  - 'They are all the same': Low perceived typicality and outgroup disapproval as buffers of intergroup threat in mass media
AN  - 1364703240; 201323752
AB  - Three studies examined whether the perceived typicality of a threatening outgroup actor in media messages alters threat effects on attitudes toward the entire outgroup; and whether outgroup (dis)approval of the actor influences perceived typicality. Study 1 measured Dutch majority attitudes toward Moroccans before and after the Van Gogh murder by a Moroccan-Dutch Muslim. Low perceived typicality of the murderer mitigated less favorable attitudes toward Moroccans after the murder. Study 2 used a newspaper report involving a Moroccan perpetrator to manipulate (dis)approval by other Moroccans. Controlling for prior attitudes toward Moroccans, outgroup disapproval effectively reduced the perceived typicality of the perpetrator as a Moroccan. Study 3 manipulated threat to Psychology students' identity by an Economy student's insulting behavior and (dis)approval by other Economy students in a campus magazine interview. Outgroup disapproval reduced the perceived typicality of the insulting student and buffered threat effects on Psychology students' attitudes toward Economy students. We conclude that outgroup disapproval buffers threat effects of negative outgroup behavior in mass media on outgroup attitudes through reducing perceived typicality. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Tolerance by Surprise: Evidence for a Generalized Reduction in Prejudice and Increased Egalitarianism through Novel Category Combination
AN  - 1330881455
AB  - Prejudices towards different groups are interrelated, but research has yet to find a way to promote tolerance towards multiple outgroups. We devise, develop and implement a new cognitive intervention for achieving generalized tolerance based on scientific studies of social categorization. In five laboratory experiments and one field study the intervention led to a reduction of prejudice towards multiple outgroups (elderly, disabled, asylum seekers, HIV patients, gay men), and fostered generalized tolerance and egalitarian beliefs. Importantly, these effects persisted outside the laboratory in a context marked by a history of violent ethnic conflict, increasing trust and reconciliatory tendencies towards multiple ethnic groups in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We discuss the implications of these findings for intervention strategies focused on reducing conflict and promoting peaceful intergroup relations.

T1  - The Double-Edged Sword of Negative In-Group Stereotyping
AN  - 1347783921; 201318403
AB  - The present work examined the negative consequences that result when stigmatized individuals endorse negative in-group stereotypes after failure. Study 1 found that women given the opportunity to blame their math failure on the stereotype "women are bad at math" showed higher stereotype endorsement, exerted less effort on a subsequent math test, and displayed less identification with the math domain. Study 2 found that observers' felt more negative emotions toward a woman who blamed her poor performance on the math stereotype. Furthermore, this effect was fully mediated by changes in perceptions of the woman's confidence. Together, these findings suggest that people who use negative stereotypes to excuse their failures incur both personal and interpersonal costs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'The Shame Games': a textual analysis of Western press coverage of the Commonwealth Games in India
AN  - 1283639849; 201304136
AB  - This study examines the news coverage of the Commonwealth Games in India in major newspapers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Textual analysis of news articles reveals a heavy focus on issues of mismanagement and deficiencies in game preparations, and the use of negative stereotypes of India. The article draws attention to the bias in coverage of events in developing countries and calls attention to the hegemonic function of the Western press in perpetuating old social attitudes and prejudices that undermine the success and achievements of events in developing countries like India.

T1  - The Cinematic Incarnation of Frazier's Black Bourgeoisie: Tyler Perry's Black Middle-Class
AN  - 1008954350
AB  - Images of Black Americans in modern cinema often depict negative stereotypes of working- and lower-class Blacks. Yet, with the rise of the Black middle-class and the increasing inclusion of Blacks in positions of power within the mass media, more images of middle-class Blacks have begun to appear, particularly through the work of Tyler Perry. We find that Perry's images largely reflect E. Franklin Frazier's characterization of middle-class Blacks in The Black Bourgeoisie (1957), where Perry frames them as (1) materialistic and status-obsessed, (2) dysfunctional and abusive, and (3) disdainful of working- and lower-class Blacks. We also argue that he is creating new controlling images like the "Emasculated Black Gentleman." In these ways, Perry's images may have detrimental consequences including perpetuating Black stereotypes, reinforcing existing class and gender tensions in Black America, and impeding the life chances of middle-class Blacks by suggesting that they are unsuitable for assimilation and integration.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Creative suburbs? How women, design and technology renew Australian suburbs
AN  - 1081868205; 201235490
AB  - Australian suburbs have long been subjected to negative stereotyping -- as aesthetic wastelands, politically conservative, socially isolated and environmentally rapacious -- as the last places you would expect creativity. A critical engagement with this discourse and an examination of older as well as some newer suburbs unsettles these characterizations. A broad definition of "creativity" directs attention to what was occurring in 20th century Australian suburbs -- with a creative domestic economy and modernist architecture providing strong counters to their negative portrayal. Further, as a sample of Melbourne's contemporary master-planned estates will illustrate, at least some of this city's houses and neighbourhoods are at the leading edge of architectural innovation, community building and environmental sustainability -- creatively developing alternatives to the stereotypical suburb.

T1  - Racial Attitudes in the New Millennium: Cool Feelings in Hot Times
AN  - 1037888139; 201234030
AB  - In The Declining Significance of Race, William Julius Wilson (1980) stated social class was more influential than race in determining social outcomes for Blacks. This thesis remains a controversial centerpiece among race scholars. This paper examines one part of the overall puzzle of American race relations: white racial attitudes since September 11, 2001. Using Wilson's declining significance of race thesis, I question if white racial attitudes toward Blacks declined significantly from 2002 to 2004. If social class exerts greater influence on social indicators than race in the coming years, will racial prejudice, particularly toward Blacks, also decline in significance? What happens to white racial prejudice toward Blacks when a highly racialized national crisis occurs? Does racial prejudice heighten and become more significant or, as Wilson suggested, does it decline? Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Submitting to the Follower Label Followership, Positive Affect, and Extra-Role Behaviors
AN  - 1364700942; 201323139
AB  - Although the importance of followership has been discussed in organizational literature, negative connotations attached to the follower label persist, including followers' lack of ability and power. In two studies, we found evidence for negative effects of the follower label. Participants who were labeled a follower (Study 1), or self-labeled as followers in their jobs (Study 2), reported lower positive affect, and in turn, fewer extra-role behaviors. These findings suggest that followers might be at risk for reinforcing their negative stereotypes by avoiding opportunities to show their abilities and demonstrate their independence. Recommendations for leaders and opportunities for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Using human figure drawing as a tool for examining self-perception and emotional attitudes among Jewish and Arab children in Israel
AN  - 1030866728; 201227977
AB  - The study examined ingroup and outgroup perceptions among Jewish and Arab children in Israel. The sample comprised 191 children aged 10-12, 131 Jewish and 60 Arab participants who live in a mixed city. The main instrument used to examine the children's perceptions was a multidimensional analysis of Jewish and Arab figures drawn by the participants, as well as a questionnaire relating to the drawn figures. The findings revealed that, even though they lived in a mixed city and studied in the same classes, the Jewish children differentiated between the figures and overwhelmingly preferred Jewish figures to Arab figures. Moreover, they revealed negative stereotypes and expressed aggression in drawings of Arab figures. In contrast, among the Arab participants, the findings were inconsistent. In most of the variables, they did not distinguish between the various figures. However, in the quality variables, they tended to prefer figures of their own nationality and rejected Jewish figures. The findings are discussed in relation to the context of the residential environment (a mixed city), majority-minority status, and the Israeli-Arab conflict. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Conflict: The Discursive Construction of "Illegal Immigrants" in a Regional U.S. Newspaper
AN  - 862597940; 201110797
AB  - Using an intergroup communication framework, this article examines how a newspaper in southeastern Virginia discursively constructs the "illegal immigrant" as a metonym for Latino immigrants. This mixed methods study traces the development of this newspaper discourse about illegal immigrants from 1994 to 2006 using quantitative lexical analysis. It then shows how two local news events further instantiate an illegal immigrant metonymy influencing perceptions of Latinos, subsequent media discourse about immigration, and local immigration policies using critical discourse analysis. The quantitative findings suggest that news discourse focusing on (illegal) immigration tended to use lexical items low in optimism and commonality, consistent with out-group negativity. The qualitative findings show how two incidents involving "illegal immigrants" attached negative stereotypes to this category, which then potentially influenced perceptions of Latinos more broadly. This analysis shows some of the ways that media discourse influences perceived intergroup threats at the local and national levels.

AN  - 1018353983; 201212790
AB  - We conducted an online experiment to investigate the effects of the nature of stereotypes (Positive or Negative; prepared as priming conditions) and multicultural awareness (measured using M-GUDS-S) on the subject's tendency of making stereotyped judgments on targets of different cultural/ethnic backgrounds. A total of 20 combinations of stimulus (positive/negative stereotyping word) and target (portrait of a male of different race) were presented, and the subject rated how well the stimulus and the target matched. We found a significant main effect of priming conditions on the subject's responses. We also found possible interactions between multicultural awareness subscales and the priming conditions.

T1  - The Effects of citizenship dissimilarity and national pride on attitudes toward immigrants: Investigating mediators and moderators of intergroup contact
AN  - 822521913; 201072857
AB  - Building on research from organizational sociology and the contact hypothesis, we incorporated community characteristics to examine how coworker citizenship dissimilarity influences employees' attitudes towards immigrants. We also proposed that the nature of this relationship would depend on national pride. Results from a national survey (n = 559) indicated living with more immigrants in one's neighborhood corresponded in heightened citizenship dissimilarity at the workplace. It, in turn, corresponded in employees holding more favorable views of immigrants. This effect was the most pronounced for people with high levels of national pride because of the presumably increased opportunities to dispel their previously held negative stereotypes about out-group members.

T1  - Workplace friendships between men: Gay men's perspectives and experiences
AN  - 914767043; 201200341
AB  - Challenging the heteronormative bias in the current literature on men's workplace friendships, this article uses qualitative interview data to explore how gay men understand and experience workplace friendships involving other gay and heterosexual men. Developing a Foucauldian approach, this study suggests that gay men's experiences and perspectives on workplace friendships can supplant negative stereotypes of men's friendships, by understanding them as relational sites for developing empowering organizational gay sexualities and genders. From a Foucauldian theoretical orientation, we can examine how gay men can(not) avoid falling into the trap of treating gender and sexuality in dichotomous and heterosexist terms, allowing them and their male work friends to explore new possibilities for workplace friendships that are more gender and sexually complex than is currently assumed. This article advocates future research on this matter as it could potentially enrich extant critical scholarship that has often bathed organizational masculinities in a negative light.

T1  - Effects of Online Christian Self-Disclosure on Impression Formation
AN  - 758123426; 201058687
AB  - This experiment examined the effects of online Christian disclosure. Respondents (N = 233) viewed a fictional social networking profile containing one of three levels of Christian disclosure frequency: none, nominal, and extensive. Respondents made few distinctions between nondisclosure and nominal disclosure. Most notably, respondent religiosity moderated impressions. Regardless of disclosure level, religious respondents rated profile owners as more likeable and less stereotypically negative than less religious respondents. The least religious respondents tended to rate the extensively disclosing Christian as least romantically desirable and with more negative stereotyping. The most religious respondents rated the extensively disclosing Christian as most likeable and as most romantically desirable. Christian identity tended to be assumed when not disclosed. Nominal disclosure may constitute a socially acceptable level of online Christian disclosure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Determinants of Interracial and Ethnic Trust
AN  - 758124344; 201056745
AB  - The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to discern which individual factors are associated with interracial/ethnic trust among a national probability sample of African Americans, Latinos, and non-Hispanic whites. Using national data from the 2000 Community Benchmark Survey, the multiple regression results indicate that, even after controlling for education and income, African Americans and Latinos reported significantly lower levels of interracial/ethnic trust than did non-Hispanic whites. Additionally, separate regression equations indicate that predictors associated with interracial/ethnic trust varied by racial and ethnic group. Implications and future research are discussed.

T1  - Through the Eyes of Friends: An Investigation of School Context and Cross-Racial Friendships in Racially Mixed Schools
AN  - 1928215848
AB  - Racially mixed schools are important because they affect the distribution of academic achievement, racial attitudes, subsequent social and economic outcomes of students, and patterns of residential integration. The purpose of this article is to capture and describe the role that adolescent friendships play in the educational and social experiences of students enrolled in racially mixed, or desegregated, schools. Based on qualitative analysis that includes semi-structured, in-depth interviews of female adolescents from middle school to high school, this study provides the practice- and policy-based implications of cross-racial friendships.

T1  - An Investigation of the Determinants of Stigmatization and Prejudice Toward People Living With HIV/AIDS
AN  - 1866473592
AB  - The components and determinants of HIV/AIDS stigma and prejudice were investigated in an online-questionnaire study. The results show that the components of the attitude toward people with HIV/AIDS consist of social distance, demands for political measures, negative stereotypes, and attribution of responsibility to people living with HIV/AIDS. Besides antigay attitudes and false beliefs about ways of infection, the HIV/AIDS attitude is connected to and depends on social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Structural equation modeling indicated that antigay attitudes and false beliefs function as mediator variables for SDO and RWA. Implications of the results are discussed.

T1  - 'Away with the fairies?' Disability within primary-age children's literature
AN  - 2059579383
AB  - This article outlines the findings of a new study that explores the portrayal of disability within a sample of the primary-age children's literature most readily available to UK schools. The kind of literature to which children are exposed is likely to influence their general perceptions of social life. How disability is handled by authors is therefore important from the standpoint of disability equality. Findings suggest that whilst there are some good examples of inclusive literature 'out there', discriminatory language and/or negative stereotypes about disability continue to be present in a range of more contemporary children's books. Clearly, more still needs to be done to ensure that schools and teachers are provided with information relating to the best examples of inclusion literature and efforts must continue to be made to inform authors, publishers and illustrators about how to approach the issue of disability.

T1  - The Russian Nation Imagined: The Peoples of Russia as Seen in Popular Imagery, 1860s-1890s
AN  - 743043305; 201026242
AB  - This essay traces changing representations of ethnic Russians & other peoples of the empire in popular prints (lubok), illustrated weeklies, & the art of the Itinerants (Peredvizhniki) from the 1860s through the 1890s. The author describes the role of the expanding print culture in an emergent Russian national identity. After 1861, cheerful images of Russian common people in popular prints & weekly magazines clashed with elite artists' & writers' stress on peasants' noble suffering. During the next three decades, however, images in all three lenses converged to form a positive view of ordinary ethnic Russians, particularly peasants. Similarly, negative stereotypes of non-Russian nationalities in illustrated magazines in 1860s gave way in the 1880s & 1890s to positive views of a multiethnic nation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Wolves in Sheep's Clothing: SDO Asymmetrically Predicts Perceived Ethnic Victimization Among White and Latino Students Across Three Years
AN  - 1928309153
AB  - Dominant groups have claimed to be the targets of discrimination on several historical occasions during violent intergroup conflict and genocide.The authors argue that perceptions of ethnic victimization among members of dominant groups express social dominance motives and thus may be recruited for the enforcement of group hierarchy. They examine the antecedents of perceived ethnic victimization among dominants, following 561 college students over 3 years from freshman year to graduation year. Using longitudinal, cross-lagged structural equation modeling, the authors show that social dominance orientation (SDO) positively predicts perceived ethnic victimization among Whites but not among Latinos, whereas victimization does not predict SDO over time. In contrast, ethnic identity and victimization reciprocally predicted each other longitudinally with equal strength among White and Latino students. SDO is not merely a reflection of contextualized social identity concerns but a psychological, relational motivation that undergirds intergroup attitudes across extended periods of time and interacts with the context of group dominance.

T1  - Racial and Athletic Identity of African American Football Players at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Predominantly White Institutions
AN  - 1928193114
AB  - This study examined racial and athletic identity among African American football players at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and predominantly White institutions (PWIs). Negotiating the dualism of racial and athletic identities can be problematic because both roles are subject to prejudice and discrimination, particularly for student-athletes in revenue-producing sports like football. Results indicated that seniors at both institution types reported significantly lower levels of Public Regard and that lower levels of Public Regard predicted higher levels of college adjustment. Senior football players reported a greater acknowledgment that society does not value African Americans, and this acknowledgment predicted greater college adjustment. No differences between institution types in racial Centrality emerged, but football players at PWIs reported higher levels of Athletic Identity. By garnering a better understanding of the psychosocial needs of African American football players, these results can inform college student personnel who can prioritize facilitating student-athlete academic and life skills with the same attention given to ensuring their athletic success.
